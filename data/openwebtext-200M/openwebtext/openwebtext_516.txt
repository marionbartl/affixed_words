Editor 's note : Joseph E. Stiglitz , professor at Columbia University , was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics in 2001 for his work on the economics of information and was on the climate change panel that shared the Nobel Peace Prize in 2008 .
Stiglitz , a supporter of Barack Obama , was a member and later chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers during the Clinton administration before joining the World Bank as chief economist and senior vice president .
He is the co-author with Linda Bilmes of the " Three Trillion Dollar War : The True Costs of the Iraq Conflict . "
Economist Joseph Stiglitz says federal regulators and executives helped create the Wall Street crisis .
NEW YORK ( CNN ) --
Many seem taken aback by the depth and severity of the current financial turmoil .
I was among several economists who saw it coming and warned about the risks .
There is ample blame to be shared ; but the purpose of parsing out blame is to figure out how to make a recurrence less likely .
President Bush famously said , a little while ago , that the problem is simple :
Too many houses were built .
Yes , but the answer is too simplistic :
Why did that happen ?
One can say the Fed failed twice , both as a regulator and in the conduct of monetary policy .
Its flood of liquidity ( money made available to borrow at low interest rates ) and lax regulations led to a housing bubble .
When the bubble broke , the excessively leveraged loans made on the basis of overvalued assets went sour .
For all the new - fangled financial instruments , this was just another one of those financial crises based on excess leverage , or borrowing , and a pyramid scheme .
The new " innovations " simply hid the extent of systemic leverage and made the risks less transparent ; it is these innovations that have made this collapse so much more dramatic than earlier financial crises .
But one needs to push further :
Why did the Fed fail ?
First , key regulators like Alan Greenspan did n't really believe in regulation ; when the excesses of the financial system were noted , they called for self - regulation -- an oxymoron .
Second , the macro-economy was in bad shape with the collapse of the tech bubble .
The tax cut of 2001 was not designed to stimulate the economy but to give a largesse to the wealthy -- the group that had been doing so well over the last quarter - century .
The coup d'grace was the Iraq War , which contributed to soaring oil prices .
Money that used to be spent on American goods now got diverted abroad .
The Fed took seriously its responsibility to keep the economy going .
It did this by replacing the tech bubble with a new bubble , a housing bubble .
Household savings plummeted to zero , to the lowest level since the Great Depression .
It managed to sustain the economy , but the way it did it was shortsighted : America was living on borrowed money and borrowed time .
Finally , at the center of blame must be the financial institutions themselves .
They -- and even more their executives -- had incentives that were not well aligned with the needs of our economy and our society .
They were amply rewarded , presumably for managing risk and allocating capital , which was supposed to improve the efficiency of the economy so much that it justified their generous compensation .
But they misallocated capital ; they mismanaged risk -- they created risk .
They did what their incentive structures were designed to do : focusing on short - term profits and encouraging excessive risk - taking .
This is not the first crisis in our financial system , not the first time that those who believe in free and unregulated markets have come running to the government for bail - outs .
There is a pattern here , one that suggests deep systemic problems -- and a variety of solutions :
1 . We need first to correct incentives for executives , reducing the scope for conflicts of interest and improving shareholder information about dilution in share value as a result of stock options .
We should mitigate the incentives for excessive risk - taking and the short - term focus that has so long prevailed , for instance , by requiring bonuses to be paid on the basis of , say , five - year returns , rather than annual returns .
2. Secondly , we need to create a financial product safety commission , to make sure that products bought and sold by banks , pension funds , etc. are safe for " human consumption . "
Consenting adults should be given great freedom to do whatever they want , but that does not mean they should gamble with other people 's money .
Some may worry that this may stifle innovation .
But that may be a good thing considering the kind of innovation we had -- attempting to subvert accounting and regulations .
What we need is more innovation addressing the needs of ordinary Americans , so they can stay in their homes when economic conditions change .
3 . We need to create a financial systems stability commission to take an overview of the entire financial system , recognizing the interrelations among the various parts , and to prevent the excessive systemic leveraging that we have just experienced .
4 . We need to impose other regulations to improve the safety and soundness of our financial system , such as " speed bumps " to limit borrowing .
Historically , rapid expansion of lending has been responsible for a large fraction of crises and this crisis is no exception .
5 . We need better consumer protection laws , including laws that prevent predatory lending .
6 . We need better competition laws .
The financial institutions have been able to prey on consumers through credit cards partly because of the absence of competition .
But even more importantly , we should not be in situations where a firm is " too big to fail . "
If it is that big , it should be broken up .
These reforms will not guarantee that we will not have another crisis .
The ingenuity of those in the financial markets is impressive .
Eventually , they will figure out how to circumvent whatever regulations are imposed .
But these reforms will make another crisis of this kind less likely , and , should it occur , make it less severe than it otherwise would be .

When Steve Jobs has a computer to sell these days , the world listens .
Back in 1976 , almost nobody did .
Jobs and Apple cofounder Steve Wozniak struggled to drum up interest in the Apple 1 , which they planned to sell as a bare circuit board that hobbyists would turn into a working computer by soldering in chips themselves .
Then Paul Terrell , who ran the Byte Shop in Mountain View , California -- one of the first computer stores -- placed an order for 50 Apple I systems , contingent on Apple 's supplying them as fully assembled boards .
" Steve was hungry for an order and knew he could get Woz and some of their buddies to put this order together in their garage .
And I knew where they lived -- so we did the deal and that got Apple Computer started , " Terrell remembers .
( He had to hire a local carpenter to provide the computers ' wooden cases . )
The 1 was only a modest success back in the day .
In today 's Apple - crazy world , though , it may be the most famous collectible PC .
One reportedly sold for $ 50,000 in 1999 , but you can probably get one for about half that - if you can find it at all .

San Francisco ( CA ) - Intel is currently preparing the launch of its final Core - architecture processor design , the six - core server CPU Dunnington .
Sources indicate that Intel was able to create product versions for all major power envelope levels in this segment , including a low - power 65 watt chip :
Six cores and 65 watts sounds like a winner to us .
If there were still any doubts that over the scalability of the Core architecture , Dunnington should put any of those to rest .
Like the quad - core Harpertown design , the multi-socket Dunnington will be targeting all three major server segments , covering the 130 watt , 95 watt and 65 watt power envelopes .
Considering that some Harpertown CPUs were rated at a 150 watt power envelope recently ( updated to a 120 watt rating last week ) and the fact that the 45 nm Dunnington will add two more cores , 9 MB L2 cache and a massive 16 MB L3 cache , the power achievement is impressive by any standard .
The Dunnington flagship , the X7460 model , will run at 2.66 GHz and will carry a thermal design power of 130 watt .
The 65 watt version , which could become a major hit in blade - server designs will be clocked at 1.83 GHz .
All Dunnington processors will be using FSB1066 .
Our colleagues over at Fudzilla previously AMD recently announced that it will also be offering six - core processor , code - named Istanbul , in the first half of 2009 .
The socket F processor will feature a dual - die design and according to AMD , debut a lower clock speeds than the company ’s quad - core processors .
A monolithic AMD six - core processor based on a new micro-architecture is expected to be available in 2010 .
Top 5 Ways To Improve Your Health With Water
— How To Improve Your Health With Water —
Drinking clean water is critical to your overall health and wellbeing .
Unfortunately , few realize the importance of filtering their water .
Water supplies vary around the country , but almost also city and municipal water supplies undergo some form of treatment .
This treatment process includes filtering , but eventually potentially harmful chemicals like chlorine and fluoride are added to the water .
High - priced modern filters can remove these chemicals , but unfortunately then water is left clean but needs invigoration to help bring it back to it ’s natural state .
If you have access to spring water from clean sources than I would highly advise drinking that .
Spring water contains natural minerals and oxygen that is lost during the filtration process .
Unfortunately , most people who live in urban environments are unable to access clean spring water and must drink from municipal sources .
Use these 5 techniques to improve your drinking water .
1.Buy a High Quality Reverse Osmosis Water Filter
In my opinion , buying a high - quality water filter is the best investment in your health you can make .
Even if your lucky enough to live in a municipality that does n’t add fluoride , you still have to deal with chlorine and potentially other chemicals in your water supply .
Filtering your water with cheap store bought filters will remove some chemicals like fluoride , but will not remove chemicals with a smaller particle size like fluoride , otherwise know as hydrofluoric acid .
When picking a water filter make sure it can remove fluoride , if so you can rest assured that it will be able remove most of the chemicals in your water .
2. Add Fresh Squeezed Lemon
One of my favorite ways invigorate water is through the use of lemons .
Lemons are a great way to get your much needed dose of vitamin C as well as improve the taste of your water .
I prefer to squeeze a 1 / 4 chunk of lemon into by 40 oz water canteen two times daily .
Lemon also has detoxing and other properties that can help clean out the body .
Ancient cultures for thousands of years have recognized the benefits of adding lemon juice to water and have done so for centuries .
3. Add Cayenne Pepper to Warm Water
I believe it ’s critical to your success in life to set up a morning routine .
This basically means that you do the same thing every morning when you wake up , especially on Monday through Friday .
I have practiced the same morning routine for years and I believe I can attribute it to a large part of my success .
Unlike most people , I avoid drinking coffee first thing because I do n’t want to become dependent on caffeine to wake up in the morning .
Instead , I warm up a glass of warm water over the stove .
Next , I squeeze 1/4 piece of lemon and approximately 1 teaspoon of Cayenne Pepper .
This incredible mixture has a multitude of health benefits and tastes amazing .
4. Add Fresh Organic Cucumbers
Adding fresh organic cucumbers to your water is a great way to change it up .
Cucumbers are a water heavy healthy choice that adds a great natural flavor .
My favorite thing to drink in the summer is cucumber water because it does wonders to quench my thirst .
First , I fill a pitcher 1 /2 full of ice .
Next , I add in a fully chopped cucumber into the pitcher .
Finally I fill it will clean or purified water and let it site for about 20 minutes .
Now , sit back and enjoy a tasty thirst quenching beverage .
5. Add Beyond Tangy Tangerine 2.0
One of my favorite things to add to my water is Beyond Tangy Tangerine 2.0 .
I love adding this delicious vitamin and mineral mix because it gives water a tangy taste while also providing me with my daily dose of vitamin and minerals .
You can add other vitamin and mineral powders to your drink and get the same results , but for me personally this one tastes the best .
That is my list of the top 5 ways to improve your health with water .
If you want to stay healthy you should be drinking a lot of water , but the problem is after a while it become difficult to drink .
That ’s when these invigoration techniques come in handy to mix it up and keep your taste buds happy .
Thanks for reading my blog !
My Favorite Gluten Free Teriyaki Sauce On The Market
As many of you know I have a gluten sensitivity otherwise known as Celiac Disease .
I try my best to avoid all gluten products which makes eating out nearly impossible .
Gluten is in breads and pasts so it is very hard to avoid it in your diet .
About 1 hour after I eat bread I start to feel my stomach ache and the bloating starts .
Sometimes it can even cause diarrhea , abdominal pain , and the urge to vomit .
A few year ago I read an article about gluten and realized this was what was causing my stomach aches and bloating and I most likely had a mild form of Celiac Disease .
I have tried taking probiotics and other supplements to help with the issue and those did not work .
For me the best course of action was just to avoid gluten all together .
The problem is there are very few good tasting products on the market .
At a trade show in Portland Oregon I ran into the Keli ’s Hawaiian booth and sampled their Gluten Free Teriyaki Sauce on chicken , and I was hooked at first taste .
Their teriyaki is a sweet ginger style teriyaki and not the bitter and salty varieties you find from countries in Asia .
This family recipe comes from the Hawaiian Islands and uses sugar as a base instead of salt .
Keli ’s tastes great on chicken , fish , poultry , rice , steak , beef , pizza , and just about everything else I have tried .
My favorite is to make up my meatball recipe and glaze them with it about 5 minutes before they are done cooking in the oven .
This is n’t the type of sauce your marinate with because it ’s thicker then your average teriyaki and works best as a dip or a glaze .
I purchased their 15 oz bottle off Amazon and it lasted for over a month .
That ’s a long time considering I use it 4 - 5 times a week for cooking for a family of four .
I cooked for my extended family last week and everyone loved it .
I call Keli ’s my secret weapon in the kitchen because it adds a lot of flavor to bland dishes .
If you have kids this is a must buy because kids go crazy over this stuff .
Check out this video to see a great gluten - free stir fry recipe you can make at home .
One of the best places to find information on cooking is on YouTube .
I learn more great advice there then I probably did at a 4 year college .
The world of Youtube is filled with niche experts on every single topic imaginable .
If you do a simple search for “ cooking recipes ” or “ cooking videos ” you will find thousands of chefs ready to let you into their home .
After using their teriyaki sauce for about 2 weeks I decided to check YouTube for some new ideas about Keli’s .
I found one video by a guy named the “ Fire Breathing Idiot ” who did a review on the Pele ’s Fire Spicy Teriyaki Sauce .
He sampled the product on camera and gave it rave reviews which inspired me to try their whole line .
From the information I can gather from their website they have a teriyaki , spicy teriyaki , huli - huli sauce , sweet and sour sauce , and a marinade .
The Keli ’s website also talks about releasing an Organic line soon which I am excited about because health is one of my main passions .
I have included this product in my blog because it is gluten - free but it would be better if it was Organic as well so when they come out with more products I will feature them here .
You do n’t need an exact recipe to cook up a delicious meal and all it takes is some creativity in the kitchen .
You can serve this on grilled chicken over rice , just apply the thick teriyaki sauce during the last few minutes of cooking .
Like I mentioned earlier , it ’s also delicious on steak as a post cooking dipping sauce .
I hope this blog gave you some gluten - free cooking ideas .
I know people suffering from Celiac Disease have a hard time finding things to eat so I thought I would do the community a favor and begin featuring quality gluten free products I find online .
Next week I will post a blog featuring more healthy food options .
All Natural Lemon Water Detox
The world is full of dangerous chemicals that enter our body everyday .
The air we breath , the water we drink , and even the food we eat could all potentially be contaminated .
Most people do n’t think about this but you can also absorb chemicals through your skin when you touch money and other things .
I have read studies about how BPA on receipt paper can enter the body through your finger tips when your handed a receipt at the grocery store .
This is all pretty scary and as a healthy person I know part of staying that way is to detox my body regularly .
There are a lot of products on the market that claim to do this such as herbal detox’s that come in pill form .
There are also products like Oxy Powder that releases oxygen bubbles into your digestive track and breaking up the gunk .
If you search you can also find colon cleansing products that clear the colon quickly and safely .
If you budget is tight I think the best way to detox is with the all natural lemon water detox .
Lemon has a cleansing effect on the body and can do wonders in helping aid digestion and ridding the body of some of the chemicals we ingest daily .
You can Google the term “ Lemon Water Detox ” to find the exact formula for detoxing with lemons .
Most of the detox ’s I have read about involve fasting as well so it might not be for everyone .
The other thing to think about is lemon juice can hurt the enamel on your teeth so make sure you consider that risk before drinking lemon water daily .
I hope that gave you some ideas on how to cleanse you body safely .

What is the Best Whey Protein Powder On The Market – Test And Review 2016
What is the best whey protein powder on the market ?
When you ask this question you will get a lot of different answers because everyone is looking for something different in a whey protein .
For me , I ’m interested in taking the healthiest products I can find .
Therefore , the ingredients are the # 1 most important factor for me .
I try to only consume products that are Certified USDA Organic because I know that they contain less chemicals and Non-GMO ingredients .
For some people health is not the most important aspect , instead building muscle is .
In fact , a lot of body builders use things like steroids to increase muscle at the expense of their health .
I do n’t espouse to this ideology and only take supplements with quality ingredients .
Research shows that if you eat a highly processed product your more likely to feel the negative effects of the ingredients then if you eat the same product in it ’s whole form .
This has to do with the natural fibers that chemicals will bind to and can effectively be passed through the body via the GI tract .
If you eat these same chemicals in a food from a processed form these fibers do not exist and the toxins could potentially be released into your blood stream .
This concept was introduced by Mike Adams over at Natural News and he called it the Metals Capturing Capacity .
Just Google that term if you want more information on his theory .
I have tried a lot of different proteins sold at big box stores .
I ’m not going to call out these stores specifically , but I ’m sure you can imagine the giant pallet of XXL Protein at rock bottom discount prices at your local big box .
Have you ever stopped and examined the ingredients in these products ?
Let me tell you they are not very good .
If I ca n’t pronounce most of the ingredients then I do n’t buy it .
The truth of the matter is you ca n’t buy high quality proteins in your average store .
You have to visit a Co-op , health food store , or something like a Whole Foods to get the type of proteins I take .
That ’s why I find it easiest to order these types of products online .
One day I was listening to the radio and I heard an ad for a product called One World Whey .
The radio ad said this was an unheated grass fed whey .
At the time I did n’t know there was an unheated supplements and it perked my interest .
I decided to go ahead and order the product and see what all the rage was about .
When I got my canister I was amazed by all the claims made about the product on the label .
You could tell the manufacturer Synergistic Nutrition had put a lot work to create a really good product .
The milk was made from grass fed cows which means less chemicals .
The developer also sources their milk from Amish cows which I feel are probably treated more humanely .
I try to only buy animal products that the animal welfare standards are high and the feed is grass or organic .
One World
Whey uses a manufacturing process that is totally unheated so more of the nutritional value is in tact .
The protein powder is also one of the best tasting I have ever had .
The whey comes in 3 delicious flavors chocolate , vanilla , and strawberry .
My favorite flavor is chocolate because I can mix it with water and it basically tastes like chocolate milk .
The strawberry tastes great but If you like to mix your powder with green powders or anything else this is n’t the best .
When you mix strawberry with water it tastes great , but I would n’t mix it with anything else .
The vanilla flavor is great for people who like to mix with green powders , Maca Powder , and MSM .
It ’s pretty sweet and tastes really good to most people .
Of all the protein powders on the market One World Whey is my favorite for all around taste and nutritional benefit .
Sure , there are other proteins on the market that are probably as good .
Most Organic protein’s you can purchase at high end grocers and health co-ops are probably as good .
The main difference being that One World does n’t heat their product so more of the nutritional qualities are most likely still in tact .
The downside to One World is the price point .
This product retails for $ 159 dollars for a 5 Lb canister .
If you go to big box stores you can get 5 Lb cans of discount whey ’s for as low as $ 49 dollars .
So the price difference is large but if your serious about only putting quality ingredients in your body then it ’s worth the money .
There are a few different places online to order One World Whey but my favorite is to order from small online stores .
I think it ’s best to support small companies on the web to keep as much competition out there as possible .
The final consideration when taking a whey protein is the dosage .
Studies show that supplementing with protein powder is good but do n’t take too much .
Some nutritional sources say that excess protein in the body can actually feed cancerous cells .
Now I ca n’t verify if this is true or not but I just wanted to put out a word of warning for body builder types , MMA fighters , Ju Jitsu , and other athletes that may be supplementing in large dosages .
In my opinion all vitamin and mineral supplementation should be done is small dosages because you can have too much of a good thing .
There are many great health blogs out there like Mercola where you can get more information on this .
You can also visit the Life Naturally Facebook page for reviews on health food , supplements , and daily healthy living tips .
In conclusion , If you have the money I think it ’s worth spending money on quality nutritional products .
I would rather take less supplements then more products with chemicals and other additives .
If your looking for a great tasting whey protein powder made from some great ingredients then you should buy One World Whey .
If your on a strict budget then I recommend buying organic protein powders from your neighborhood health food store and saving the extra money .

Paddle Boarding Your Way To Better Health
Stand Up Paddle Boarding For Better Health
Paddle boarding has been a very popular and growing sport over the last 10 years .
It has been around for a very long as Hawaiians have used it for many years to roam around and assist in training beginner surfers .
Needless to say , this is not a new idea or sport .
It has merely blown up in popularity due to famous surfers like Laird Hamilton and other big Hawaiian surfers .
Laird took a simple idea and started using it to paddle into monster waves .
This brought the whole sport to the attention of many others and the rest is history .
You can find paddle boarding or “ SUPing ” in just about any major town across the US .
SUP “ stand up paddleboard ” is a short acronym people tend to use when talking about the sport .
Having only started off as open water SUPing and SUP surfing , it has grown into much more .
Instead of just having solid boards , now they have created inflatable boards so you can haul them around easier and even pack a board up to remote lakes in the mountains easily .
They even have paddle board fishing , with specifically made paddle boards to accommodate the everyday fisherman .
These boards are typically inflatable as well and have tie down rings so you can strap down all your gear to the board .
Where we get excited is that they created SUP yoga boards .
Take your ambitious yoga instructor and put her on a paddle board and watch her go to work .
Yoga boards are just slightly wider and have more padding on the top , typically the length of the board so you can maneuver around .
Doing yoga on a paddle adds an added element of balance and would probably not be suggested for the beginner unless you feel like getting wet a lot .
This is also growing on a large rate and you can find SUP yoga instructors in almost every state .
SUP Fitness
If you stop and look at the health benefits that paddle boarding gives you , you will be amazed .
Let ’s take a look at some of the finer points :
Getting out into the open air .
So many times we find ourselves indoors way too much and not getting out into nature with fresh , clean air .
The importance of clean air is huge and almost ever health coach will tell you this .
SUPing gives us an ample amount out in the elements and having fun at the same time .

Great cardio .
SUPing offers a fantastic full body cardio workout .
Tell me this , would you rather be in a stuffy gym on a bike or treadmill , or would you rather be out in the sun and open air with friends paddling around on some beautiful open water ?
The level of cardio you get is up to you and what pace you set , but it really gets the system working when you put some effort into it .

Engaging all your muscles .
Paddle boarding is pretty much a full body workout .
When you paddle , you actually use your entire body in every stroke .
You also engage a lot of stabilizing muscles to help keep your balance as you paddle .

Minimal entry cost .
Now I do realize that some new paddle boards can run in excess of $ 1,500 or even more .
There are great starter board packages that start at $ 350 which is n’t so bad .
You can also just go out and rent a board for a day at $ 20 - 50 dollars .
There are a lot of options and compared to a lot of other sports , a low entry cost as you only have to buy a board once .

Great for all ages .
Anyone can paddle board .
I have seen 80 years old ladies out paddle boarding .
If balance is hard , just kneel on the board and paddle that way .
They also make special board sizes for young kids .

Great family time .
This is a great way to get out with the family for the day .
You are not only exercising , but having a great time with family or friends and creating lasting memories .
As you can see , there really are very few downsides to paddle boarding and a whole lot of upsides .
If you are curious on pricing , just search for paddle boards for sale online and you will find an array of boards as well as options to choose from .
Finding a trusted company is not hard and you are always safe going with anything through Amazon as they sell paddle boards as well .

Why Nature And Survival Matters
Why Nature And Being A Skilled Survivalist Matters To You And Your Health
What does it mean to be a survivalist in the 21st century ?
During the last decade , we have seen technology increase at a rapid pace .
During this period many people who lost their connection with the land , nature , and survivalism .
To many , they see technology as a crutch that allows them to be lazy and live an easy life .
Unfortunately , this has caused generations of people to loose many skills that their ancestors had known .
Skills like making fire , collecting water , and hunting have been lost by entire generations .
While these skills may seem unnecessary in the modern world , this just is n’t the case for two reasons .
During this short piece , I will break down why it is critical to keep this skills in your life .
First , history tells us that occasionally the world reverts into a pre-technological age where once again people will need to learn how to procure their own water and food .
You can look at many ancient societies like Rome or Atlantis as examples of advanced civilizations suddenly disappearing from the earth .
There ’s much debate about why this happens , but many believe it has to do with these populations actually killing themselves off with advanced technologies .
Other reasons could be that these advanced civilizations ran out of resources because too many people were grouped into one small area .
Nature seems to go in different intervals and cycles .
For many , they think this cycle is simply a 1 - year cycle or a 10 - year cycle .
but there ’s actually cycles of much larger time frames like 100 years or more .
It seems that the “ super cycles ” are the ones that catch humanity off guard because they are multi-generational and unless this knowledge was passed down they do n’t have access to it .
For example take flood planes , there ’s a lot of places that only flood every 100 years .
You could be living at a place for 99 years and never see a flood , and then suddenly everything is under water .
That ’s why it ’s critical to know how to take care of yourself regardless of if you will need it or not according to Skilled Survivor .
The other reason it ’s important to keep and know primitive skills has to do with a science called epigenetics .
In short , this is the science of genes and cells and the information that is stored within them .
The human body and mind is capable of amazing feet that the majority of people just ca n’t comprehend .
In fact , the brain and your DNA has information that is not easily accessed , especially if your living in modern society .
The reason is these more primal instincts are only accessed during certain times when your doing certain things .
For example , when you go into nature and build a fire you are able to access ancestral memories you otherwise would n’t be able too .
Another example of this would be when your out hunting .
During a hunt , your body reverts back to the memories of your ancestors and the amazing hunts they went on , the near - death experiences , and the successful kills .
These memories are then translated to you when your participating in the same experiences .
This is the primary reason it is so important to get out into nature and experience more than just city life .
The internet and technology is relatively new so you have no epigenetics associated with these activities , therefore you are only accessing the lower level of your being .
By getting primal and back to nature it opens up new levels of awareness and understanding in your brain you would n’t otherwise be able to access .
These new levels of brainpower are now unlocked and can be used for daily tasks like business or relationships .
If you are curious to learn more , l some of the et me give you a link to some of the best survival books online .
You can learn a lot from reading a book I hear . 🙂
How Meditation Changed My Life
How Meditation Changed My Life
By : Seth from Life Naturally
Many people look down on mediation primarily because they do n’t understand it fully .
Meditation is not something you do occasionally , instead this is something you do all the time .
In fact , I ’m meditating while I write this article .
Deep breathing is another technique that goes hand in hand with mediation .
As I grow older , I find myself constantly working on my breath and increasing the length and depth of my daily breathing .
The benefits of this are increased focus , reduced stress , and increased clarity .
In stressful situations these techniques become even more important because I ’m able to pull back from the current situation and think more clearly .
One of my coaches Bob Proctor explains that your body is always in a vibrational state .
The frequency and speed of your vibration is correlated with your mental state .
For example , if your thinking positive and happy your going to be in a fast vibration .
If your a negative person and thinking bad thoughts your vibration will slow down .
This subtle change can be felt throughout the whole body , and some experts claim that others can pick up on the frequency your vibrating without even saying a word to you .
Have you ever walked into a restaurant or bar and instantly had a bad feeling ?
Most likely you were feeling the vibrational state of the people within that room and they were vibrating at a low and negative frequency .
On the other hand , picture the times you walked into a bar and you felt a fun and exciting feeling ?
This was probably because you were resonating with everyone else in the bar having a great time .
As I grow old , I began to rely on this “ sixth sense ” that allows you to connect with people on another other .
In the universe we are naturally attracted to things that vibrate at a similar frequency as us .
That means that if we are a negative person it is highly likely we will surround ourselves with people who are very negative also .
If we are a positive person we will most likely attempt to surround ourselves with positive people .
The reason for this is because humans feel comfortable with people who are vibrating at the same frequency as them and tend to gravitate towards that .
The reality of the situation is you can actually control your state once you learn to become self aware .
In fact , I can feel when I begin to shift from a good mood into a bad one .
This self - awareness can help you in many ways including relationships and business .
If your looking to be more successful in life it ’s critical that you control your vibration as much as possible .
For me , I can also change my frequency through deep breathing and yoga .
Sometimes when I find myself getting angry or upset I will simply switch gears and begin thinking of things and people that make me happy .
This usually only takes a couple of seconds and I can quickly alter my entire mood .
Most people are totally unaware of the fact your mental state is totally under your control which I call being self - aware .
Once you have this realization the world begins to open up to you .
In fact , you will begin to notice when other people are not self - aware and are basically out of control .
The benefits of deep breathing and mediation are too numerous to list , but some are better health , increased energy , more mental clarity , and focus .
A body that ’s at ease and full of oxygen has a lower chance of developing disease than one that ’s stressed and lacks oxygen .
If you study the law of attraction then you know that what you think about you eventually will become , therefore you should always been thinking positive and uplift thoughts .
If your looking to increase your income you should be constantly thinking about how great it is to have so much money .
In fact , it ’s not enough to say you want the money , instead you must believe that you already have it .
This process of believing will actually trigger your sub-conscious mind to find a way to create the wealth for you .
Over the years I have seen the results of positive thinking , deep breathing , and mediation in my life and I can tell you for a fact that I will never be the same .
If you have never meditated I highly suggest your start incorporate simple deep breathing techniques slowly into your life .
The best part about deep breathing is it can be done at any time even when your doing other things .
Remember , it takes a while to train your body to comfortably do deep breathing .
If at first it feels uncomfortable , then it ’s best to just keep practicing until you can breath deeper and deeper .
Eventually , your bodies natural rhythm will change and you will begin deep breathing naturally everyday .

Google Has Moved Their Top Search Results to a 3 Pack Listing
If you have been hiding under a rock for the last few months you probably have n’t noticed that Google has moved their top search results for the Google Business Listings from a 7 - Pack to a 3 - Pack .
This is devastating news for for small business owners in competitive niches because it will be hard to get your business information to even show up now .
Let ’s say your in a competitive niche like restaurants in Portland Oregon .
If you look at the screenshot of the Google search I just did you will see that the Google 3 - pack pulls up in result 1 , 2 , and 3 .
Then after that in the # 4 position and below you begin to see webpages like Yelp and restaurant pages .
Most restaurant owners will have a hard time ranking in the top 3 restaurants in big cities .
I have also noticed that the restaurants with the top 3 citation listings usually are on the front page with their websites .
So basically what has happened is Google has created less diversity on the front page which is good for the best restaurants but bad for everyone else .
Maybe in the future I will give you guys some information on how to rank better in the Google Business Listings , or you can visit Portland SEO and they can help you get to the top 3 with proven techniques that not many seo ’s know about .
You would be amazed and the difference in results from someone who pretends to know search engine optimization , and someone who really knows .
Results speak for themselves , do n’t be afraid to ask some of their results or anyones for that matter .
It ’s a lot like getting workout advise from someone overweight and out of shape … does that make any sense ?
Then why would you get seo from someone who has never ranked a page to the # 1 spot or even 2 or 3 ?
Just some food for thought !
We will probably cover a little more in the future like website design and development or on page strategies .
Also , if we inspire you to want to know more , please drop us an email and let us know what else you would like to hear or know about when it comes to seo or health .
We look forward to seeing you next time , stay positive and healthy !
Our Favorite Portland SEO Company
I have been designing webpage for customers for about 20 years .
When you have been in the internet business as long as I have you pick up insights that others do n’t have .
The main one being how many companies come and go in and out of this industry .
The truth is there ’s a steep learning curve to be good at search marketing and most people just do n’t have the patience to grind it out .
The other wild card that makes the internet different then professional services is the game is always changing .
When the World Wide Web was first introduced it was easy to game the system .
I remember the days when AltaVista was one of the biggest search engines .
This was in 1995 in the pre Google early years of the internet .
Then Google came to town and since then has taken the internet by storm with some experts estimating an enormous 60 - 70 % market share on all organic search .
Eventually AltaVista began to fall out of favor and was purchased by Yahoo and was finally shut down in 2013 because of poor performance .
Another big earlier pioneer in the search world was AOL .
AOL , like AltaVista suffered a similar fate and was eventually absorbed by larger companies .
During the 200o internet bubble there were many companies with billion dollar market shares that were bankrupt over night .
When your in a new field that heavily relies on technology the world can change in an instant .
In the late 1990 ’s and early 2000 ’s I would not have recommended SEO services for my clients .
The internet just was n’t that competitive those days and anyone who could design an attractive and functional website could get visitors .
Now that the internet is getting older more companies have moved in to slice out their piece of the pie .
Unfortunately for the average small business owner this is bad news .
The internet has reached a point where the average person can’t really compete with the big companies and their massive search engine marketing budgets .
That ’s why I recommend that all small firms get search engine optimization services from a professional company .
The reason I do n’t offer this service is because it takes a different skill set design and build a website then it does to optimize a website correctly .
Google is constantly updating their search algorithm with new releases like Panda , Penguin , and Omaha and it takes a full time focus just to keep up with the changes .
In the future I can see it being even more difficult for small business to compete with the giant mega corporations out there .
When a client asks me who I recommend for search engine optimization I refer them to a Portland SEO Company called Oregon Web Solutions .
I have always had a good experience with them and most importantly their techniques work .
Over the years I have seen them take clients with no web presence at all and help them totally dominate the front page of Google .
Sure , it helps that I build great aesthetically pleasing and functional websites , but it ’s the behind the scenes optimization work that is really the “ secret sauce ” to ranking well .
I also appreciate the way they break their services down into multiple affordable parts so clients can see results before they commit to the whole package .
The first seo service they offer is helping clients fill out their Google Business Listing .
This may seem simple but Google is constantly changing the business portion of Google + and it can be confusing to most .
Once Oregon Web Solutions sets up your page and verifies your listing you can now be found on the maps when people search for services in your geographic region .
Every year more people search from their mobile device and a Harvard study reports that the mobile devices will just grow in popularity .
This tactic alone can give small companies great exposure especially professional services in a small geographic region .
The great news is this service can cost as little as $ 149 dollars from OWS which is well worth the return on investment your receiving .
The next step to improving your search optimization is to get as many business citations as possible .
Business citations are the key factor in determining where you rank in the Google map pins or 7 pack .
This is essentially an arms race and the person with the most accurate citations will usually rank # 1 in the map pins .
Since more people now search on mobile devices the map pins are playing a larger rule in search and are now appearing in the top spot most of the time .
If you business is listed in the top map pin customers are able to call you with 1 to 2 clicks of their smart phone .
The more convenient you make it for your customers the better .
This SEO Service can cost between $ 1,000 - $ 3,000 dollars depending on how difficult the competition is in your area .
For most small to medium sized cities it should be very simple to rank in the top 3 positions .
The final search service they offer is the full optimization of your website .
This process involves keyword research , keyword optimization , backlinking , social marketing , and diverse anchor text .
Oregon Web Solutions has this process down to a science and in about 3 - 6 months can usually get your website ranked # 1 in Google for uncompetitive terms .
For super competitive keywords in larger cities it can be more difficult and take longer .
I have seen them rank for keyword terms in medium sized cities no problem with there SEO process .
The downside is this part of their service can cost anywhere from $ 3,000 - $ 6,000 additional dollars .
The upside is if you commit to this part of the search optimization package you can almost ensure that your website will dominate your competition .
There just is n’t very many small to medium size firms who will pay the money or invest the time to do this type of optimization .
That ’s my breakdown and analysis of my favorite search engine marketing company Oregon Web Solutions , I hope my advice will help you rank your website better .

The Secret Law Of Attraction And Your Health
What is the Secret Law of Attraction ?
Many claim to understand this law but when they talk about it they tend to exercise their ignorance .
For thousands of years great leaders and successful business people have harnessed the power of manifesting to bring them great wealth and success .
One must ask , how does one “ attract ” these things into your life ?
The key is to work with the natural flow of the universe instead of agains’t it .
Everything in nature has a certain rhythm that you must work in conjunction with if you want to be successful .
This natural flow has always been there and always will be .
Those who try to work agains’t this flow could possibly find temporary success , but in the end they will fail .
History is full of many examples of evil people attempting to operate within a negative frequency range .
There is some truth to the fact that one can harness negative energy for their own evil deeds , but the problem is eventually it destroys them .
You get what you give .
There ’s also some truth to the fact that negative energy can give you a temporary shortcut to success , but once again this is only temporary .
That ’s why you see evil people rise to greatness then they are suddenly ruined .
The key to great wealth or any success in life is to go with the natural flow of earth .
Emotions like fear , greed , worry , and doubt are all tools of the devil .
These negative vibrations will only hurt you and never help and should be avoided like the plague .
The truth is that unlimited abundance is available to all inhabitants on earth , and a scarcity mentality is never good .
Do n’t mistake this for meaning competition is no good , because that ’s not the case .
Competition is good and usually brings lower prices for all , but one must be careful to keep a positive vibration .
When I first heard of the LOA I was n’t in tune with my bodies natural frequencies .
Now that I ’m aware that I have a natural vibration I can see myself move from state to state .
If i’m in a bad mood I have a different frequency then when I ’m in a good mood .
Likewise , when I ’m around people who are in a poor state of mind then they negativity can rub off on those around them .
I ’m sure you ’ve experienced this and just not realized it .
Here is the scenario , you walk into a room and the energy just does n’t feel right .
What your feeling is the combined frequency of everyone who ’s in the room .
The other key to the law is you ca n’t help but be influenced by other people ’s energy , so it ’s important to choose who you surround yourself with very carefully .
In fact , I only hang out with people who are in a positive state of mind .
Taken a step further ,
If I walk into a room that has negative energy I simply leave .
I ’m sure you ’ve been there , you walk into a restaurant or bar on a night out drinking with friends and the energy feels terrible .
Maybe the bar or restaurant is filled with a bunch of depressed people .
If you are in tune to this you can instantly feel it .
In that case I will turn around and leave .
Why would I want these people ’s negativity rubbing off on me ?
I ’m sure you ’ve heard the phrase , misery loves company .
This classic saying is just simply restating the law of attraction .
People who are really negative prefer to hang out with other angry , fearful , or upset people .
If your really angry you do n’t want to hang out with happy people because it makes you feel bad about yourself and vise versa .
So what does the law of attraction have to do with my health you may be thinking ?
Studies show that a negative energy level can actually be harmful to your health .
Negative vibration puts strain and stress and all working parts of the body .
Stress ( negative vibration ) literally breaks down your bodies immune system and ability to function .
Your body can handle negative energy from time to time , but it functions best is a positive vibration .
Think of it this way , positive means to grow and flourish , negative mean to decay and rot .
Thats the best way I can put it .
You can eat health and exercise perfectly all you want , but if you are in a negative vibration , then all the rest is doing little to no good .
This is also why you can be in a positive vibration and eat a little worse .
There is a balance , much like a weight scale .
The only difference is that too much positive is n’t bad .
Too much negative could kill you , literally .
There are some great videos on the law here .
Eating the right foods can help you remain in a positive vibration which in turn helps you attract what you want in your life .
Ever hear the saying , you are what you eat ?
Food is energy , so if you eat positively charged food than it will assist you to stay in a positive vibration and healthy state .
Negatively charged foods will make it harder to stay in a positive state .
It can be done , but takes more effort .
Do you want it to be easier or harder ?
Each little thing we do in life stacks on the other .
Stack the positive and attract more of it .
Stack the negative and attract more of that .
Your body follows your orders and makes no qualms about which you choose .
This is what the law is all about .
Make a promise to yourself today to avoid fear , worry , and doubt and instead focus on a positive energetic state and you will be more successful .
So if you take anything away from this blog then remember that were all putting off a vibration or energy .
Start recognizing your own energy and feel how it changes throughout the day .
The more you can maintain a positive state and energy the better you life will be .

Secret Success Is In A Daily Routine
The Secret of your success is found in your daily routine – John C Maxwell
I have always looked up to John Maxwell for his leadership teaching and principles .
As an aspiring leader myself i’m always looking to be on the cutting edge when it comes to growing as a person .
Over the years I have began researching how to become a healthier person and I have incorporated John ’s leadership principles into the health regimen .
The more I mature the more I realize the secret to success in anything is found in your daily routine .
How you spend your day for a single day will have little impact on your life either positive or negative .
The way to make change in any field is to set yourself up with a daily routine .
I have found that it ’s even more important to do this when it comes to improving your health .
I like to start my daily health regimin first thing in the morning .
This will usually get my day started off right and it becomes easier to carry these positive and health habits into the evening .
The first thing I do every morning is fill my steel 40 oz water bottle full of water at least 1 /2 of a squeezed lemon .
Drinking water first thing can help jump start your organs after 8 + hours of fasting .
Lemon water is alkiline and drinking it in the morning can help make your feel better and quick start your energy levels .
With my 40 oz of water I usually take a digestive enzyme .
I do this first thing because I want to give the digest enzyme a little while to break down before I eat my breakfast .
I try not to eat breakfast right when I wake up because I believe you should fast as long as possible .
For example , if I eat dinner at 6 or 7 pm then I try not to eat breakfast until 9 pm or later .
If I follow this time frame then that gives my body nearly 15 hours of fasting time per day .
At around 9 am when I ’m done with my morning exercise I drink a glass of whey protein .
Most of the studies show that whey protein has the best effect if taken within 30 minutes of exercising either before or after .
After the whey protein settles in my system then I am ready to eat some breakfast .
My breakfasts usually consist of an organic veggie omelet or a fruit and veggie smoothie depending on how hungry I am .
I have found if I go light for breakfast then I usually end up eating a bigger lunch so it ’s a wash in the end .
I try to listen to my body and eat when I ’m hungry .
That ’s a basic rundown on how I start my day and I believe it ’s been a huge reason for my success .
Eating healthy and organic seems to keep my energy levels high and my mind clear .
Remember , my morning routine is not for everyone and you should develop your own routine that gives you the greatest chance for success .

Breast Implants – Are They Safe ?
There are two types of breast implants available in to women in the United States , saline and silicone .
There are pros and cons to each implant and patients should do research to figure out which one is best for you .
A lot of people , especially men say they prefer the feeling of silicone breast implants over saline .
Another point to consider is the safety of each type of implant .
From the studies and research I have done it appears that if saline implants our more obvious when they rupture then silicone making them somewhat safer in that respect .
The bottom line is it really comes down to what the personal preference is from the person getting the surgery .
There are also other surgeries a women might opt to do like breast reduction or a breast lift .
It ’s important to note , that any type of surgery comes with some degree of risk to the person going under the knife .
I feel that if the perceived problem does n’t effect the women in a really negative way then it ’s probably to just live with the issue .
If the problem does cause a damaging effect then fixing the issue might be worth the risk of surgery .
If your going to get breast implants then I prefer when women go for a moderate size that looks natural .
We have all seen the women with petite bodies who go from an A cup to a D cup .
I think this throws their whole body out of proportion and prefer the natural look , just enhanced .
Breast augmentation surgery is usually done after a women has gone through child birth .
After a women gives birth and has breast fed the child for 6 months to 2 years then her breasts can often “ deflate ” and loose their fullness .
I personally feel women look great like this but I know some feel sub-conscious about the look .
The price for breast augmentation surgery can run anywhere from $ 2,000 to $ 10,000 or more with the average price being around $ 3,000 dollars .
When looking for a doctor make sure it ’s someone who is a American Board Certified Cosmetic Surgeon .
There are a lot of cheaper options for plastic surgery out there like going to foreign countries but do n’t even consider it .
The health care system in America is still the best in the world and by choosing a certified surgeon your taking a lot of risk out of the operation .
Breast augmentation surgery is the most popular cosmetic surgery in the United States by far .
Women from around the world come to the United States to have this procedure done by some of the best doctors on the planet .
Even with it ’s popularity only about 5 % of the women in America have had this procedure done , and that figure includes implants , reductions , and breast lifts .
If you want more information on cosmetic surgery then visit breast augmentation Portland Oregon to learn more about the pros and cons of going under the knife .
As I mentioned earlier all surgeries come with some degree of risk and you really have to decide for yourself if your willing to take the chance to improve something that ’s cosmetic in nature .
Sure there might be some cases such as breast reductions where a women physically needs to procedure because of back pain or other issues .
In those cases the risk threshold would probably be higher then someone who wants a little bit fuller breasts .
One of the big things I strongly advise women to avoid is going for the Pamela Anderson style “ fake ” look where the breasts sit unnaturally on the body .
Sure , most women want full breasts that do n’t “ sag ” but when they appear to float in a way that does n’t look natural I think you have gone too far .
If you prefer social media you can also check out breast augmentation Portland to read some Facebook posts .
Who does n’t like women with beautiful breasts ?
I know I do and I think ladies should know that the natural look is still beautiful .
I believe all ladies are unique and as long as you think you look sexy you probably are .
In conclusion , the most important point to remember is find a licensed cosmetic surgeon and read his reviews before you move forward to reduce your risk .

Falling demand and a significant decrease in the price of crude oil has helped to push the price of a gallon of regular gasoline to $ 3.81 – its lowest level in nearly two months .
Just one month ago , the price of gas was just sort of its record high , selling at an average price of $ 4.10 per gallon .
While the recent month - long decrease in the price of gas is certainly a very welcome sight , it should be noted that today ’s current price is still 38 % above the $ 2.77 we were paying at this point last year .
Currently , there are nine states reporting an average gas price above $ 4 per gallon , with Hawaii having the highest average price at $ 4.58 per gallon .
Missouri is reporting the lowest state - wide average price , coming in at $ 3.52 .
Oklahoma has the second lowest price at $ 3.56 per gallon .
Remember the first time the price of gasoline was around $ 3.75 a gallon ?
Many of us thought we were going to have to drastically cut back our driving , prepare ourselves for $ 5 or higher gas , and face some pretty dire financial predicaments .
It ’s a wonder there was n’t mass rioting in the streets .
Fast forward just six weeks and all of a sudden , $ 3.81 gas is n’t so bad .
In fact , it feels like an absolute relief from the $ 4.12 we were paying just a three weeks ago .
It ’s amazing how good a simple seven percent drop in the price of a modern - day necessity can feel !
However , if Americans continue to drive less , purchase vehicles with better fuel economy and oil prices continue to fall – due to a global economic slow down and continued strengthening of the dollar ( hopefully ) – this recent price drop might turn into something a little more significant .
Unfortunately , I ’m not holding my breath and I believe that gas prices wo n’t fall but 10 % from current levels before the end of the year .
The presidency of George W. Bush has elevated anti-Americanism to a global sport more popular in some quarters than World Cup Football .
The end of the Cold War , the emergence , at least temporarily , of the United States as the world 's ' hyper - power ' , and Bush 's unfortunate first - term tendency to act unilaterally and then boast about it have inspired many to sound off about how much they hate America .
In 2004 Griffith University political scientist Brendon O'Connor noted that , because ' anti-Americanism ' lacks a precise definition , what differentiates anti-Americanism from legitimate criticism of the United States 'is often confused or , in fact , deliberately distorted ' .
Interestingly , strongly anti-American comment frequently comes from individuals who follow American fashions , enjoy American music and benefit directly from American technology .
People who pour contempt on Americans and their religious practices nevertheless admire Martin Luther King Jr. , an American Baptist minister .
Despite the obvious contradictions , individuals skilled in the abusive art of condemning an entire nation of 300 million people , clearly vent huge amounts of personal anger when it comes to most things related to the United States .
Delivering a lecture on anti-Americanism at the University of Dundee in 2003 , Professor Godfrey Hodgson spoke three home truths when he noted , firstly , that much of what passes for anti-Americanism is just plain bad manners : '... anti-Americanism , in the sense of a prejudice , is shameful and unpleasant , just as is prejudice against any national or ethnic group ' .
Secondly , ' some of what appears to be anti-American sentiment in the world today is really a hostility to the ideology , policies , conduct and discourse of the present Bush Administration .
And of course that hostility is shared by tens of millions of Americans . '
Thirdly , even today , anti-Americanism as it exists in Australia , Europe and elsewhere often ' coexists with an extraordinarily strong pro-American sentiment ' .
How many people showed up in Berlin to cheer on Barack Obama ?
In Australia , one thing that differentiates legitimate criticism of the United States from a general dummy - spit is the willingness to shoulder some measure of personal responsibility .
Eighteen years ago I wrote an article titled ' On the Virtues of " Anti-Americanism " ' for an Australian magazine .
The theme of the article was simply that , in an asymmetrical relationship such as middle - power Australia enjoys with superpower America , it is wise for the junior partner not to be deluded to the point of dependence by relying on a so - called ' special relationship ' .
This was not to suggest that our ANZUS relationship with the US is a pact with the devil .
But it was to argue that former Prime Ministers were wrong when they proclaimed that Australians and Americans ' think the same , act the same , and want the same things ' .
Today Australia supposedly has a defence policy that stresses ' self - reliance within an alliance context ' .
I am not the only one to ask if the ' self - reliance ' bit in that policy really means anything .
Are we , in fact , capable of creating a more independently minded Australian foreign policy - one in which we identify and act upon our own national interests without assuming , as we do so often , that we share everything in common with the United States ?
And are we willing to individually and collectively bear the financial responsibility and personal commitment necessary to provide effectively for our own defence ?
Rather than grapple with serious questions like that , some find it far easier to fall back on common slurs and amuse themselves with cheap jibes about the ' Septics ' .
We might more profitably go to work on substantive suggestions for a more independent and independently minded Australian foreign and defence policy .
On occasions when I have thrown out that challenge , the most common response from real die - hard America haters , is to blame our politicians and / or suggest that US imperialism is so comprehensive , clever and lethal that we are all victims of it .
How convenient !
A ready excuse to dismiss any positive and constructive independent action on our own behalf .
Apparently , there is nothing left for us to do but moan and bitterly blame others .
In his 2004 article O'Connor noted ,
" Professed hatred [ of the US ] generally relies on a series of stereotypes or caricatures that tells one more about the individual or group passing judgement than it does about America .
None of this is to suggest that America is always right , honourable or just , but rather I would suggest that the slide into anti-Americanism distinguishes no one .
Prejudiced rhetoric weakens justifiable critiques of America 's many faults .
At the same time , it hinders the ability to appreciate the promise that America still holds for itself and the world . "
A few years ago , while teaching a university course in international politics , I asked a member of the Australian Defence Forces to deliver a guest lecture on the work of the ADF in peace - keeping operations around the world .
When he completed an excellent lecture , this young officer was subjected to a barrage of hostile questions from my students about Australia 's defence ties with the United States and the ' militarisation ' of Australian foreign policy .
He handled all the questions with such cool detachment that , as I walked him to his car , I asked if he was n't disturbed by some of the student attitudes he had just observed .
He smiled and said ,
" These young Australians have grown up as beneficiaries of an American shield that has allowed them as individuals to ignore any personal responsibility for the defence of Australia and we , as a nation , to spend much less on defence than if we did not rely so heavily on America for our ultimate security .
But I am confident that if tomorrow we awoke to find an invading force just off our shores , these young people would awake to reality and learn very quickly that all of us , individually , have a stake in the defence of Australia . "
Let 's hope he was right .
This message comes from an anonymous source believed to be within the US intelligence community .
Some of the statements cannot be verified for authenticity , but the general themes and references speak for themselves .
I 've researched everything that is possible to research and it all stands up .
I have no reason to believe any of this is untrue .
Read it and decide for yourself .
-ed Psychological Operations is my specialty .
PsyOps. Everything I 've done has been highly classified , all black programs and black operations .
Some people I know thought I worked for the CIA , but it 's much more complicated than that .
I 've worked with people in the CIA , DIA , NSC , NSA , SAIC , Army Intel and many more lesser known agencies within the intelligence apparatus .
Before focusing on PsyOps I started out running covert combat missions , special operations .
I was good at what I did and rose through the ranks fast .
When the " War on Terror " started I was paid a lot of money to consult with private military contractors .
When private paramilitary units needed to get the jobs done that paid the most money they would come to me with checkbooks filled with US taxpayer dough .
I 've seen the worst things imaginable , hell on earth .
Had friends die in my arms .
Seen piles of rotten corpses .
Seen men , women and children tortured .
I 've seen the eyes of terrified and confused children being sold into a vicious life of slavery and an early death .
I could get a lot more graphic , but you get the idea .
That was my life , and all along I was told that I was fighting for freedom and working for the " good guys . "
What a ridiculous comment that is !
In the black world , that is , in the covert world , there are n't any " good guys " - just varying degrees of evil .
As Brigadier General Butler famously stated , " War is a racket . "
It does n't have anything to do with freedom and democracy .
It is not good fighting evil .
There 's just a bunch of old greedy gangsta motherfuckers making obscene amounts of cash and breeding hatred , violence , terrorists and sex slaves .
The truth is , there is no oversight !
Meaning , you can get away with anything , nothing is illegal because no one knows about it , or the few who do are either in on it or have a vested interest in keeping quiet .
Whether you 're runnin ' guns , weapons , drugs , gold , diamonds , women , children , it just does n't matter .
As long as the old guard gets their resources , it 's all good .
And in the end , it 's all about power .
The people who really run this planet know that natural resources ( oil , water , coltan , cobalt , etc. ) are the key .
The " War on Terror " is just a front for a geo- strategic resource grab on a massive scale .
Even the wars in Northern Africa are all about exploitation of resources .
Once the good ole CIA boys at Bechtel did their NASA satellite studies of the Democratic Republic of Congo's ( DRC ) mineral resources and discovered that it was the " richest patch of earth on the planet , " all hell broke loose !
They figured out that the DRC has 80 % of the world 's coltan , among many other vital resources .
Without coltan , you can't have any technology that requires a computer chip : computers , cell phones , satellites and weapon systems , of course .
So Bechtel , the CitiBank boys , the World Bank , IMF and various covert elements have been supplying brutal regime after brutal regime in the region .
Well over four million and counting have died there .
Same thing with oil in the Middle East .
Do you think they really give a shit about Iraqi freedom ?
We worked hard to make you believe that , but c'mon , they do n't give a shit about the Iraqi people .
They 've killed about a MILLION of them !
And that 's NOT an exaggeration !
They sure as hell give a shit about Iraqi oil though .
They also care about Saudi oil , and have a nice deal with a dictatorship that brutally oppresses their people .
If freedom and democracy are the issue , how about freeing the Saudi people ?
Why do you think 15 of the 9/11 terrorists came from Saudi Arabia ?
We support a regime that oppresses those people .
We support them because they cooperate on the oil front .
So , why strike back at them ?
Let 's hit Iraq .
They do n't give us any oil - let 's get 'em !
If you look at the history of covert special operations , it 's all about securing a piece of land that has some valuable resource .
Once the resource is identified , special ops figures out the most efficient way to suppress or extinguish the population that is unfortunate enough to live near it .
Then the big companies come in , from the United Fruit Company to the Bechtels and Halliburtons of the world .
That is the way it has been and still is , from John D. Rockefeller and Allen Dulles right through Kissinger , Bush Sr. and Cheney .
Millions of innocent civilians have been slaughtered .
Let me repeat that : Millions of innocent civilians have been slaughtered .
And I 'm not kidding you .
These are evil motherfuckers and they are no friends of ours .
These things do n't have anything to do with protecting the US people or standing up for freedom and democracy .
They do n't give a shit about the average American .
In this age of the global economy , the concept of nation state is obsolete .
If only proud Americans could understand that .
Pride in the American way is just another propaganda device for PsyOps agents - people like me - to use to manipulate you and make you think that black is white and white is black .
If you were to ask me who is a bigger threat to the people of the US , Cheney or bin Laden , or who has done more damage to the US , I would say Cheney without hesitation .
Cheney , along with Bush Sr. and Kissinger , has been running the covert world for about 40 years now .
A little side note for you : I firmly believe Robert Gates , the current Secretary of Defense and Bush Sr.'s right - hand man in the covert world , used computer cryptography and software security assets to get Bush Jr. elected both times .
I do not have direct knowledge of the operation , but research " Robert Gates , " " Bill Owens , " " electronic voting security , " " HAVA , " " VoteHere " and " Scientific Applications International Corp . "
[ We will post more on this in the near future . ]
The operation went so well that Gates was going to be made the first ever Director of National Intelligence .
He turned down the job , but then took the Secretary of Defense position when Rumsfeld was removed from his public position .
I do n't think there will ever be solid evidence linking directly to members of the administration ; it 's all a tangled web of plausible deniability .
But I do think it will eventually be proven that the elections were manipulated to deliver Bush the victory .
Many people in the covert world take this for granted , as common sense .
Please do n't confuse this as partisan propaganda .
I do n't give a shit about the Democrat or Republican PsyOps mind - fuck dynamic .
They 're just labels to divide a potentially powerful united US public .
It 's hard to get the average American to understand these things .
Most everyone in this country has been mind - fucked since birth .
For a very blatant example , you can look at the advertising industry and the way they have increased intensely their focus on the youth .
It 's all about breeding impulsive emotionally driven consumers through repetition - over and over again - buy , buy , buy .
You hear something enough and you internalize the message .
It becomes something like the air you breathe , like gravity .
It 's there , omnipresent , but you do n't realize it or consciously think about it .
It becomes the spring from which your thoughts leap forth .
What it all boils down to is the exposure rate .
You take a simple message and you repeat it over and over , such as mentioning Saddam and 9/11 .
You do n't have to say Saddam was involved in 9/11 , because that is not true .
You just have to mention Saddam and 9/11 in the same simple repetitive message thousands of times and people will support an attack on a country that did n't have anything to do with 9/11 because they 've been psychologically conditioned to link the two .
It 's psychological operations on a grand scale , mass psychology .
The scientific art of manipulating public opinion is 100 years old now .
PsyOps have evolved to the point , thanks to the all pervasive mass media , where we can make you believe , or at least passively accept , whatever we want you to .
I secretly worked with the world 's most powerful media companies to get you to believe what " they " want you to believe .
The media is the most efficient weapon of tyranny and oppression ever created .
No need to physically control populations anymore when you can do it mentally - program it in , internalize the rules .
To give a little more background on publicly revealed psychological operations , in 1977 , after the Congressional Church Committee investigated CIA manipulation of the news media , and right after George Bush Sr. left his post as the Director of the CIA , famed Watergate reporter Carl Bernstein searched a little deeper into what was known as Operation Mockingbird .
He revealed that over 400 US journalists were actually carrying out clandestine CIA PsyOps services .
Bernstein identified operations involving almost every major US news outlet , most notably The New York Times , CBS and Time magazine .
The CIA responded to all of this with a " limited hangout . "
A " limited hangout " is CIA speak for when classified information gets out and you have to make it seem as if you are " coming clean " with all the information on the operation , but in reality you are really just admitting part of the operation so you can cover up other deeper parts and continue the program .
This worked very effectively for them , as the US public quickly moved on and this operation has largely been forgotten .
Currently , I would estimate , with cable news and the Internet now , that there are well over a thousand covert operatives spread throughout the news media .
They have a firm grip on television , newspapers , wire services , radio and magazines .
However , with the Internet - that 's their weak spot - it's too decentralized and difficult to control .
The Pentagon 's Information Operations Roadmap now describes the Internet as an enemy " weapons system . "
The Pentagon does n't hide the fact that they want total control over information , or as they call it " information dominance . "
They very plainly state that they seek to " control land , sea , space and information . "
This is what they refer to as " full spectrum dominance . "
If you do n't think they see this as a top priority , look at Iraq .
The plan to " embed " journalists with the military in Iraq was a strategic operation that considered " journalism as part of psychological operations . "
The journalists that were n't " embedded " were considered " enemy combatants . "
More journalists have been killed in Iraq than in any other war , and it is the US doing a large portion of the killing .
Before I go too far here , the point I want to make to the US public , the bottom line is that the most power crazed and greed addicted people are above the law and get away with everything .
In the covert world rules do not apply .
Democracy is a fairy tale .
Nothing is what it seems , reality is n't real .
Through the looking glass Alice goes .
I 've fought against it and got nowhere .
I 've informed people that I naively thought could do something , but nothing could be done .
I took all the blood money I 've made and donated it to humanitarian causes .
Will it make a difference ?
No .
Not in the grand scheme of things , but in the short run it may save a few people maybe .
And that 's all I can hope for at this point .
I 've become so cynical !
I live with guilt and cynicism weighing on my every move , my every thought .
When you 've seen the things I have seen , been involved with the things I 've been involved with , when you 've spent the majority of your life living like I have , what do you do when you decide to give it up and get out ?
Can you ever get out ?
I was able to get out , thus far , when no one I knew thought I could get out .
But once you lived in the covert world , " normal " civilian life feels like a prison sentence .
Then again , the covert world was a prison sentence .
I 've been strongly advised to keep a very low profile and forget about things for a while .
But I find it hard to just fade into the night when we are reaching an event horizon , a breaking point .
Despite my cynicism , there is a part of me that knows I have to keep fighting .
The stakes are just too high , higher then they 've ever been .
The human species is in serious trouble , facing a set of crises unlike anything we 've ever faced before .
Unless these covert forces are exposed , and ultimately eliminated , I do n't see how we can even begin to make the bold actions that we need to start making now - and I mean right fucking now !
These covert forces are a root cause and driver , a cancer spreading through the system and planet .
As far as I can tell , you can't change the system from within the intelligence community itself .
This includes the Senate Intel Committee .
If the urgently needed changes are ever to happen , it has to come from the US public .
Now I know first hand how the American public has been conditioned to be apathetic and not get involved in politics and has been fed a steady diet of misinformation .
But propaganda only works to the point where the population being propagandized is not feeling the direct impact and negative consequences on a personal level in their daily lives .
That 's why the draft played a large role in bringing an end to Vietnam .
We need another draft to push the mainstream over the edge and into action , but the façade is beginning to crack - 9/11 had some effect , the war in Iraq certainly , Katrina , massive job loses and an economic downturn that has really just begun have all factored into creating a critical mass .
Even the most propagandized population in the history of civilization will have to act when their very survival and well - being is directly threatened and impacted .
I just hope enough people will understand the need for bold decisive action now , before it 's too late .
So , to the people who have awareness of the problems facing us , if I could give advice , it would be this : 1 . Try the Bush Administration for war crimes .
If the case could ever be brought to court , the evidence to convict is definitely there .
This is why the administration has been strongly against the International Criminal Court .
If we are to begin repairing this country , and the world , we must begin by showing these power crazed and covert forces that they are accountable .
If we can convict someone like Cheney , we will send a powerful message to the covert world .
If we let them walk , we will keep having these problems .
New people will follow them and take their place .
2 . Investigate where all the military spending has been vanishing off to .
There are literally trillions of taxpayer dollars unaccounted for .
This money is fueling the covert world and terrorism in general .
As part of this , I would include an investigation into war profiteering as well .
3 . Make it mandatory that all electronic voting machines must have a 100 % verifiable paper trail .
4 . Get people into the Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) who will smash the current media ownership rules .
The concentration of media ownership is the foundation of the covert power structure .
Without that , the whole thing is a house of cards .
That 's why the FCC is currently trying to ram through rules that will further consolidate media ownership before the Bush administration leaves office .
As part of this , it is pivotal that we protect the open architecture of the Internet .
The media belongs to the people , as does the government , in theory anyway , but we need an information system that actually serves the public interest .
5 . Declare a national and global emergency on the environmental front .
We have already reached the breaking point .
We need organized , governmental , policy driven , bold action now .
6 . We need to address entities that now have power over the Constitution , such as the undemocratic and unelected corporate global governing structure - institutions like the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) and the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) and " agreements " like NAFTA and DR - CAFTA , to name a few .
Most Americans do n't even know what these power structures are , let alone that they have power that supersedes the Constitution .
We must also address the National Security Act , that 's where the ultimate power of our country lies .
The National Security Act has effectively made the Constitution meaningless and is the primary driver of the covert world .
The PATRIOT Act and various other newly granted powers must also be drastically revised or eliminated completely in order to protect our civil liberties .
7 . Lastly , we need to have publicly financed elections .
As long as we have a system that requires candidates to raise tens of millions of dollars to even be considered for office , we will have politicians who bend over backwards for the richest one percent and the most powerful elements of society at the citizens ' expense .
An important aspect of this has to be a requirement for large media companies to provide candidates with free airtime .
Candidates have to spend the majority of their money on advertising in the mainstream media .
That 's why the major news media spend so much time focusing on who is raising the most money , because they are the ones who end up with all that money .
Once we have publicly financed elections and free airtime for candidates , we will get people in office who will work in the interests of the public because they are not beholden to the large and powerful entities .
When you have politicians depending on the public instead of the private sector for survival , all the issues mentioned above could be addressed because they wo n't have to fear the withdrawal of support from large corporations and the wealthy and powerful who do not want these things to happen .
This will also enable us to eliminate tax breaks for the richest one percent , put an end to corporate welfare practices , and stop funding for obscene military and prison industrial companies that are profiting off of disasters and no longer serve security interests .
Then we can redirect that money into environmental , education , health care and social security programs , to mention a few .
In the current political environment this may all sound like an unrealistic pipe dream , but these are the seven pivotal things that MUST happen .
If all seven do n't happen within the next few years , we will have set the world on a disastrously irreversible course .
This is " the unfortunate reality of our current situation . "
It is not going to be easy , but you better start fighting for it now , while we still can .
It really does come down to us .
You have to personally , in your daily life , do everything you can .
With enough public pressure all of these things are achievable .
Once we get a small portion of the population acting in this direction , it will quickly catch on and spread .
Even though the overwhelming majority of the US population is incredibly propagandized on the surface , just underneath is the realization of the need for mass action .
They just need leaders to point this out .
The mainstream just needs a spark .
Do what you can to set it off .
It is a matter of unprecedented significance .

Palin – the Devil in disguise
The candidate for the Vice Presidency of the United States of America , whose experience in small town politics , mothers ´day dos and the local hockey club is her claim to fame , threatened to open the gates of Hell by attacking Russia in the event of another invasion of Georgia in a televised interview on ABC ( shown today ) .
One question for this self - opinionated upstart :
Do you know what a nuclear holocaust is ?
Palin – the Devil in disguise
Sarah Palin , Mrs. Nobody know - it - all shreiking cow from Alaska , the joke of American politics , plied with a couple of vodkas before letting rip in front of incredulous audiences while McCain coos in the background , cuts a ridiculous figure as she strives to be taken seriously .
How can anyone whose husband is a member of the Alaska Independence Party and who is running for the Vice Presidency of the Union be taken seriously ?
How indeed can the Republican Party be taken seriously for not vetting this female , or have they not yet discovered the skeletons in her closet ?
We have .
So Sarah Palin , Mrs. Hockey
Mom housewife - cum - small - town gossip merchant and cheap little guttersnipe , suppose you shut up and allowed real politicians and diplomats to do their work ?
Threatening Russia with a war is perhaps the most irresponsible thing anyone could do at this moment in time .
Have you any idea what a nuclear holocaust is ?
Have you any notion of the power of Russia ’s armed forces ?
Did you know that Russia has enough missiles to destroy any target anywhere on Earth in seconds ?
And have you not forgotten , you pith - headed little bimbo from the back of beyond , that small detail about the slaughter of Russian citizens by Georgians , which started the whole debacle ?
So next time suppose you keep your mouth shut and while you ’re at it , make sure the members of your family keep their legs shut too .
Your country has enough failed mothers as it is .

IDER - Three DeKalb County residents are being held without bond following their arrests today in connection with a drug raid at a North Sand Mountain home .
Sheriff Jimmy Harris said Ben L. Buffington , 54 , was charged with trafficking methamphetamine , first - degree possession of a controlled substance , first - degree possession of marijuana and felony possession of a firearm after drug Drug Task Force agents search his home on County Road 754 in Ider .
Harris said agents found 30 grams of meth ice , a meth lab , more than $ 3,500 in cash and several weapons in Buffington 's home .
He said Buffington was on probation for possessing precursor chemicals used in making meth .
Also arrested at the home were Jennifer Inez Eaton , 30 , and David Vaughn , 20 , both of Fort Payne .
Both were charged with unlawful possession of a controlled substance .
PHOENIX ( Reuters ) - Republican John McCain on Tuesday questioned rival Barack Obama ’s belief in American leadership in world affairs with two days to go before the Democratic senator accepts his party ’s nomination for U.S. president .
U.S. Senator John McCain ( R - AZ ) is interviewed by talk show host Jay Leno ( R ) on " The Tonight Show with Jay Leno " at the NBC studios in Burbank , California August 25 , 2008 in this publicity photograph released by NBC .
REUTERS / Paul Drinkwater / NBC / Handout
McCain , 71 , suggested Obama , 47 , had failed to express confidence in America as “ the greatest force for good on this earth ” when he gave a speech in Berlin last month before more than 100,000 people .
“ He was the picture of confidence .
But in some ways confidence itself and confidence in one ’s country are not the same , ” McCain he told a group of American war veterans .
McCain and Obama are vying to succeed Republican President George W. Bush , who must step aside in January after eight years in office .
McCain ’s campaign insists it does not question Obama ’s patriotism but merely his judgment .
Previous assertions by McCain that Obama cares more about political positions than issues of substance such as winning the Iraq war have angered the Democratic candidate , who has told his opponent not to question his patriotism .
McCain , himself a war veteran imprisoned for more than five years in Vietnam , accused Obama of appearing to link the U.S. - led invasion of Iraq in 2003 to Russian military action in Georgia in recent weeks .
Obama last week condemned Moscow ’s actions in Georgia and said Russia could not “ charge into other countries ” but he also said : “ Of course it helps if we are leading by example on that point . ”
His remarks were widely seen as a criticism of the war in Iraq , which Obama opposed .
McCain used the comments to raise broader questions about Obama , suggesting he lacked the clarity and vision to lead America and the world .
“ If he really thinks that by liberating Iraq from a dangerous tyrant , America somehow set a bad example that invited Russia to invade a small , peaceful and democratic nation , then he should state it outright because that is a debate I welcome , ” McCain declared .
“ Confusion about such questions only invites more trouble , violence and aggression , ” said McCain , who as a senator has specialized in defense and foreign affairs issues and has put national security at the center of his campaign .
He and Obama are running neck - and - neck in opinion polls .
Dow drops as bailout defeated RAW STORY
Published : Monday September 29 , 2008
Print This Email This The House failed to pass a $ 700 billion economic bailout package Monday , sending lawmakers back to the drawing table to try to stave off an economic collapse , and the stock market plummeted on the news .
The package failed on a 228-205 vote after Congressional leaders held the vote open for a half - hour after time had expired as they tried to persuade lawmakers to change their votes .
CNN reported that lawmakers would n't hold another vote on the bailout Monday as Congress prepared to adjourn for the Jewish holiday of Rosh Hashanah , which begins at sundown .
The failure -- after lawmakers remained in Washington over the weekend to negotiate a compromise -- essentially sends Congress and the White House back to the drawing table as they try to craft a compromise .
The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down nearly 600 points as traders worried the vote would go down in defeat .
The Dow dropped as much as 778 points at one point .
It was unclear how long Pelosi would hold the vote open to try to persuade lawmakers to shift their votes .
House rules allow leaders to hold the vote open indefinitely .
Lawmakers on Monday debated the bailout plan for struggling Wall Street banks as US President George W. Bush appealed to Congress to quickly approve the deal to free up frozen credit markets .
" I fully understand that this will be a difficult vote , " Bush said at the White House before the House of Representatives began debate on the proposal amid stiff opposition from some members of his Republican party .
But he said the rescue package " will help keep the crisis in our financial system from spreading throughout our economy . "
The US president spoke after a compromise proposal was hammered out in high - stakes negotiations between rival party leaders in Congress and White House officials over the weekend before global markets reopened on Monday .
The plan would mark the largest government economic intervention since the Great Depression of the 1930s , and is designed to shore up a troubled economy suffering from a burst US housing bubble that has ravaged the global banking system .
The proposal grants the Treasury secretary authority to buy up toxic mortgage - related assets in troubled banks in hopes of easing the flow of credit and reviving the moribund housing market .
As the pivotal debate began in Congress , the shakeup of the US banking sector continued with Citigroup on Monday agreeing to takeover Wachovia Bank .
US regulators backed the deal that grants the government a stake in one of the nation 's biggest banks .
The takeover came as Wachovia faced a near collapse of its share price and weakening confidence because of its exposure to troubled mortgage assets .
Congressional leaders , mindful of the approaching November 4 general elections , acknowledged the vote could be close while some conservative Republicans and liberal Democrats vowed to oppose the measure .
" We now have a deal that promises to bring near - term stability to our financial turmoil , but at what price ? "
Republican Congressman Michael Pence , a critic of the bailout , asked in a letter to colleagues .
White House hopefuls Republican John McCain and his Democratic rival Barack Obama have offered cautious backing for the plan , both claiming that demands they had made had been included in the new bill .
Despite the weekend deal , the financial crisis spread anxiety across global markets , prompting nationalizations and rescues of European banks while sending stocks down in Asia and Europe .
Britain had to nationalize Bradford & Bingley bank , governments intervened to prop up Belgian - Dutch group Fortis and other European banks got sucked into the storm .
Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke echoed Bush 's appeal , voicing support for the bailout bill .
" This legislation should help to restore the flow of credit to households and businesses that is essential for economic growth and job creation , while at the same time affording strong and necessary protections for taxpayers , " he said in a statement .
Democratic leaders portrayed the revised plan , that ran more than 100 pages , as much improved from the three - page version sent days earlier by the White House , saying it included stricter oversight , safeguards for taxpayers and caps on executive pay packages .
" Working in a bipartisan way , we sent a message to Wall Street .
The party is over , " said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi .
" The era of golden parachutes for high flying Wall Street operators is over .
No longer will the US taxpayer bail out the recklessness of Wall Street . "
The proposed rescue , posted on financialservices .house.gov and formally titled the Emergency Economic Stabilization
Act of 2008 , calls for the immediate release of 250 billion dollars to enable the government to buy up troubled assets .
Under the bill , the president is authorized to approve a further 100 billion dollars , but the plan gives Congress a veto power over purchases above that limit and sets a ceiling for all purchases of 700 billion dollars .
The rescue operation will be overseen by a board including the chairman of the Federal Reserve , the Treasury secretary and the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission .
The bill prohibits " golden parachutes " for CEOs or other executives who lose or leave their jobs at companies participating in the plan as long as the Treasury holds equity in those firms .
The negotiations were reportedly marked by bitter disagreement over how to pay for possible losses suffered by taxpayers after debt has been bought and sold .
Democratic lawmakers had called for financial firms to help pay for the losses but the draft legislation left the question open for the next US president to tackle .
DEVELOPING ...
In the Fox TV show “ 24 ” , counterterrorism agent Jack Bauer tortures someone around 12 times a day .
While Bauer ’s use of torture magically always elicits the truth from its deserving victims , the lawyers who are designing our nation ’s interrogation policies seem to be basing their opinions more on this fictional TV show than on either the poor results actually obtained from torture , or on the law ( including the constitution ) :
British lawyer Philippe Sands says that Bauer was an inspiration at early “ brainstorming meetings ” of military officials at Guantanamo in September 2002 .

Preventing the Free Market from Doing Its Job
Economically speaking , the so - called credit market crisis is , first and foremost , a reallocation of property rights .
Overstretched borrowers default on their obligations .
Lenders , who have made unwise credit decisions , run up losses if they fail to collect interest and principal payments on credit extended .
Luckily , all this leaves the physical supply of economic goods untouched .
The reallocation of property rights is typically accompanied by changes in market valuations .
Financial asset prices such as stocks , bonds , and derivatives may decline , reflecting changes in people 's preferences .
While this is certainly unfavorable from the viewpoint of financial asset holders , it is welcomed by those seeking to invest their money , as they are now in a position to purchase assets at lower prices .
As the unhampered market finds a new equilibrium via price changes , it exposes malinvestment .
Some of the investments made and some of the jobs created prove to be unprofitable .
It is the process of altering prices for capital and labor that brings the economy 's production structure back in line with people 's preferences .
In that sense , a so - called crisis , or bust , is actually a correction of bad decisions made in the past ; the term crisis would appear to be inappropriate .
In fact , the term crisis should be attributed to the boom period .
It is here where scarce resources , mostly due to artificially reduced interest rates through monetary policy , are being channeled to unprofitable businesses .
While the period of building up malinvestment is typically hailed as a period of economic expansion , it is actually a period of squandering .
As Ludwig von Mises put it ,
The boom is called good business , prosperity , and upswing .
Its unavoidable aftermath , the readjustment of conditions to the real data of the market , is called crisis , slump , bad business , depression .
People rebel against the insight that the disturbing element is to be seen in the malinvestment and the overconsumption of the boom period and that such an artificially induced boom is doomed .
They are looking for the philosophers ' stone to make it last . [ 1 ]
Many people think that state interventionism can ( and has to ) fight against financial market turmoil and any consequences it may have for output and employment growth .
While this is certainly a fatal belief , one thing seems certain : the latest developments suggest that without a far - reaching coercive redistribution of income through state action , the government - controlled paper - money standards would go belly up immediately .
The Intricacies of Fractional - Reserve Banking
To see this , we must be aware of the fact that today 's government - controlled money - supply systems rest on fractional - reserve banking .
Banks create money when they extend loans to , or buy assets from , nonbanks .
If , for instance , a bank grants a loan in the amount of , say , US $ 10,000 , it creates money in the same amount .
If a borrower repays his loan , the money stock declines .
That said , the money stock is basically the result of bank - credit supply and bank - credit demand .
What is more , banks are required to hold just a fraction of their obligations in cash ( minimum reserves ) .
If confidence in the financial solidity of a bank should erode and customers want to withdraw their deposits , a bank could not meet its promise to pay in full .
The ensuing bank run could spread to other banks , to the point where the banking sector as a whole becomes insolvent .
However , government - sponsored central banks have the power to prevent any such bank default .
If it is politically expedient , a central bank can , at any point in time , provide banks with whatever money is needed ( lender of last resort ) , so that the risk of bank runs has been reduced greatly .
But there remains another weak point of the government sponsored money system .
The governments ' financial watchdogs encourage banks to keep a small ratio of regulatory equity capital to risky assets , around 8 % .
As a result , relatively small losses have the potential to wipe out banks ' capital base .
In such a case , not only would bank shareholders suffer losses , but so would depositors and holders of bank liabilities .
It is this fact that can have far - ranging consequences for the economy 's credit and money supply .
To see what bank losses mean under fractional - reserve banking backed by little equity capital , let us take a look at a simple example .
Below we show a ( stylized ) consolidated balance sheet of the banking sector ( Figure 1 ) .
It records banks ' assets on the left - hand side and banks ' liabilities on the right - hand side .
As can be seen , banks hold a fraction of fractional reserves : base money ( minimum reserves ) amount to a small portion of clients ' demand deposits and time deposits .
What is more , the banking sector 's ( regulatory ) equity capital in relation to risky assets ( loans , bonds , and other assets ) is assumed to be 10.1 % .
Bank Recapitalization Reduces the Money Stock
Now let us assume that — as a result of a collapsed lending - and credit - speculation boom — 10.1 % of banks ' risky assets ( an equivalent of US $ 1,170bn ) have to be written off .
In our example , the resulting loss would wipe out the banking sector 's entire equity capital ( Figure 2 ) .
Banks would be on the verge of bankruptcy .
To remain in business , banks would need new equity capital .
If nonbank investors buy new stocks , the banking sector 's balance sheet would change in an important way : bank liabilities ( in the form of demand and time deposits and long - term liabilities ) decline in the same amount as banks ' equity capital rises .
If we assume that bank clients exchange demand and time deposits for new bank stocks , the increase in banks ' equity capital of , say , US $ 1,051bn ( which would restore an equity - capital - to - risky - assets ratio of 10.1 % ) would reduce the stock of deposits held with banks by 15.3 % ( Figure 3 ) .
A sharp drop in the stock of bank deposits would be deflationary , potentially leading to a marked decline in goods and asset prices , even triggering a severe fall in output and employment , thereby aggravating bank - loan losses .
In view of such a scenario , panic may spread like wildfire .
Public opinion can be expected to call for government policies that would fend off any such development .
Policies for Socializing Bank Losses
The central bank could intervene by buying banks ' distressed assets ( at par or even at elevated prices ) , or extending loans to banks , with newly issued central bank money .
This would reduce bank losses and release equity capital for additional lending and money creation .
However , such a policy would be unmistakably inflationary , running the risk of destroying confidence in paper money .
Market interest rates could rise , causing borrower defaults on a wider scale , thereby pushing the economy into recession , increasing banks ' loan write downs and thereby equity capital losses considerably .
In fact , a strategy of outright inflation might not be rational from the viewpoint of government politicians , central bankers , and influential vested interest groups ; all of them would have much to lose , and at least those in command of the printing press and taxation can be expected to opt for strategies that would , from their viewpoint , appear to cause as little damage as possible .
The central bank could — actually before any major write - downs are recorded — take over banks ' risky assets in exchange for government bond holdings .
In our example , the central bank transfers its government bond holdings to banks in the amount of US $ 744bn ( Figure 4 ) .
In our example , the transaction has prevented a severe decline in banks ' equity capital .
Clearly , if its security holdings are ( much ) lower than banks ' write offs , the central bank cannot prevent banks ' equity capital from eroding markedly .
However , there is another way of subsidizing banks via mobilizing taxpayers ' money .
To see how this can work , we need to take a look at the year 1948 , when the Deutschmark was introduced in West Germany .
Due to differences in converting asset and liabilities from Reichsmarks into Deutschmarks , German banks found themselves with revaluation gaps on the asset side of their balance sheets .
The German public sector came to help and provided banks with so - called Ausgleichsforderungen ( or compensation claims ) .
These were effectively state bonds that had a long maturity , a low interest rate , and were repaid over time .
These taxpayer - funded assets helped shore up the banking sector 's equity capital .
In a similar fashion , governments , or their central banks , could in the current situation provide banks with claims on the government ( or claims on the central bank ) .
Banks would record these assets on the left - hand side of their balance sheets , and they would help increase banks ' equity capital .
Let us assume that the central bank provides banks with US $ 1,051bn ( the amount that would restore banks ' equity - capital ratio of 10.1 % ) of claims on the central bank ( Figure 4 ) .
The banking sector would be restored to health as far as its capital base is concerned , while the stock of money remains unchanged .
As in our example , the central bank 's equity capital would be wiped out with additional liabilities in the amount of US $ 1,051bn ; the government could provide its central bank with additional government bonds ( with a long maturity and a low interest rate ) , so that the central bank 's equity base would remain unchanged .
What about the option of the government setting up special funds , which would take over banks ' distressed loan and security portfolios ?
Here , banks would receive ( interest bearing ) claims against the government - sponsored special funds , while the latter would be refinanced by issuing government - guaranteed bonds .
However , such a transaction would reduce the economy 's money stock : the government 's special fund would pay for banks ' assets with commercial - bank money ( which was acquired through the issue of bonds ) .
As a result , the banking sector 's balance - sheet volume would shrink , and so would the money stock .
Finally , one could let bank depositors and holders of bank liabilities take part in banks ' losses .
In this case , banks ' depositors and creditors would see their claims converted into bank equity capital ; it would actually be a bank - debt - for - equity - swap on a grand scale .
But would there be a political willingness to declare the national banking sector bankrupt ?
Returning Money to the Free Market
Whatever the technicalities for propping up the government - sponsored paper - money systems may be , the decade - long debt binge will most likely end in inflation .
This is because the " crisis " is widely perceived as a calamity — rather than the necessary economic correction of malinvestment brought about by central banks ' manipulation of market interest rates through credit and money expansion .
On top of that , people fear deflation much more than inflation .
Lower interest rates and more credit and money are seen as a remedy of the disease brought about by central banks ' artificial lowering of the interest rate through credit expansion .
We currently find ourselves in a situation Ludwig von Mises warned against :
The boom produces impoverishment .
But still more disastrous are its moral ravages .
It makes people despondent and dispirited .
The more optimistic they were under the illusory prosperity of the boom , the greater is their despair and their feeling of frustration .
The individual is always ready to ascribe his good luck to his own efficiency and to take it as a well - deserved reward for his talent , application , and probity .
But reverses of fortune he always charges to other people , and most of all to the absurdity of social and political institutions .
He does not blame the authorities for having fostered the boom .
He reviles them for the inevitable collapse .
In the opinion of the public , more inflation and more credit expansion are the only remedy against the evils which inflation and credit expansion have brought about . [ 2 ]
There is no escape from the costs of correcting the damage inflicted by government paper - money standards .
However , when looking for monetary - reform proposals , Mises 's work must be given highest public attention : he proposed ending the government money - supply monopoly — which he identified as the root of the problem — and returning money to the free market .
Only in this way can the costs of the final monetary and economic collapse be prevented from becoming disastrously high .
Mises wrote , " The alternative is only whether the crisis should come sooner as the result of a voluntary abandonment of further credit expansion , or later as a final and total catastrophe of the currency system involved . " [ 3 ]
Meet the Boy Too Big for His Mom's SUV
This 12 - Year - Old Boy Is Truly Unique and Truly Tall
Ellensburg , Wash. , is home to a truly unique young man : 12 - year - old Brenden Adams , who is more than seven feet tall and , incredibly , still growing .
He towers over his classmates and even his teacher , Gretchen Holmstrom , who jokingly quipped , " I'm 5 ' 9 , " so I never look up to sixth graders -- until this year … never say never ! "
And though friends say Brenden is just a regular kid , he 's obviously not like anybody else .
He has to duck through most doorways and sit sideways at his school desk because his knees do n't fit under it .
In his mom 's sport utility vehicle , he has to fold down the second row of seats , sit in the third row and stretch his legs out over the middle row in order to sit comfortably .
His shoe size ?
18 and still growing .
Not Just a Tall Kid
Brenden is one - of - a- kind , and it 's not just his height .
Everything about him is different .
His mom , Debbie Ezell , said he requires a team of doctors and multiple medical visits simply to stay on top of his ever - changing and expanding frame .
He has enormous joints , fatty tumors , even extra teeth , 12 of which were recently removed .
Amazingly , his dad , Willie Adams , said there was no hint of any of this when Brenden was born at 7 pounds , 3 ounces and 19 1 / 2 inches in length .
His mom says they first started to notice something was different at his 2 month check - up .
" They said , these measurements just are n't right .
He 's too long , " Ezell said .
" And at four months , he had all of his teeth . "
Then mom and dad got the news that any parent would dread .
Doctors and medical experts told them they had no idea what was causing the problem with their child .
" I still have n't seen anyone like Brenden , " says Dr. Melissa Parisi , his geneticist at Children 's Hospital in Seattle .
Parisi has been treating Brenden since he was four years old , when , she said , " he was the size of a typical 8 - year - old boy . "
What 's Up ?
" I was terrified , " his father said , " and no one could ever give us an answer what the outcome would be or what the expectancy would be . "
Brenden 's mom agreed , " That 's the worst part … not knowing . "
For years , doctors continued to search for the source and an answer to Brenden 's unstoppable growth .
He went through multiple tests and X - rays as medical experts tried to determine what was going on inside Brenden 's body .
Then , finally , a breakthrough -- when Brenden was eight years old and already the size of an adult .
" I have to say that the hematologists and oncologists here actually helped us figure it out , " admits Parisi .
" He has a very unusual rearrangement of his genetic material .
It 's what 's called an inversion of chromosome - 12 and it affects every single cell in his body . "
Chromosomes , you may remember , come in pairs .
But in Brenden 's case , his 12th chromosomes do n't match .
Somehow -- experts still do n't know why -- the middle of one of them broke off , flipped around and re-attached , disrupting a critical gene that controls growth .
And that 's what experts believe is causing Brenden 's excessive growth and other symptoms and what makes his case the only one of its kind .
" This gene is functioning despite the regulation that it should n't be , " said Dr. Gad Kletter , Brenden 's endocrinologist at Swedish Hospital in Seattle .
" It 's over - functioning .
He was predicted to be over eight foot tall . "
Ending the Neverending Growth Spurt
Now that doctors finally figured out what was causing Brenden 's skyrocketing height , they still had another mystery to solve : how to stop it ?
And since Brenden is believed to be the only person in the world with the condition , there was no clear - cut answer .
Then , Kletter had an idea that seemed a little crazy -- shots of testosterone to jump start puberty and speed up Brenden 's growth .
It 's puberty , he explained , that signals the body to stop growing .
" We induced puberty , " explained Kletter , " to fuse the bones and stop the growth . "
And so far , the shots seem to be successful .
Brenden 's growth has slowed down .
Living With a Giant
To make life a little easier at home , Brenden 's mom had a home built specifically to fit someone of Brenden 's enormous proportions .
" It 's a lot easier going through the doors and stuff than the last house we had , " Brenden said .
" The doors are a lot taller and so are the ceilings . "
Coincidentally , on the day ABC News visited Brenden 's school , his class was working on a soul - searching exercise .
Perhaps not surprisingly , Brenden wrote that he wishes people would see " how he 's just like everyone else . "
Happily , some already do .
" He 's really nice and caring , " a friend , Tucker , said .
His stepsister , Sierra , added : " He 's an extremely good person . "
What does the future hold for him ?
" It 's unknown , " said Kletter .
" No other case is reported , nothing to look at -- it 's an uncharted sea . "
We hate to admit it , but there 's a really good chance that even with all the right tools , your first round of resumes might very well end up in the back of a filing cabinet , or in a plastic bin next to the interviewer you thought you charmed .
But you do n't learn without trying , and having your first efforts to switch positions fail gives you time , and some real data , to reflect on what you can change for the next batch .
Read on for some of the better advice we 've seen for rebuilding a job search and narrowing your targets .

Work the crowd you 're in

The New York Times ' career columnist Marci Alboher wrote that when you 're expecting to be laid off , focusing on your job 's positives and thanking those you work with can pay off in references and leads .
If you 're feeling hopelessly trapped in a gig , you can use the same tactics to deliver unexpected compliments , thank those who helped you get to where you are , and work back on your most - connected contacts .
Set a deadline for yourself , as if your job is truly ending on , say , the last of the month , and work the crowd as much as you can without giving away your hunger to leave .

Getting a new , sharp suit can invigorate your job search — you can be ( at least mentally ) a totally new person in new threads .
As career advice columnist Penelope Trunk has suggested , great suits cost a lot because they sit nicely on your frame , and the fabric does n't wrinkle .
But a suit you 'll likely only wear to an important interview and a family event or two does n't have to cap your credit card .
If you can find a trust - worthy tailor , a decent - looking but cheap suit can fit the bill :
Since you are having your cheap fabric tailored , it will lay well on your body .
And if you do n't sit a lot before the interview , it wo n't wrinkle : Voila , an expensive suit that was n't expensive .

Besides , if you 're wearing a just - bought suit that you were uncomfortable spending so much cash on , you 'll probably look uncomfortable when you 're on the interview .

Start a blog
No , seriously — it can work .
Blogger ( and occasional interviewer ) Adam Dorowski's suggestion that the blog is the new resume is n't empty Web 2.0 hype .
You can't just send the permalinks along to your prospective boss and wait for the benefits package , but it 's a subtle way to move into a new direction or show off talents you do n't get to explore in your current gig , and it shows off those basic office skills of clear thought and communication :
Blogging is the perfect way for a candidate to give an employer a more detailed sales pitch - to show they can " talk the talk " ( as opposed to just fill a resume with buzzwords ) .
I can't think of a reason for any serious tech professional to not have a blog .
Not only does it serve as an excellent notebook for storing ideas and links , but it can come in handy in a job hunt where what interviewers really want to just know what , professionally ( and somewhat personally ) , engages you on a day to day basis .

In other words , blog as if you were already doing what you 'd love to do , and it'll show when your prospective employer hits the hyperlink .
Get back to the ground floor
As many of our commenters suggested when asked how to score a dream job , you might not be able to make a lateral move into the company or career that invigorates you , but if you 're willing to intern on weekends , start at a lower - paying scale , or even head back to school to pick up a few skills and credits the employer might appreciate , it can go a long way toward showing you 're committed to more than just a nice salary .
And as we 've mentioned before , seeking out people in a specific company or holding the title you want to one day have and getting as much information as you can about how they got there — without digging through their trash , of course — pays off .
Knowing what you have to do , even if it means backtracking a bit , is a lot more helpful than wondering what you did n't do .
That 's just our take , of course .
What helped you get back into the game and into the right job if you were initially rejected , or just fell off the application habit ?
Hit us with your story in the comments .
Alone in the Dark started way back in 1992 on the old PC DOS systems and later spawned sequels on various consoles , from the 3DO to the PS2 .
This sequel is set in 2008 and sees you play as the hero of the original game , Edward Carnby , who is looking for answers to strange supernatural occurrences around Central Park in New York .
The game " centers around rumors , allegations , and suspicions of clandestine activity in tunnels found below the park ” so expect the unexpected throughout the game .
The game starts you waking up after a supernatural ritual to cleanse you of the evil that once was in your body .
The ritual caused severe amnesia and you wake not knowing anything .
From there , you can tell Atari has gone for the big blockbuster feel as the opening twenty minutes of the game is pretty action packed with big cinematic explosions going off everywhere , really giving you the feel that this is going to be one hell of a night .
The game is split up into episodes and sequences .
One of the new features that Alone of the Dark boasts is the ability to skip through the game much like you can on a DVD movie .
You can fast forward sequences or even skip entire episodes .
You find a puzzle to hard or a boss to hard or just want to see what happens at the end of the game skip it .
Of course you do not get those precious achievements , but for the casual gamers out there , this is a welcome addition .
Although the opening cinematic was fast - paced and action - packed that does n’t correspond throughout the whole game .
During the middle of the game things slow way down , to a point of being to slow in areas with lots of walking to get to places taking its toll .
The action in Alone in the Dark comes in drips : one minute you can be fighting off dozens of vampires , humans , and other messed up and ugly creatures , and next you will be wondering when and where they will come at you next .
The fighting itself is very awkward and frustrating to say the least , and this goes for the controls as a whole .
There are dozens of objects that can be used as melee weapons : steel poles , chairs , axes , wooden sticks , fire extinguishers , huge logs , and so on .
When faced against enemies with a melee weapon in your hand , you will need to lock onto them using the left trigger and then by using the right analogue stick pull back then push forward to release an attack , this will unleash an over the head attack .
To unleash a swipe , using the right analogue stick again moving it from left to right or right to left .
The problem with this is the fact that you are pretty screwed when it comes to facing off against multiple enemies , since , to get a decent hit , you need to lock on to the target and by doing this leaving you vulnerable to other attacks .
Of course , there are handguns in the game but to be honest , they are rather useless unless you pour flammable liquid on the bullets to make them fire bullets , as the only way to get rid of some enemies is to use fire .
One of Alone in the Dark ’s best features is the inventory , and the ability to use items in the game and combine them to create helpful tools .
As I mentioned before , since normal bullets do n’t work , pour some flammable liquid on the bullets to make them flammable and voila !
you have yourself fire bullets .
You see a wall that you think can be penetrated ?
Get a bottle full of flammable liquid , stick some double sided sticky tape on it then attach a case of bullets and you have yourself a bomb .
There are dozens of combinations available from items and each combination brings something new to the way you play game and how you can go about killing monsters .
Now you may be thinking that this is living up to the hype , with me explaining the diverse inventory system , the episode and sequences system , and the big blockbuster feel , but all this does n’t distract you from the horrible controls , dodgy fighting system , horrible camera , and the overall layout of the game .
It ’s like Eden Studios spent all of their time on getting these original ideas in the game but forgot about the execution and how they would intertwine with the whole gameplay experience .
Instead of using an over - shoulder camera with the ability to move the camera around , Eden decided to have the camera behind the character with no control what so ever .
Overall , the brilliantly creative ideas and blockbuster scenes are n’t enough to distract you from the poor camera , horrible controls , and the overall feel of the game .
It does n’t live up to the hype that was touted from Atari but , and this is a big but , if you can get around the camera and the controls then there is a pretty solid game underneath .

The United States consumes 390 million gallons of gasoline a day .
Even if you believe climate change is the greatest hoax since Orson Wells convinced the country it was under Martian attack , we can't sustain that kind of consumption because the supply of oil is dwindling and what remains can't be pumped much faster .
By embracing small , lightweight cars with hyper - efficient engines , alternative fuels and hybrids we can cut our fuel consumption 30 to 50 percent by 2035 , say researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology .
Improvements in vehicle design and engine efficiency , hybrid technology and the inevitable electrification of automobiles will go a long way toward slaking our thirst for gas , they say , but the biggest benefit will come when people realize they do n't need the fastest car or biggest truck on the block to slog through our daily commutes or run to the store for a quart of milk .
" We 've got to get out of the habit of thinking we only need to focus on improving the technology , that we can invent our way out of this situation , " says John Heywood , the mechanical engineering professor who led the study .
" We 've got to do everything we can think of , including reducing the size of the task by real conservation . "
The idea that smaller cars and hybrids are more fuel efficient is n't new , but On the Road in 2035 : Reducing Transportation 's Petroleum Consumption and GHG Emissions ( . pdf ) lays out a comprehensive approach to reducing our fuel consumption to 2000 levels and significantly curbing greenhouse gas emissions .
Over the next 15 years or so , automakers must increase the efficiency of gasoline and diesel engines and transmissions and significantly reduce the weight of the cars they build .
These improvements should be focused exclusively on improving fuel economy , not improving performance , the researchers say .
Looking 15 to 30 years ahead , the researchers say automakers must continue developing hybrids , plug - in hybrids , electric vehicles and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles .
Develop alternative fuels , but do n't expect them to supplant petroleum anytime soon .
Relying on corn - based ethanol " is not obviously justifiable , " they write , but biodiesel , algal fuels and cellulosic ethanol should be pursued .
The government needs to get involved " to push and pull improved technologies and greener alternative fuels into the market place in high volume . "
Policymakers should " require auto manufacturers to make smaller , more fuel efficient cars , encourage consumers to chose those vehicles and discourage everyone from driving so much . "
Heywood and his colleagues started working on the study five years ago , when gas was well under two bucks a gallon and SUVs ruled the earth .
Since then , we 've seen prices approach $ 5 a gallon in some areas and the bottom fall out of the auto industry as consumers ditch their gas - guzzlers faster than Christie Brinkley dumped Peter Cook .
The auto industry has gotten the message and is pursuing many of the points the researchers make .
They 're all working on smaller , more fuel - efficient gasoline engines , dual - clutch transmissions and clean diesels while paring weight from their cars .
Internal combustion is n't going anywhere anytime soon , and the researchers say it " offers a path for continuous improvements in vehicle efficiency for the next few decades " – provided automakers emphasize fuel economy over performance .
Most of the automakers also are developing hybrids , which the researchers say " offer a promising path to cost - effective reduction in fuel use , " and plug - in hybrids .
But the timeline for their impact on fuel consumption will be measured in decades because of their slow rate of market penetration .
Toyota 's sold 1 million Prius hybrids in the 10 years it 's been on the road , and hybrids are still less than 3 percent of the market .
That number will surely climb , but " their impact on fuel use and emissions is unlikely to be significant over the next few decades . "
The time line , they say , is longer still for electric and hydrogen vehicles because of their cost and other issues .
Critics argue the auto industry is dragging its heels and we need these cars tomorrow .
But if super - efficient vehicles appeared in every showroom tomorrow , it still would take two decades or more for them to have a significant impact .
Cars have a lifespan of about 15 years , and " fleet fuel use responds with a lag time of some 10 years to changes in the new vehicle market , " the researchers say .
" Transitioning from our current situation onto a path with declining fuel consumption and emissions , even in the developed world , will take several decades – much longer than we hoped and realized , " Heywood says .
" We 've got to start now . "

Imagine that America had no system of post - secondary education , and you were a member of a task force assigned to create one from scratch .
One of your colleagues submits this proposal :
First , we will set up a single goal to represent educational success , which will take four years to achieve no matter what is being taught .
We will attach an economic reward to it that seldom has anything to do with what has been learned .
We will urge large numbers of people who do not possess adequate ability to try to achieve the goal , wait until they have spent a lot of time and money , and then deny it to them .
We will stigmatize everyone who does n't meet the goal .
We will call the goal a " BA . "
You would conclude that your colleague was cruel , not to say insane .
But that 's the system we have in place .
Finding a better way should be easy .
The BA acquired its current inflated status by accident .
Advanced skills for people with brains really did get more valuable over the course of the 20th century , but the acquisition of those skills got conflated with the existing system of colleges , which had evolved the BA for completely different purposes .
Outside a handful of majors -- engineering and some of the sciences -- a bachelor 's degree tells an employer nothing except that the applicant has a certain amount of intellectual ability and perseverance .
Even a degree in a vocational major like business administration can mean anything from a solid base of knowledge to four years of barely remembered gut courses .
By most accounts , 2005 was a good year for the U.S. economy .
The nation added more than 2 million jobs and the unemployment rate averaged less than 5 percent .
Gross Domestic
Product grew robustly , and corporate profits soared nearly 18 percent .
But few people , including many in the media who regularly report on the economy , understand what happened below the surface to produce those surprisingly good results .
Consider , for instance , job growth .
American businesses actually produced 31 million new jobs in 2005 , driven by on average some 1.5 million firms every quarter that were expanding , and another 370,000 new businesses that were starting up .
On the other hand , firms also eliminated nearly 29 million jobs , including an average of nearly 1.5 million businesses that were contracting each quarter and another 325,000 going out of business , according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics ’ Business Employment Dynamics survey .
The net result , 2 million additional jobs , is the product of the enormous creation and destruction going on below the surface .
Those startling numbers should remind us that even in a strong economy there are plenty of losers — not just winners .
And that should help explain what ’s wrong with the press ’s coverage of a Government Accountability Office study released last week , which reported that two - thirds of American corporations paid no taxes in 2005 — including a quarter of big businesses .
The report , commissioned by several labor - friendly Democratic Senators who pretty much knew based on previous studies what it would say , sparked a lot of manufactured outrage in political circles and produced a series of misleading stories , like one by the Associated Press that ran in dozens of newspapers under sensationalistic headlines like “ Corporations Pay No Taxes . ”
A number of more rational commentators have pointed out some of the ways that the pols have led the media astray on this one .
Kevin Hassett , in a Bloomberg commentary , explained that most small businesses are now organized in such a way that many prefer to take their profits as an owner ’s salary and pay taxes on the wages .
It ’s not that they are n’t paying taxes , as the headline incorrectly says , but rather that the money is not flowing to the government through the corporate levy .
Still , the report leaves open the question of larger businesses that paid nothing .
The impression one gets from corporate critics is that many are prospering but exploiting loopholes in the tax code and leaving the rest of us to pick up the tab .
But that criticism is based on the mistaken notion that in robust years , such as 2005 , virtually all businesses do well .
Nothing could be further from the truth .
Even in good times , there are plenty of losers in a dynamic economy .
The BLS ’ Business Dynamics Survey , for instance , shows that in 2005 there were 7.3 businesses that were contracting for every 7.6 that were expanding , including 1.3 that were closing their doors for every 1.5 that were starting up .
Large businesses were hardly immune to this kind of tumult .
For every 5.8 jobs added by firms with more than 500 employees , other firms that big eliminated 4.9 jobs .
Among those hit hard in 2005 was General Motors , which despite $ 193 billion in revenues wracked up a $ 10.4 billion loss and cut its workforce .
It should n’t be necessary to remind reporters and editors who cover such matters that businesses pay taxes on their profits , not sales .
But I often read stories in which a reporter confuses the two , saying that a business “ made ” $ 50 million when the writer is referring to the company ’s sales .
Much of the press that the GAO report received revolves around blurring the distinction between these two .
As Michigan Senator Carl Levin , a frequent critic of corporations , said of the study , “ Twenty - five percent of the largest U.S. corporations [ those with more than $ 50 million in revenues ] had $ 1.1 trillion in gross sales in 2005 and yet paid no federal income taxes . ”
That statement suggests that Levin is either trying to mislead us or that he has made it into the world ’s most exclusive club , the U.S. Senate , without knowing the difference between earnings and sales .
The difference , of course , can be enormous .
For one thing , many industries have extremely small profit margins because as soon as it gets too easy to make a buck in a free - market system , you ’re sure to get plenty of competitors crowding in , driving down your margins .
The average net margin in the supermarket business is just 1 to 2 percent of sales , for instance , which means that a company with $ 50 million in sales ( to use the study ’s definition of large businesses ) would earn , on average just $ 500,000 - to - $ 1 million annually and pay taxes on that money .
Many firms in the industry , of course , would be below that average , and some would lose money in any year .
Many businesses we regard as successful operate on small profit margins .
After paying $ 5.8 billion in taxes in 2005 , Wal - Mart earned $ 11.7 billion — a nice chunk of change .
But those earnings were on revenues of $ 312 billion , a mere 3.4 percent net profit margin .
Exxon Mobil earned $ 36 billion in 2005 after paying $ 23.3 billion in taxes on revenues of $ 371 billion .
Looking at that result you realize that in America today , a ‘ windfall ’ profit is one that amounts to less than 10 percent of revenues .
The politics behind the GAO report are transparent — to undermine the momentum that ’s building to cut corporate tax rates .
As I wrote several weeks ago ( “ In the U.S. , Selectively Applied Capitalism , ” July 28 ) , the U.S. has the second highest corporate tax rate among 30 countries in the Organisation of Economic Co-Operation and Development .
That matters because , as economists for the OECD recently concluded , the corporate tax is the most harmful to economic growth of all the levies most commonly used by member nations .
That ’s why GOP presidential nominee John McCain favors lowering it , but so does the powerful Democratic Chairmen of the House Ways & Means Committee , Charlie Rangel .
The Democratic presidential nominee , Barack Obama , has also said in newspaper interviews that he would consider cutting the corporate tax , but he has n’t made that an official part of his platform .
Now , however , labor - friendly legislators egged on by union leaders are trying to derail calls for a corporate tax cut by manufacturing outrage against U.S. businesses .
That ’s not hard to do when you have so many journalists reporting and commenting on these issues who ca n’t get behind headlines that are spoon fed to them , like the editorial writer at Newsday who found the GAO report “ jaw dropping . ”
Yes , it ’s true that 2005 was a good year for many American companies .
As I noted above , corporate profits rose 18 percent , according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis .
But taxes on corporate profits that year increased 34 percent , says the BEA .
Growing firms , you see , do pay more in taxes .
Just do n’t imagine that every business is growing whenever the American economy is .
This is part of a series I started in March 2008 - you may want to go back and look at older parts if you 're new to this series .
I 've combined two of the planned parts this time , what was in the list from last time as parts 7 and 8 .
Making use of lambda / call
We can implement loops using recursion " manually " , but adding lambda 's now should make it possible to create a slightly cleaner version by actually defining a " while " function :
( defun while ( cond body ) ( if ( call cond ( ) ) ( do ( call body ( ) ) ( while cond body ) ( ) ) ) )
In a way , this is n't so far from Ruby blocks , except that we do n't provide the syntactic sugar that allows the blocks to be defined without any extra vocabulary , so in use our " while " function would look like this :
( while ( lambda ( ) ( cond ) ) ( lambda ( ) ( body ) ) )
Not terrible , and far better than earlier , but still not very clean .
We 'll do better shortly , but for now lets start with a pre-requisite that prevents the code above from actually working in any meaningful sense of the word :
We finally have to add support for using the arguments passed .
In our Ruby based syntax , the while function using function arguments looks like this :
[ : defun , : while , [ : cond , : body ] , [ : if , [ : apply , : cond , [ ] ] , [ : do , [ : apply , : body , [ ] ] , [ : while , : cond , : body ] ] , [ ] ] ]
As a sidebar , indirectly this also means we 're providing a hackish way of providing local variables .
" Proper " local variables is largely syntactic sugar again .
Most stuff in programming is syntactic sugar :
( call ( lambda ( i ) ( code here ) ) ( 0 ) )
The code above defines the local variable ( i ) , visible to the code inside , and initializes it to 0 .
Not pretty , but as usual we defer pretty until later .
As usual it's also highly inefficient , since it depends on creating a brand new function , but we 'll deal with that later .
Adding function arguments
But lets move on and actually figure out what changes to make to access the function arguments .
These preparations also pave the way for proper local variables and more down the line .
First we 'll add a " scope " object , and do some minor refactoring .
The " scope " defines which sets of variables are actually visible to use at any time .
class Function attr_reader : args , : body def initialize args , body @args = args @body = body end end class
Scope def initialize compiler , func @c = compiler @func = func end def get_arg a a = a .
to_sym @func .
args .
each_with_index { | arg , i | return [ : arg , i ] if arg == a } return [ : atom , a ] end end
The reason we separate Function and Scope here is that I 'll later introduce scopes that match other things than functions , such as classes etc .
Part of the refactoring mentioned is to thread the scope objects through the compiler , so that scope changes are transparent ( by just passing the new scope down ) .
We hook Scope#get_arg in into Compiler #get_arg by changing :
return [ : atom , a ] if ( a . is_a ? ( Symbol ) )
into this :
return scope .
get_arg ( a ) if ( a . is_a ? ( Symbol ) )
#output_functions changes into this , to start a new scope for each function :
def output_functions @global_functions .
each do | name , func | puts " .globl # { name } " puts " .type #{ name } , @function " puts " #{ name } :" puts " \t pushl %ebp " puts " \t movl %esp , %ebp " compile_exp ( Scope . new ( self , func , func .
body ) puts " \t leave " puts " \t ret " puts " \t .size #{ name } , .- #{ name } " puts end end
And #compile_defun changes to create a proper Function object instead of just an array of arguments and the body :
def compile_defun scope , name , args , body @global_functions [ name ] = Function . new ( args , body ) return [ : subexpr ]
end
Then we need to actually support accessing the arguments .
Again we resort to " gcc - S " to find out how .
This :
void bar ( const char * str , unsigned long arg , unsigned long arg2 ) { printf ( str , arg , arg2 ) ; }
turns into :
bar : pushl %ebp movl %esp , %ebp subl $ 24 , %esp movl 16 ( %ebp ) , %eax movl %eax , 8 ( %esp ) movl 12 ( %ebp ) , %eax movl %eax , 4 ( %esp ) movl 8 ( %ebp ) , %eax movl %eax , ( %esp ) call printf leave ret
As you can see , the arguments are accessed relative to %ebp , which has been loaded with a copy of %esp at the beginning of the function .
Why the offset of 8 for the first argument ?
Well , the return address gets pushed onto the stack , creating an offset of 4 , and the the old value of %ebp is pushed on , giving us an offset of 8 to access the arguments .
Remember that %esp grows down in memory , which is why we 're adding offsets to get past the last entries pushed onto the stack .
That leads to this addition to # compile_eval_arg as the last " if " check :
if atype == : arg puts " \t movl \t #{ PTR_SIZE * ( aparam + 2 ) } ( %ebp ) , %eax " end
Last but not least we create a Function object for " main " by modifying the call to #compile_exp in #compile_main :
@main = Function . new ( [ ] , [ ] ) compile_exp ( Scope . new ( self , @main ) , exp )
Time to test how it works :
prog = [ : do , [ : defun , : myputs , [ : foo ] , [ :puts , : foo ] ] , [ : myputs , " Demonstrating argument passing " ] , ]
Then :
$ ruby step7.rb > step7.s $ make step7 cc step7.s -o step7 $ ./step7 Demonstrating argument passing

Bacon Grease Dressing , Sawmill Gravy , Refried Beans , Fried Rice , Cornbread , and Corn Dawg Bites , and Mary 's Yorkshire Pudding .
What else ?
Here are some ideas !
Heat bacon grease in saucepan on medium heat .
When grease begins to simmer , stir in vinegar and sugar to taste .
Toss the lettuce and chopped green - tail onions together .
Remove grease mixture from heat and serve immediately to the side of the salad .
Garnish with crumbled bacon bits , if desired .
Gravy is very tricky to make .
For those of you who know how to make a roux , then , this will be easy .
( For you rednecks out there , a roux is a hot mixture of fat and flour -- I just recently found this out so I like to show off my new vocabulary to impress you . )
Anyway , this recipe will ( possibly ) serve about 4 or so people ( depending on how big and how hungry they are ) .
About 6 to 8 tablespoons hot grease ( preferably sausage drippings with pieces of sausage in it )
About 4 to 6 tablespoons self - rising flour ( or whatever you have )
Salt and pepper to taste
Milk ( about 2 or 3 cups )
The grease should be hot and in a large skillet and over medium heat .
( To help you measure : I let the grease cover the bottom of my 12 - inch skillet ) .
Add the flour ( the amount of flour should be about 3/ 4 the amount of the grease ) and bring to a hearty simmer and cook until the flour is golden .
If you undercook this , your roux will taste like flour and grease , yuck .
Season with salt and pepper .
When you are satisfied with the color of your roux , reduce the heat to low and slowly add your milk .
When I was growing up , we did n't have a lot of money and milk was expensive , so my Daddy would mix water with the milk .
You can do this or not .
Stir this mixture constantly , if you do n't you will have lumpy gravy and your family will never let you live it down ( like the time you left the guts in the turkey , right ? ) .
Bring this roux - milk mixture to a boil ; after simmering for about ten minutes or so , this mixture will firm up .
If it firms up too fast , remove it from the heat and add a little milk or water to thin .
Re-season it , and pour over Momma 's Biscuits .
The European Union was trying to secure a ceasefire in the pro-Russian enclave .
The United States and the EU sent a joint delegation to the region in a bid to halt the fighting , while Nato called for an immediate end to the clashes and for direct talks between Russia and Georgia .
If it ’s not one thing …it ’s another .
After all of the outcry about the autism and vaccine connection , we thought that replacing mercury as a preservative with thimerosal would make us safe .
Now , it turns out there could be another potential hazard .
Several studies published in medical journals have linked amalgam fillings to increased levels of bodily mercury and we all know what that means !
Mercury has been linked to a variety of serious health concerns .
Millions of Americans have cavity fillings made of amalgam , a blend of about 50 percent mercury , a neurotoxin , plus tin , silver and other metals .
( Fillings called “ silver ” are actually amalgam . )
Although they ’ve been widely used for more than 150 years , some people say amalgam fillings can emit mercury , causing damage to the brain , kidneys or nervous system .
As often happens it took a group of concerned citizens to force the FDA to reconsider its position on amalgam fillings .
A lawsuit brought by Moms against Mercury was recently settled and the FDA now has this statement on their website .
” … mercury in fillings “ may have neurotoxic effects on the nervous systems of developing children and fetuses . ”
It also states that “ Pregnant women and persons who may have a health condition that makes them more sensitive to mercury exposure , including individuals with existing high levels of mercury bioburden , should not avoid seeking dental care , but should discuss options with their health practitioner . ”
Thanks for watching out for us , guys !
For Parents and parents to be there are several issues .
First , should amalgam fillings be removed ?
It ’s not an easy or very environmentally friendly process as mercury from the fillings can end up in the sewer system and in landfills .
Many dentists do have a waste recycling program in place to prevent environmental damage , so ask yours about it .
If you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant , you might want to consider having old fillings removed .
If you or your children require new fillings consider getting tooth colored resin or porcelain ones .

Gasoline prices are still tumbling , the government reported Monday , while a steep drop in crude oil prices in New York futures trading could indicate that more relief for consumers is on the way .
The U.S. average price for a gallon of self - serve regular gasoline slid 7.5 cents to $ 3.88 , its lowest level since May 19 , according to the Energy Department ’s weekly survey of filling stations .
In California , the average fell 11.2 cents to $ 4.205 .
It was the seventh straight weekly decline for pump prices in the state , which peaked at $ 4.588 on June 1 .
Even with the recent declines , gas prices in California are almost $ 1.20 a gallon higher than a year ago .
On the New York Mercantile Exchange , meanwhile , crude for September delivery fell $ 3.69 a barrel , or 2.9 % , to $ 121.41 , its lowest close since May 5 .
It traded as low as $ 119.50 a barrel during the day ’s hectic session .

The drop in crude was part of a general decline in commodity prices , with natural gas , copper , gold , sugar , corn and other products closing lower .
Gasoline futures fell 2.6 % to a three - month low of $ 3 a gallon .
Analysts said further evidence that sky - high gas prices and the weak U.S. economy are reducing the demand for gasoline is trumping concerns about tensions over Iran ’s nuclear ambitions , renewed violence in Nigeria and the threat that Tropical Storm Edouard poses to the oil - producing areas in the Gulf of Mexico .
“ The thought awhile back was that demand was going to hold up pretty well in the face of higher prices , but it finally hit a wall , ” said analyst Brian Youngberg of brokerage Edward Jones in St. Louis .
In addition , speculative traders appear to be losing their appetite for oil , which is down more than 16 % from its top all - time close of $ 145.29 a barrel July 3 .

“ Speculation is a knife that cuts both ways , ” said Jim Ritterbusch , president of oil trading advisory firm Ritterbusch & Associates in Galena , Ill .
“ It forces prices to overshoot on the upside , but it also forces prices to overshoot on the downside .
We ’re probably going to see prices drop much further than people anticipate . ”
The situation in Iran is key , Ritterbusch said .
The United Nations is weighing more economic sanctions against Iran after the oil exporter indicated it had no plans to abandon its nuclear development program .
If the Iranian situation is resolved without a serious confrontation , crude prices “ could easily drop to $ 100 a barrel , ” Ritterbusch said , with gas prices retreating to $ 3.25 a gallon nationally .
Gasoline prices have lagged behind crude prices on the way down , falling about 8 % in California from the peak , about half the decline in oil futures .
Analysts said gas station owners and refiners saw their profits squeezed during the first half of the year when oil prices surged and they might be trying to make back some of that money now that oil prices are falling .

“ Gasoline did n’t rise as fast as oil on the way up , so I would n’t expect that it would fall as much on the way back down , ” said Edward Jones ’ Youngberg .
“ And the oil that ’s being priced today [ on the futures market ] is n’t going to reach the pumps for a while . ”
Demand for gasoline in the U.S. has fallen as much as 4 % from a year ago , said Andrew Lipow , president of Lipow Oil Associates in Houston .
The government said last month that , through May , the number of miles driven by Americans had fallen for seven straight months -- suggesting that U.S. road travel could see its first annual decline since 1980 .
Besides high pump prices , drivers also are coping with inflation , a weak stock market and continuing declines in housing prices , Lipow noted .
“ With all of those factors out there , I do n’t think consumers are getting ready to jump back in their cars ” despite the recent drop in gasoline , he said .

Demand is also falling in Europe and Asia , Lipow said .
China has drastically cut back on driving and other energy use in an effort to cut air pollution before the Olympics start in Beijing on Friday .
In addition , nearly 80 % of Chinese consumers surveyed by marketing researcher J.D. Power Asia Pacific said they were driving less in the wake of their government ’s decision in June to increase gasoline prices by 17 % , the firm said in a report released Monday .

ATLANTA , Aug. 21 ( UPI ) --
Two Georgia men who claimed to possess the body of a slain Sasquatch said the mythical beast was actually a Bigfoot costume filled with road kill .
Rick Dyer and Matt Whitton , a former police officer who was fired once the hoax was exposed , said the Bigfoot scam was a joke and they never intended their story to become as sensational as it did , WSBTV , Atlanta , reported Thursday .

" All this was a big joke .
It got into something way bigger than it was supposed to be , " Whitton said .
The men said the item they had claimed was Bigfoot 's corpse was actually nothing more than a costume filled with opossum road kill and leftovers from a slaughterhouse .
However , Whitton said he disagrees with Clayton County Police Department Chief Jeff Turner 's decision to fire him on the grounds that the hoax affects his credibility .
" I do n't believe it does affect my credibility at all because this is Bigfoot , " said Whitton .
" It would be one thing if I came out and said that I had something else that is tangible or real , but right now , as far as I 'm concerned , there is no real Bigfoot . "
ONE cannot speak about bailouts without addressing moral hazard concerns .
Tyler Cowen writes :
[ E]ven if nationalization is the right response this time , it might not be the next time a financial institution gets into fiscal trouble .
Yet in that subsequent case nationalization will be that much harder to avoid , given the understandable fears of private capital if nationalization happens this time .
Every time you nationalize and wipe out shareholders , you create a dangerous precedent and scare away private capital for a long time .
You are probably reading lots of absolutist recommendations around the blogosphere but these are truly difficult issues and the correct policy responses are not obvious .
This is the heart of the moral hazard argument — if you do it this time , markets will assume you 'll do it next time and take on excessive risk accordingly .
The response of those in favour of a bailout is two - fold .
First , because these GSEs are odd organisations , other firms should n't assume that the same rules would apply to them ( although the Bear Stearns fiasco suggests they might ) .
Second , regulations are sure to change significantly after all this is over , suggesting that next time wo n't look anything like this time .
The Federal Reserve and its partners in financial firefighting have added another bulwark against moral hazard — ensuring that firm bailouts punish shareholders as much as possible .
But this strategy comes with its own hazards .
Ricardo Caballero elaborates :
By punishing equity holders , the Treasury chose to hurt those that it had invited to stabilize the situation just a few hours earlier .
In doing so , it may have damaged its ability to leverage its policies with private capital support , a key aspect of policy success in dealing with a coordination failure problem .
Second , during periods of high uncertainty and the potential for runs , large or coordinated shortsellers are more likely to succeed in triggering socially inefficient panic - selling .
Rumor - mongering and persistent selling pressure eventually weaken wary investors and depositors .
Unfortunately , by choosing to punish shareholders , Secretary Paulson has rewarded shortsellers and raised their ammunition to cause further financial instability .
Again , while shortselling plays a very useful role during normal times , it can turn into a source of instability during periods of high uncertainty .
This is an interesting argument .
While the government 's punish - the - shareholders plan should encourage shareholder prudence , it might also mean that the mere whiff of crisis sends equity holders to the exits , thereby producing actual crisis .
Not exactly what Mssrs Bernanke and Paulson are after .
But is shareholder flight all that bad ?
Felix Salmon is n't so sure :
Clearly , we 're in a world where the biggest risks to the economy remain financial .
And it just so happens that there 's an easy and reasonably effective way of hedging those risks : shorting financial stocks .
Investors around the world who want to protect themselves against market - crisis risk are likely doing just that right now , helping to drive the price of those stocks downwards .
Which means that as the stocks of big banks fall , quite a few sensible investors are actually making money .
Not because they 're betting on Armageddon , but just because they understand the big risks and are hedging them accordingly .
Indeed , broad stock indices have been remarkably calm over the past few sessions , in the face of all the financial - sector craziness .
The share - price volatility in Fannie and Freddie over the past few sessions looks to me as though a hell of a lot of people are playing in those stocks , and that most of them are not buy - and - hold investors from years ago who are now finding themselves underwater .
Indeed , I 'm almost reassured by all this stock - price volatility .
Equity , sitting as it does at the top of the capital structure , is never going to be a safe place to be during a crisis .
But it just might be the case that the crazier the rollercoaster ride suffered by shareholders in Freddie Mac , the safer the rest of us can feel , if that rollercoaster ride is partly a consequence of prudent risk management elsewhere in the system .
In other words , the problem might not be panic selling , but rather an appropriate assessment of market risk .
On the other hand , the problem might be panic selling .
The real sticky issue seems to be that the Federal Reserve and the Treasury are often pulling in two different directions at once — attempting to prevent bank failures with one action while sending the message that shareholders in failing banks should get what they can when they can with other policies .
It 's interesting — most discussions of the moral hazard implications of Fed actions have focused on how those actions might determine behaviour in the next crisis .
In the end , concern might have been better focused on the implications for behaviour in subsequent months of the current crisis , which is still going strong one year on .
On Dec. 10 , 1974 , the U.S. National Security Council under Henry Kissinger completed a classified 200 - page study , “ National Security Study Memorandum 200 : Implications of Worldwide Population Growth for U.S. Security and Overseas Interests . ”
The study falsely claimed that population growth in the so - called Lesser Developed Countries ( LDCs ) was a grave threat to U.S. national security .
Adopted as official policy in November 1975 by President Gerald Ford , NSSM 200 outlined a covert plan to reduce population growth in those countries through birth control , and also , implicitly , war and famine .
Brent Scowcroft , who had by then replaced Kissinger as national security adviser ( the same post Scowcroft was to hold in the Bush administration ) , was put in charge of implementing the plan .
CIA Director George Bush was ordered to assist Scowcroft , as were the secretaries of state , treasury , defense , and agriculture .
The bogus arguments that Kissinger advanced were not original .
One of his major sources was the Royal Commission on Population , which King George VI had created in 1944 “ to consider what measures should be taken in the national interest to influence the future trend of population . ”
The commission found that Britain was gravely threatened by population growth in its colonies , since “ a populous country has decided advantages over a sparsely - populated one for industrial production . ”
The combined effects of increasing population and industrialization in its colonies , it warned , “ might be decisive in its effects on the prestige and influence of the West , ” especially effecting “ military strength and security .
” NSSM 200 similarly concluded that the United States was threatened by population growth in the former colonial sector .
It paid special attention to 13 “ key countries ” in which the United States had a “ special political and strategic interest ” : India , Bangladesh , Pakistan , Indonesia , Thailand , the Philippines , Turkey , Nigeria , Egypt , Ethiopia , Mexico , Brazil , and Colombia .
It claimed that population growth in those states was especially worrisome , since it would quickly increase their relative political , economic , and military strength .
For example , Nigeria : “ Already the most populous country on the continent , with an estimated 55 million people in 1970 , Nigeria ’s population by the end of this century is projected to number 135 million .
This suggests a growing political and strategic role for Nigeria , at least in Africa . ”
Or Brazil : “ Brazil clearly dominated the continent demographically . ”
The study warned of a “ growing power status for Brazil in Latin America and on the world scene over the next 25 years .
” Food as a weapon There were several measures that Kissinger advocated to deal with this alleged threat , most prominently , birth control and related population - reduction programs .
He also warned that “ population growth rates are likely to increase appreciably before they begin to decline , ” even if such measures were adopted .
A second measure was curtailing food supplies to targeted states , in part to force compliance with birth control policies :
“ There is also some established precedent for taking account of family planning performance in appraisal of assistance requirements by AID ( U.S. Agency for International Development ) and consultative groups .
Since population growth is a major determinant of increases in food demand , allocation of scarce PL 480 resources should take account of what steps a country is taking in population control as well as food production .
In these sensitive relations , however , it is important in style as well as substance to avoid the appearance of coercion . ” “ Mandatory programs may be needed and we should be considering these possibilities now , ” the document continued , adding , “ Would food be considered an instrument of national power ? ...
Is the U.S. prepared to accept food rationing to help people who can ’t / wo n’t control their population growth ? ” Kissinger also predicted a return of famines that could make exclusive reliance on birth control programs unnecessary .
“ Rapid population growth and lagging food production in developing countries , together with the sharp deterioration in the global food situation in 1972 and 1973 , have raised serious concerns about the ability of the world to feed itself adequately over the next quarter of a century and beyond , ” he reported .
The cause of that coming food deficit was not natural , however , but was a result of western financial policy : “ Capital investments for irrigation and infrastructure and the organization requirements for continuous improvements in agricultural yields may be beyond the financial and administrative capacity of many LDCs .
For some of the areas under heaviest population pressure , there is little or no prospect for foreign exchange earnings to cover constantly increasingly imports of food .
”
“ It is questionable , ” Kissinger gloated , “ whether aid donor countries will be prepared to provide the sort of massive food aid called for by the import projections on a long - term continuing basis . ”
Consequently , “ large - scale famine of a kind not experienced for several decades -- a kind the world thought had been permanently banished , ” was foreseeable -- famine , which has indeed come to pass .
( Executive Intelligence Review )
After much arm wrestling , the Senate came to an agreement on energy tax breaks which are set to expire later this year .
Both Sens. Max Baucus ( D - Mont. ) and Charles Grassley ( R - Iowa ) , of the Senate Finance Committee , made the announcement on Tuesday .
The tax package will provide $ 17 billion in renewable energy tax breaks .
It will also adjust the alternative minimum tax , extend tax credits for children and create several business tax cuts .
It will also set aside $ 7 billion in tax relief for those affected by recent floods and hurricanes .
The bill extends the solar and wind investment tax credit for eight years , and the production tax credit for biomass and hydropower for up to two years .
The definition of a system that would qualify for the credit has also been updated .
They now include small wind investment and geothermal heat pumps .
“ This month , the Senate can act to create jobs , break America ’s dependence on foreign oil , support working families , and help businesses thrive , ” said Baucus in a statement [ PDF ] .
“ This agreement will lead America toward clean , homegrown energy and the good - paying jobs that come with it . ”
In the past , how to fund these extensions has been quite messy .
Republicans have squawked at anything where oil industry tax breaks were affected and Democrats have insisted that the source funding be specified .
The compromise was to freeze tax breaks for oil and gas at the current rate , and to tighten the rules on taxes for the industry .
This will effect income earned by the companies in overseas markets .
The Oil Spill Liability
Trust fun was also adjusted .
Hopefully the bill will pass when voted upon .

The defeat in Congress of a proposed $ 700 billion economic - rescue package followed an intense outpouring of voter anger , fanned by politicians , interest groups and media on the left and right , that overwhelmed calls from the president and top lawmakers to pass the deal .
Voters opposed to the deal deluged Capitol Hill with letters , emails , phone calls and faxes over the past week .
Some 23,000 signatures were collected over two days by Sen. Bernie Sanders , a Vermont Independent , calling for a five - year , 10 % surtax on the wealthiest ...

HOUSTON ( Reuters ) - A
Texas school district will let teachers bring guns to class this fall , the district ’s superintendent said on Friday , in what experts said appeared to be a first in the United States .
The board of the small rural Harrold Independent School District unanimously approved the plan and parents have not objected , said the district ’s superintendent , David Thweatt .
School experts backed Thweatt ’s claim that Harrold , a system of about 110 students 150 miles northwest of Fort Worth , may be the first to let teachers bring guns to the classroom .
Thweatt said it is a matter of safety .
“ We have a lock - down situation , we have cameras , but the question we had to answer is , ‘ What if somebody gets in ?
What are we going to do ? ” he said .
“ It ’s just common sense . ”
Teachers who wish to bring guns will have to be certified to carry a concealed handgun in Texas and get crisis training and permission from school officials , he said .
Recent school shootings in the United States have prompted some calls for school officials to allow students and teachers to carry legally concealed weapons into classrooms .
The U.S. Congress once barred guns at schools nationwide , but the U.S. Supreme Court struck the law down , although state and local communities could adopt their own laws .
Texas bars guns at schools without the school ’s permission .
It 's not every day that the New York Times writes articles about the Domain Name System , but then again this DNS bug is anything but normal .
It 's been over five weeks now since Dan Kaminsky first announced the major flaw that he found in the DNS protocol .
Although most of the details of the bug have been public for a few weeks now , it was n't until last week at the Black Hat and Defcon conferences in Las Vegas that Kaminsky explained the depth of the issue .
As I listened to him describe the ways this bug can be exploited my heart dropped down into my stomach and I felt a little sick .
My friend was only half joking when he whispered to me " I 'm thinking about transferring to accounting . "
Yes , the bug is that bad .
Everyone should be paying attention to this one .
Fortunately , most of the big sites out there have been patched , for now .
But the current patch only buys us some time , it does n't actually fix the real problem .
In case you are just joining the party , the bug that Dan found can be used by an attacker to poison DNS records .
In other words , he can redirect your email , instant messages , website visits , or any other traffic that relies on DNS .
Which , of course , means all traffic .
Yes , that sounds scary , but it seems that most people do n't fully appreciate the degree to which this can be exploited .
Dan 's presentation made it crystal clear .
What This Means For You
Let 's start with a quote from George Kurtz , a VP at McAfee :
If you control the DNS servers , you control the Internet .
This exploit effectively grants control of the DNS servers to anyone clever enough to execute the attack .
When you control DNS you also control email .
And when you control email you also control , well , everything .
Email is Broken
Assume for a moment that I 've used this DNS exploit to take control of your email account .
The most obvious effect is that I can now read your mail .
Also , I can read your mail and continue forwarding it to you , so that you never realize there is a problem .
I can add attachments to your messages , or infect existing attachments from people you trust with viruses or malware .
When your best friend sends a link to you about that funny video on YouTube , well , I can rewrite that link to go anywhere I want .
Of course , we all know that nobody out there uses the Internet mail system to do harm , right ?
Just imagine , instead of getting normal annoying spam like you 've been seeing for years now , you also now have to worry about legitimate messages from your friends being the carriers of trouble .
So how else can I use email to my advantage ?
Kaminsky pointed out that almost every website out there relies on your email address to verify your identity .
Using the whois database I can find out who the administrative contact is for , say , microsoft.com and claim that email address .
Then I just browse to the website of the registrar for microsoft.com , click on the " forgot my password " link , and have the password for that account reset .
Since I 'm getting the email for that account , I 'll also get the link they send me that says " please click here to verify your new password . "
At that point I effectively own microsoft.com and can do whatever I want , including changing the contact email address , or transferring it to a different registrar .
Think about that the next time you see a " Forgot my password " link on a website .
SSL is Broken
Dan Kaminsky said that many people were pointing to SSL as a safety measure .
He told them they should be more cafeful .
After all , how does one go about registering a SSL certificate ?
Anyone is allowed to buy a certificate , but they must show some authoritity over the domain .
This authoritity is checked by the certificate authorities ( CA ) by using DNS , typically in one of three ways :
The CA looks up the domain via whois
The CA sends an email to an address they have on record
The CA checks for a specially named file on the website 's server
As Dan pointed out in his talk , all three of these methods rely on DNS , which we have poisoned .
Just because that site you are visiting uses SSL does n't mean it 's the site you think it is . :)
The Web is Broken
Ok , so enough about email .
Why else should you care ?
( as if that were n't enough already )
Well , how many sites do you think you visit that have the following code embedded in them ?
< script type =" text / javascript " src= " http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js "></script> < script type =" text / javascript " src= " http://partner.googleadservices.com/gampad/google_service.js "></script> < script src= " http://www.google-analytics.com/urchin.js " type =" text / javascript " ></ script > < script type=" text / javascript " > _uacct = " UA - XXXXXXX - 1 " ; urchinTracker ( ) ; </ script >
If I were to inject poisoned records into your DNS for pagead2.googlesyndication.com , partner.googleadservices.com , or www.google-analytics.com then I can execute javascript from any website you visit that uses Google Analytics or Google Adsense .
The same holds true for ad.doubleclick.net , developer.yahoo.com ( YUI ) , or any other site that serves commonly included scripts ( src= " ? " ) .
Desktop Apps are Broken
Kaminsky also pointed out that we have now entered an era where the Internet has expanded to the desktop .
Many applications are useless without an Internet connection , such as AIM / ICQ / Jabber / etc , iTunes , Skype and most popular games .
By poisoning the DNS entry for login.oscar.aol.com
I can intercept AIM messages for anyone who is using that DNS server .
The same holds for any other Desktop application that connects to the Internet .
Perhaps most worriesome are mechanisms for applying automatic updates .
Yes , this includes attacks on popular Linux package management systems such as apt - get and yum .
But it goes beyond that , and into systems that automatically update such as iTunes , Mac OS X , Open Office , Winzip , Winamp , and others .
Imagine what an attacker could accomplish if he could poison swquery .
apple.com and swscan.apple.com in Comcast 's DNS servers .
Mac OS X , as well as iTunes , periodically checks for software updates in the background , and pops up a notification if there are upgrades to be applied .
An attacker could push down any software update and the innocent user would never know the difference .
Everything Else is Broken , Too
Of course , these are just some of the reasons an attacker may want to poison DNS .
Kaminsky covers many more in his presentation , including CDN population , writing SSL cookies , and discovering internal addresses for databases , backup servers , and authentication services .
He specifically states that it is indeed possible to poison the top level domains , including com , net , and org .
That 's right , an attacker can intercept all DNS requests for .com .
This means that he not only gets to respond to your questions , but also find out what questions you are asking .
Those " private " DNS records are no longer private ( they never were , really ) .
The initial patch that the vendors released on July 8th has been deployed in most places by now , but again , it is only a temporary solution .
It just makes it harder for an attacker to poison DNS - it does n't make it impossible .
In fact , a Russian researcher named Evgeniy Polyakov has already demonstrated that it is possible to poison the latest patched BIND DNS server with two standard desktop PCs and a gigabit ethernet connection .
Instead of 10 seconds it took him 10 hours , and required a lot of traffic .
We are still in trouble , but this is the best we have for now .
ZAPOTLANEJO , Mexico -
Here in the heart of Mexico 's tequila country , where every town has a distillery and the air smells sweet like fermenting molasses , a sign proudly marks the entrance to Miguel Ram�rez 's farm : " Rancho Ram�rez : Producer of Agaves . "
But behind the fence , the blue - agave plants , the raw ingredient of Mexico 's most famous liquor , are getting harder to spot .
They are being replaced by row after row of leafy cornstalks .
Like other farmers in western Mexico , Ram�rez is abandoning his slow - growing agave plants to cash in on corn , beans and other food crops that are selling for record prices worldwide .
They are part of an international trend , as everyone from Idaho potato farmers to Bolivian coca growers cut back on their trademark crops in hopes of making big money on corn and grain .
" Corn is where the money is now , " Ram�rez said , admiring his new crop from the bed of a pickup truck .
" I 'm going to get out of agave completely . "
Mexico's Tequila Regulatory Council is worried that the corn gold rush is setting the stage for a shortage that could drive up tequila prices .
The effect on other crop prices is less clear .
Boom and bust
With white corn selling in Mexico for 18 cents a pound this month - its highest price in at least a decade - compared with as little as 2 cents for agave , the switch was probably inevitable , said Mart�n S�nchez , director of agriculture for the tequila council .
" We do n't have good numbers , but we know it is happening : People are abandoning their fields of agave and flipping over to other crops , " S�nchez said .
In many fields east of Guadalajara , overripe agave plants are turning brown and dropping their spikes .
Prices are so low that the crop is not worth harvesting , said Antonio Aceves , a farmer in the town of Tototl�n who cut his agave acreage this year to 25 from 74 .
Harvesting of agave is labor - intensive and would cost more than what he could earn from sales .
Aceves said the seeds of uncertainty in the agave market were sown in 1997 , when a frost killed millions of young plants .
By 2002 , agave prices had risen to a stunning 80 cents a pound .
Jos� Cuervo , Sauza , Herradura and other distillers were paying up to $ 100 for a single " pineapple , " or agave heart .
" You practically had to guard your field with an army , " Aceves said .
" A lot of people got rich , and suddenly , everybody was planting agave . "
The big tequila makers , meanwhile , became determined to avoid another shortage .
They began growing agave themselves on rented land and contracted with hard - nosed brokers to cover any shortfall , said Rafael Aldana , an officer of the farmers ' co-op in the town of El Arenal .
An agave plant takes five to seven years to mature , so farmers are now facing a glut of agave and no buyers .
About 25 of Aldana 's 35 acres of agave are ripe for the picking , he said .
" Nobody wants them , " he said .
" I 'll probably lose them all . "
Switching over
In a field near the town of Tequila , farmhand Raudel L�pez Sandoval navigated past the needle - sharp spines of an agave and stabbed the dirt with a pole .
He grabbed some beans from a plastic container on his waist and tossed them into the hole .
" Beans grow fast , " he said .
" You tend an agave for six years , and then the price drops on you or you get hit with a freeze or something .
It 's a lot of investment to lose . "
The price of beans in Mexico has risen 60 percent since December , to 59 cents a pound from 37 cents .
Corn , Mexico's other staple food , is up 24 percent , to 18 cents a pound .
At his feed store in Tototl�n , Guadalupe Salorio said sales of corn seed went up 20 percent this spring as agave farmers switched crops .
The rise in the price of food crops is an international trend as developing countries such as China and India begin to eat better , high oil prices raise the cost of fertilizer , and the United States and Europe divert corn and vegetable oils into refineries aimed at making alternative fuels .
As of June , world food costs had risen 62 percent since early 2006 , according to Oxford Economic Forecasting , a British consulting firm .
The worldwide price of cereals such as corn and wheat was up 120 percent .
Idaho potato farmers reduced their potato acreage by 10 percent this year in favor of corn , barley and wheat .
Indian cotton growers have planted 18 percent less than they did last year to make room for food crops .
In the American South , cotton planting was the lowest since 1983 as farmers switched to corn and soybeans , according to U.S. Department of Agriculture statistics .
In Bolivia , President Evo Morales , who long championed the growing of coca leaf for non -drug uses , is now urging coca growers to supplement their crops with rice and corn to help feed the Andean country .
The Chapare region 's union of coca growers is requiring each of its 35,000 members to plant 2 �1/ 2 acres of rice .
Corn prices were expected to ease slightly in the United States because of a bumper crop this year .
Nevertheless , the bonanza has accelerated a global trend toward raising fewer types of crops , putting the world 's food supply at greater risk in case of a disease or disaster , said Doreen Stabinsky , an agriculture expert at Greenpeace .
" It 's a whole problem of mentality , where you have millions of acres focused on producing just a few crops , " Stabinsky said .
" It 's been highly detrimental to crop diversity . "
A bounce back ?
Tequila officials , meanwhile , believe there could be an agave shortage on the horizon , S�nchez said .
" When the price of agave is low , people get demoralized and abandon their crops , " he said .
" There 's often a lack of good long - term planning . "
During the last agave shortage , in 2001 - 02 , makers of some premium tequilas raised prices by a few dollars a bottle .
Others began adding other types of alcohol to their products to stretch supplies .
Tequila has to contain only 51 percent of pure agave to carry the name .
Distillers already are preparing for leaner days by stockpiling finished tequila , he said .
And some growers have stopped weeding and spraying their older agave plants , devoting their attention to younger plants in hopes that the price will bounce back .
Rafael Murillo is one of the optimists .
On a hill outside Tequila , he used a sickle to whack away at weeds around some 3 - year - old agave plants , their blue spines now thigh - high .
" The mature agaves are a lost cause , " Murillo said .
" But I 'm not going to become a corn farmer yet .
These little ones still have a future . "

I had some amazing comments left here by Alan Kay himself .
Alan Kay ( for those who have n't been paying attention ) is the father of smalltalk , pioneer of Object - Oriented Programming ( plus dynamic programming , message - based programming , gui-environments and much more ) , 2003 Turing Award Winner ... he 's a visionary without whom there 'd likely be no windows in MS Windows ( or Macs ) , no ' one laptop per child ' program and many more things besides all that .
Alan from Tron ?
Based on Alan Kay .
Seriously .
Alan 's writing -- even in comment form -- is so perfectly crafted that I thought i'd move it into its own post , and turn some of the words into hyperlinks , and added two [ bracketed ] notes .
Personally i've discounted it as poorly conducted research -- but it had a lot of resonance with readers at the time .
Something I 'd love to know is what does Alan Kay think of this ( draft ) paper from 2006 , ' The Camel has Two Humps ' ?
( also discussed at Coding Horror )
I saw this a few years ago .
They could be right , but there is nothing in the paper that substantiates it .
( How to do a short reply here ? )
Notion 1 : Good science can rarely be pulled off in an environment with lots of degrees of freedom unless the cause and effect relationships are really simple .
Trying to assess curricula , pedagogy , teaching , and the learners all at once has lots of degrees of freedom and is * not* simple .
So for example we 've found it necessary to test any curriculum idea over three years of trials to try to normalize as much as possible to get a good ( usually negative ) result .
Notion 2 : Most assessments of students wind up assessing almost everything but .
This is the confusions of " normal " with " reality " .
For example , in our excursions into how to help children learn powerful ideas , we observed many classrooms and got some idea of " what children could do " .
Then I accidentally visited a first grade classroom ( we were concerned with grades 3 - 6 ) in a busing school whose demographic by law was representative of the city as a whole .
However , every 6 year old in this classroom could really do math , and not just arithmetic but real mathematical thinking quite beyond what one generally sees anywhere in K - 8 [ kindergarten and grades 1 through 8 ] .
This was a huge shock , and it turned out that an unusual teacher was the culprit .
She was a natural kindergarten and first grade teacher who was also a natural mathematician .
She figured out just what to do with 6 year olds and was able to adapt other material as well for them .
The results were amazing , and defied all the other generalizations we and others had made about this age group .
This got me to realize that it would be much better to find unusual situations with " normal " populations of learners but with the 1 in a million teacher or curriculum .
I found Tim Gallwey , who could teach anyone ( literally ) how to play a workable game of tennis in 20 minutes , and observed him do this with many dozens of learners over several years .
I found Betty Edwards who could teach ( again literally ) anyone to draw like a 2nd year art student in one intense week .
And so forth , because what the exceptional teaching is doing is actually allowing assessment of what general human beings from a typical bell curve can learn from crafted instruction .
And , I think some of the keys here are in the metaphor of bell curve .
Students will exhibit distributions of talent , motivation , learning skills , style , etc. , and one will see these show up right away in any simple - minded form of instruction and curriculum .
But if the battle cry is " Learner 's First " , then what we really want to know is what can be done to help the different types of learners .
Some do n't need any help .
Some need to learn some things before they tackle the main subject .
Some need to be shown different POVs so they can see a route for them to learn .
Really good teachers want to get all the students to be fluent , and they often find ways to do this .
" Regular " teachers often just want to get through the material .
Some school systems want to use education to sort the population rather than to educate the whole population .
Etc .
I do n't know the general answers here , but our research groups in the mid-70s [ presumably the Learning Research Group at Xerox Parc ] set a goal of 90 % fluency for ( say ) 10 - 12 year olds , and then we proceeded to fail to achieve this until about 1998 , when enough things had been done in the computer environment to provide hooks to many different kinds of children without losing the essential high quality of powerful ideas that was our goal .
I think as a teacher , one has to embrace the bell curve idea and be prepared to deal with at least three tiers of preparedness in the students .
One could hope that a lot more general prep about thinking and symbolizing would have happened in K - 12 , but it does n't in the US for sure .
There has been some very interesting work with respect to science teaching that seems parallel here ( for example , by Tinker and others at Tufts ) .
They not only found a pretest ( could they interpret various kinds of graphs ? ) that would predict the grades of the 1st year physic students , but found that teaching the kids skills in doing well on the pretest ( using some very creative ideas that Jerome Bruner would find familiar ) would also vastly improve their performance in the physics class itself .
So the pretest was not just testing , but also finding some forms of relational and figurative thinking that some of the students needed skills in , before tackling physics .
I think every musician who is reading this will know what I 'm driving at here .
Music is a lot of skills and types of thinking and few musicians are naturally good at all of them .
The desire to be a musician plus decent music instructors will find the things each learner will need to work on to get fluent .
The result is that most skilled musicians can play advanced stuff , but they are all rather different on their outlook , how they practice , what they practice , etc .
( Sports and art also ... and almost certainly the more holy subjects sanctified by society , and those pretenders to the throne such as computing ....)
Cheers ,
Alan
PART THREE
LIFE IN CHRIST
SECTION TWO
THE TEN COMMANDMENTS
CHAPTER TWO
" YOU SHALL LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR AS YOURSELF "
ARTICLE 5
THE FIFTH COMMANDMENT
54 You shall not kill .
You have heard that it was said to the men of old , " You shall not kill : and whoever kills shall be liable to judgment . "
But I say to you that every one who is angry with his brother shall be liable to judgment .
55
2258 " Human life is sacred because from its beginning it involves the creative action of God and it remains for ever in a special relationship with the Creator , who is its sole end .
God alone is the Lord of life from its beginning until its end : no one can under any circumstance claim for himself the right directly to destroy an innocent human being .
"
56
I. RESPECT FOR HUMAN LIFE
The witness of sacred history
2259
In the account of Abel 's murder by his brother Cain,57 Scripture reveals the presence of anger and envy in man , consequences of original sin , from the beginning of human history .
Man has become the enemy of his fellow man .
God declares the wickedness of this fratricide : " What have you done ?
The voice of your brother 's blood is crying to me from the ground .
And now you are cursed from the ground , which has opened its mouth to receive your brother 's blood from your hand .
"
58
2260 The covenant between God and mankind is interwoven with reminders of God 's gift of human life and man 's murderous violence :
For your lifeblood I will surely require a reckoning .
. . .
Whoever sheds the blood of man , by man shall his blood be shed ; for God made man in his own image .
59
The Old Testament always considered blood a sacred sign of life .
60 This teaching remains necessary for all time .
2261 Scripture specifies the prohibition contained in the fifth commandment : " Do not slay the innocent and the righteous . " 61 The deliberate murder of an innocent person is gravely contrary to the dignity of the human being , to the golden rule , and to the holiness of the Creator .
The law forbidding it is universally valid : it obliges each and everyone , always and everywhere .
2262 In the Sermon on the Mount , the Lord recalls the commandment , " You shall not kill , " 62 and adds to it the proscription of anger , hatred , and vengeance .
Going further , Christ asks his disciples to turn the other cheek , to love their enemies .
63
He did not defend himself and told Peter to leave his sword in its sheath .64
Legitimate defense
2263 The legitimate defense of persons and societies is not an exception to the prohibition against the murder of the innocent that constitutes intentional killing .
" The act of self - defense can have a double effect : the preservation of one 's own life ; and the killing of the aggressor .
. . .
The one is intended , the other is not .
"
65
2264 Love toward oneself remains a fundamental principle of morality .
Therefore it is legitimate to insist on respect for one 's own right to life .
Someone who defends his life is not guilty of murder even if he is forced to deal his aggressor a lethal blow :
If a man in self - defense uses more than necessary violence , it will be unlawful : whereas if he repels force with moderation , his defense will be lawful .
. . .
Nor is it necessary for salvation that a man omit the act of moderate self - defense to avoid killing the other man , since one is bound to take more care of one 's own life than of another's .
66
2265 Legitimate defense can be not only a right but a grave duty for one who is responsible for the lives of others .
The defense of the common good requires that an unjust aggressor be rendered unable to cause harm .
For this reason , those who legitimately hold authority also have the right to use arms to repel aggressors against the civil community entrusted to their responsibility .
2266 The efforts of the state to curb the spread of behavior harmful to people 's rights and to the basic rules of civil society correspond to the requirement of safeguarding the common good .
Legitimate public authority has the right and duty to inflict punishment proportionate to the gravity of the offense .
Punishment has the primary aim of redressing the disorder introduced by the offense .
When it is willingly accepted by the guilty party , it assumes the value of expiation .
Punishment then , in addition to defending public order and protecting people 's safety , has a medicinal purpose : as far as possible , it must contribute to the correction of the guilty party .
67
2267 Assuming that the guilty party 's identity and responsibility have been fully determined , the traditional teaching of the Church does not exclude recourse to the death penalty , if this is the only possible way of effectively defending human lives against the unjust aggressor .
If , however , non-lethal means are sufficient to defend and protect people 's safety from the aggressor , authority will limit itself to such means , as these are more in keeping with the concrete conditions of the common good and more in conformity to the dignity of the human person .
Today , in fact , as a consequence of the possibilities which the state has for effectively preventing crime , by rendering one who has committed an offense incapable of doing harm - without definitely taking away from him the possibility of redeeming himself - the cases in which the execution of the offender is an absolute necessity " are very rare , if not practically nonexistent .
"
68
Intentional homicide
2268 The fifth commandment forbids direct and intentional killing as gravely sinful .
The murderer and those who cooperate voluntarily in murder commit a sin that cries out to heaven for vengeance .
69
Infanticide,70 fratricide , parricide , and the murder of a spouse are especially grave crimes by reason of the natural bonds which they break .
Concern for eugenics or public health cannot justify any murder , even if commanded by public authority .
2269
The fifth commandment forbids doing anything with the intention of indirectly bringing about a person 's death .
The moral law prohibits exposing someone to mortal danger without grave reason , as well as refusing assistance to a person in danger .
The acceptance by human society of murderous famines , without efforts to remedy them , is a scandalous injustice and a grave offense .
Those whose usurious and avaricious dealings lead to the hunger and death of their brethren in the human family indirectly commit homicide , which is imputable to them .71
Unintentional killing is not morally imputable .
But one is not exonerated from grave offense if , without proportionate reasons , he has acted in a way that brings about someone 's death , even without the intention to do so .
Abortion
2270 Human life must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of conception .
From the first moment of his existence , a human being must be recognized as having the rights of a person - among which is the inviolable right of every innocent being to life .
72
73 Before I formed you in the womb I knew you , and before you were born I consecrated you .
My frame was not hidden from you , when I was being made in secret , intricately wrought in the depths of the earth.74
2271 Since the first century the Church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion .
This teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable .
Direct abortion , that is to say , abortion willed either as an end or a means , is gravely contrary to the moral law :
75 You shall not kill the embryo by abortion and shall not cause the newborn to perish .
God , the Lord of life , has entrusted to men the noble mission of safeguarding life , and men must carry it out in a manner worthy of themselves .
Life must be protected with the utmost care from the moment of conception : abortion and infanticide are abominable crimes .
76
2272 Formal cooperation in an abortion constitutes a grave offense .
The Church attaches the canonical penalty of excommunication to this crime against human life .
" A person who procures a completed abortion incurs excommunication latae sententiae , " 77 " by the very commission of the offense , " 78 and subject to the conditions provided by Canon Law.79
The Church does not thereby intend to restrict the scope of mercy .
Rather , she makes clear the gravity of the crime committed , the irreparable harm done to the innocent who is put to death , as well as to the parents and the whole of society .
2273 The inalienable right to life of every innocent human individual is a constitutive element of a civil society and its legislation :
" The inalienable rights of the person must be recognized and respected by civil society and the political authority .
These human rights depend neither on single individuals nor on parents ; nor do they represent a concession made by society and the state ; they belong to human nature and are inherent in the person by virtue of the creative act from which the person took his origin .
Among such fundamental rights one should mention in this regard every human being 's right to life and physical integrity from the moment of conception until death .
" 80 " The moment a positive law deprives a category of human beings of the protection which civil legislation ought to accord them , the state is denying the equality of all before the law .
When the state does not place its power at the service of the rights of each citizen , and in particular of the more vulnerable , the very foundations of a state based on law are undermined .
. . .
As a consequence of the respect and protection which must be ensured for the unborn child from the moment of conception , the law must provide appropriate penal sanctions for every deliberate violation of the child 's rights .
"
81
2274 Since it must be treated from conception as a person , the embryo must be defended in its integrity , cared for , and healed , as far as possible , like any other human being .
Prenatal diagnosis is morally licit , " if it respects the life and integrity of the embryo and the human fetus and is directed toward its safe guarding or healing as an individual .
. . .
It is gravely opposed to the moral law when this is done with the thought of possibly inducing an abortion , depending upon the results : a diagnosis must not be the equivalent of a death sentence .
"
82
2275 " One must hold as licit procedures carried out on the human embryo which respect the life and integrity of the embryo and do not involve disproportionate risks for it , but are directed toward its healing the improvement of its condition of health , or its individual survival . " 83 " It is immoral to produce human embryos intended for exploitation as disposable biological material . " 84 " Certain attempts to influence chromosomic or genetic inheritance are not therapeutic but are aimed at producing human beings selected according to sex or other predetermined qualities .
Such manipulations are contrary to the personal dignity of the human being and his integrity and identity " 85 which are unique and unrepeatable .
Euthanasia
2276 Those whose lives are diminished or weakened deserve special respect .
Sick or handicapped persons should be helped to lead lives as normal as possible .
2277 Whatever its motives and means , direct euthanasia consists in putting an end to the lives of handicapped , sick , or dying persons .
It is morally unacceptable .
Thus an act or omission which , of itself or by intention , causes death in order to eliminate suffering constitutes a murder gravely contrary to the dignity of the human person and to the respect due to the living God , his Creator .
The error of judgment into which one can fall in good faith does not change the nature of this murderous act , which must always be forbidden and excluded .
2278 Discontinuing medical procedures that are burdensome , dangerous , extraordinary , or disproportionate to the expected outcome can be legitimate ; it is the refusal of " over- zealous " treatment .
Here one does not will to cause death ; one 's inability to impede it is merely accepted .
The decisions should be made by the patient if he is competent and able or , if not , by those legally entitled to act for the patient , whose reasonable will and legitimate interests must always be respected .
2279 Even if death is thought imminent , the ordinary care owed to a sick person cannot be legitimately interrupted .
The use of painkillers to alleviate the sufferings of the dying , even at the risk of shortening their days , can be morally in conformity with human dignity if death is not willed as either an end or a means , but only foreseen and tolerated as inevitable Palliative care is a special form of disinterested charity .
As such it should be encouraged .
Suicide
2280 Everyone is responsible for his life before God who has given it to him .
It is God who remains the sovereign Master of life .
We are obliged to accept life gratefully and preserve it for his honor and the salvation of our souls .
We are stewards , not owners , of the life God has entrusted to us .
It is not ours to dispose of .
2281 Suicide contradicts the natural inclination of the human being to preserve and perpetuate his life .
It is gravely contrary to the just love of self .
It likewise offends love of neighbor because it unjustly breaks the ties of solidarity with family , nation , and other human societies to which we continue to have obligations .
Suicide is contrary to love for the living God .
2282 If suicide is committed with the intention of setting an example , especially to the young , it also takes on the gravity of scandal .
Voluntary co-operation in suicide is contrary to the moral law .
Grave psychological disturbances , anguish , or grave fear of hardship , suffering , or torture can diminish the responsibility of the one committing suicide .
2283 We should not despair of the eternal salvation of persons who have taken their own lives .
By ways known to him alone , God can provide the opportunity for salutary repentance .
The Church prays for persons who have taken their own lives .
II .
RESPECT FOR THE DIGNITY OF PERSONS
Respect for the souls of others : scandal
2284 Scandal is an attitude or behavior which leads another to do evil .
The person who gives scandal becomes his neighbor 's tempter .
He damages virtue and integrity ; he may even draw his brother into spiritual death .
Scandal is a grave offense if by deed or omission another is deliberately led into a grave offense .
2285 Scandal takes on a particular gravity by reason of the authority of those who cause it or the weakness of those who are scandalized .
It prompted our Lord to utter this curse : " Whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin , it would be better for him to have a great millstone fastened round his neck and to be drowned in the depth of the sea .
" 86 Scandal is grave when given by those who by nature or office are obliged to teach and educate others .
Jesus reproaches the scribes and Pharisees on this account : he likens them to wolves in sheep 's clothing .
87
2286 Scandal can be provoked by laws or institutions , by fashion or opinion .
Therefore , they are guilty of scandal who establish laws or social structures leading to the decline of morals and the corruption of religious practice , or to " social conditions that , intentionally or not , make Christian conduct and obedience to the Commandments difficult and practically impossible .
"
88 This is also true of business leaders who make rules encouraging fraud , teachers who provoke their children to anger ,89 or manipulators of public opinion who turn it away from moral values .
2287 Anyone who uses the power at his disposal in such a way that it leads others to do wrong becomes guilty of scandal and responsible for the evil that he has directly or indirectly encouraged .
" Temptations to sin are sure to come ; but woe to him by whom they come !
"
90
Respect for health
2288 Life and physical health are precious gifts entrusted to us by God .
We must take reasonable care of them , taking into account the needs of others and the common good .
Concern for the health of its citizens requires that society help in the attainment of living - conditions that allow them to grow and reach maturity : food and clothing , housing , health care , basic education , employment , and social assistance .
2289
If morality requires respect for the life of the body , it does not make it an absolute value .
It rejects a neo -pagan notion that tends to promote the cult of the body , to sacrifice everything for it 's sake , to idolize physical perfection and success at sports .
By its selective preference of the strong over the weak , such a conception can lead to the perversion of human relationships .
2290 The virtue of temperance disposes us to avoid every kind of excess : the abuse of food , alcohol , tobacco , or medicine .
Those incur grave guilt who , by drunkenness or a love of speed , endanger their own and others ' safety on the road , at sea , or in the air .
2291 The use of drugs inflicts very grave damage on human health and life .
Their use , except on strictly therapeutic grounds , is a grave offense .
Clandestine production of and trafficking in drugs are scandalous practices .
They constitute direct co-operation in evil , since they encourage people to practices gravely contrary to the moral law .
Respect for the person and scientific research
2292 Scientific , medical , or psychological experiments on human individuals or groups can contribute to healing the sick and the advancement of public health .
2293 Basic scientific research , as well as applied research , is a significant expression of man 's dominion over creation .
Science and technology are precious resources when placed at the service of man and promote his integral development for the benefit of all .
By themselves however they cannot disclose the meaning of existence and of human progress .
Science and technology are ordered to man , from whom they take their origin and development ; hence they find in the person and in his moral values both evidence of their purpose and awareness of their limits .
2294
It is an illusion to claim moral neutrality in scientific research and its applications .
On the other hand , guiding principles cannot be inferred from simple technical efficiency , or from the usefulness accruing to some at the expense of others or , even worse , from prevailing ideologies .
Science and technology by their very nature require unconditional respect for fundamental moral criteria .
They must be at the service of the human person , of his inalienable rights , of his true and integral good , in conformity with the plan and the will of God .
2295 Research or experimentation on the human being cannot legitimate acts that are in themselves contrary to the dignity of persons and to the moral law .
The subjects ' potential consent does not justify such acts .
Experimentation on human beings is not morally legitimate if it exposes the subject 's life or physical and psychological integrity to disproportionate or avoidable risks .
Experimentation on human beings does not conform to the dignity of the person if it takes place without the informed consent of the subject or those who legitimately speak for him .
2296 Organ transplants are in conformity with the moral law if the physical and psychological dangers and risks to the donor are proportionate to the good sought for the recipient .
Organ donation after death is a noble and meritorious act and is to be encouraged as a expression of generous solidarity .
It is not morally acceptable if the donor or his proxy has not given explicit consent .
Moreover , it is not morally admissible to bring about the disabling mutilation or death of a human being , even in order to delay the death of other persons .
Respect for bodily integrity
2297 Kidnapping and hostage taking bring on a reign of terror ; by means of threats they subject their victims to intolerable pressures .
They are morally wrong .
Terrorism threatens , wounds , and kills indiscriminately ; it is gravely against justice and charity .
Torture which uses physical or moral violence to extract confessions , punish the guilty , frighten opponents , or satisfy hatred is contrary to respect for the person and for human dignity .
Except when performed for strictly therapeutic medical reasons , directly intended amputations , mutilations , and sterilizations performed on innocent persons are against the moral law.91
2298 In times past , cruel practices were commonly used by legitimate governments to maintain law and order , often without protest from the Pastors of the Church , who themselves adopted in their own tribunals the prescriptions of Roman law concerning torture .
Regrettable as these facts are , the Church always taught the duty of clemency and mercy .
She forbade clerics to shed blood .
In recent times it has become evident that these cruel practices were neither necessary for public order , nor in conformity with the legitimate rights of the human person .
On the contrary , these practices led to ones even more degrading .
It is necessary to work for their abolition .
We must pray for the victims and their tormentors .
Respect for the dead
2299
The dying should be given attention and care to help them live their last moments in dignity and peace .
They will be helped by the prayer of their relatives , who must see to it that the sick receive at the proper time the sacraments that prepare them to meet the living God .
2300
The bodies of the dead must be treated with respect and charity , in faith and hope of the Resurrection .
The burial of the dead is a corporal work of mercy ; 92 it honors the children of God , who are temples of the Holy Spirit .
2301 Autopsies can be morally permitted for legal inquests or scientific research .
The free gift of organs after death is legitimate and can be meritorious .
The Church permits cremation , provided that it does not demonstrate a denial of faith in the resurrection of the body .
93
III .
SAFEGUARDING PEACE
Peace
2302 By recalling the commandment , " You shall not kill , " 94 our Lord asked for peace of heart and denounced murderous anger and hatred as immoral .
Anger is a desire for revenge .
" To desire vengeance in order to do evil to someone who should be punished is illicit , " but it is praiseworthy to impose restitution " to correct vices and maintain justice .
"
95
If anger reaches the point of a deliberate desire to kill or seriously wound a neighbor , it is gravely against charity ; it is a mortal sin .
The Lord says , " Everyone who is angry with his brother shall be liable to judgment .
"
96
2303 Deliberate hatred is contrary to charity .
Hatred of the neighbor is a sin when one deliberately wishes him evil .
Hatred of the neighbor is a grave sin when one deliberately desires him grave harm .
" But I say to you , Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you , so that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven . "
97
2304 Respect for and development of human life require peace .
Peace is not merely the absence of war , and it is not limited to maintaining a balance of powers between adversaries .
Peace cannot be attained on earth without safeguarding the goods of persons , free communication among men , respect for the dignity of persons and peoples , and the assiduous practice of fraternity .
Peace is " the tranquillity of order .
" 98
Peace is the work of justice and the effect of charity .
99
2305 Earthly peace is the image and fruit of the peace of Christ , the messianic " Prince of Peace .
" 100 By the blood of his Cross , " in his own person he killed the hostility , " 101 he reconciled men with God and made his Church the sacrament of the unity of the human race and of its union with God .
" He is our peace . " 102 He has declared : " Blessed are the peacemakers .
" 103
2306 Those who renounce violence and bloodshed and , in order to safeguard human rights , make use of those means of defense available to the weakest , bear witness to evangelical charity , provided they do so without harming the rights and obligations of other men and societies .
They bear legitimate witness to the gravity of the physical and moral risks of recourse to violence , with all its destruction and death .
104
Avoiding war
2307 The fifth commandment forbids the intentional destruction of human life .
Because of the evils and injustices that accompany all war , the Church insistently urges everyone to prayer and to action so that the divine Goodness may free us from the ancient bondage of war .
105
2308 All citizens and all governments are obliged to work for the avoidance of war .
However , " as long as the danger of war persists and there is no international authority with the necessary competence and power , governments cannot be denied the right of lawful self - defense , once all peace efforts have failed .
" 106
2309
The strict conditions for legitimate defense by military force require rigorous consideration .
The gravity of such a decision makes it subject to rigorous conditions of moral legitimacy .
At one and the same time :
- the damage inflicted by the aggressor on the nation or community of nations must be lasting , grave , and certain ;
- all other means of putting an end to it must have been shown to be impractical or ineffective ;
- there must be serious prospects of success ;
- the use of arms must not produce evils and disorders graver than the evil to be eliminated .
The power of modem means of destruction weighs very heavily in evaluating this condition .
These are the traditional elements enumerated in what is called the " just war " doctrine .
The evaluation of these conditions for moral legitimacy belongs to the prudential judgment of those who have responsibility for the common good .
2310 Public authorities , in this case , have the right and duty to impose on citizens the obligations necessary for national defense .
Those who are sworn to serve their country in the armed forces are servants of the security and freedom of nations .
If they carry out their duty honorably , they truly contribute to the common good of the nation and the maintenance of peace .
107
2311 Public authorities should make equitable provision for those who for reasons of conscience refuse to bear arms ; these are nonetheless obliged to serve the human community in some other way .
108
2312 The Church and human reason both assert the permanent validity of the moral law during armed conflict .
" The mere fact that war has regrettably broken out does not mean that everything becomes licit between the warring parties .
" 109
2313 Non-combatants , wounded soldiers , and prisoners must be respected and treated humanely .
Actions deliberately contrary to the law of nations and to its universal principles are crimes , as are the orders that command such actions .
Blind obedience does not suffice to excuse those who carry them out .
Thus the extermination of a people , nation , or ethnic minority must be condemned as a mortal sin .
One is morally bound to resist orders that command genocide .
2314 " Every act of war directed to the indiscriminate destruction of whole cities or vast areas with their inhabitants is a crime against God and man , which merits firm and unequivocal condemnation .
" 110 A danger of modern warfare is that it provides the opportunity to those who possess modern scientific weapons especially atomic , biological , or chemical weapons - to commit such crimes .
2315 The accumulation of arms strikes many as a paradoxically suitable way of deterring potential adversaries from war .
They see it as the most effective means of ensuring peace among nations .
This method of deterrence gives rise to strong moral reservations .
The arms race does not ensure peace .
Far from eliminating the causes of war , it risks aggravating them .
Spending enormous sums to produce ever new types of weapons impedes efforts to aid needy populations ; 111 it thwarts the development of peoples .
Over - armament multiplies reasons for conflict and increases the danger of escalation .
2316 The production and the sale of arms affect the common good of nations and of the international community .
Hence public authorities have the right and duty to regulate them .
The short - term pursuit of private or collective interests cannot legitimate undertakings that promote violence and conflict among nations and compromise the international juridical order .
2317 Injustice , excessive economic or social inequalities , envy , distrust , and pride raging among men and nations constantly threaten peace and cause wars .
Everything done to overcome these disorders contributes to building up peace and avoiding war :
Insofar as men are sinners , the threat of war hangs over them and will so continue until Christ comes again ; but insofar as they can vanquish sin by coming together in charity , violence itself will be vanquished and these words will be fulfilled : " they shall beat their swords into plowshares , and their spears into pruning hooks ; nation shall not lift up sword against nation , neither shall they learn war any more .
" 112
IN BRIEF
2318 " In [ God 's ] hand is the life of every living thing and the breath of all mankind " ( Job 12:10 ) .
2319 Every human life , from the moment of conception until death , is sacred because the human person has been willed for its own sake in the image and likeness of the living and holy God .
2320 The murder of a human being is gravely contrary to the dignity of the person and the holiness of the Creator .
2321 The prohibition of murder does not abrogate the right to render an unjust aggressor unable to inflict harm .
Legitimate defense is a grave duty for whoever is responsible for the lives of others or the common good .
2322 From its conception , the child has the right to life .
Direct abortion , that is , abortion willed as an end or as a means , is a " criminal " practice ( GS 27 § 3 ) , gravely contrary to the moral law .
The Church imposes the canonical penalty of excommunication for this crime against human life .
2323 Because it should be treated as a person from conception , the embryo must be defended in its integrity , cared for , and healed like every other human being .
2324 Intentional euthanasia , whatever its forms or motives , is murder .
It is gravely contrary to the dignity of the human person and to the respect due to the living God , his Creator .
2325 Suicide is seriously contrary to justice , hope , and charity .
It is forbidden by the fifth commandment .
2326 Scandal is a grave offense when by deed or omission it deliberately leads others to sin gravely .
2327 Because of the evils and injustices that all war brings with it , we must do everything reasonably possible to avoid it .
The Church prays : " From famine , pestilence , and war , O Lord , deliver us . "
2328 The Church and human reason assert the permanent validity of the moral law during armed conflicts .
Practices deliberately contrary to the law of nations and to its universal principles are crimes .
2329 " The arms race is one of the greatest curses on the human race and the harm it inflicts on the poor is more than can be endured " ( GS 81 § 3 ) .
2330 " Blessed are the peacemakers , for they shall be called sons of God " ( Mt 5:9 ) .
Scientists Put Exercise
In A Pill
To supplement these drugs we are going to need pills that plant memories of a cross-country hike or perhaps memories of a river rafting trip .
Two compounds make mice boost their treadmill performance .
While GW1516 enhances the effects of exercise AICAR eliminates the need .
Time to tune in , turn on , and drop exercise pills .
Howard Hughes Medical Institute researchers have identified two drugs that mimic many of the physiological effects of exercise .
The drugs increase the ability of cells to burn fat and are the first compounds that have been shown to enhance exercise endurance .
Both drugs can be given orally and work by genetically reprogramming muscle fibers so they use energy better and can contract repeatedly without fatigue .
In laboratory experiments , mice taking the drugs ran faster and longer than normal mice on treadmill tests .
Animals that were given AICAR , one of the two drugs , ran 44 percent longer than untreated animals .
The second compound , GW1516 , had a more dramatic impact on endurance , but only when combined with exercise .
Ronald M. Evans , the Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator who led the study , said drugs that mimic exercise could offer potent protection against obesity and related metabolic disorders .
They could also help counter the effects of devastating muscle - wasting diseases like muscular dystrophy .
Evans and his colleagues , who are at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies , published their findings on July 31 , 2008 , in an advance online publication in the journal Cell .
Concerned about the potential for abuse of the two performance - enhancing drugs , Evans has also developed a test to detect the substances in the blood and urine of athletes who may be looking for way to gain an edge on the competition .
Exercise will still be needed for the development of better coordination .
But cardiovascular conditioning and muscle build - up really should n't take so much time out of our busy lives .
Besides , why use real exercise when drugs can do a better job of making your body fit ?
After four weeks of treatment with AICAR , Evans and his colleagues once again challenged sedentary mice to run on the treadmill .
They found that mice that had received AICAR were able to run 44 percent longer than untreated mice .
" This is a drug that is like pharmacological exercise , " Evans says .
" After four weeks of receiving the drug , the mice were behaving as if they 'd been exercised . "
In fact , he says , those that got the drug actually ran longer and further than animals that received exercise training .

Jackson and Timberlake caused controversy with their half - time show
A US appeal court has thrown out a $ 550,000 ( £ 275,700 ) fine against CBS for screening Janet Jackson's " wardrobe malfunction " during 2004 's Super Bowl .
Three judges ruled the Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) watchdog " acted arbitrarily and capriciously " in levying the fine .
Some 90 million viewers saw a fleeting glimpse of the singer 's breast during a performance at half - time .
About 542,000 complaints were received by broadcaster CBS .
Jackson was performing alongside Justin Timberlake when the incident happened .
As he sang the line " gonna have you naked by the end of this song " , he reached for Jackson 's bra .
She covered herself up before the lights dimmed , during a performance seen by millions of families as part of American TV 's highest - rated broadcast of the year .
CBS was flooded with complaints as soon as the footage was screened .
Apologies
The network , producers MTV and Timberlake all apologised , insisting the move had not been intentional .
But the fine was imposed in September 2004 and was the largest ever handed to a US television broadcaster .
The FCC fined 20 CBS - owned TV stations the maximum penalty for indecency - $ 27,500 ( £ 13,780 ) - each .
CBS appealed against the decision , however .
The court said the FCC had traditionally fined broadcasters for indecent material only when it amounted to " shock treatment " for viewers .
In this case , the footage - lasting " nine - sixteenths of a second " - was too brief to merit such a penalty , it added .
" The FCC cannot impose liability on CBS for the acts of Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake , independent contractors hired for the limited purposes of the half - time show , " wrote the chief judge on the panel , Anthony Scirica .
The FCC had argued the move was arranged in advance and said CBS should have been prepared to censor such a graphic image .
No statement on the ruling has yet been issued by CBS or the FCC .
Finally we have a Django 1.0 roadmap and timeline .
Jacob Kaplan - Moss posted today on Django devolopers I must say this roadmap seems very realistic and the only thing that I will miss is the aggregation support , that is promised to be released in a future version , maybe in 1.1 .
WASHINGTON 
After four years pursuing one former Army scientist on a costly false trail , F.B.I. agents investigating the deadly anthrax letters of 2001 finally zeroed in last year on a different suspect : another Army scientist from the same biodefense research center at Fort Detrick in Frederick , Md .
Over the last 18 months , even as the government battled a lawsuit filed by the first scientist , Steven J. Hatfill , investigators built a case against the second one , Bruce E. Ivins , a highly respected microbiologist who had worked for many years to design a better anthrax vaccine .
Last weekend , after learning that federal prosecutors were preparing to indict him on murder charges , Dr. Ivins , a 62 - year - old father of two , took an overdose of Tylenol with codeine .
He died in a Frederick hospital on Tuesday , leaving behind a grieving family and uncertainty about whether the anthrax mystery had finally been solved .
The apparent suicide of Dr. Ivins , a Red Cross volunteer and amateur juggler who had won the Defense Department ’s highest civilian award in 2003 , was a dramatic turn in one of the largest criminal investigations in the nation ’s history .
The attack , the only major act of bioterrorism on American soil , came in the jittery aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks .
It killed five people , sickened 17 others and set off a wave of panic .
My friend recently had a baby girl and she told me about the costs for a normal pregnancy and delivery .
To say the least I was a bit flabbergasted that over $ 25000 was charged for a delivery with no complications .
Since I want to have children in the future , I did a bit of research into the financial preparations one can do for a baby 's arrival .
Hopefully this will be helpful for all the potential parents out there .
1. Health insurance coverage -
If you do have health insurance you could still end up paying quite a bit out of pocket depending on what happens during delivery and what type of insurance you have .
You should definitely check the policy for what your out of pocket expenses are for hospital stays and major surgery in case of a C - section .
If your work has multiple insurance options it is possible to switch into a slightly more expensive policy that covers more during a pregnancy and subsequent delivery .
If you do not have health insurance and you are pregnant then it is very hard to buy insurance since insurance companies treat pregnancy as a pre-existing condition .
However , it is possible for pregnant American women to apply for Medicaid before delivery .
Any insurance is better than none since a delivery could cost anywhere from $ 10000 to $ 30000 .
Additionally , a newborn is very susceptible to disease so having medical coverage for the baby is very important .
2 . Set up a flexible spending account if available - Flexible spending accounts allow you to contribute pre-tax money from your paychecks and pay for medical expenses or dependant care .
The only disadvantage is that you must spend what you put into the account within the " Benefit Period " or lose the money you put in .
The Benefit Period begins January 1st and ends March 15th of the following year .
The great thing about flexible spending accounts is that the full amount you intend to contribute over the year is available for your use immediately even if the year is not over .
So for example , if I tell my employer that I need to set aside $ 2000 next year , that entire $ 2000 would be available to me on January 1st even though I have not had any paycheck deductions .
This is especially beneficial for expectant mothers who intend to quit working after the birth of a child since they could use the entire amount set aside by the employer for hospital expenses and not return to work to pay it back .
That money is also not taxed as income
3 . Pay off major debts - Once a baby arrives most families ' expenses go up so it would be harder to pay off debts .
I do not think that people necessarily have to pay off every cent of debt they have before having a baby , but paying off as much debt as possible before a kid arrives could relieve quite a bit of stress later .
4 . Do not shop too much for the baby before it is born -
This is some advice I got from moms I know .
Quite a few women said to me that babies grow so fast that buying every cute outfit out there is a waste of money .
It is much cheaper to ask for old clothes from friends and relatives who also had babies .
For example , one woman got bags full of baby clothes from a sister in law who had a baby a year prior .
Another piece of advice I got was that newborns do not really need toys or shoes so money is better spent on more useful things like bottles and diapers .
It is also a good idea to stock up on a variety of diapers during sales before the baby is delivered since inflation will make everything more expensive a year or two down the road .
5 . Life and disability insurance -
The general accepted advice is to buy term life insurance for yourself before you have a child so it protects your child in case you die before his or her adulthood .
For more about choosing a life insurance policy , Julie Rains wrote a good article about term and whole insurance here .
She also wrote about why you do not need to buy life insurance for your child .
6 . Raise your income if you need to -
Do you need more income to support a new addition to the family ?
If so , it is probably best to find ways to earn more money before the baby arrives .
This could mean asking for a raise , finding a better paying job , or setting up a income generating side business .
Once a child arrives you may find that being a new parent is stressful enough without additional money making pursuits .
7. Housing -
Many families buy a new house or rent a bigger place before or during pregnancy , but that may not be the best thing to do if the cost of the new space is unaffordable or much higher than before .
Babies do not need that much space before they start walking so there is time to search for larger housing after delivery .
You could save thousands of dollars by delaying the housing upgrade by a few months or years .
8. Prepare for leave from work - Most American companies do not have very generous maternity or paternity leaves , but most employees can take a 12 week unpaid leave to bond with a child under the Family and Medical Leave Act without losing their jobs .
Since the leave is unpaid you need to figure out if you have enough cash to cover the leave .
Also it is important to inform your manager a few months before you go so that you can train someone to fill in for you while you are on leave .
9. Childcare -
This is something that needs to be thought about before the baby arrives .
Who will take care of the child ?
Will one parent stay at home ?
This is probably the most important thing to figure out before the baby arrives .
One thing is for sure , good childcare is never cheap .
A child is an incredible responsibility , and a bit of planning goes a long way .
This is not an exhaustive list of the financial preparations new parents should be aware of before welcoming a baby , but it is a start .
After a child is born there are many other financial concerns such as paying for college and adding them as beneficiaries to your will and retirement accounts .
Anyway , I think parenting never really ends , but being financially prepared from the start will give you more time with your child .
What would you add to this list ?
Feel free to give advice to future parents in the comments !
Enlarge Google
With the " add name tags " feature , names are tied to photos for sorting .
You can match a name to a face and then later call up photos of certain people .
ADDING NAME TAGS ADDING NAME TAGS
To get started face - tagging your friends and family : Upload pictures to Picasa Web albums at picasaweb.google.com , either directly or using Google 's Picasa desktop software ( Windows only ) .
Once the photos are there , click on the " add name tags " button to organize them by face .
It 's your job now to type in " Dad " for pictures of your father , " Julie " for a girlfriend , etc .
With the identification in place , Picasa should be able to identify these folks next time you upload fresh pictures .
But in USA TODAY tests , that rarely happened .
Instead , a second collection of Dad or Julie images came up that had to be tagged .
You can put the collections together by going to the " People " tab .
Click the two " Dad " collections and look for the " merge " button above to get them into the same group .
One of the big selling points of the photo - recognition feature is to be able to organize an instant slideshow of those photos .
How to do it :
Go back to the People tab , select the " Dad " and " Julie " collections and click the Slideshow button .
Drawbacks :
The slideshow feature can't be saved or posted on the Web .
Only you , and the friends crowding around your computer , can see it .
If you do n't want to spend time categorizing your photos , Picasa Web Albums is n't for you .
Google 's advanced technology is only as good as the information it receives .
It ca n't keep people identified if you do n't take the time to do the identifying .
By Jefferson Graham
If the human brain sees a million images per day and can instantly identify them , why could n't software do that , too ?
Making such a thing a reality has been the longtime goal of German - born physicist Hartmut Neven , whose facial - recognition software firm was purchased by Google in 2006 , with the stated goal of bringing his vision to digital photography .
Instead of sifting through thousands of computer file names and badly named photo folders , what if we could organize our pictures by faces instead , gathering all of our pictures of Mom , Dad and the rest of the brood together ?
Neven joined forces with Google 's Picasa photo editing and management software team , spending two years developing a tool that could bring photo facial recognition to the masses .
Now the software is here , and Google is winning raves for its accuracy .
It 's not perfect , as Google engineers point out , but it 's still a major step forward .
" I find it interesting to understand how the human mind works , " says Neven , who now works at Google as a lead technical manager .
" How it is so adept and capable at learning .
And the best way to teach the theory on brain functions is to write a program that 's quite similar . "
Google 's face - recognition system ties into Picasa Web Albums , Google 's online photo - sharing service .
It 's one of the search giant 's smaller offerings .
Web Albums had just a 3.4 % share of the online photo market in August , according to researcher Hitwise , ranking No. 5 . Market leader Photobucket had a 34.7 % share .
Google recently upgraded its Picasa desktop photo- editing application with faster uploading tools .
Face recognition , however , happens on the Web .
After uploading pictures to Web Albums , you simply click the " add name tag " feature .
A group of 200 shots from your family vacation , for instance , will be broken into groups based on the faces — 60 of Dad , 40 of Mom , etc .
Just match names with faces
Your job is to match the name to the face by typing in their names .
The idea is that , after each face has been identified and tagged you could use the information to , say , call up a group of photos of brother and Mom together , or you with a specific group of friends , and make an instant slideshow .
" What we 're doing is taking measurements , " says Mike Horowitz , the Google product manager who oversees Picasa .
" We 're looking at the special elements of the face — where the eyes and nose are , for instance , and trying to make a prediction . "
Chris Chute , an analyst at researcher IDC , says photo recognition is something consumers will latch onto , because it solves a growing problem .
" We 're taking more pictures than ever before , because we can , and the ability to organize them is up to the user , " he says .
Since many people do n't like to take the time , " Anything that makes it easier for them will be greatly appreciated . "
Privacy a concern Facial - recognition applications are a growing phenomenon .
Authorities in Germany and England are testing computerized facial recognition in conjunction with new biometric passports .
Passengers go through security and deal with computers , instead of humans .
But can computers be trusted ?
How much do we want them to know about us ?
In the Tom Cruise film Minority Report , a computer spits out personalized ads directed at the character everywhere he turns .
Google has been a frequent target of criticism on privacy issues , and tech bloggers have weighed in on the new face - tagging feature .
" I do n't like it at all , " says Rob Williams , who blogs for the Techgage website .
" Google knows what I search for , where I live and how much time I spend on websites .
Now they know what my friends look like , too .
That 's just too much . "
Horowitz says the tagging feature is " opt - in , " so only people who choose to use the feature do so .
" Turn face tagging off , and all the data goes away . "
For a scientist like Neven , there 's no such thing as too much information .
Before joining Google , Neven taught computer science at University of Southern California , then started his own company , which became Neven Vision .
" We were a start - up and had to make money , so we turned to Europe , where cellphones were more advanced , and worked with brand marketers , " he says .
His goal was to use software to recognize billboards and other objects .
He worked toward getting snapshots from cellphones to return information about the product .
In one European promotion for Coca - Cola , people were asked to take a quick camera phone shot of a Coke can for instant registration in a sweepstakes .
At Google , Neven would like to see his software advance to the point where it can eliminate many of the mundane uploading tasks camera hobbyists now encounter .
For instance , once the application learned the faces you regularly photograph ( like your spouse and kids ) , you would not have to manually tag photos when you transfer them from a camera to your computer — the software would do that for you .
" We want to make it increasingly automatic and seamless , " he says .
It 's not there yet — but it will be , promises Neven .

U.S. Rep. Jim Marshall , a Democrat serving his third term in Congress , represents Georgia 's 8th Congressional District .
He serves on the House Armed Services and Agriculture Committees .
Jim Marshall says he 's put his career in the House on the line to pass bailout legislation .
( CNN ) --
My family does n't use credit much .
We pay off our charge cards every month .
We drive used cars .
We paid off our house mortgage early and have not refinanced .
We carefully live well within our means .
In fact , until very recently , my " apartment " in Washington has been my office .
I 'm pretty well - known as a cheapskate .
So when I said recently that I would be willing to give up my seat in Congress in order to pass the financial rescue package , it turned some heads .
It 's because I understand what 's at stake and because I hope to be a part of reforming our financial system so that we do n't have these problems again .
iReport.com : Do you support a Wall Street bailout ?
I have spent my career as a business , finance and bankruptcy law professor and lawyer .
I have helped individuals and institutions get out of financial trouble .
More important , I have studied ways to make sure they do n't get into trouble in the first place -- and drag all of us down with them .
Some politicians -- and a few economists -- would say that America is drunk on credit and just needs to go cold turkey .
But it 's more accurate to say we 're addicted to credit .
Too much credit .
Good credit , bad credit , anything that lets us live the high life .
We have mistaken growth in the value of financial paper for real economic growth .
Getting clean will not be so easy .
When credit is quickly withdrawn , everyone in the business of lending panics .
Credit becomes scarce and is not available at a reasonable interest rate .
Institutions that need to use credit daily start to fall like dominoes .
The financial fallout -- bank failures , risking a stock market crash , worthless retirement and pension funds -- could kill us .
We need to reduce our dependence on credit gradually but steadily and with no excuses .
Deep down , we all know that a financial rescue is necessary .
I voted for the plan that was defeated today because , to paraphrase Rep. Spencer Bachus , I 'm unwilling to play Russian roulette with the financial lives of my children and grandchildren .
Although the bill was imperfect and wildly unpopular , I believed that those of us in Congress needed to suck it up , vote for it and let the chips fall where they may .
But the plan has failed .
I hope the economists who have warned of an imminent collapse are wrong .
To paraphrase Franklin Roosevelt , what we have to fear is fear itself .
If people can take a deep breath and avoid an immediate panic , it is my hope that we can improve this plan and still act in time to save our financial future .
iReport.com : Bailout fails , Americans win
My own strong preference is that it focus less on acquiring mortgage - backed securities and be more of a tightly focused effort to minimize foreclosures and home vacancies that drive down property values for all of us .
For these non-prime mortgage notes , I would give bankruptcy courts the power to modify mortgage payments to make them more realistic .
I would limit the pay of not only top Wall Street executives but the traders who made millions by making this problem worse .
I hope we can get a plan that includes at least some of those elements .
But most important , we need a bill that can attract enough support to pass .
Then the hard work begins , and that is the work I want to be a part of in the months ahead : Making sure this does n't happen again .
That 's why you run for office , or at least why I did .
If I have not , in fact , given up my seat because of my vote , I 'll be back to work on that myself .

According to Robert Hicks , Master Blender at the Ardmore distillery , scientific analysis of scotch has uncovered over 800 chemical compounds that affect the flavor of the whiskey .
While some of those chemicals exist in only small quantities ( the iodine flavor chemical makes up only 5 parts per billion in Laphroaig ) , their impact on the taste can be immense .
However , despite all the technology available to distillers , most still test their scotch the old fashioned way .
" There 's a lot of analysis that 's done at the lab , " said Brookings , " but for us down in the distillery , we still like to do it by taste . "
WORTH , Ill. , Sept. 17 ( UPI ) -- Police in Worth , Ill. , say a man 's vehicle sank into Cal - Sag Channel after he attempted to back his rear tires into the water to determine if there was a leak .
Authorities said the man backed his sports utility vehicle down a boat ramp at about 7 p.m.
Tuesday in an effort to pinpoint whether one of his tires was leaking .
However , when he exited the vehicle it rolled into the water , the Chicago Tribune reported Wednesday .

A friend of the man who arrived on the scene to bring him dry clothes said the man got soaked trying to re-enter the SUV to press on the brake .
Firefighters from at least seven departments showed up and the SUV was pulled from its resting place about 10 feet off the end of the ramp .
The vehicle was out of the water by 9 p.m. , authorities said .
" He feels very stupid , " the friend said of the driver .
A recent Gallup poll had Obama leading McCain by 10 points among postgraduate - educated voters and tied among the college - educated .
Barack Obama 's new map
Between flaps over bullets in Bosnia and bitterness in Pennsylvania , discussion of the Democratic nominating battle largely overlooks the real strategic difference in the race .
Sen .
Hillary Rodham Clinton is steering her campaign by the same map Democrats have followed for 16 years , aiming to rally mostly large coastal and Midwestern states .
Sen . Barack Obama thinks the map can be redrawn , swinging swaths of red states onto the blue side .
Clinton is struggling to hold the shrinking Eastern industrial states and aging working - class voters , holdovers from the old Democratic coalition .
Obama ’s new map reflects the appeal to rising social groups —
Westerners , nonwhites and the well - educated — of his post - partisan call for unity and change .
Their contest is more than a face - off of individuals ; it is a confrontation between the Democratic Party ’s past and future .

The contrast was obvious in maps published by SurveyUSA last month , after a poll of 600 voters in every state pitting Obama and Clinton against Sen.
John McCain , the presumptive Republican nominee .
When the two Democrats ’ electoral votes were tallied , they were close : Obama had 280 , and Clinton had 276 — both just over the winner ’s line ( 270 ) .
But their maps looked quite different .
Clinton ’s looked like that of every Democratic nominee since Bill Clinton in 1992 , dominated by their party ’s coastal enclaves : California and the Northeast and the Midwest .
She picked up big states Obama lost — Pennsylvania , New Jersey and Florida — and some smaller ones : West Virginia and Arkansas , the Clintons ’ previous home state .
But Obama painted the West bright blue , sweeping all three Pacific Coast states , New Mexico , Nevada , Colorado , Minnesota , Iowa and even reliably Republican North Dakota .
He also held most of the Northeast , picked up Virginia and outdid Clinton in the Midwest by taking Michigan .
Obama was hot on McCain ’s heels in red states where Clinton was way behind , such as Nebraska , South Dakota , Alaska , North Carolina and even Texas .
Now , after six weeks of Democratic fratricide , Obama and Clinton both run worse against McCain than they did in the SurveyUSA poll , but subsequent polls show similar patterns .
Three factors underpin Obama ’s new electoral map : the West , nonwhites and the well - educated .
Fast - growing Western states have become a land of opportunity for Democrats .
The GOP ’s social conservatism and support for Big Business have irked longtime libertarians , non-fundamentalist newcomers and environmentally conscious voters .
This helped swing a region , which until recently was solidly Republican , to the Democrats .
For instance , in the Mountain West , where Republicans held every statehouse in 2000 , five of eight governors are now Democrats .
They and their supporters are a particular sort of Democrat : green and tolerant but also pro-gun and anti-tax .
Obama ’s more moderate , less statist emphasis — like his non-compulsory health plan — resonates with these voters , for whom the more conventionally liberal Clinton is radioactive .
Indeed , libertarian Republican columnist Ryan Sager writes that , in the West , “ Republicans have one hope : Hillary Clinton .
Nonwhite voters ’ soaring numbers and turnout explain another part of the difference between Obama ’s and Clinton ’s maps .
Extraordinary black support in the SurveyUSA poll gave Virginia to Obama , as when Doug Wilder became the nation ’s first black governor two decades ago , and put both Carolinas within his reach , as well .
But massive Latino mobilization — which helped Clinton in the primary — could benefit Obama in the general election .
In Texas , Hispanics ’ primary turnout jumped fivefold this year compared with 2004 and was overwhelmingly for Democrats , stimulated by Republican anti-immigrant talk .
Their support , along with a large black turnout for Obama , nudged Texas just 1 percent away from falling into the Democratic column for the first time since 1976 .
Well - educated Americans are the third prop for Obama ’s new map .
Democratic consultant Mark Gersh said , “ The biggest thing that happened in 2006 was the final movement of upper - income , well - educated , largely suburban voters to the Democrats , which started in 1992 . ”
Obama ’s support this year confirmed this .
A recent Gallup poll had Obama leading McCain by 10 points among postgraduate - educated voters and tied among the college - educated , with McCain ahead only among the high - school - educated .
( The opposite was true for Clinton :
The only group where she led McCain was high - school - educated voters . )
The swelling ranks of the highly educated help explain Obama ’s strength in the Northeast , college towns and knowledge - economy centers such as Washington state and Columbus , Ohio .
The differing characters of the candidacies also help define their maps .
Clinton ’s is a base - vote campaign , much like those Karl Rove designed for George W. Bush .
Her aim is to mobilize party loyalists and just enough extra voters to eke out victory .
Her map reflects her reliance on remnants of the Franklin D. Roosevelt coalition , particularly older blue - collar voters in large Eastern and industrial states .
Yet her dependence on such declining groups , along with her polarizing impact on voters beyond the base , handicaps her against a post - partisan like McCain , a master at outreach to independents , marginal Democrats and voters west of the Mississippi .
Obama , in contrast , is a post - partisan candidate who speaks to young millennials and others frustrated with the confrontational , gridlocked politics of the past two decades .
Each of his key Democratic groups —
Westerners , blacks and Latinos , and the educated — is in the ascendant .
Yet Obama ’s unifying rhetoric also lets him compete with McCain for the center .
Moreover , his appeal across many small states actually helps him , since electoral votes require fewer popular votes in less populous states than in big ones .
Of course , Obama may fail to draw his new map come November .
He may be so bruised by Clinton or savaged by the Republicans that he loses his crossover appeal to whites and independents .
McCain ’s moderate immigration stance may peel away Latinos wary of voting for a black candidate .
Or a first - time campaigner ’s gaffe , like Obama ’s April 11 remark about “ bitter ” voters clinging to guns and faith , may lead him to a fall .
Obama has shown that Democrats have another way to win , without Clinton / Rove - style trench warfare or sweeping all the big industrial states .
In doing this , he has revealed the future of the Democratic Party .

Astronomers looking at galaxies in the universeâ€™s distant past were surprised to find some compact , very young galaxies that have masses similar to a mature , grown - up galaxy .
Using the Hubble Space Telescope , astronomers discovered nine small galaxies , each weighing in at 200 billion times the mass of the Sun .
The galaxies , each only 5,000 light - years across , are a fraction of the size of today ’s adult galaxies but contain approximately the same number of stars .
Each galaxy could fit inside the central hub of our Milky Way Galaxy .
Using the Hubble in conjunction with Keck Observatory in Hawaii , astronomers were able to study the galaxies as they existed 11 billion years ago , when the Universe was less than 3 billion years old .
â€ œSeeing the compact sizes of these galaxies is a puzzle ” , said Pieter G. van Dokkum of Yale University in New Haven , Connecticut , USA , who led the study .
“ No massive galaxy at this distance has ever been observed to be so compact .
These galaxies would have to change a lot over 11 billion years , growing five times bigger .
They could get larger by colliding with other galaxies , but such collisions may not be the complete answer .
It is not yet clear how they would build themselves up to become the large galaxies we see today.â€ 
To determine the sizes of the galaxies , the team used the Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer on Hubble .
For the Keck observations , a powerful laser was used to correct for image blurring caused by the Earth ’s atmosphere .
Only Hubble , Keck and ESOâ€™s Very Large Telescope are really able to measure the sizes of these galaxies as they are very small and far away .
The ultra - dense galaxies might comprise half of all galaxies of that mass 11 billion years ago , van Dokkum said , forming the building blocks of todayâ€™s largest galaxies .
How did these small , crowded galaxies form ?
One way , suggested van Dokkum , involves the interaction of dark matter and hydrogen gas in the nascent Universe .
Dark matter is an invisible form of matter that accounts for most of the Universeâ€™s mass .
Shortly after the Big Bang , the Universe contained an uneven landscape of dark matter .
Hydrogen gas became trapped in pockets of the invisible material and began spinning rapidly in dark matterâ€™s gravitational whirlpool , forming stars at a furious rate .
Based on the galaxiesâ€™ mass , which is derived from their color , the astronomers estimated that the stars are spinning around their galactic disks at roughly 400 to 500 kilometers per second .
Stars in todayâ€™s galaxies , by contrast , are traveling at about half that speed because they are larger and rotate more slowly than the compact galaxies .
The astronomers say that these galaxies are ideal targets for the Wide Field Camera 3 , which is scheduled to be installed aboard Hubble during upcoming Servicing Mission 4 in the fall of 2008 .

A three - dimensional view of variable winds in the cloud layers on Venus
18 September 2008
A team of astronomers , led by Agustin Sánchez - Lavega from Universidad del Pais Vasco , has used spectral images recorded with VIRTIS between April 2006 and June 2007 to track and study cloud features over the entire southern hemisphere of Venus .
These clouds probe the winds in the thick cloud and haze layers that encircle the entire planet at altitudes between 30 and 70 km .
The study was performed by examining cloud features in pairs of images taken between 20 and 74 minutes apart .
The evolution of the cloud features between each image provided a measure of their location as a function of time .
From this the zonal and meridional wind speeds were derived .
Multi-wavelength spectral images from VIRTIS can be used to probe different altitudes in the thick cloud layers of Venus .
In their study , Sánchez - Lavega and colleagues probed three different altitude ranges using the three wavelengths : 0.38 µm , 0.98 µm and 1.74 µm ( see Table 1 ) .
Lambda
( μm ) Altitudes
( km ) Atmospheric Region No. of clouds
Tracked 0.38 62-70
Top of upper cloud layer 625 0.98 58-64
Base of upper cloud layer 662 1.74 44-48 Lower cloud layer 932
Observed wind speeds
Figure 2 shows the mean wind speed as a function of latitude for both the zonal wind and meridional wind as derived from the observed cloud features .
The values are temporally and spatially averaged over narrow latitude bins .
Each plot shows the wind speed variation at the three different altitude ranges : 62 -70 km ( blue ) , 58 - 64 km ( purple ) and 44 - 48 km ( red ) .
Spatial variations
Altitudes
( km ) Mean Zonal
wind speed ( m/s ) 62-70 - 102 ± 10 58-64 - 62 ± 10 44-48 - 60 ± 10
Clearly visible is the fast westward zonal rotation ( known as super - rotation ) of the upper cloud deck with an average speed of 102 ms - 1 between 0° and ~ 55° southern latitude .
In the other two altitude ranges the same westward wind is present , but with a substantially lower wind speed ( table 2 ) .
This implies there is a large shear between adjacent altitude layers mainly in the upper cloud deck and from the equator down to ~55°S .
At higher southern latitudes the zonal wind speeds drop linearly and steadily toward the pole for all three altitudes .
In addition , at these latitudes the difference between the wind speeds in the three altitude ranges diminishes as all layers start to co-rotate coherently with the large polar vortex .
The meridional wind speed was found to vary little with latitude .
Taking account of the measurement uncertainties it is only at the top of the upper cloud deck that a trend is observed with an increase from ~0 to ~ 10 ms - 1 , peaking at the latitude 55 °S ( Figure 2B , blue curve ) .
Temporal variations
The long time span covered by the observations allowed the team to investigate the temporal variation of the measured wind speed .
There was some indication of variation in the speed of the zonal wind as a function of latitude and in the 58 - 64 km altitude range .
It was ~ 13 ms - 1 faster at the start of observations ( in April 2006 ) compared to the average over the entire observation period .
This variation , however , needs to be confirmed with further measurements .
A more pronounced effect found in the course of the study by Sánchez - Lavega and colleagues was a strong dependency on wind speeds with local solar time .
Between the morning and mid-afternoon the zonal wind speed increased by about 10 ms - 1 .
This effect only occurred in the top cloud layers and only at the higher latitudes ( above 50°S ) .
Overall , the results reported in Sánchez - Lavega et al , when combined with measurements of the Venusian wind speeds obtained with other spacecraft , confirm a sharp change in the zonal circulation at ~ 55 degrees latitude .
Ongoing observations with Venus Express will help to determine if the observed mean wind speeds are stable and typical for Venus , and will further characterise the nature and variations of the mean zonal winds in the cloud layers .

Piracy is a complex problem without easy solutions .
In the UK , a group of game publishers have banded together to intimidate pirates into coughing up cash or heading to court .
This RIAA - style tactic , targeting the end user , has proven unpopular and unprofitable for the music industry in the United States and has paid mixed dividends at best .
Peter Moore , the head of EA Sports , is openly critical of this approach , while id Software 's Todd Hollenshead actually thinks piracy is a " benefit " to PC hardware manufacturers .
Hal Halpin , the head of the Entertainment Consumer Association , has yet to take a stand one way or the other .
Welcome to the quagmire of gaming piracy .
Peter Moore is blunt .
" If we learned anything from the music business , they just do n't win any friends by suing their consumers , " he told Eurogamer .
" Speaking personally , I think our industry does not want to fall foul of what happened with music . "
Moore takes piracy seriously , but does n't have many ideas for an effective weapon against it .
He does , however , know what he does n't like .
" I 'm not a huge fan of trying to punish your consumer .
Albeit these people have clearly stolen intellectual property , I think there are better ways of resolving this within our power as developers and publishers , " Moore said .
" I think there are better solutions than chasing people for money .
I 'm not sure what they are , other than to build game experiences that make it more difficult for there to be any value in pirating games . "
EA actually has some plans in that direction , including free , microtransaction - based games like Battlefield Heroes and of course MMOs like Warhammer Online , games that are functionally impervious to piracy .
The question is : do PC users see the ability to pirate games as a reason to choose that platform for gaming ?
That 's a very debatable position , but id Software 's Todd Hollenshead seems to think that hardware companies do n't mind piracy all that much .
" I think that there 's been this dirty little secret among hardware manufacturers , which is that the perception of free content — even if you 're supposed to pay for it on PCs — is some sort hidden benefit that you get when you buy a PC , like a right to download music for free or a right to download pirated movies and games , " he told GamesIndustry .
There is perhaps some truth to this assertion : gamers may not mind spending top - dollar on the best components if they think they can get all the content they want for free .
One important contact we wanted to speak to for this story was Hal Halpin , the founder of the ECA — an advocacy group that stands up for the rights of gamers .
With publishers in the UK beginning to threaten users , and the ESA hiring executives from the RIAA , surely he would have some thoughts on what this could mean for American gamers in the future .
Unfortunately , his reply to Ars was brief , and somewhat curt .
" Unfortunately , ECA has yet to take a public position on piracy , which is itself a very complex and encompassing issue .
As for the ESA , we cannot comment on their hiring practices or policies . "
This is a disappointing answer from an important figure in gaming .
These attitudes and insights show just how divisive , but important , the issue of piracy has become for gaming .
It often seems like it comes down to three approaches when dealing with pirates : either ignore them , listen to them , or sue them .

Crapo Comments on the Nomination of Amy Coney Barrett to be Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court
近年では、体の様々な箇所のムダ毛を脱毛する男性が増えています。特に、多いのが髭脱毛です。髭は濃い人だと一日に一回、薄い人でも数日に一回と定期的に剃る必要があります。永久脱毛で髭が生えないようにするだけで今まで面倒に感じていた髭の手入れにかかる手間やストレスから開放されます。
今回は、髭脱毛の施術は一回で効果が得られるのか、ツルツルになるまでに必要となる施術回数等を紹介します。
髭脱毛で主流となっている二種類の脱毛方法
現在、髭脱毛で主流となっているのが「レーザー脱毛」と「フラッシュ脱毛」の二種類です。どちらも、脱毛したい箇所に光を照射して肌の奥にある毛乳頭にダメージを与える事で脱毛効果を得るといった共通点があります。
また、それぞれの脱毛方法にしかないメリットも存在するので、自分に合った脱毛方法を選びましょう。
レーザー脱毛にしかないメリット
レーザー脱毛は、フラッシュ脱毛よりも高い出力の光を照射する事が可能です。医院やクリニックといった医療機関しか施術が行えないという特徴があります。施術前の診察・カウンセリングから施術まで医師の方に担当してもらえます。
さらに、施術に使用している脱毛機器が医療機器だったりと高い安全性が魅力となっています。また、施術後に痛みや熱っぽさ等の違和感が出た場合は、すぐに診察を行い適切な治療を受けられます。高い安全性と充実したアフターケアから利用者が増え続けています。
フラッシュ脱毛にしかないメリット
フラッシュ脱毛は、エステサロンやメンズエステで利用出来ます。駅前や住宅街といった利用しやすい場所に店舗が多い事から、学校・仕事終わりのちょっとした空いた時間に脱毛施術が受けられます。新規利用・他店からの乗り換えキャンペーンやお試しクーポン等、リーズナブルな価格で脱毛出来る店舗が多く、安い費用でお試し脱毛を利用して脱毛効果を確かめてから契約が出来るといったメリットがあります。
また、脱毛施術と一緒に利用出来るエステコースを用意している店舗がほとんどです。脱毛するついでに体の気になる箇所のケアをしてもらう男性利用者も増えているんですよ。
どちらの脱毛も毛周期に合わせて施術が行われる
レーザー・フラッシュ脱毛のどちらも利用者の「毛周期」に合わせて施術が行われています。
光脱毛は、ムダ毛が最も成長して毛根や毛乳頭としっかり結びついている状態に光を照射する必要があるからです。また、ムダ毛が生まれ変わる時や成長中にも光を照射する事が永久脱毛には必要となります。
一回の施術では永久脱毛の効果は得られない
髭脱毛だけではなく、全ての脱毛は毛周期に合わせて複数回光の照射を行うので1回の施術で永久脱毛の効果が得られる事はありません。高い出力の光を照射が可能なレーザー脱毛であれば、施術後にムダ毛が多少減ったという効果を実感する事は出来ます。
しかし、一回の施術のみでは、髭を完全に脱毛する事は不可能なので時間が経つと再び髭が生えてきます。永久脱毛の効果を得たい場合には、複数回施術を受ける事が必須です。
（髭脱毛の効果が実感できるのは何回目から？気になる回数や脱毛効果を上げる方法を紹介）
永久脱毛の効果を得られるまでにかかる期間と施術回数
毛周期に合わせて施術を複数回受ける事になる髭脱毛ですが、利用者によって施術にかかる期間や回数は異なります。また、髭は体毛の中でも濃く、本数が多いので他の箇所の脱毛より時間がかかります。レーザー脱毛で約一年半～二年半、フラッシュ脱毛で約三年～四年が目安となります。
髭が薄くなったかな？と感じるまでにレーザー脱毛で5回、フラッシュ脱毛で7回程度の施術を受ける必要があるでしょう。自分で髭を剃る必要がないツルツルの状態になるまでには、レーザー脱毛で12回、フラッシュ脱毛で15回程度となっています。
一回だけの施術を行っている医療機関・エステサロンも存在する
何度も施術に通う事になる髭脱毛ですが、一回だけの単発施術を行っている医療機関・エステサロンも少なからず存在しています。一般的な脱毛コースは、脱毛回数が決まっていたり料金を一括やローン払いで支払う必要があります。
しかし、単発施術はお金に余裕がある時だけ利用出来るのでローン払いや毎月の月額料金の支払いの心配がなくなります。また、自分の好きなタイミングで脱毛施術が受けられるといったメリットも得られます。しかし、しっかりと脱毛をしたいと考えている場合は、単発施術ではなく一般的な脱毛コースを選んだ方がお得となるケースが多いといった点に注意が必要です。
適切な施術間隔とは ？
毛周期に合わせて施術を行う光脱毛は、適切な施術間隔を空ける事が大切なんですよ。出来るだけ早く施術終わらせたいと考えて短い間隔で施術を受けようとする方も多いですが、間隔が短すぎると脱毛の効率が悪くなってしまいます。
また、光の照射は肌へのダメージもあり、ダメージが残った状態で再び施術を受けてしまうと、火傷や肌荒れ等の肌トラブルの原因となります。効率の低下や肌トラブルは脱毛施術の完了が長引く事になるので、レーザー・フラッシュ脱毛のどちらの場合も最低でも一ヶ月程度間隔を空けてから施術を受けるようにしましょう。
間隔が空き過ぎても問題はない？
髭脱毛の施術を受け始めてから、仕事や急な用事で前回の施術から間隔が空き過ぎてしまう方も珍しくありません。施術期間が空き過ぎた事によって脱毛効果が薄れるのでは？と不安を感じる方も多いですが、毛根組織は一度受けたダメージは完全に回復しないという特徴があるので問題ありません。
しかし、施術間隔を空け過ぎてしまうと残っている毛の細胞が活性化して髭が増えたり硬くなってしまう事があります。また、施術間隔が空き過ぎると脱毛完了までにかかる期間も伸びてしまいます。
施術後に毛が濃くなる原因とは？
髭脱毛の施術を受けた数日後～一週間後に一時的に髭が濃くなる方もいます。実際は、髭が濃くなったのではなく、施術のダメージで毛穴が圧迫された事で毛が濃く見えてしまったり、毛穴に抜けた毛のカスが残ってしまう事が原因です。
一回目の施術後に多く見られる現象で、一週間程度経てば解消されるので放っておいても問題はありません。どうしても気になるという場合は、マスク等で隠すと良いでしょう。髭が濃くなったと勘違いしてカミソリで髭を剃り過ぎると肌が傷んで、本当に髭が濃くなってしまいます。
出来るだけ肌が傷まないように気を付けてください。
目的に合わせた脱毛コースを選ぶのもアリ！
髭を完全に脱毛してツルツルになりたいという人もいれば、毛を薄くして目立たないようにしたいという人もいますよね。多くの医療機関・エステサロンでは目的に合わせた脱毛コースを用意しています。施術回数によってかかる費用も異なるので、自分の目的に合わせた脱毛コースを選ぶ利用者も増えています。

Romney then responded and called McCain a liar and then just plain dishonest .
Mitt Romney was caught on tape Sunday saying his GOP rival John McCain was " lying " about his position on the Iraq war , before quickly telling a reporter he regretted his words .
The Arizona senator was merely " dishonest , " Romney said .
" Well , he 's lying , " replied the former governor , with a slight laugh .
Within a second his tune changed .
" He 's dishonest [ inaudible ] .
He 's being dishonest about that .
That 's not accurate . "
" Are you calling him a liar ? " the reporter asked .
" No I 'm not .
I 'm saying he made a dishonest comment .
I misspoke . "
Even Brit Hume called McCain --- dishonest over this story .

Hume : … and I think that for McCain to claim that is dishonest .
Not straight talk .
Wallace :
Is that anymore dishonest than Mitt Romney saying that McCain is not an expert on the economy ?
Hume : Well , McCain did in fact say that .
As Digby says :
The McCain campaign is coming hard after Obama right now , being very aggressive and nearly hostile , adopting a tone of righteous indignation that this interloper is trying , basically , to steal the country from its rightful owners .
It 's pretty standard right wing populism and it's always been an effective approach for Republicans during hard times .
We 'll see if he can make it work , but I would hope that the Democrats start fighting this back right now .
It 's not going to get any better and there 's no margin in letting it lie ... read on
So we know McCain is a liar , but that did n't stop the media from running the phony Obama did n't want to see the wounded troops story .
Hang on , it 's just starting ...
In response to Uninsured Depositors At WaMu Are Begging For Trouble I received this comment from Chris Puplava at Financial Sense .
Read your article today and thought you could use the following image for support , which indeed shows Washington Mutual Credit Default Swaps now above the level Bear Sterns was at ( mid 800s ) when it imploded .
Click On Chart For Sharper Image
Thanks Chris .
That chart shows why it 's important to heed the credit markets .
There was virtually no recovery in the credit markets in Washington Mutual ( WM ) , even during the short squeeze lifting nearly all financials , some 100 % or more .
Washington Mutual could not hold any of the gains , which is what one would expect when the credit markets are increasing the odds of a bankruptcy at WaMu nearly every day .
If the credit markets do not think Washington Mutual survives , why should anyone else ?

IOC President explains why Beijing Games is exceptional
There are many aspects that the Beijing Games is exceptional , International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) President Jacques Rogge told China Daily on Wednesday in Beijing .
Results of the new study , “ The Cost to Circumcise Africa , ” comparing the cost of male circumcision to the cost of lifetime distribution of free condoms in sub-Saharan Africa , found that condom distribution is 95 times more cost - effective in preventing the same number of infections in Sub-Saharan Africa .
“ Male circumcision is too costly to justify in the HIV battle .
Even if circumcision does offer some protection against heterosexually transmitted HIV , condoms clearly provide more protection , at a much lower cost , ” says study co-author and Wellness Associates co-founder John Travis , MD , MPH .
“ We found that it just does n’t make sense to perform mass surgeries in a region of the world struggling to meet the most basic healthcare needs , especially when there are more cost - effective plans for achieving the same results . ”
In 1975 , after six years in the US Public Health Service , and completing a residency in preventive medicine at Johns Hopkins School of Public Health , John Travis opened the world ’s first wellness center , Wellness Resource Center ( now Wellness Associates ) , in Mill Valley , California .
His work attracted national attention , leading to an appearance on 60 Minutes with Dan Rather in 1979 , and launching the hitherto unknown word " wellness " into the public domain .
The study will be published in Fall 2008 .

Dealing with Difficult People
Photo by Stock Photo
Can you recall the last time you had to deal with a negative or difficult person ?
Or the last time someone said something with the intention of hurting you ?
How did you handle it ?
What was the result ?
What can you do in the future to get through these situations with peace and grace ?
No matter where we go , we will face people who are negative , people who oppose our ideas , people who piss us off or people who simply do not like us .
There are 6.4 billion people out there and conflict is a fact of life .
This fact is n’t the cause of conflict but it is the trigger to our emotions and our emotions are what drive us back to our most basic survival instinct ; react and attack back to defend ourselves .
In these instinctual moments , we may lose track of our higher selves and become the human animal with an urge to protect ourselves when attacked .
This too is natural .
However , we are the only animal blessed with intelligence and having the ability to control our responses .
So how can we do that ?
I regularly get asked “ How do you deal with the negative comments about your articles ?
They are brutal .
I do n’t think I could handle them . ”
My answer is simple , “ I do n’t let it bother me to begin with . ”
It was n’t always this simple , and took me some time before overcoming this natural urgency to protect myself and attack back .
I know it ’s not easy , if it was easy , there would n’t be difficult or negative people to begin with .
Why Bother Controlling Our Responses ?
1. Hurting Ourselves
One of my favorite sayings is “ Holding a grudge against someone is like drinking poison and expecting the other person to die . ”
The only person we hurt is ourselves .
When we react to negativity , we are disturbing our inner space and mentally creating pain within ourselves .
2. It ’s Not About You , It ’s About Them
I ’ve learned that when people initiate negativity , it is a reflection of their inner state expressed externally and you just happen to be in front of that expression .
It ’s not personal , so why do we take it personally ?
In short : Because our ego likes problems and conflict .
People are often so bored and unhappy with their own lives that they want to take others down with them .
There have been many times when a random person has left a purposefully hurtful comment on TSN , and regularly checked back to see if anyone else responded to their comment , waiting eagerly to respond with more negativity .
3. Battle of the Ego
When we respond impulsively , it is a natural and honest response .
However , is it the smart thing to do ?
What can be resolved by doing so ?
The answer : Nothing .
It does however feed our ego ’s need for conflict .
Have you noticed that when we fight back , it feels really satisfying in our heads ?
But it does n’t feel very good in our soul ?
Our stomach becomes tight , and we start having violent thoughts ?
When we do respond irrationally , it turns the conversation from a one - sided negative expression into a battle of two egos .
It becomes an unnecessary and unproductive battle for Who is Right ?
4. Anger Feeds Anger . Negativity Feeds Negativity .
Rarely can any good come out of reacting against someone who is in a negative state .
It will only trigger anger and an additional reactive response from that person .
If we do respond impulsively , we ’ll have invested energy in the defending of ourselves and we ’ll feel more psychologically compelled to defend ourselves going forward .
Have you noticed that the angrier our thoughts become , the angrier we become ?
It ’s a negative downward spiral .
5. Waste of Energy
Where attention goes , energy flows .
What we focus on tends to expand itself .
Since we can only focus on one thing at a time , energy spent on negativity is energy that could have been spent on our personal wellbeing .
6. Negativity Spreads
I ’ve found that once I allow negativity in one area of my life , it starts to subtly bleed into other areas as well .
When we are in a negative state or holding a grudge against someone , we do n’t feel very good .
We carry that energy with us as we go about our day .
When we do n’t feel very good , we lose sight of clarity and may react unconsciously to matters in other areas of our lives , unnecessarily .
7. Freedom of Speech
People are as entitled to their opinions as you are .
Allow them to express how they feel and let it be .
Remember that it ’s all relative and a matter of perspective .
What we consider positive can be perceived by another as negative .
When we react , it becomes me -versus - you , who is right ?
Some people may have a less than eloquent way of expressing themselves – it may even be offensive , but they are still entitled to do so .
They have the right to express their own opinions and we have the right and will power to choose our responses .
We can choose peace or we can choose conflict .
15 Tips for Dealing with Difficult People
While I ’ve had a lot of practice dealing with negativity , it is something I find myself having to actively work on .
When I ’m caught off guard and end up resorting to a defensive position , the result rarely turns out well .
The point is , we are humans after all , and we have emotions and egos .
However , by keeping our egos in - check and inserting emotional intelligence , we ’ll not only be doing a favor for our health and mental space , but we ’ll also have intercepted a situation that would have gone bad , unnecessarily .

Here are some tips for dealing with a difficult person or negative message :
What would the Dali Lama do if he was in the situation ?
He would most likely forgive .
Remember that at our very core , we are good , but our judgment becomes clouded and we may say hurtful things .
Ask yourself , “ What is it about this situation or person that I can seek to understand and forgive ? ”
2. Wait it Out
Sometimes I feel compelled to instantly send an email defending myself .
I ’ve learned that emotionally charged emails never get us the result we want ; they only add oil to the fire .
What is helpful is inserting time to allow ourselves to cool off .
You can write the emotionally charged email to the person , just do n’t send it off .
Wait until you ’ve cooled off before responding , if you choose to respond at all .
3 . “ Does it really matter if I am right ? “
Sometimes we respond with the intention of defending the side we took a position on .
If you find yourself arguing for the sake of being right , ask “ Does it matter if I am right ? ”
If yes , then ask “ Why do I need to be right ?
What will I gain ? ”
4. Do n’t Respond
Many times when a person initiates a negative message or difficult attitude , they are trying to trigger a response from you .
When we react , we are actually giving them what they want .
Let ’s stop the cycle of negative snowballing and sell them short on what they ’re looking for ; do n’t bother responding .
5. Stop Talking About It
When you have a problem or a conflict in your life , do n’t you find that people just love talking about it ?
We end up repeating the story to anyone who ’ll listen .
We express how much we hate the situation or person .
What we fail to recognize in these moments is that the more we talk about something , the more of that thing we ’ll notice .
Example , the more we talk about how much we dislike a person , the more hate we will feel towards them and the more we ’ll notice things about them that we dislike .
Stop giving it energy , stop thinking about it , and stop talking about it .
Do your best to not repeat the story to others .
6. Be In Their Shoes
As cliché as this may sound , we tend to forget that we become blind - sided in the situation .
Try putting yourself in their position and consider how you may have hurt their feelings .
This understanding will give you a new perspective on becoming rational again , and may help you develop compassion for the other person .
7. Look for the Lessons
No situation is ever lost if we can take away from it some lessons that will help us grow and become a better person .
Regardless of how negative a scenario may appear , there is always a hidden gift in the form of a lesson .
Find the lesson(s ) .
8. Choose to Eliminate Negative People In Your Life
Negative people can be a source of energy drain .
And deeply unhappy people will want to bring you down emotionally , so that they are not down there alone .
Be aware of this .
Unless you have a lot of time on your hands and do not mind the energy drain , I recommend that you cut them off from your life .
Cut them out by avoiding interactions with them as much as possible .
Remember that you have the choice to commit to being surrounded by people who have the qualities you admire : optimistic , positive , peaceful and encouraging people .
As Kathy Sierra said , “ Be around the change you want to see in the world . ”
9. Become the Observer
When we practice becoming the observer of our feelings , our thoughts and the situation , we separate ourselves away from the emotions .
Instead of identifying with the emotions and letting them consume us , we observe them with clarity and detachment .
When you find yourself identifying with emotions and thoughts , bring your focus on your breathe .
10 . Go for a Run
… or a swim , or some other workout .
Physical exercise can help to release the negative and excess energy in us .
Use exercise as a tool to clear your mind and release built up negative energy .
11 . Worst Case Scenario
Ask yourself two questions ,
“ If I do not respond , what is the worst thing that can result from it ? “
“ If I do respond , what is the worst thing that can result from it ? “
Answering these questions often adds perspectives to the situation , and you ’ll realize that nothing good will come out of reacting .
Your energy will be wasted , and your inner space disturbed .
12 . Avoid Heated Discussions
When we ’re emotionally charged , we are so much in our heads that we argue out of an impulse to be right , to defend ourselves , for the sake of our egos .
Rationality and resolution can rarely arise out of these discussions .
If a discussion is necessary , wait until everyone has cooled off before diving into one .
13 . Most Important
List out things in your life most important to you .
Then ask yourself , “ Will a reaction to this person contribute to the things that matter most to me ? ”
14 . Pour Honey
This does n’t always work , but sometimes catches people off guard when they ’re trying to “ Pour Poison ” on you .
Compliment the other person for something they did well , tell them you ’ve learned something new through interacting with them , and maybe offer to become friends .
Remember to be genuine .
You might have to dig deep to find something that you appreciate about this person .
15 . Express It
Take out some scrap paper and dump all the random and negative thoughts out of you by writing freely without editing .
Continue to do so until you have nothing else to say .
Now , roll the paper up into a ball , close your eyes and visualize that all the negative energy is now inside that paper ball .
Toss the paper ball in the trash .
Let it go !

Those “ modest origins ” of our meritocratic elites are less modest by the year .

... The rich man is in his castle ( actually , more likely , his gated community or doorman apartment complex ) and the poor man is at his gate .

They do n’t want to anyway , because they do n’t much like each other ....

I wish they were not so academic .
I wish there were some sign of a Churchill among them , or a Roosevelt ( Teddy for preference ) , or an Andy Jackson .

I wish , above all , that there were fewer of them .

It ’s a pity there is n’t some way to forcibly mix them with their fellow citizens at some point in their cosseted young adulthood , so that they might at least have a shot at learning how to talk across the I.Q. gap ; but in a free society , there is no way to do that .
Absent that kind of social engineering , there is nothing for it but to lie back and let them rule us .
They ’ll probably make a pretty good job of it .
They are , after all , the brightest and the best … however much we dislike them .

Inequality of innate ability is a fact of life .
We see the inequality in athletics events such as the Olympics or the Tour de France .
We also see the stratification in academic and professional achievement .
IQ stratifies people in different occupations and professions .
A caste comprising very high IQ individuals may be emerging .
But as long as opportunity societies exist , high achieving and wealthy people will emerge frequently from the mid-level castes .
One of Derbyshire 's glaring mistakes is in not analysing the birthrates of his new uber - elite .
They are un - breeding themselves out of existence .
Another mistake he makes is in neglecting the possiblity that genetic science will prove to be an " IQ equalizer " , in the near future .
At least in affluent countries .
Sperm banks can certainly mix up the genetic combinations .
Derbyshire also neglects the phenomenon of psychological neoteny -- the incompetence of a pampered adolescence that extends throughout a person 's lifetime .
An elite composed of neotenates is a particularly fragile elite .
It can not abide contradiction or challenge , and will not endure a close examination .

This weekend I was out to buy two iPhones , ones for me and one for my better half .
After I saw a long line in front of the Store in Los Gatos , I decided to try the Apple Store in Oakridge Mall .
It turns out , everyone was pretty much sold out and that there are no phones available for the next few weeks .
I have to admit , that the longer I sought after that stupid phone , the more I wanted it .
The harder it was for me to get my hands on it , the more I contemplated how to get it .
I called all Apple stores in my neighborhood , but no luck .
I called AT&T who told me that I could come in with my credit card and pay for the phone and that I could pick it up WHEN THEY GET IT ?
WTF ?
Then I began to realize what was happening and why Apple is once more short in supply , even after the disaster with the first incarnation of the apple cell phone .
I recently read a book on The Psychology of Persuasion ( by Cialdini , PhD ) who did an outstanding job on showing us all the buttons that we have and how easy it is to push them to get us to comply with a request .
After a while , you should ask yourself why you want that damn thing so much .
If everyone is talking about it , it must be something worth owning right ?
Apple skillfully employs five of the basic six principle of influence :
Scarcity :
We are pre-wired to consider scarce things ( items , information … ) as more valuable .
We will do everything we can to obtain these items .
Apple even uses an availability widget on their website to keep us reminded of the exclusivity of the phone .
Social Proof :
We are more pre-wired to consider the actions of a crowd as correct .
We silently observe others and try to align our own behavior accordingly .
By creating long lines of people in front of a limited number of stores , Apple gets a great deal of persuasion through masses .
Liking : Apple has carefully crafted their image .
No other commercial entity has such a strong fan base .
Authority : Steve Jobs tells us what we need and what we do n’t .
We trust him , since he knows best .
When he says buy , we buy .
Commitment / Consistency :
Once you bought apple products , you start to convince yourself that they are truly superior .
Our desire for consistency was used by Chinese to brainwash POW of the Korean war much the same way we are brainwashed now .
We convince ourselves that our actions are correct after the fact , since we refuse being inconsistent ( flip - flopping ) .
Thus , we become true believers .
Reciprocation :
This is the sixth pillar that is n’t as much used by Apple .
Its the free sample principle .
Most people find it hard to walk away after having a free sample in the super market and end up buying the product , even if they do not even like it very much .
Cialdini explains all of this much better in his book :
Influence : The Psychology of Persuation
or in his textbook :
Social Psychology : Goals in Interaction
DIGG THIS
Ever since its founding in 1913 , the Fed has described itself as an independent agency operated by selfless public servants striving to fine - tune the economy through monetary policy .
In reality , however , a non- political governmental institution is as likely as a barking cat .
Yet , the myth of an independent Fed persists .
One reason this myth persists is that statist textbooks have helped perpetuate it for decades .
From 1948 until about 1980 Paul Samuelson ’s Economics was the best - selling introductory economics text .
Generations of students were introduced to economics by Samuelson .
Although not as popular as it once was , Samuelson ’s text ( now co-authored with William Nordhaus ) is still widely used .
According to the 1989 edition :
The Federal Reserve ’s goals are steady growth in national output and low unemployment .
Its sworn enemy is inflation .
If aggregate demand is excessive , so that prices are being bid up , the Federal Reserve Board may want to slow the growth of the money supply , thereby slowing aggregate demand and output growth .
If unemployment is high and business languishing , the Fed may consider increasing the money supply , thereby raising aggregate demand and augmenting output growth .
In a nutshell , this is the function of central banking , which is an essential part of macroeconomic management in all mixed economies .
Another top - selling economics text has been Campbell McConnell ’s Economics , which echoes Samuelson and Nordhaus ’s idealistic statism :
Because it is a public body , the decisions of the Board of Governors are made in what it perceives to be the public interest . . . the Federal Reserve Banks are not guided by the profit motive , but rather , they pursue those measures which the Board of Governors recommends .
. . .
The fundamental objective of monetary policy is to assist the economy in achieving a full employment , noninflationary level of total output .
These are mere wishes , not statements of facts , for there is voluminous evidence that the Fed — like all other governmental institutions — has always been manipulated by politicians .
The Fed as a Political Tool
When the Fed was founded , it was controlled by two groups , the Governors ’ Conference , composed of the twelve regional bank presidents , and the seven - member Federal Reserve Board in Washington .
In 1935 the Fed was reorganized to concentrate nearly all power in Washington .
Franklin Roosevelt packed the Fed just as he later filled the U.S. Supreme Court with political sycophants .
Roosevelt appointed Marriner Eccles , a strong supporter of deficit spending and inflationary finance , as Fed Chairman , although Eccles had no financial background and lacked even an undergraduate degree .
In those years the Fed was really run by Eccles ’s political mentor , Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau , Jr. , and thus ultimately Roosevelt .
Later presidents were no less willing to influence supposedly independent Fed policy .
According to the late Robert Weintraub , the Federal Reserve fundamentally shifted its monetary policy course in 1953 , 1961 , 1969 , 1974 , and 1977 — all years in which the presidency changed .
Fed policy almost always changes to accommodate varying presidential preferences . [ 1 ]
For example , President Eisenhower wanted slower money growth .
The money supply grew by 1.73 percent during his administration — the slowest rate in a decade .
President Kennedy desired somewhat faster money creation .
From January 1961 to November 1963 , the basic money supply grew by 2.31 percent .
Lyndon Johnson required rapid money creation to finance his expansion of the welfare / warfare state .
Money - supply growth more than doubled to 5 percent .
These varying rates of monetary growth all occurred under the same Fed chairman , William McChesney Martin , who obviously was more interested in pleasing his political master than in implementing an independent monetary policy .
Martin ’s successor , Arthur Burns , was such a staunch supporter of Richard Nixon that he lost all professional credibility by enthusiastically endorsing Nixon ’s disastrous wage and price controls .
Even though his staff informed him in the fall of 1972 that the money supply was forecast to grow by an extremely robust 10.5 percent in the third quarter , Burns advocated ever - faster growth before the election .
The growth rate in the money supply in 1972 was the fastest for any one year since the end of World War II and helped re-elect Richard Nixon .
However , President Ford called for slower monetary growth as part of his Whip Inflation Now program , and the Fed complied with a 4.7 percent growth rate .
But when Jimmy Carter was elected , Burns again complied with presidential wishes by stepping up the growth rate to 8.5 percent .
Carter did not reappoint Burns , but the latter ’s successors were equally cooperative .
The money supply increased at an annual rate of 16.2 percent in the five months preceding the 1980 election — a post - World War II record .
In 1981 Donald Regan , Ronald Reagan ’s Treasury Secretary , advocated , and got , more rapid monetary growth .
A year later the President himself met with Fed Chairman Paul Volcker to lobby for slower growth , which was dutifully produced by the Fed .
More recently , Alan Greenspan was just as accommodating to President Clinton .
Both Sides Benefit
The Fed is obviously influenced by the executive branch .
But the relationship between the Fed and administrations runs far deeper .
As Robert Weintraub observed , such contact has been and continues to be fostered by cross-planting of high - level personnel in both directions .
Officials have also met weekly for decades .
But personal contact is not necessary for the Fed to allow itself to be used as a political tool .
The administration ’s policy views are generally well known .
Economist Thomas Havrilesky has even developed an index of executive branch signaling , based on newspaper accounts of the administration ’s monetary policy preferences as reported in the Wall Street Journal .
[ 2 ]
And as Weintraub concluded , a Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board who ignores the wishes of the President does so at his peril .
The Fed and presidents alike benefit from this arrangement .
Economist Edward Kane has argued persuasively that the Fed ’s ultimate political function is to serve as a political scapegoat when things go wrong .
Writes Kane : " Whenever monetary policies are popular , incumbents can claim that their influence was crucial in their adaptation .
On the other hand , when monetary policies prove unpopular , they can blame everything on a stubborn Federal Reserve and claim further that things would have been worse if they had not pressed Fed officials at every opportunity . " [ 3 ]
In return for this favor , the Fed is allowed to amass a huge slush fund ( discussed below ) by earning interest income from the government securities it purchases through its open market operations .
A Demand for Inflation ?
It is also well established that politicians use the Fed as a tool of money creation to advance their own re-election .
As Robert J. Gordon wrote in the Journal of Law and Economics more than 30 years ago : Accelerations in money and prices are not thrust upon society by a capricious or self - serving government , but rather represent the vote - maximizing response of government to the political pressure exerted by potential beneficiaries of inflation . [ 4 ]
Gordon is wrong in denying that government is inherently capricious and self - serving , but he ’s got a good point :
Politicians are naturally inclined to finance government handouts to special - interest groups with the hidden tax of inflation , which hides the true costs of government from the taxpaying public .
Joining with election - minded officials in favor of expansive monetary policies is a low - interest - rate lobby , led , argues Edward Kane , by builders and construction unions and by financial institutions that earn their living by borrowing short to lend long .
The Fed underwrites an enormous volume of research , some of which is very good .
But , as Business Week magazine once observed :
There is disturbing evidence that the research effort of the bank ’s 500 - odd Ph.D. economists is being forced into a mold whose shape is politically determined by the staff of the Federal Reserve Chairman .
Some Fed economists admit that political expedience is the rule .
Says former Fed economist Robert Auerbach , " the practice at the Bank where I worked was to clear research through the Board of Governors and to ‘ persuade ’ economists to delete material that the Board or the Bank officials did not like . " [ 5 ]
Thus , all Fed research should be taken with a grain of salt .
However , one study in particular deserves special attention .
In 1992 Boston Fed research director Alicia Munnel published a report claiming to find persistent mortgage loan discrimination against minorities in Boston .
The study , used to justify racial quotas for bank loans , was fatally flawed .
The data were hopelessly jumbled .
Equally important , the report failed to control for creditworthiness — credit ratings , job history , income , and so on .
When confronted with these facts by Peter Brimelow and Leslie Spencer of Forbes magazine , Munnel admitted : I do not have evidence . . . no one has evidence of lending bias .
Taxpayer - Funded Lobbying
The Fed also uses its privileged position — and especially its multi-billion dollar slush fund generated by interest income on open market purchases — to lobby .
Its preferred method is to pressure member banks , which it regulates , to lobby for it .
It also recruits a small army of academic researchers , who benefit from Fed research grants , visiting appointments , and invitations to conferences at exotic locations , to testify on its behalf at Congressional hearings .
For instance , in the late 1970s Representative Henry Reuss introduced a bill authorizing the General Accounting Office to audit the Federal Reserve system .
It was defeated because , as Reuss later explained , with the Federal Reserve Board in Washington serving as the command center , a well - orchestrated lobbying campaign was mounted , using the members of the boards of directors [ of the regional banks ] as the point men .
In a speech to the American Bankers Association after the GAO bill was defeated , the Richmond Fed ’s chairman , Robert W. Lawson , congratulated the assembled commercial bankers for their success : " The bankers in our district and elsewhere did a tremendous job in helping to defeat the General Accounting Office bill .
It shows what can be done when the bankers of the country get together . " [ 6 ]
Academics conducted themselves in an equally disgraceful way , warning of potential abuses and assuring Congress that the Fed could be trusted to behave responsibly .
For decades , believers in the public interest theory of Fed behavior blamed the Fed ’s failures to ensure price stability on the agency ’s incomplete knowledge and difficulty fine - tuning the economy .
But research suggests that the Fed ’s abysmal record in controlling inflation reflects not mere incompetence , but the way in which the Fed is organized .
Until the Fed ’s creation , there was no overall upward trend in the price level .
Inflation occurred during wars , but prices then gradually declined to their former levels .
Since the establishment of the Fed , however , there has been a continuous upward surge in prices .
Public choice scholars believe that an important reason why the Fed has caused so much inflation is that it benefits from inflation .
Since the entire operation has been funded since 1933 from revenue acquired through interest payments on government security holdings , the Fed has an incentive to purchase securities ( thereby expanding the money supply ) more than it has an incentive to sell them .
Purchasing government securities is a source of income to the Fed , whose income is earned by the interest paid on the securities .
Selling securities , on the other hand , causes a loss of income .
The Fed is constrained to return excess revenues to the Treasury , but enjoys great discretion over its budget and managed to spend over $ 2 billion on itself in 1996 .
Fed officials live quite well on their revenues .
As a recent General Accounting Office report revealed : The Fed has 25,000 employees , runs its own air force of 47 Learjets and small cargo planes , and has fleets of vehicles , including personal cars for 59 Fed bank managers .
. . .
A full - time curator oversees its collection of paintings and sculpture . [ 7 ]
The Fed held $ 451 billion in accumulated assets as of 1996 , when it was engaged in building for itself several expensive new office buildings .
The number of Fed employees earning more than $ 125,000 per year more than doubled ( from 35 to 72 ) from 1993 to 1996 ; even the head janitor ( known as the support services director ) is paid $ 163,800 in annual salary plus benefits .
Money is lavishly spent on professional memberships , entertainment , and travel .
Economist Mark Toma has studied the Fed ’s spending habits and believes that the Fed does in fact conduct monetary policy with an eye toward how its managers and employees can themselves profit from it .
That means instituting a bias toward bond purchases and money creation .
[ 8 ]
Similarly , William Shughart and Robert Tollison contend that the Fed behaves exactly like many other government bureaucracies , padding its operating expenditures by increasing the number of employees on its payroll . [ 9 ]
That is , the Fed uses staff expansion to reduce the amount it must return to the Treasury .
Thus , when engaging in expansionary policies , write Shughart and Tollison , the Fed can both increase the supply of money and increase the size of its bureaucracy because the two goals are served by open market purchases of securities .
Contractionary policies , on the other hand , force the Fed to lower its profits and staff .
Because of this unique financing mechanism , argue Shughart and Tollison , the Fed has been more successful in enlarging its employee staff over time than the federal government as a whole .
This employment effect , moreover , may partially explain why the Fed has apparently been more willing to engage in expansionary than in contractionary monetary policies .
Regulation as a Political Tool
The Fed also uses its vast regulatory powers for political purposes , rather than to promote the public interest .
The Fed ’s authority is vast , but is most abused through enforcement of the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 .
Under the CRA , the Fed must assess a bank ’s record of meeting community needs before allowing a bank to merge or open a new branch or even an automatic teller machine .
An entire industry of nonprofit political activists routinely files protests with the Fed , which must be evaluated before the bank can win Fed approval .
The activists typically threaten to stall mergers or branch expansions unless banks give them — not the poor in their communities — money , a practice that many bankers consider pure blackmail .
For example , the Chicago - based National Training and Information Center threatened to delay a merger by a Chicago bank unless it received $ 30,000 to renovate its office .
The bank agreed , and also gave $ 500,000 to other leftist organizations .
In Boston , left - wing activist Bruce Marks , the head of the Union Neighborhood Assistance Corporation , filed complaint after complaint with the Fed over Fleet Financial Group ’s community lending record until Fleet agreed to give $ 140 million to his organization and to make $ 8 billion in loans to individuals and businesses favored by Mr. Marks .
" We are urban terrorists , " Marks explained to the Wall Street Journal . [ 10 ]
The CRA is frequently used as a means of racial extortion .
For example , the Fed , under the direction of former Governor Lawrence Lindsey , found statistical disparities in lending , i.e. , the percentage of loans granted by the Shawmut Services Corporation to blacks and Hispanics did not match the groups ’ proportion in the population .
Yet no individuals complained of discrimination and the Fed did not claim to have found any victims .
In fact , between 1990 and 1992 , when the discrimination allegedly occurred , Shawmut ’s mortgage loans to blacks and Hispanics more than doubled , and the mortgage rejection rate fell by 45 percent and 26 percent , respectively .
However , the Fed employed 150 people to go out and find people who claimed to have been discriminated against by Shawmut and to offer them $ 15,000 each , effectively robbing the company of $ 1 million .
Conclusions
Any government monopoly will be corrupt and inefficient , but the Fed may be the worst government monopoly of all .
Not only does it operate for its own advantage in the name of promoting the public interest , and offer government officials political cover for their self - interested policies , the Fed also allows no escape .
One can at least refuse to do business with , say , the government school monopoly by homeschooling or by sending one ’s children to private schools .
But one cannot avoid the effects of the Fed ’s monetary monopoly .
It is time to depoliticize and denationalize our money .

The Best of Thomas DiLorenzo
The British governments of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown have been shockingly complicit with the Bush administration both in using , encouraging , and facilitating torture , as well as in helping to cover up the traces .
Some CIA torture flights passed through the UK , and British - controlled Diego Garcia has served as one of the primary staging grounds for those flights and itself is one of the network of ' black sites ' .
Indeed MI5 agents have arranged the arrest of men who ended up at Guantanamo , and taken part in interviews there - as for example in the case of Bisher al Rawi .
In other words , Tony Blair fully integrated the UK into Bush 's torture regime .
That 's made even clearer in a new parliamentary report just published in Britain .
The Joint Committee on Human Rights has been investigating the torture and murder of Baha Musa in Iraq in 2003 .
Musa was beaten and suffocated .
The Committeee found that top military officials misled it when they claimed that Bush - style " conditioning techniques " used by the British military had not been approved for interrogations in Iraq .
Such techniques ( e.g. hooding , sleep deprivation , and stress positions ) were prohibited by law more than 30 years ago .
Since 2004 UK military officials have pled the few bad apples defense , both in their own internal review and in testimony to Parliament .
[ In 2004 ] Adam Ingram , the armed forces minister , and Lieutenant General Robin Brims , Commander Field Army in 2006 , had told the Joint Committee on Human Rights that hooding and sleep deprivation were forbidden .
But the committee said the assurances appeared to be false , and not all troops had known these and other " conditioning techniques " were banned .
Neither man has explained to Parliament why they lied .
The Independent adds :
A scathing report from the Joint Human Rights Committee ( JHRC ) warns that the use of " coercive interrogation techniques " may have been officially sanctioned , despite assurances that troops knew they were outlawed ...
The JHRC report also found that the use of hooding and stress positioning by 1 Queen 's Lancashire Regiment in 2003 was based on legal advice received from brigade headquarters .
It claims that , at least until the Baha Mousa case came to light , the prohibition on the use of conditioning techniques " was not as clearly articulated to troops in Iraq as it might , and indeed should , have been " .
Legal advice from the military chain of command authorizing torture .
How familiar .
Phil Shiner , of Public Interest Lawyers , said : " We are meant to believe that it is just a few bad apples , but the evidence from courts martial and other cases shows that nothing could be further from the truth . "
The report also finds that ...
... even at the start of 2008 an official army investigation had found that the prohibition on [ the techniques ' ] use was still not ' clearly being articulated ' to ordinary soldiers ... [ Phil Shiner said ]
" There is evidence that British forces in Iraq routinely used coercive interrogation techniques - including sexual humiliation - and that interrogators were made to use them . "
In the face of this damning evidence , and very much on the model of the Bush administration , the British Defense Minister Des Browne has the temerity to say :
" Since 2003 we have made considerable improvements to the training and information given to soldiers deploying on operations about the correct and humane treatment of detainees .
We have always been clear that we expect our forces to comply fully with international law .
We will not tolerate anything less . "
Even so , Browne has announced that a judge 's inquiry will investigate the " discrepancies " between what military officials told legislators and , presumably , the truth .
Such a judicial investigation into official government lies would be welcome in the US as well .

Check it , nerds .
A team over at the Universidade Nova de Lisboa has reportedly figured out a way to use paper ( yes , paper ) as an interstrate component of a Field Effect Transistor ( FET ) .
In testing , the group " fabricated the devices on both sides of the paper sheet , " thus causing the paper to act as the " electric insulator and as the substrate " simultaneously .
Remarkably , results showed that performance actually rivaled that of best - in - class oxide thin film transistors , giving revived hope for the realm of disposable devices like paper displays , labels , intelligent packaging , tracking tags , etc .
The findings are scheduled to be published this September , after which we 're sure any firms interested in taking this stuff commercial will be putting their best foot forward .

Ashlee Simpson and Pete Wentz are NOT Expecting Twins
After referring to his unborn baby as " them " on a Phoenix , Arizona radio show yesterday morning , sent celebrity gossip bloggers into a tailspin as headlines that he and wifewere expecting twins flooded the internet .
The rocker quickly contacted the queen of gossip , Perez Hilton , to set the record straight , saying " That was way wrong .
I meant to say ' the baby ' and said ' them ' cos it was 7 am .
I can tell you we are absolutely not having twins .
I totally mispoke ' cos we dunno if it 's a boy or girl .
I try to speak vaguely and I totally blew it on this one . "
Leaving a medical building later in the day , Ashlee and Pete remarked that everything was fine with the pregnancy .

VIENNA ( Reuters ) - Governors of the United Nations ’ nuclear watchdog approved an inspections plan for India on Friday , an important step towards completing a nuclear trade accord between New Delhi and the United States .

The plan will permit regular International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) surveillance of India ’s declared civilian nuclear energy plants -- 14 of 22 existing or planned reactors .
The IAEA ’s 35 - nation board of governors passed the plan by consensus despite qualms about ambiguous language some feel could allow India to cancel inspections unilaterally , or which fails to ensure civilian nuclear materials cannot be diverted into the country ’s off - limits bomb program .
The decision clears a hurdle to an accord that would allow exports of nuclear fuel and technology for civilian use to India after a 34 - year ban imposed because India tested atomic bombs and has not signed the Non-Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) .
Washington and New Delhi must now persuade the 45 - nation Nuclear Suppliers Group ( NSG ) to grant India an unprecedented waiver allowing trade with a non-NPT state and win ratification by the U.S. Congress before the deal can go into force .
India ’s foreign secretary said the NSG would discuss the issue on August 21 - 22 , and that India expected an “ unconditional exemption ” , a demand some NSG members may resist for fear of undoing respect for the NPT .
The IAEA ’s director said the inspections scheme met non-proliferation safeguards standards , and that talks had begun on a system of more intrusive , short - notice checks , known as the Additional Protocol , to raise confidence in India ’s intentions .
IAEA inspections will be phased in from 2009 .
“ These are not comprehensive or full - scope safeguards ( unlike with NPT member states ) , ” Mohamed ElBaradei said .
“ ( But the plan ) satisfies India ’s needs while maintaining all the agency ’s legal requirements .
“ I believe the agreement is good for India , good for the world , good for nonproliferation ...
I believe we answered every question satisfactorily , ” he told reporters .
The United States welcomed the IAEA ’s approval of the inspection plan and said it hoped to move quickly on revising the NSG guidelines before submitting the accord to Congress .
Industrialized powers say the deal ushers India towards the non-proliferation mainstream and will fight global warming by fostering use of low - polluting nuclear energy in developing economies , also cutting high oil and gas costs .
Simon Smith , Britain ’s IAEA envoy , said the deal would “ make a significant contribution to energy and climate security ” .
“ This is an important day for India and for our civil nuclear initiative , for the resumption of India ’s cooperation with our friends abroad , ” Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said during a visit to Sri Lanka .
MISGIVINGS
But some smaller Western and developing nations and disarmament groups fear the accord could weaken allegiance to the NPT , already challenged by a drive for nuclear power in the Middle East led by Iran ’s disputed uranium enrichment project .
“ An arrow was launched through the heart of the NPT today , with the approval of the India safeguards agreement , ” said one dismayed diplomat .
“ As a result of heavy - handed diplomacy , India can benefit from nuclear help from abroad while keeping its weapons program unchecked .
Hypocrisy wins . ”
With time fast running out before the U.S. presidential election in November , Washington and New Delhi have lobbied other countries hard to speed the deal over remaining hurdles .
India faces a tough sell at the NSG , formed in response to its 1974 nuclear test to limit trade in “ trigger list ” nuclear items -- those with civilian or military uses -- to NPT member states with good non-proliferation records .
Nuclear analysts say some hardline NSG members may propose conditions on India ’s waiver including a more binding commitment against nuclear testing , on which India is observing a voluntary moratorium , and significant progress towards implementing an Additional Protocol .
Twenty - six IAEA board members are also in the NSG .
People are trying to make jet fuel out of coconut oil and algae , so why not garbage ?
That 's what they 're thinking at the Solena Group , a Washington DC company that builds and operates renewable energy power plants in North America , Asia and Europe .
The company has started work on a facility that will make jet fuel from trash , tree bark and even manure through a process called plasma gasification .
It uses 5,000 - degree plasma arcs to break trash into gas fuel , which is then converted into liquid suitable for powering an airplane .
Between the plasma gasification and gas - to - liquid conversion , the process will release plenty of CO2 into the environment , but the company says that 's nothing compared to the emissions created by decomposing landfill waste and continued reliance on petroleum - based aviation fuel .
( According to the Department of Transportation , aviation accounts for 2.7 percent of the country 's annual greenhouse gas output . )
And energy generated from the plasma arcs is used to power the system , making it self - sustaining .
Solena plans to build its plant in Gilroy , California , where it can be fed with a steady stream of household trash from Norcal Waste Systems , a big California garbage collection company .
The company 's success is far from assured : it wo n't begin production until 2011 but some US biofuel tax credits are scheduled to expire in 2008 , so far no commercial airline has publicly expressed interest in the project , and the price of jet fuel could drop again before the garbage - gas project gets off the ground ( highly unlikely , though you never know ) .
But according to The Register , Solena does have one big friend on its side .
Eager to diversify its fuel sources , the Navy is evidently interested in working with the company .
And that ' not a bad customer to start with .

Advertisement Pedigree dogs are suffering from genetic diseases following years of inbreeding , an investigation has found .
A BBC documentary says they are suffering acute problems because looks are emphasised over health when breeding dogs for shows .
The programme shows spaniels with brains too big for their skulls and boxers suffering from epilepsy .
The Kennel Club says it works tirelessly to improve the health of pedigree dogs .
Pedigree animals make up 75 % of the seven million dogs in the UK and cost their owners over £ 10 m in vets ' fees each week .
Poor health
The programme , Pedigree Dogs Exposed , says dogs suffering from genetic illness are not prevented from competing in dog shows and have gone on to win " best in breed " , despite their poor health .
It says physical traits required by the Kennel Club 's breed standards , such as short faces , wrinkling , screw - tails and dwarfism , have inherent health problems .
Other problems occur because of exaggerations bred into dogs by breeders trying to win rosettes , it adds .
The programme shows a prize - winning cavalier King Charles spaniel suffering from syringomyelia , a condition which occurs when a dog 's skull is too small for its brain .
People are carrying out breeding which would be first of all entirely illegal in humans and secondly is absolutely insane from the point of view of the health of the animals
Professor Steve Jones
University College London
It also features boxers suffering from epilepsy , pugs with breathing problems and bulldogs who are unable to mate or give birth unassisted .
It says deliberate mating of dogs which are close relatives is common practice and the Kennel Club registers dogs bred from mother - to - son and brother - to - sister matings .
HAVE YOUR SAY
There are some breeds of dogs which are " abominations " Obyapka , UK Scientists at Imperial College , London , recently found that pugs in the UK are so inbred that although there are 10,000 of them , it is the equivalent of just 50 distinct individuals .
Steve Jones , professor of genetics at University College London , said : " People are carrying out breeding which would be first of all entirely illegal in humans and secondly is absolutely insane from the point of view of the health of the animals .
" In some breeds they are paying a terrible price in genetic disease . "
Breeding practices RSPCA chief vet Mark Evans was interviewed for the programme .
He said : " The welfare and quality of life of many pedigree dogs is seriously compromised by established breeding practices for appearance , driven primarily by the rules and requirements of competitive dog showing and pedigree dog registration . "

But Kennel Club spokeswoman Caroline Kisko said it is " working tirelessly " to help improve the health of pedigree dogs .
" Any dog may be shown but it is up to the judge to decide if it fits the breed standard , " she said .
" It is when characteristics become exaggerated that health problems can occur .
" This is something that the Kennel Club does not encourage and actively educates people , including judges , against doing as part of its Fit For Function , Fit For Life campaign . "
Pedigree Dogs Exposed will be shown on BBC One at 2100 BST on Tuesday 19 August

What are these ?
Seems like the procedure has changed :
Mr. Peters nodded , and then looked down at the sheet which I had filled out and signed .
“ I ’m going to have to make some calls to verify your identity . ”
I nodded .
He pulled out a cell phone .
I had assumed that we would be going to some separate screening room , but that was n’t the case .
He stood facing the silver table , and I leaned back against it .
So this was the dreaded interview .
People walked past us with bags and luggage .
“ Hello , ” he said .
“ Security . ”
Long pause .
It sounded like he was transferred .
He said a number that I think had the same number of digits as a phone number .
Then he said a shorter number .
“ No , she does n’t . ”
He wrote something in small letters on the form .
Then he spelled my name over the phone .
“ D - A - V - I - D - O - F - F. That ’s Indigo Delta … yes . ”
He looked at me .
“ What ’s the name of a street that you lived on prior to your current address ? ”
“ Inman . ”
“ Inman , ” he repeated .
There was a pause .
“ Where did you live in 2004 ? ”
“ Hmm … ” I said .
“ New Mexico ?
I think ?
Maybe Massachusetts . ”
He conferred with the person on the phone .
“ That ’s fine . ”
He hung up .
“ All right , ” he said .
“ You ’re going to go through full security screening . ”
He wrote “ SSSS ” in red marker on my printed boarding pass .
He handed my form to one of the officers at the podium , and then gestured to the first screening line .
“ Right here . ”
Bloc Party singer Kele Okereke was left with severe facial bruising and a split lip following an alleged racist attack by Sex Pistols singer John Lydon .
The incident occurred on Saturday evening at the Summercase festival in Barcelona , with one witness claiming Lydon 's entourage behaved like " a gang of racist thugs " .
In an official statement released by the Okereke , who is of Nigerian descent , the singer says he approached Lydon backstage and asked him about the possibility of a reunion for Public Image Ltd , the band Lydon formed following the Sex Pistols demise in 1978 .
In Okereke 's words , Lydon became " intimidating and aggressive while his entourage responded with a racist tirade , including the statement , ' your problem is your black attitude ' . "
An assault allegedly ensued in which three people attacked Okereke .
Several other bands witnessed the incident , with Foals ' singer Yannis Philippakis and Kaiser Chiefs singer Ricky Wilson intervening on the Bloc Party singer 's behalf .
" It 's not an issue of the physical assault , even though it was an unprovoked attack , " said Okereke .
" It is the fact that race was brought into the matter so readily .
Someone as respected and as intelligent as Lydon should know better than to bring race into the equation , or socialise with and encourage those who hold such narrow - minded attitudes . "
He added : " I am disappointed that someone I held with such high regard turns out to be such a bigot . "
The incident has since been reported to the police in Spain and the UK .
No comment has been offered by Lydon and calls to his press officer were not returned .
Guardian / Music has contacted those bands said to have witnessed the incident and is awaiting their version of events .
Dylan on the Economy : Some Insights
Last week I asked blog readers to suggest the Bob Dylan lyrics they would use to describe the economy — a task requiring both deep knowledge of Dylan ’s music and of current economic conditions .
The intersection of economics and Dylan is bigger than you might think , and yields some terrific suggestions .
And judging by the lyrics suggested , the Dylan - o - meter suggests that economic conditions are pretty bleak .
I ’ve listed my favorites below , along with the context that I think they really speak to .
Beyond this shortlist , you might enjoy reading the full list of entries for some entertaining runners - up .
1 . The tax rebate checks :
“ Well , he hands you a nickel , He hands you a dime , He asks you with a grin If you ’re havin ’ a good time . ”
– From “ Maggie ’s Farm , ” suggested by Dan .
2. President Bush meeting with Treasury Secretary Paulson :
“ ‘ There must be some way out of here , ’ said the joker to the thief , ‘ There ’s too much confusion ; I ca n’t get no relief . ’ ”
– From “ All Along the Watchtower , ” suggested by Lawrence S .
3 . The housing bubble :
“ Now the bricks lay on Grand Street Where the neon madmen climb .
They all fall there so perfectly ,
It all seems so well timed .
An’ here I sit so patiently Waiting to find out what price
You have to pay to get out of Going through all these things twice . ”
– From “ Stuck Inside of Mobile With the Memphis Blues Again , ” suggested by Jeff .
4 . And a suggestion that sounds like Robert Shiller ( but more poetic ) :
“ And so it did happen like it could have been foreseen , The timeless explosion of fantasy ’s dream . ”
– From “ Ballad in Plain D , ” suggested by Andy .
Congrats to Dan , Lawrence , Jeff , and Andy .
Your prizes are on their way .
Oh , and I saw Dylan on Friday in Philly — a terrific show .

1. Overview
The Cemetech Bluetooth Dataglove , or Clove 2 for short ( pronounced like the spice ) is a project to allow one - handed typing in situations where it might be impossible or impractical to use a traditional keyboard .
It has been designed to allow the user to type any character from a keyboard with minimal effort , and thus is arranged with most frequently - used keys immediately accessible and less - used keys requiring two or three finger strokes to access .
No character requires more than four finger combinations from any other character .
It is built from easily - acquired parts , and the most complex component , the Bluetooth module , is taken from a commercial keyboard .
Total cost of construction is roughly USD $ 60 , including the glove , bluetooth module , and charger .
Because all key interpretation is performed in software on the host device , remapping the keys or modifying its functionality is trivial .
A sample translation application was built as a script for the Windows program AutoHotkey , but creating a translation layer or driver for any device would take minimal effort .
The Bluetooth nature of the glove both allows connection to a wider range of devices than with other interfaces such as USB or PS / 2 , and of course makes usage more elegant by eliminating the need for a physical tether to the host .

Typing on the dataglove is very similar to typing on a regular keyboard , in that every combination does something and most do different things depending on modifiers like Shift , Alt , and Ctrl .
However , due to the limited number of available finger combinations , more functions must be crammed onto each key ( 6 on most keys ) .
In addition to the three standard modifiers , Space has only a single function , as does the Mode key .
Mode switches between alpha mode , navigation / symbol mode , and symbol / function mode .
I have found that the easiest way to memorize numbers and symbols is to remember with what letter they share a finger combination .
Mode toggles between the three modes , and the sample driver software I wrote provides audio cues during mode switching .
Every key combo that performs an action makes a clicking noise , while modifiers each have their own tone .
Enabling and disabling the glove also plays a tone sequence , so overall the glove is somewhat usable without a screen in front of the user .
Alt and Ctrl are sticky : pressing Alt or Ctrl and then a key produces the same effect as holding the modifier and hitting the key on a normal keyboard .
Pressing
Alt and / or Ctrl a second time without a key to modify turns
Alt and / or Ctrl off again .
Shift operates differently , acting either as Alt and Ctrl , or if pressed twice , locking into Caps Lock .
A third tap turns off Caps Lock .
Below are listed all keys typable with the glove :

3. Construction and Instructions
3.1 . Introduction
The " row " and " column " columns in the table above identify which finger and thumb / palm contacts respectively must be touched together for that particular combination .
A reference as to which contacts correspond to which row / column can be found in the construction details below .
The " Difficulty " column represents how hard it is for me to perform each of the finger combinations , where 0 is the easiest and the difficulty increases through + and ++ to +++ being the most difficult .
Any and all of the keys in the final six columns can be modified with Ctrl and / or Alt .
The dataglove does not require great skill to build , but does require a fair bit of patience and persistence .
It will be easier if you use the same materials as I did , but if you use a different keyboard , bluetooth or otherwise , you will have to derive your own keymap .
I 'll begin with the tools and materials needed to create the glove , module , and charger , then move on to the actual instructions and plans .
3.2 . Skills , Parts , and Tools
Skills
Basic knowledge of sewing , soldering , and hot gluing

3.3 . Constructing the Bluetooth Module
The Bluetooth module is built around the PCB from a commercial bluetooth keyboard , which greatly simplifies both the hardware and software design .
You can probably use any Bluetooth keyboard , but I chose a Dell Bluetooth Keyboard ( actually a rebranding Logitech unit ) for price , availability , and simplicity .
Once you open your keyboard , you 'll see that there are a series of contacts that connect the thin film contact sheets to the PCB .
These are arranged in two sets , which I call rows ( the more numerous set ) and columns .
Pressing any key connects one of the rows to one of the columns .
If you use the same keyboard I used , you can use the chart below , but if you use a different keyboard , you must map your keyboard yourself .
You can do this by visually tracing the thin film contact sheets , or use a continuity tester to find which keys connect which rows and columns .
Dell Bluetooth Keyboard Keymap ( 14.47KB )
Hopefully , your keyboard is powered by 2 AA or AAA batteries ( ~3.0v ) , which should make it a good candidate for a 3.7v Li-Poly battery .
My keyboard had a built - in voltage regulator , but you may find that you need a resistor voltage divider ( or , even better , a diode with a 0.7 v drop such as a 1N4001 ) to drop the voltage down to 3.0V .
If your keyboard requires a higher voltage , you may need to consider using two batteries in series , which will mean your charger will need to be modified accordingly ( see the SHDesigns site linked below for details ) .
Once you have extracted the PCB , find the negative and positive solder points to which the original battery pack was attached .
The positive point should lead to a power switch ; remove the switch and solder a 30 awg wire on the far side of the switch solder points ( so that the switch would no longer have done anything ) .
Solder a second wire to the negative point .
Solder your replacement SPST switch to the negative wire , and solder a second wire to the other side of the switch , leading to the negative terminal of the Li-Poly battery pack .
When you finish in the next step , the circuit should be as diagrammed in the following schematic :
Bluetooth Module Power Schematic ( 20.71KB )
Next , you should build the enclosure .
I cut two 5.25 " plastic computer bay covers so when placed together , one end of the enclosure was closed and the other was open .
At the closed end of one cover piece , drill a center hole , then screw two screws through , one closer to the center on one side , one towards the edge on the other side , as you can see in the image below .
You can also see where the power switch has been removed from the PCB and a replacement soldered in its place .
Finally , create the connector into which the dataglove will plug .
I used a 24 - pin DIP IC socket , soldering 30 awg wire between each of the contacts on the board and the socket .
Since the Dell keyboard I used has 25 contacts , 17 rows and 8 columns , I needed to discard one , so I chose row 2 .
As you can see from the keymap above , it works with only a single column .
I recommend soldering wires to the contacts on the PCB , routing them to whichever side of the board they need to end up on , lightly hot - gluing the socket in place at the end of the board , then soldering the wires onto the socket .
The order on the socket does not matter , as long as you record it and have the dataglove 's connector match the pinout on the bluetooth module .
When you have finished the socket , add more hot glue to prevent shorts between adjacent contacts on the DIP socket , then put the whole module together .
You may need to drill additional holes for the power switch and bluetooth connect button ; I also needed an extra plastic collar around the DIP socket to make the enclosure look neater .
I also drilled a final hole for the blue / orange status LED , which lights during the connection process , warns of low battery , and is off during normal operation .
A final detail is the velcro wrist strap , which I hot - glued to the bottom of my module , but which you might wish to attach more securely .
I 'm debating adding a second strap or centering the first strap .
Note the charging pins and center disconnect hole in the picture below .

3.4 . Constructing the Glove
While the glove itself is not the most challenging piece of Clove 2 to construct , it is ( to my knowledge ) the most novel .
Two categories of steps are needed to construct the finished glove , soldering of the flexible connector between glove and bluetooth module , and the sewing of the conductive traces on the glove .
I will begin with the process of soldering the connector , then move on to sewing the traces , a simple but tedious task .
You should have two pieces of perfboard , as indicated in the parts list above .
Both should have the traces going the SHORT way , ie , parallel to the short edge and perpendicular to the long edge .
For the 8x14 hole board , simple slice carefully down the center of the board , cutting every trace into two .
The board should have two rows of 14 traces , each of which covers 4 holes .
Begin by snapping your row of metal pins into two 12 - pin pieces , and soldering them into the perfboard .
They should be two holes apart , as you can see from the picture below , so that two holes remain between each pin and the outer edge of the board .
The long side of the pin and the plastic piece should be on the non-copper side of the perfboard .
Next , cut 24 pieces of wire off the IDE cable ( or other ribbon cable ) , each of which should be at least 6 to 8 inches long , depending on how far you want the bluetooth module from the glove .
Solder each of the wires into the board .
In order to ensure the best connection , I stripped each piece of wire by about 1/2 " , inserted it into the copper - clad side right next to its corresponding pin ( but on the outside , closer to the edge of the board ) , then brought the end back through in the same row at the outermost hole , then soldered the whole thing on the copper - clad side .
when you finish , all 24 wires should be connected , and there should be no shorts between adjacent pins .
Check with an ohmmeter or continuity tester if unsure .
In my glove , I only needed 4 of the rows and 14 of the columns from the original keyboard , so I only bothered soldering 18 wires .
You may wish to do this , or attached all 24 wires to allow for future expansion of the glove .
Hot - glue the wires to the perfboard for extra strength , then bind the wires together right next to the perfboard .
Hold off on binding the wires along the rest of their length until after you solder the board on the other end .
You 'll want to prepare the second piece of perfboard , 8x21 holes , as shown in the following diagram and image .
Note that the traces have first been sliced down the center , then every other trace remove careful with a boxcutter .
Do n't cut yourself doing this ; I nearly did several times .
Dataglove Conductive Traces ( 42.61KB )
Before you begin to solder the wires to this second board , you must do a bit of preparation beside razoring the traces .
Note from the photos below that the long edges are cut halfway through the outermost hole , which will guide the thread without requiring the thread to be passed through a hole .
Use a dremel , sanding block , Xacto knife , or your tool of choice to trim the long edges of the board .
Now you can begin to attach the wires .
I used a piece of solder to temporarily bind the wires near this second board to get a sense of the required length , then cut the wires , stripped 1/2 " , passed the end through the hole closest to the center ( copper - clad side ) , and then up again at the next hole towards the edge , as with the perfboard on the other end .
I then trimmed , soldered , and hot glued the wires in place .
It is in this step that you must make sure the row and column order matches the layout in the Conductive Traces diagram linked above .
Once you have soldered and glued all 18 or 24 wires , use the black thread ( or your preferred method ) to bind the wires at several places along the cables 's length .
Keep in mind that the cable will need to flex as you move your hand , so try to aim for a compromise between strength and flexibility .
Now begins the least engineering - oriented part , sewing the glove .
The first step is to use a thin needle with a small hole to fasten the perfboard to the back of the dataglove .
A small note : I made a right - handed glove .
If you wish to make a left - handed glove , you must reverse everything in the Dataglove Conductive Traces diagram .
Other than that , the instructions remain the same .
USe the black thread to sew in and out of the holes where the traces have been removed .
Do not cross any of the traces with the thread .
When you finish , knot the thread inside the glove , cut , and secure with a dab of hot glue .
You may wish to do each corner as a separate thread , and perhaps sew in the middle as well , for the most robust and strong attachment .
With this in place , the only remaining step is to use the conductive thread to make the glove traces and contacts .
In the diagram below , note the small loops of black thread .
I went through several ( ~6 - 8 ) times to ensure the board would not come loose .
Every trace is sewn in essentially the same way .
I recommend starting with the contacts on the fingernails of the index and middle fingers , move on to the twelve finger contacts , then finish with the three thumb contacts and the palm contact .
Begin by figuring out where the contact should end and the trace from the contact to the perfboard should start .
Start sewing here , and sew the thread alternately in and out of the fabric until you reach the perfboard .
It should follow the rough path laid out in the Conductive Traces diagram above .
Several notes : first , the thread frays very easily , so try not to undo too much and redo .
If you must , use a new piece of thread , for as the thread frays , its conductivity decreases dramatically .
Also , it is vitally important that each thread not touch any of its neighbors , as shorts will render the glove useless ( since multiple contacts will be connected ) .
Use an ohmmeter , a continuity tester , or even a battery and an LED to make sure adjacent threads are not electrically connected .
Also , to ensure that the tension in the thread is correct , I found it helpful to sew the traces while wearing the glove .
If you 'd rather not stick yourself every once in a while or can't sew left handed , at least pull the fingers and cuff of the glove every once in a while to stretch the glove so there 's some slight slack in the thread when you let go .
Once you reach the perfboard , switch to a needle small enough to fit smoothly through the holes in the perfboard .
Sew up through the first hole in , then down at the edge in the semicircle you created by shaving the long edges of the PCB , and repeat two or three times .
Make sure the thread is tight enough to make a good connection to the copper trace , which you should verify with your handy continuity tester / ohmmeter / LED and battery , then dab on some hot glue to hold the thread in place on both the inside and top of the perfboard , and cut the thread .
Now you should sew the contact on the other end of the thread .
If you examine my photos below closely , you 'll see I sewed in X shapes , which seems to provide the most reliable contacts .
You 'll have to cut the thread off the spool before beginning this part , so make sure you leave yourself enough length of thread .
When you finish , bring the thread to the inside , dab on some glue , and cut the thread .
If you 're really thorough , loose the end along the trace towards the perfboard .
The final step for each trace is to put on a very thin line of hot glue on the thread .
Pull the tip of the glue gun along the thread , barely pressing down on the trigger .
You might need to go over twice or three times to get enough on to cover the thread , but it should remain thin and flexible enough not to hinder movement .
If you 're worried about shorts to other threads on the inside , you can repeat the process inside the glove .
Do this again for all the other traces , and you 'll be done with the glove .
A final note : while I presented a recommended contact placement that works well for my hands , it might not work well for yours .
Consult the 31 - combination chart at the top of this page and make sure you can complete all the combinations comfortably .
If not , you may wish to change where the contacts are placed or how the glove is mapped .
3.5 . Constructing the Charger
The charging circuit in the charging dock for Clove 2 is fairly simple , and based on an original charger design by Scott Henion of SHDesigns , designed in 2003 .
The circuit for Clove 2 is designed to work with a 3.7v LiPoly battery pack under no load , as the original keyboard used was designed for a pair of AA batteries .
The charging circuit will properly charge the battery pack , varying current so that it remains full while protecting against overcharging .
To create the charging dock :
Begin by creating the circuit board , as per the schematic and layout below .
Note in the layout that the red double lines indicate where you should cut the perfboard traces to break the circuit ( check with a continuity tester that the connection is actually broken ) .
Also be aware that the voltage regulator and transistors can be damaged by heat , so try to minimize the solder time for these components .
In my design , I brought the LED off - board so I could mount it on the front of my charging dock , but you may wish to keep it on the PCB .
Dataglove Charger Schematic ( 25.63KB )
Dataglove Charger Layout ( 32.65KB )
Next , create the dock structure .
It should have two contacts to touch the two charge points on the bottom of the bluetooth module , and a long plastic pin to fit into the bluetooth module 's disconnect hole .
I used more 5.25 " plastic drive bays to build my dock , but you may wish to use other materials as per personal preference .
Finally , mount the PCB into the dock ( I hot - glued it to the back of the unit ) , and solder the output wires onto the charging contacts .
Make sure that the polarity matches the polarity of the bluetooth module ; for my design , the negative contact was closer to the center on one side , and the positive contact was near the edge on the other side .
Make sure that the plastic disconnect properly opens the normally - closed switch inside the bluetooth module .
Mount the DC power jack , solder it on , then plug it into the 9v adapter and connect a multimeter to the output contacts in the dock .
Adjust the multimeter until the potential across the output pins is exactly 4.2 v , the correct charging voltage for a 3.7v Lithium Polymer battery .
3.6 . Software
As detailed above , the software that translates keypresses detected by the glove into keypresses on the host system is fairly simple .
I wrote a Windows script for a program called AutoHotkey , freeware for most versions of Windows ( but not * nix or Mac OS ) .
I plan to eventually create ports to ( almost definitely ) * nix and ( possibly ) Mac OS .
The source code of the script can be downloaded at the link below .
Note that while this will work properly only with the module from the Dell Bluetooth Keyboard that I used , a few simple edits to correct the keys corresponding to each of the 31 finger combinations will suffice to modify it for any keyboard .

The head of the European Central Bank should be running the Federal Reserve because he is doing a better job at protecting his economy , investor Jim Rogers , CEO of Rogers Holdings , told " Squawk Box Europe " on Friday .
European Central Bank President Jean - Claude
Trichet can be depended on to fight inflation , which is a worse evil than recession , Rogers told " Squawk Box Europe . "
The economic stimulus packages announced in the U.S. and Japan this year will plunge the countries in a prolonged period of economic decline , because they will create inflation and will prevent the cleansing of the economies he said , adding " recessions are like forest fires . "
" I 'm afraid we 're just extending things out and we , too , are going to have a lost decade , " Rogers said .
" We 've been having investment bankers going bankrupt for a few hundred years .
There are a lot of 29 years - old out there are driving Maseratis , let them turn in their Maseratis . "
Standing in a cavernous hall in the headquarters of the evangelical group Focus on the Family , Lisa Anderson has some bad news for John McCain .
' This is going to be an interesting election , ' she said with a smile .
The phrase conveys a stark warning to the Republican candidate .
Focus on the Family , where Anderson is a director , is one of the most powerful evangelical groups in America .
Many of its supporters - and millions of other US evangelicals - helped elect George W Bush twice , giving him their votes and volunteering for his campaign .
McCain , who desperately needs their votes , would like them to support him , too .
But many evangelicals neither trust nor like McCain .
Nowhere illustrates McCain 's problem with evangelical voters better than Colorado Springs , in the shadow of the Rocky Mountains .
Dubbed ' the Vatican of the evangelical movement ' , the city is headquarters for more than 100 Christian organisations , ranging from mega-churches with 10,000 - strong congregations to Focus on the Family , whose radio broadcasts reach 200 million listeners around the world each day .
Many evangelicals visit Focus 's huge headquarters on holiday , inspired by its message of being against abortion , gay marriage and the morality of Hollywood .
But one person who has not yet made the pilgrimage is McCain , for Focus 's founder , James Dobson , has pointedly not endorsed him , despite backing Bush in 2004 .
That position is not likely to change .
' I do n't think we will see the trend in that direction , ' said Anderson .
McCain 's problems with attracting evangelical votes are long - standing .
In 2000 , after defeat in South Carolina against Bush , he railed against evangelical leaders as ' agents of intolerance ' .
Unlike Bush , he makes few references to his personal faith .
He has not supported banning stem cell research , but has promoted campaign finance reform that evangelicals oppose and attacked a federal law banning gay marriage .
Kay Parsons , a housewife shopping in a Colorado Springs mall , summed up evangelical attitudes : ' I do n't really trust him . '
Parsons , who voted Bush in 2004 , is not sure she will vote for McCain .
' I am not happy with any of the choices in front of me , ' she said .
The size of the evangelical community ensures its voice must be listened to .
In the post room of Focus on the Family , dozens of workers sift through the mail , which can be as much as 150,000 items a day .
Such power and influence mean evangelicals are a voting bloc McCain cannot write off .
His campaign is bombarding 600 nationwide leaders with regular emails and appeals for help .
Plans have been drawn up to mobilise the evangelical vote in 18 vital states .
His top staff , like senior aide Charlie Black , have regular meetings with evangelical leaders .
It might work .
McCain 's record on the key issue for many conservative evangelicals - abortion - is solidly hostile .
' The evangelical community will come around in the end , ' said Steve Mitchell , a political pollster and chairman of Mitchell Research .
' Some leaders have not endorsed him yet because they are just tough negotiators .
They are playing politics . '
Yet McCain 's problems have led to speculation about a narrowing ' God gap ' between Republicans and Democrats .
Some of Barack Obama 's aides believe they can move into the evangelical bloc and win over many of the voters that elected Bush .
In Chicago last week Obama met 30 religious leaders , including the Rev TD Jakes , pastor of a Dallas mega- church .
His staff also held the first fundraiser for Obama by a new group of evangelicals called the Matthew 25 Network .
Democrats may also benefit from profound changes in the evangelical community , estimated to comprise almost one in four voters .
In recent years many churches and leaders have embraced issues such as poverty , Aids and environmentalism that differ from the usual Republican platform .
In recent weeks TV viewers have been watching ads warning about climate change featuring the unlikely duo of the left - wing Rev Al Sharpton and rightwinger Pat Robertson .
Recently more than 100 leading evangelicals issued a new manifesto , one of the key points of which called for a return to a more purely religious identity .
The document was an implicit rejection of the evangelical activism effectively harnessed by the Republican party .
This national story has been mirrored in Colorado City .
Its largest church is the New Life Church founded by the Rev Ted Haggard , a preacher who boasted about having weekly chats with Bush .
New Life was a potent symbol of rising evangelical power in the White House .
But Haggard 's prominence collapsed following a gay sex scandal .
Now New Life 's minister is the Rev Brady Boyd , who has rebuilt the church on non-political grounds and has stated he will not suggest who his flock should vote for .
Many evangelical voters could be swing voters or even be prepared to go Democratic .
But experts believe Obama also faces problems , especially after the scandal over the incendiary speeches of the Rev Jeremiah Wright , his former pastor .
Wright 's religious vision was born in America 's black churches and is in a very different tradition from most evangelism .
Mitchell believes the Wright debacle will ensure that McCain will win over the constituency .
Nevertheless , McCain 's problems still leave him walking a tightrope .
He needs evangelical voters , but also needs to retain his appeal to the more moderate middle ground .
McCain was recently forced to renounce the endorsements of two religious leaders because of their past extremist statements on Islam and Jews .
McCain may find that his balancing act between the Republican base and the middle ground becomes impossible .
Take two Colorado City women : Susan Henderson and Cindy Smith .
Both were Bush voters in 2004 .
Both distrust McCain .
' I am pro-choice and he's not , ' said Henderson .
Smith said : ' I 'm the conservative type .
McCain is a bit too much for the other side . '
Neither would say she would definitely vote for McCain in November .
Nor would they reject Obama outright .
As Anderson said , when it comes to the evangelical vote it is going to be an ' interesting ' - and crucial - battle .
Pelosi to protesters : " Can we drill your brains ? "
House Democratic leaders and protesters waving McCain signs had a war of words Tuesday at a press event outside an old train station .
The demonstrators interrupted House Speaker Nancy Pelosi with chants of “ Drill here !
Drill now ! ”
Pelosi paused and asked the group , “ Right here ? ”
Seeming to enjoy the back and forth , she followed with another question : “ Can we drill your brains ? ”
She went on to refer to the protesters , who continued to chant sporadically , as “ handmaidens of Big Oil . ”
Arguing that increased offshore drilling would reduce gas prices by only a couple of pennies a decade from now , she referred to the demonstrators as the “ 2- cents-in-10 - years - crowd . ”
Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer swiped at the demonstrators , too , saying that “ sophomoric chanting ” wo n’t solve the energy crisis and that “ all thinking Americans know ” — stressing the word " thinking " and looking at the crowd — that America does n’t have a quarter of the word ’s fossil fuels yet uses a quarter of the world ’s energy .

WASHINGTON – More than 22,000 veterans have sought help from a special suicide hot line in its first year , and 1,221 suicides have been averted , the government says .
According to a recent RAND Corp. study , roughly one in five soldiers returning from Iraq and Afghanistan displays symptoms of post - traumatic stress disorder , putting them at a higher risk for suicide .
Researchers at Portland State University found that male veterans are twice as likely to commit suicide than men who are not veterans .
This month , a former Army medic , Joseph Dwyer , who was shown in a Military Times photograph running through a battle zone carrying an Iraqi boy , died of an accidental overdose after struggling with post - traumatic stress disorder for almost five years .

MONTREAL–Organized criminals in Canada are going green , turning to environmental crime as an increasingly lucrative way to raise money .
A report released yesterday by Criminal Intelligence Service Canada says crime networks have developed underground markets for electronic waste and scarce natural resources .
The annual survey of organized crime , compiled from local police reports across the country , indicates criminals are using such markets to complement traditional revenue sources , such as narcotics .
" Criminal networks can profit by collecting e-waste in developed countries such as Canada and selling it to ' recyclers ' in developing nations , " the service reports .
" This practice is a violation of both Canadian and international law . "
The report does not put a dollar figure on illegal trafficking and disposal of computers , televisions and cellphones but warns such activity will peak , starting next year , as digital broadcast norms take effect in Canada and the United States , making millions of TVs obsolete .
" One of the reasons organized crime has been as successful as it is , is that they 're ( leaders are ) very adaptable and it's not like they 've given up any of their traditional markets , " said RCMP Commissioner William Elliott , who chairs the intelligence service .
Asked to outline the scope of illegal e-waste , Elliott said : " If it was n't lucrative , organized crime groups would n't be involved in it . "
A United Nations environment program estimates 20 million to 50 million tonnes of e-waste is generated worldwide every year .
On top of financing criminal networks , authorities are concerned about how black - market recyclers handle defunct electronics .
" We 're realizing that in terms of sales of laptops and electronic devices to organized crime there is often damage to the environment and it's a national concern , " said Robert Chartrand , a Montreal police investigator who heads Quebec 's bureau of the service .
Often extremely toxic , much of Canada 's e-waste ends up in Asia and Africa to be mined for parts .
But the environmental threat represented by organized crime also extends to our natural resources .
CISC notes that criminal networks have taken up illegal poaching and resource exploitation .
" Canadian forests are vulnerable to illegal harvesting due to their relative abundance , isolation , and the large number of logging access roads , " the report says .
Canada 's vast wilderness is an easy target in the hunt for black market prices on rare animals .
" Illegal trade in wildlife can be as profitable as dealing in narcotics , " the UN program said earlier this year .
As it did last year , CISC identified close to 900 criminal groups in Canada , operating mainly in the British Columbia lower mainland , southern Ontario and Montreal .

McCain adviser suggests that Republican campaign would benefit from another 9/11 attack
By Patrick Martin
25 June 2008
A senior adviser to the presumptive Republican presidential nominee , John McCain , in the course of an interview with Fortune magazine made public Monday , declared that a new terrorist attack like September 11 , 2001 would be good for his candidate ’s electoral prospects .
Such an event “ certainly would be a big advantage to him , ” declared Charles R. Black Jr. , in a comment that even the monthly business magazine felt compelled to describe as “ startling . ”
Black added that the assassination last December of former Pakistan Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto , while “ unfortunate , ” had given McCain a boost in the final days before the New Hampshire primary , by focusing public attention on a major international crisis .
“ His knowledge and ability to talk about it reemphasized that this is the guy who ’s ready to be Commander - in - Chief .
And it helped us , ” Black said .
Within hours of the publication of his comments on the magazine ’s web site , Black ’s views were being disavowed by McCain .
Black eventually appeared before a press gathering on Monday afternoon to make the ritual “ apology ” that is always offered as a signal that those doing the apologizing want to shut down any further public discussion .
But McCain himself has made remarks analogous to those of Black .
On the day of Bhutto ’s murder , he told CNN there might be a positive impact on his struggling campaign for the Republican nomination .
“ I ’m the one with the experience , the knowledge and the judgment , ” he said in an interview with CNN anchor Dana Bash .
“ So perhaps it may serve to enhance those credentials . ”
Press reports on Tuesday noted that McCain had made a similar comment in 2004 , when he described a video released by Osama bin Laden , on the eve of the presidential vote , as “ very helpful ” to the reelection of President Bush .
In the same Fortune article that quoted Black , McCain was asked to name “ the biggest single threat to the American economy . ”
He answered by citing , not unemployment , financial collapse , exploding oil prices or the huge trade deficit , but another terrorist attack .
“ I would think that the absolute gravest threat is the struggle that we ’re in against radical Islamic extremism , which can affect , if they prevail , our very existence , ” he said .
“ Another successful attack on the United States of America could have devastating consequences . ”
Besides the bizarre character of the suggestion that a handful of Islamic fundamentalist terrorists could “ prevail ” or threaten the “ very existence ” of the United States , the comment demonstrates that McCain is running a one - note campaign , in which the answer to every issue and every problem is the “ war on terror . ”
Now trailing by significant margins in opinion polls — a Bloomberg / Los Angeles Times poll published Tuesday put him behind Obama by 15 points —
McCain sees his only chance of success is to , quite literally , terrify the American people into electing him president .
Obama campaign spokesman Bill Burton called Black ’s comments “ a complete disgrace . ”
But he went on to use the controversy as an occasion for burnishing Obama ’s own credentials as commander - in - chief in the “ war on terror . ”
Burton said , “ Barack Obama will turn the page on these failed policies and this cynical and divisive brand of politics so that we can unite this nation around a common purpose to finish the fight against al - Qaeda . ”
There was no effort , either by the Democratic candidate or the media , to explore the real significance of Black ’s remark .
This is anything but a “ gaffe , ” or rather , the gaffe is that Black blurted out something that is widely discussed in the inner circles of the McCain campaign , the Republican Party and the Bush White House — and , more than likely , in the highest echelons of the Pentagon and CIA as well — but which is not intended for public consumption .
As Fox News correspondent Carl Cameron observed Tuesday , Black “ got in trouble for saying what everyone is talking about . ”
Black is a long - time Republican Party operative , who has also served as a Washington lobbyist for a who ’s who of right - wing dictatorships and political gangsters .
He entered national politics as the political director of Young Americans for Freedom , the far - right organization that opposed the mass movement of youth and students against the Vietnam War , and then worked for the first Senate campaign of ultra-rightist Jesse Helms in North Carolina in 1972 .
Black became the founding chairman of the National Conservative Political Action Committee , and rose to become political director of the Republican National Committee , where he mentored Lee Atwater , the principal political hit - man for President George H. W. Bush , and Karl Rove , who played the same role for the younger President Bush ..
Black was a top adviser to the presidential campaign of Ronald Reagan in 1980 , when the Republican Party was fearful that the Carter administration would pull off an “ October surprise ” — such as obtaining the release of the US Embassy hostages being held in Iran — that might tip the balance in the election .
There have long been reports that Reagan representatives headed by William Casey , later head of the CIA , met with Iranian officials in Paris to make sure that no such deal was struck .
The Iranian regime held the hostages until the final hours of the Carter administration , releasing them only as Reagan took the oath of office .
With the Republicans in power , Black sought to cash in financially , founding the lobbying firm of Black , Manafort and Stone , which became the Washington representative of such right - wing dictators as Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire , Ferdinand Marcos of the Philippines , Mohamed Siad Barre of Somalia and Nigerian Gen. Ibrahim Babangida .
Black ’s most prominent international client was Jonas Savimbi , whose anticommunist UNITA movement , backed by the Reagan administration and apartheid South Africa , waged a brutal war against the Cuban - backed nationalist regime in Angola .
In the mid-1990s , Black ’s lobbying firm acquired another prominent “ dissident ” as a client : Ahmed Chalabi , the exiled Iraqi banker and convicted swindler , whose Iraqi National Congress fed false information about Baghdad ’s alleged “ weapons of mass destruction ” and lobbied ceaselessly for a US invasion of Iraq .
Black ’s activities were not merely mercenary .
He was motivated by reactionary politics and loyalty to the American state machine .
He told the Washington Post in a recent interview that he had never represented foreign governments and political movements “ without first talking to the State Department and the White House and clearing with them that the work would be in the interest of US foreign policy . ”
These undoubted connections to the US military - intelligence apparatus , as well as Black ’s long history in the concoction of right - wing political provocations , lend a particularly sinister character to the latest incident .
It is not just a matter that Black has breached political decorum by making a public estimate of the potential political impact of a major terrorist attack , as the limited media coverage of the dispute and the Obama campaign ’s denunciation of the “ politics of fear ” suggest .
The question not asked by either the media or the Democrats is whether , having determined that a terrorist attack would benefit the McCain campaign , sections of the state apparatus and the Bush administration are actively preparing such an event , either by permitting an ongoing conspiracy to unfold unobstructed — as was likely the case on 9/11 itself — or by actively engineering such an atrocity .
There is nothing farfetched about such a conjecture .
On the contrary , many of Black ’s own international clients engaged in such activities — planting bombs , staging phony “ terrorist ” attacks , concocting pretexts for arresting political opponents or suspending elections .
The US intelligence apparatus , of course , has long experience in such methods of provocation and political manipulation , as do the Israeli secret services .
As with the prospect of US or Israeli air strikes on Iran , or some other reckless military adventure , during the months leading up to the election , the driving force of events is not the conduct of some foreign enemy — Al Qaeda , Iran , Syria , etc. — but the ever - deepening crisis of American capitalism itself .
The political representatives of the American ruling elite — and this includes the Democratic Party and Senator Obama , just as much as the Republicans and McCain — have no policy to alleviate the growth of unemployment and inflation , to halt a financial crisis whose dimensions are consistently underestimated by the media , or to assuage the seething discontent among tens of millions of working people who face an increasingly difficult struggle to survive .
Increasingly , the financial aristocracy is turning to methods of war and provocation to distract and disorient the public and create a political climate in which any expression of social discontent can be demonized and suppressed .
This is the real meaning of the comments of Charles Black .

Introduction
Creationists have often been criticized for failing to present original research and evidence that would overthrow our contemporary view of human origins in favor of another .
However , this is not an entirely fair accusation .
The creation " science " field known as OOPARTS , or " Out Of Place ARTifactS " is a lively area of study with numerous examples .
This paper will examine the most popular and least understood specimen , the Coso Artifact .
The Discovery
The story of the Coso Artifact has been embellished over the years , but nearly all accounts of the actual discovery are basically unchanged .
On February 13 , 1961 , Wallace Lane , Virginia Maxey , and Mike Mikesell were seeking interesting mineral specimens , particularly geodes , for their " LM & V Rockhounds Gem and Gift Shop " in Olancha , California .
On this particular day , the trio were about six miles northeast of Olancha , near the top of a peak about 4,300 feet in elevation and about 340 feet above the dry bed of Owens Lake .
According to Maxey , " We hiked about three miles north , after we had parked some five miles east of State Highway 395 , south of Olancha , California . "
At lunchtime , after collecting rocks most of the morning , all three placed their specimens in the rock sack Mikesell was carrying .
The next day in the gift shop 's workroom , Mikesell ruined a nearly new diamond saw blade while cutting what he thought was a geode .
Inside the nodule that was cut , Mikesell did not find a cavity as so many geodes have , but a perfectly circular section of very hard , white material that appeared to be porcelain .
In the center of the porcelain cylinder , was a 2 - millimeter shaft of bright metal .
The metal shaft responded to a magnet .
There were still other odd qualities about the specimen .
The outer layer of the specimen was encrusted with fossil shells and their fragments .
In addition to shells , the discoverers noticed two nonmagnetic metallic metal objects in the crust , resembling a nail and a washer .
Stranger still , the inner layer was hexagonal and seemed to form a casing around the hard porcelain cylinder .
Within the inner layer , a layer of decomposing copper surrounded the porcelain cylinder .
The Initial Investigations
Very little is known about the initial physical inspections of the artifact .
According to discoverer Virginia Maxey , a geologist she spoke with who examined the fossil shells encrusting the specimen said the nodule had taken at least 500,000 years to attain its present form .
However , the identity of the first geologist is still a mystery , and his findings were never officially published .
Another investigation was conducted by creationist Ron Calais .
Calais is the only other individual known to have physically inspected the artifact , and was allowed to take photographs of the nodule in both X ray and natural light .
Calais 's X rays brought interest in the artifact to a new level .
The X ray of the upper end of the object seemed to reveal some sort of tiny spring or helix .
INFO Journal Publisher Ronald J. Willis speculated that it could actually be " the remains of a corroded piece of metal with threads . "
The other half of the artifact revealed a sheath of metal , presumably copper , covering the porcelain cylinder .
The Artifact : Where Is It Now ?
The last known individual to possess the Coso Artifact was one of the original discoverers , Wallace Lane .
According to the Spring 1969 issue of INFO Journal , Lane was the last known person to possess the object .
It was on display in his home , but he adamantly refused to allow anyone to examine it .
However , he had a standing offer to sell it for $ 25,000 .
In September 1999 , a national search was attempted to locate any of the original discoverers , but the attempt was fruitless .
The authors of this article suspect that Wallace Lane is dead , and the location of the artifact is unknown , possibly destroyed .
Virginia Maxey is alive , but is avoiding any public comment .
The whereabouts of Mike Mikesell are still unknown .
Fantastic Speculations
Ever since the artifact was first discovered , numerous individuals have speculated about its mysterious origin and possible use .
Virginia Maxey speculated that " one possibility is that it is barely 100 years old - something that lay in a mud bed , then got baked and hardened by the sun in a matter of a few years . "
However it was Maxey who supplied the claim that the artifact could be at least 500,000 years old .
" Or else it is an instrument as old as legendary Mu or Atlantis .
Perhaps it is a communications device or some sort of directional finder or some instrument made to utilize power principles we know nothing about . "
INFO Journal editor Paul J. Willis speculated that the artifact was some sort of spark plug .
His brother found the suggestion extraordinary .
" I was thunderstruck , " he wrote , " for suddenly all the parts seemed to fit .
The object sliced in two shows a hexagonal part , a porcelain or ceramic insulator with a central metallic shaft - the basic components of any spark plug . "
However , the two could not reconcile the upper end featuring a " spring " , " helix " , or " metal threads " with any contemporary spark plug .
So the mystery continued .
The artifact even appeared briefly at the end of an " In Search Of ... " episode hosted by Leonard Nimoy .
The Internet offers a plethora of other opinions on the subject .
While most websites simply report the mystery as described earlier , some have taken to speculate on the purpose and origin of such a device .
Brian Wood , described as " International Director of MICAP ( Multinational Investigations Cooperative on Aerial Phenomena ) and Producer / Director of The Paranet Continuum Radio Program " suggested that if it is n't simply a spark plug , " My guess would be some sort of antenna .
The construction reminds me of modern attempts at superconductors .
Wonder if anyone 's tried replicating the thing using ceramic superconductors and then cooling the thing off with liquid nitrogen to see what happens . "
( Source : http://emerald.oz.net/jz/sphinxt.html September 10 , 1999 ) .
Joe Held 's " Joe 's UFOs and Space Mysteries " thinks the device " looks similar to a small capacitor with several different materials .
The object is roughly the size of an auto spark plug .
Since the formation of geodes can take millions of years this was a very curious find indeed . "
( Source : http://members.tripod.com/J_Kidd/index.html September 10 , 1999 ) .
The Creationists and the Artifact
With such outrageous speculation , individuals familiar with the creation / evolution controversy would assume that fundamentalist Christians would stay far away from such artifacts and stories .
But this is far from the case .
Numerous creationists have been involved with this artifact since its discovery .
As noted earlier , Ron Calais was involved with the Coso Artifact since its initial discovery .
Calais was the individual responsible for the natural light and X ray photographs of the artifact .
He also brought the Coso Artifact to the attention of the Charles Fort Society , publisher of INFO Journal , whose 1969 article is the primary source for information on this object to date .
Calais is still a contributor to creationism and most recently had a paper published in the June 1996 edition of the Creation Research Society Quarterly ( " Slippery Phylogenies : Evolutionary Speculations on the Origin of Frogs " , by Ron Calais and A.W. Mehlert , pp. 44-48 . ) .
Creation Outreach , a Spokane , Washington based creationism ministry promotes the artifact on their website ( source : http://www.ior.com/~kjc/pages/strange.htm
September 22 , 1999 ) by reprinting an article by J.R. Jochmans .
Jochman 's article on the Creation Outreach 's website , originally available through the national Bible - Science Association concluded , " As a whole , the ' Coso artifact ' is now believed to be something more than a piece of machinery :
The carefully shaped ceramic , metallic shaft and copper components hint at some form of electrical instrument .
The closest modern apparatus that researchers have been able to equate it with is a spark plug .
However , there are certain features - particularly the spring or helix terminal - that does [ sic ] not correspond to any known spark plug today . "
Creation Outreach member Jim Marisch is known to have lectured in local Spokane public school classrooms , but it is unknown if he specifically mentioned the artifact in question .
Nevertheless , students exposed to Creation Outreach would inevitably be redirected to their website for further information .
It should also be noted that according to a letter printed in " Atlantis Arising " , J.R. Jochmans claims to have ghost - written three quarters of the book " Secrets of the Lost Races " by Rene Noorbergen .
" Secrets of the Lost Races " has often been cited as a reference for the Coso Artifact by young - earth creationists .
Carl Baugh , a young - earth creationist whose claim to fame is the promotion of the Paluxy River Tracks , notes the Coso Artifact in his online dissertation ( source : http://home.texoma.net/~linesden/cem/diss/diss2.htm
October 10 , 1999 ) using material from Noorbergen 's " Secrets of the Lost Races . "
Elsewhere in the Pacific Northwest , the Institute for Creation Research has been heavily promoting the Coso Artifact through its adjunct faculty member , Dr. Donald Chittick .
According to his own literature , Chittick , a Newberg , Oregon resident , holds a Ph.D. in physical chemistry and has taught at the University of Puget Sound and George Fox College .
Dr. Chittick is also an active lecturer , having traveled in the United State and Canada for the past 20 years , speaking before students both public and private about creationism .
In 1981 , he was one of five " creation scientists " who testified in pretrial depositions for the Arkansas " Balanced Treatment Act " , which required that " creation science " be taught along with evolutionary biology in that state 's public schools .
And in 1993 , his lecture to public high school students in Stanwood , Washington led to a community furor , threats from the ACLU , and a subsequent shakeup in the local school board .
Though he claims to have little to do with the ICR , Dr. Chittick encourages audiences at his lectures to join the ICR , sells their literature , and signs up interested parties for the ICR 's mailing list .
Most recently , Donald Chittick delivered his " Puzzle of Ancient Man " lecture on March 9 , 1999 , in Winnipeg , Manitoba .
The event was sponsored by the ICR as part of their " Case for Creation " lecture series .
According to the ICR , adjunct faculty members are " expected to be of high moral character and personal integrity , firmly committed to the ICR Tenets and Educational Philosophy . "
" The Puzzle of Ancient Man " lecture is basically a summary of Chittick 's book of the same title .
Like the book , Chittick begins his lecture by presenting the Coso Artifact as evidence that ancient civilizations were extremely advanced .
Presuming that it is an ancient spark plug , Chittick explains , " A spark plug is evidence of fairly sophisticated development .
Reliable dates for such finds are difficult to obtain .
However , it has been commonly assumed that formation of geodes requires significant amounts of time .
Finding a spark plug in a rock considered to be very old would indeed give it the label of an out - of - place artifact .
Evidence of advanced technology , like spark plugs , should not , according to evolutionism , be discovered in old rocks . "
Problems with the Artifact Story
Creationist and other proponents of the artifact have woven a riveting story .
But a multitude of problems regarding the claims and recent discoveries have cast a much different picture .
The Geologic Evidence : Is the Coso Artifact Encased in a Geode ?
When it comes to the geologic evidence , the most stunning claim is that the artifact was discovered in a geode .
As Donald Chittick has noted , formation of a geode requires significant amounts of time .
But what is often overlooked is that the Coso Artifact possesses no characteristics that would classify it as a geode .
It is true that the original discoverers were looking for geodes on the day the artifact was found .
But this alone is insufficient evidence that the artifact is a geode .
Geodes consists of a thin outer shell , composed of dense chalcedonic silica , and are filled with a layer of quartz crystals .
The Coso Artifact does not possess either feature .
Discoverer Virginia Maxey referred to the material covering the artifact as " hardened clay " and noted that it had picked up a miscellaneous collection of pebbles , including a " nail and washer . "
Analysis of the surface material is noted as having a hardness of Mohs 3 , which is not very hard and certainly much softer than chalcedony .
Other arguments regarding the ancient source of the Coso Artifact focus on the alleged fossil shells encrusted on the surface .
As noted earlier , if a nail and washer were also found on the surface , the significance of the fossil shells is seriously diminished .
Even creationist literature notes how surface materials can lead to mistaken assumptions about the true age of individual objects .
Creation Ex Nihilo's June - August 1998 issue features fence wire that had become encased by surface materials including " fossil " seashells ( quotes in the original article ) .
The Artifact Itself : What Is It ?
As noted earlier , numerous individuals have speculated about the apparent purpose of the Coso Artifact .
The most popular suggestion is that it is some sort of spark plug , designed and manufactured by an advanced civilization eons ago for technological devices equal to or surpassing our own .
But as mentioned earlier , there 's no reason to assume that the artifact was manufactured thousands of years ago .
Some have half - heartedly suggested that the device could have been a contemporary spark plug circa 1961 .
But ancient artifact proponents point to the X ray of the top half , which indicates some type of tiny spring or helix mechanism .
The content of this X ray , they argue , runs contrary to what we know about contemporary spark plugs .
A clue to what is revealed in the X ray lies in one of the earliest articles about the artifact .
In the Spring 1969 issue of INFO Journal , Ronald Willis suggested that the upper end of the object " is actually the remains of a corroded piece of metal with threads . "
The Willis brothers seriously suspected the object was a contemporary spark plug , but were still unable to explain what was in the X ray .
Spark plugs of the 1960 's era typically terminated with no visible threading and tapered to a dull point .
Though many of the interested parties agreed that the artifact bore a striking resemblance to a twentieth - century spark plug , no one seems to have considered the idea of evolution - specifically , spark plug evolution .
In the course of investigating the origins of the Coso Artifact , it was determined that mining operations were conducted in the area of discovery early in the twentieth century .
This discovery lead to the tantalizing possibility that primitive combustion engines were used for various purposes in the Coso mountain range .
Combustion engines were a very new technology at this time , and so we extrapolated that spark plug technology would also have been in its infancy .
Even if this assumption were correct , identification of the spark plug in question would seem to be a daunting task .
To help the authors of this article identify the Coso Artifact , they decided to turn to a little - known group of experts - The Spark Plug Collectors of America .
Letters were sent to four different spark plug collectors describing the Coso Artifact , including Ron Calais ' X rays of the object in question .
Collectors were asked if they could identify what they saw in the photos .
The collectors were expected to provide some vague hints , or to not be able to identify the artifact at all .
Their actual answers were stunning .
On September 9 , 1999 , Chad Windham , President of the Spark Plug Collectors of America called Pierre Stromberg of Pacific Northwest Skeptics .
Windham initially suspected that Stromberg was a fellow spark plug collector , writing incognito , with the ostensible motive of hoaxing him .
His fears were compounded by the fact that there is an actual line of spark plugs named " Stromberg . "
Windham had also contacted another spark plug collector , strongly suspecting that he was the culprit , and made a point of looking up the website of Pacific Northwest Skeptics to ensure it actually existed .
Though Stromberg repeatedly assured Windham that his intentions were purely for research , he was puzzled why Windham was so suspicious and asked him to explain .
Windham replied that it was so obvious to him that the artifact was a contemporary spark plug , the letter had to be a hoax .
" I knew what it was the moment I saw the x- rays " Windham stated .
He also added that it was not uncommon at all for spark plug collectors to play pranks on one another .
" Are you sure it 's a spark plug ? " Stromberg asked ?
" There 's no question about it , " Windham replied , barely containing his laughter , " it 's a spark plug . "
Stromberg asked Windham if he could identify the particular make of the spark plug .
Windham replied he was certain that it was a 1920 's era Champion spark plug .
Stromberg was stunned by the collector 's certainty , but Windham insisted that he had nailed the identification .
Windham offered to send two identical spark plugs , the only possible but slight difference being the diameter of the packing nut at the base of the plug .
Stromberg accepted Windham 's offer and a few days later a package arrived in the mail .
Ten days after the phone call with Windham , Pierre Stromberg received a phone call from Bill Bond , founder of the Spark Plug Collectors of America , and curator of a private museum of spark plugs containing more than two thousand specimens .
Bond said he had n't spoken to Windham , but said he thought he knew the identity of the Coso Artifact , " A 1920s Champion spark plug . "
Spark plug collector Mike Healy also concurred with Bond and Windham 's assessment about the spark plug .
The fourth collector , Jeff Bartheld , Vice - President of the Spark Plug Collectors of America contacted Stromberg via postal mail on October 18 , 1999 , and also confirmed that the artifact was a 1920s Champion sparkplug .
To date , there has been no dissent in the spark plug collector community as to the origins of the Coso Artifact .
Since Chad Windham mentioned that spark plug collectors enjoy pulling pranks on one another , the question of deliberate fraud inevitably crops up in relation to the Coso Artifact .
However , there is little hard evidence that the original discoverers intended to deceive anyone from the start .
Pacific Northwest Skeptics investigated the Spark Plug Collectors of America .
The group formed in 1975 , well after the discovery of the artifact , and none of the three discoverers was ever affiliated in any way that the collectors can recall .
Windham and Bond insist that while spark plug collectors enjoy hoaxing one another , they cannot imagine that any of their members would take a prank this far .
Comparisons and Analysis
On September 14 , 1999 , Stromberg received a package from Chad Windham .
Inside the package were the two spark plugs Windham had promised along with an analysis of the specimens .
Windham writes ,
I am enclosing two spark plugs made by Champion Spark Plug company circa - 1920's .
Plug # 1 is 7/8 " - 18 thread .
I have loosely assembled the plug , and chipped the " brass hat " off to show the configuration of it and the porcelain under it .
Plug # 2 is 1/2 " NPT - of same design .
The diameter of the porcelain on Plug # 1 is slightly less than 3/4 " - close to the dimension in your letter .
As you can see the base and packing nut which hold the porcelain , are sealed with a copper and asbestos gasket .
This corresponds with the article .
The center electrode of plugs were made of special alloys which may support " ... cut in two in 1961 but five years afterwards had no tarnishing visible . "
The sketches included clearly show one rib on the upper end of the porcelain , although Champion used two ribs in this era - probably just an artist 's error .
The " top hat matches those of " plug 1 and 2 . "
As for the outer shell , it obviously decayed - probably from salt water ( or other corrosive substance ) and the outer crust is merely some sort of deposit like sea shells or other deposits collected on the deteriorating surfaces of the spark plug base .
There is _NO_ doubt that this is merely an old spark plug .
Most probably , it is a Champion spark plug , similar to the two enclosed .
Windham 's letter did indeed match a careful analysis of the specimens .
Most striking is the brass " top hat " that has so vexed previous attempts to provide a rational explanation for the artifact .
But the similarities are more than skin deep .
Because Windham had chipped the brass top hat off specimen # 1 , the spark plug revealed a metal shaft terminating in a flared end , presumably to help secure the top hat to the plug 's porcelain cylinder .
This revelation led to speculation that such a flared tip could also be visible in the original X ray of the brass hat .
And indeed , as shown at left , the flared end of the metal shaft also appears in the Coso Artifact .
The shaft in the X ray , just below the flare , also reveals deterioration until it meets the porcelain cylinder .
This , too , is exactly what we would expect if the artifact is a 1920s - era Champion spark plug .
An X ray of the authors ' own disassembled specimen reveals a picture very similar to the original X ray of the Coso Artifact .
As with the original artifact , the central metal shaft of both specimens responds to a magnet .
Proponents of fantastic stories regarding the artifact have made mention of mysterious copper rings that encase the porcelain .
But this too can be easily explained .
Specimen # 1 provided by Chad Windham was completely disassembled , revealing a pair of copper rings sandwiching an asbestos lining ( right ) .
According to Windham , this design was necessary because porcelain and steel have vastly differing expansion rates , so the copper was used for compensation purposes .
Specimen # 2 was not disassembled by Windham , but also presented a feature that could explain why the artifact had not been identified decades ago .
Specimen # 2 , though suffering from severe tarnish , came with a top nut screwed into its top hat .
Almost all Champion spark plug advertisements of the first half of the twentieth century showed pictures of their spark plugs including the top nut already screwed into place .
In some cases , the top nut comes in two forms , one of which closely mimics the tip of today 's contemporary spark plugs , which have no threading whatsoever .
So it becomes rather easy to understand why the appearance of threads in the Coso Artifact seemed so puzzling to the original investigators .
Spark plug collectors are quite familiar with spark plugs that have been found in unusual places .
The Summer 1998 issue of " The Igniter , " published by the Spark Plug Collectors of America , features such an item on page 20 .
Collector Joe Cook recounted , " Once while scuba diving , a friend of mine made a rare discovery with his underwater metal detector .
It looks like a ball of barnacles and shells , but has a spark plug top sticking out of it .
Apparently this plug has been under water for quite some time !
He asked me if I still collected plugs .
I said yes and then he asked me if I ever heard of a ' King Neptune ' special .
I said no and headed for the ' Master list ' to look it up .
When I could n't find a ' King Neptune ' special he began to laugh and handed me barnacle covered plug and he said ' bet you do n't have one like this . '
He was right ! "
It should be noted that the corrosion of the Coso Artifact almost completely destroyed any of the iron - alloy - based components , with the exception of the metal shaft encased in the porcelain cylinder .
The samples received from Chad Windham also revealed corrosion of the iron - based components , but the brass top hats were unscathed , with the exception of some tarnishing .
If the Coso Artifact is indeed a 1920s - era Champion spark plug , the X ray of an almost perfectly preserved top hat is exactly what one would expect .
Brass , a copper-zinc alloy is commonly engineered to resist corrosion far better than iron - based alloys .
In harsh environments , copper tends to outlast iron , but still succumbs fairly quickly .
The rates of decay in the Coso Artifact match the rates of decay one would see in a 1920 's era Champion spark plug .
For an excellent review of how ferrous and non-ferrous alloys decay over time , please see " The Elements of Archaeological Conservation " by J.M. Cronyn .
This article includes numerous photographs , including X rays , of contemporary objects that have completely decayed into oxide nodules .
Like the Coso Artifact , these examples also feature empty cavities where the original materials once resided .
Examples include X rays of a nodule containing the perfectly preserved shape of a bolt , plating on a padlock ( including its internal workings ) , and a belt buckle .
The formation of the iron oxide nodule likely was hastened by the fact that corrosive " mineral dust " is blown off of the dry lake bed of Lake Owen and onto the surrounding uplands where the artifact was discovered .
Salts created by the evaporation of the lake water is regularly blown off of the lake bed by local windstorms .
The U.S. Geological Survey has conducted extensive investigations of this phenomena ( Source http://geochange.er.usgs.gov/sw/impacts/geology/owens/
May 31 , 2000 ) .
Finally , as noted earlier , the last known individual in possession of the artifact was Wallace Lane , who was offering it for sale for $ 25,000 .
Bill Bond , a spark plug museum curator was asked how much a 1920s - era Champion spark plug would be worth today .
His answer was , " A couple o' bucks .
Max . "
Reaction from the Paranormal Community
During the course of research , the authors of this paper asked Dr. Chittick why he felt the Coso Artifact was an object worthy of presentation to the public .
Dr. Chittick was specifically asked how he reconciled a previous age estimate of 500,000 years with his young - earth creationist beliefs .
On September 29 , 1999 Chittick responded :
The article 's speculation that it had taken at least 500,000 years to attain the present form is just that : speculation .
Actual petrification of such objects proceeds normally quite rapidly , as is illustrated by several other similar formations .
See for instance , the note about the petrified miner 's hat on the back cover of Creation Ex Nihilo ( Vol. 17 , No. 3 ) for June - August , 1995 .
See also an article about another " fossil " spark plug in Creation Ex Nihilo ( Vol. 21 , No. 4 ) for September - November , 1999 on page 6 .
You asked what I thought about its age .
My best guess is that it is probably early post -Flood .
I have not yet been able to obtain sufficient documentation , so I do n't say much publicly .
However , there is evidence that they did in fact perhaps have internal combustion engines or even jet engines way back then .
Dr. Chittick 's revelation that he was already aware of " fossil " spark plugs was startling .
Dr. Chittick was asked in a follow - up letter about how he can positively date the Coso Artifact to the Great Flood since he was already aware of contemporary spark plugs that appear to be fossilized .
In his response on October 23 , 1999 , he commented :
It has not been my privilege to personally examine the Coso artifact or location and strata where it was found .
There are two reasons I considered the artifact significant .
1 . It obviously is a man -made item .
2 . Those who evaluated the strata said that it appeared to be old , not modern strata .
Those two items are the principle basis for my conclusion that it was worth study .
Certainly it does merit further study in my judgment .
Numerous items like that abound , but I have n't been able to document them as thoroughly as I would like , and so I do n't say too much about them .
As noted earlier , the alleged strata where the Coso Artifact was found is unknown since all three discoverers had separately searched for geodes all morning before consolidating their collections in a single sack .
Even if the exact location was discovered , the artifact was an oxide nodule freely laying on the surface , so the strata where the item was discovered is irrelevant .
Once the investigation revealed beyond a reasonable doubt the true origins of the artifact , Dr. Chittick was informed by Pierre Stromberg via postal mail .
Dr. Chittick was warned about the publication of this paper , and was urged to issue a preemptive retraction as well as paste a disclaimer in his book detailing the Coso Artifact story as fallacious .
Dr. Chittick never responded and may be still promoting a 1920s - era Champion spark plug as evidence of advanced technology of the ancient past .
Ken Clark of Spokane 's Creation Outreach at first expressed interest in the new discoveries .
But when he learned that the true identity was a 1920s - era Champion spark plug and was offered detailed proof , he no longer communicated with the authors of this article .
As of May 7 , 2000 , Creation Outreach continues to promote the spark plug on their website as evidence of a technologically advanced ancient civilization .
Conclusion
The Coso Artifact is a remarkable example of how creation " science " fails when the assumptions of its theory are implemented in a real life archaeological situation .
Young - earth creationists commonly assume that almost all sedimentary layers were depositedduring the Great Flood .
Therefore , any items closely associated with such strata must date back to the time of Noah .
Perhaps the most surprising revelation is the stunningly poor research Dr. Chittick conducted regarding the artifact .
Several times he referenced creationist articles that should have cast the original claims in extreme doubt .
But somehow , he continued to be fascinated by the artifact .
Anti-creationists familiar with Dr. Chittick will remember a previous incident with Dr. Chittick .
When confronted about his fallacious statements by Jim Lippard regarding Lucy 's knee joint in the mid 1990s , he ignored these warnings and continued to mislead his audiences until confronted in person by Pierre Stromberg at the conclusion of a lecture in Seattle .
It is possible that Dr. Chittick could be still promoting the Coso Artifact both in lectures and in his book without acknowledging any of his private conversations with the authors of this article .
The Coso Artifact was indeed a remarkable device .
It was a 1920s - era Champion spark plug that likely powered a Ford Model T or Model A engine , modified to possibly serve mining operations in the Coso mountain range of California .
To suggest that it was a device belonging to an advanced ancient civilization of the past could be interpreted as true , but is an exaggeration of several thousand years .

An important element is being overlooked in the healthcare debate between the Democratic presidential candidates : namely , whether the plans they propose are constitutional .
The largest difference between their healthcare plans is that Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton would " mandate " that everyone ( with limited exceptions ) purchase private health insurance .
Although Sen. Barack Obama 's plan also contains a mandate , it is much narrower – it is required only for children .
Mr. Obama relies principally on subsidies , economies of scale , and regulation to achieve his version of universal coverage .
Are health insurance mandates constitutional ?
They are certainly unprecedented .
The federal government does not ordinarily require Americans to purchase particular goods or services from private parties .
The closest we come is when government imposes a condition on the grant of discretionary benefit or permit .
For instance , in most states , you must have auto insurance to drive a car , or you are required to install fire sprinklers when building a new house .
But in such cases , the " mandate " is discretionary – you do n't have to drive a car or build a house .
Nor do you have a constitutional right to do so .
But Americans do have a constitutional right to live in the United States .
Accordingly , neither federal nor state governments can require you to purchase health insurance as a " condition " for residency .
The Supreme Court has drawn a distinction between requirements that are flat - out imposed by government and those imposed as a condition for discretionary benefits .
The health insurance mandate proposed by Clinton is similar to the one enacted in Massachusetts under former Gov. Mitt Romney and the plan proposed by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger for California .
These " unfunded mandates " are unlike any form of government regulation we 've seen .
In making the case for her plan to mandate private health insurance , Clinton said in a recent Democratic debate that not doing so " would be as though Franklin Roosevelt said , ' Let 's make Social Security voluntary , ' or if President [ Lyndon ]
Johnson said , ' Let 's make Medicare voluntary . ' "
In fact , under the law , there 's a big difference between participation in a government health program funded by taxes and privatizing such a program , with individuals forced to purchase private health insurance .
Taxation involves representation , as when Congress appropriates money and controls a government program for the general welfare .
This describes Social Security and Medicare .
But government cannot simply delegate its taxing powers to private business .
What representation do we have in the insurance firms whose products we would be required to buy , at prices and terms they set ?
Can we vote out an insurer 's board of directors for denying claims or paying its CEO a multimillion - dollar salary ?
Here , too , the Supreme Court has drawn a distinction between taxes imposed by government and mandatory fees set by entities with private interests .
A health insurance mandate is essentially a forced contract , in which one party ( the insurer ) gets to set the terms .
You must buy their policies , even if you prefer to self - insure , rely on alternative medicine , or obtain treatment outside the system .
In constitutional terms , such mandates may constitute a violation of due process or a " taking of property . "
Requiring Person
A to give money to Person B is a " taking , " whether or not something of value is given in return .
Let 's say the state required every resident to buy milk , on the rationale that milk consumption benefits public health .
That 's either a constitutionally forbidden taking ( of money ) or a violation of due process .
These constitutional rights are n't absolute .
Given a compelling enough reason , government can interfere with your person and property .
It can require , for instance , that your child be vaccinated before attending public school .
But there is usually an opt - out , such as private or home schooling .
We are not aware of any opt-outs for most people in the mandatory health insurance plans being discussed .
There are far more sensible and constitutional ways to provide health coverage .
Government - funded insurance ( such as Medicare or single - payer insurance ) or regulation and tax subsidies to encourage voluntary participation ( as in Obama 's plan ) both contain costs more efficiently and avoid the slippery slope of unconstitutional mandates .
Before the candidates get too far in their health insurance proposals , it would be good to consider the constitutional and policy implications of requiring Americans to buy private goods from private companies .

Help Overturn the Mandated “ Pasteurization ” of Raw Almonds
Almond Growers Sue USDA Over Compulsory Almond Treatment
Your support is needed to win the lawsuit brought by domestic almond growers against the USDA .
The Cornucopia Institute has been fighting to protect access to truly raw American almonds .
When the USDA announced their intention to gas almonds with a toxic fumigant or steam - heat the raw nuts – and still call them raw – Cornucopia began working with almond farmers , consumers and retailers to block this misguided food safety measure .
This work has now led to a lawsuit challenging the raw almond treatment mandate .
They need your help and support to cover the cost of this lawsuit !
Going to court was not their first choice .
Cornucopia initially offered a compromise plan to the USDA that would have protected family farmers growing raw almonds for consumers and the consumer ’s right to choose unadulterated food in the marketplace .
That plan was rejected earlier this year by the USDA .
Now they are seeking legal relief and justice .
On September 9 , that lawsuit was filed in the Washington , D.C. federal court .
Cornucopia ’s team of legal advisors has been carefully investigating the grounds for overturning the almond treatment mandate .
Under federal law , only farmers and almond nut handlers have “ legal standing ” to sue the USDA on this matter .
Fifteen almond farmers and handlers have stepped forward to file this suit .
These individuals have been watching their farming and business operations disintegrate under the dictates and prohibitions of the treatment mandate .
And they are not alone .
Cornucopia has talked with other almond farmers and handlers suffering in similar ways .
One farmer and lawsuit participant said : “ The entire natural raw almonds segment of our industry has been put out of business with one swipe of the pen by the Almond Board …. it is a financial disaster ( for farmers ) , and it is a disaster for the consumers that are now denied , for no good reason , a healthy whole natural raw food that they have eaten with confidence and enjoyment and benefit for decades . ”
Legal battles are a pricey proposition .
Justice is not cheap .
The Cornucopia Institute has assured the almond farmer and handler plaintiffs that they will raise the money to pay for the costs of winning this battle .
This is a battle that can be won .
Their legal team has crafted a strong case , one that exposes the USDA ’s lack of authority to invoke the treatment rule and their bungling of how it was mandated .
An alternative to this new rule would be to allow for and clearly label unpasteurized almonds — effectively warning consumers of potential risk for food contamination while at the same time protecting consumer choice .
Another alternative is to exempt small - scale and organic almond growers and handlers — since
they have never been a document source of Salmonella or other contamination .
Wo n’t you please help to win this fight ?
Most of The Cornucopia Institute ’s members are farmers .
They are standing with our almond farmer friends .
Please stand together with them and help to support this fight .
Send a letter to your elected federal officials :
I believe that uncooked foods , or “ living foods , ” offer substantial health benefits .
I am outraged by the fact that I am not able to purchase truly raw almonds from American farmers .
I am very concerned that my almonds are being treated with a toxic fumigant or unnecessary heat treatment .
Please use whatever influence you have to stop this unneeded activity .
Find full instructions for contacting your representatives and a sample letter for email or snail mail on Cornucopia Institute ’s site .
Call or write your local food retailer and ask that they support this effort .

BBC Documentary on the Falklands War. August 7 , 2008
I just saw a documentary from the BBC about the Falklands War .
The documentary was quite short and left out some interesting parts ( e.g. they even skip South Georgia completely ) and of course it was very British sided .
But anyhow since the Falklands War is one of the few wars after the Second World War with a big Navy involvement , it is important for warbuffs to look at .
First of all it shows that a ship is just a big target to an air plane / rocket .
The British lost seven ships including two destroyers and two frigates to air attacks .
The Argentineans lost nine ships including a cruiser to a submarine and a submarine to air attacks .
Ships are fragile targets and they are slow and pretty big .
So they are really easy to hit .
With modern rocket systems – sold by China to basically everyone – hitting a Ship is pretty easy and low risk for the attacker .
Second of all the Navy is about pride and not war .
After the Brits sank the Argentinean cruiser ARA General Belgrano – a former World War II US cruiser – the Argentinean Navy panicked and kept their whole fleet in port during the entire war .
Navy ’s do n’t want to take loses .
Their ships are their pride .
They are far too expensive and they contain a lot of life ( so you loose a lot of men when your ships are hit ) and they are so big and impressive .
This draws a picture for possible future wars .
First of all an invasion of Taiwan by the Chinese ( Ok , this is actually pretty unlikely .
But just to think about it ) .
The Chinese are equipped and build modern anti-ship missiles and they are building up their fleet of Submarines .
The Strait of Taiwan is near to the Chinese coast so the Chinese could hit everything the US would send against their invasion force without leaving their bases .
Another more likely conflict could be an attack by the US on Iran .
Since the Iran - Iraq - War the Persians moved their Navy from big ships to a fleet of small and cheap boats .
The Gulf is a small water way so you ca n’t hide your fleet – like the Brits were able to hide their carriers in the Atlantic – and the Persians control the only exit , a small water way called the Strait of Hormuz .
Fast , small and cheap boats have a big advantage in waters like the Gulf .
First of all they are cheap , fast and small ( daaah ) .
Thus they are n’t that easy to hit and even if you hit them it is no big loss .
They are so cheap , it is possible to afford big numbers of them for Iran .
So if your Carrier group is able to knock out 90 % of the attacking boats they ’ll still have no chance .
And the Iranians are equipped with the latest Chinese anti-shipping rockets .
If the US will attack Iran they ’ll take have loses probably even a carrier .
But now , finally !
Here is the documentary from the BBC split into 7 Parts :
Behind the public face of unity , tensions are boiling and both sides are trading not - for - attribution barbs .
Tensions boil between Obama - Clinton camps
DENVER —
As Democrats arrived here Sunday for a convention intended to promote party unity , mistrust and resentments continued to boil among top associates of presumptive nominee Barack Obama and his defeated rival , Hillary Rodham Clinton .
One flashpoint is the assigned speech topic for former president Bill Clinton , who is scheduled to speak Wednesday night , when the convention theme is “ Securing America ’s Future . ”
The night ’s speakers will argue that Obama would be a more effective commander in chief than his Republican rival , Sen. John McCain ( Ariz . ) .

The former president is disappointed , associates said , because he is eager to speak about the economy and more broadly about Democratic ideas — emphasizing the contrast between the Bush years and his own record in the 1990s .
This is an especially sore point for Bill Clinton , people close to him say , because among many grievances he has about the campaign Obama waged against his wife is a belief that the candidate poor - mouthed the political and policy successes of his two terms .
Some senior Democrats close to Obama , meanwhile , made clear in not - for - attribution comments that they were equally irked at the Clinton operation .
Nearly three months after Hillary Clinton conceded defeat in the nomination contest , these Obama partisans complained , her team continues to act like she and Bill Clinton hold leverage .
After a period earlier this month when the two sides were working collegially over strategy , scheduling , and other convention logistics , things turned scratchy again in recent days .
Some senior Obama supporters are irritated at how they perceive the Clintons fanned — or at a minimum failed to douse — stories that she was not even vetted as a possible vice presidential nominee .
This is because she told Obama she preferred not to go through the rigorous process of document production unless she was really a serious contender , an Obama associate noted .
One senior Obama supporter said the Clinton associates negotiating on her behalf act like “ Japanese soldiers in the South Pacific still fighting after the war is over . ”
A prominent Obama backer said some of Clinton ’s lieutentants negotiating with the Obama team are “ bitter enders ” who presume that , rather than the Clintons reconciling themselves to Obama ’s victory , it is up to Obama to accommodate them .
In fact , some senior veterans of Clinton ’s presidential campaign do believe this .
“ He has not fully reconciled , ” said one political operative close to the Clintons , “ and he has not demonstrated that he accepts the Clintons and the Clinton wing of the party . ”
While the Clintons have a relatively easy job in Denver — to deliver gracious speeches and accept what are likely to be loud cheers from their supporters — it is “ Obama who has the heavy lifting ” this week , this aide said .
This is because large numbers of Clinton backers — 30 percent in a recent ABC / Washington Post poll — are still not backing Obama over McCain .
The peevishness on both sides and the volume of behind - the - scenes catcalls are noteworthy because both the Clinton and Obama teams had resolved in pre-convention talks that it was overwhelmingly in the interests of both sides to get along .
Both Obama and Clinton associates have said for weeks that one of the challenges of Denver would be to control the news media narrative , in a city full of reporters and political sources , at an emotional moment for both the Obama and Clinton teams .
Several hours after this story was first published , Obama strategist David Axelrod and Clinton senior adviser Maggie Williams , issued a joint statement .
It did not address the reportedly bruised feelings over Bill Clinton 's speaking assignment , but said :
" We understand that some in the news media are more interested in reporting the rumor of controversy than the fact of unity .
The fact is that our teams are working closely to ensure a successful convention and will continue to do so .
Senator and President Clinton fully support the Obama / Biden ticket and look forward to addressing the convention and the nation on the urgency of victory this Fall .
Anyone saying anything else does n't know what they 're talking about .
Period . "
While Bill Clinton remains angry about how he and his wife were treated by both Obama backers and the news media — and he is particularly resentful at what he sees as unfair allegations that he tried to exploit racial divisions for political advantage — he has made the decision that he will put forward a positive face for Obama ’s benefit at Denver .
It is harder to do that when the topic is foreign policy and national security , which lends itself to restrained , rather than boisterous , partisan rhetoric .
“ That puts him in a terrible bind , because you ca n’t give a ringing endorsement when you ’re talking about foreign policy , ” a longtime Clinton adviser said .
“ Obviously , the hard thing to talk about with Obama is commander in chief , of all his many talents .
“ You do n’t rah - rah about commander in chief .
You rah - rah about hope and change and a new party and all that .
So no matter what he does , somebody will find fault with it . ”
Hillary Clinton , who associates said seems more at peace with the results of the nomination battle than her husband , is treating her speech preparation as an all - hands - on - deck exercise , bringing back longtime aides who worked with her during the White House years and in her Senate office .
Jim Kennedy , a veteran Clinton press hand and now an executive at Sony studios , was recalled to work on a speech draft , as was former White House speechwriter Lissa Muscatine , according to Clinton associates .
Many of Hillary Clinton ’s negotiations with the Obama team , aides said , have been led by former White House lawyer Cheryl Mills — a fiercely loyal associate of the Clintons who is known for her relentless and sometimes combative advocacy on their behalf .
Another longtime associate , former White House chief of staff John Podesta , said he has little doubt that Hillary Clinton will easily meet her political challenge in Denver .
He predicted that her supporters will “ blow the roof ” off the convention center with cheers for her , and that she will in turn make a rousing appeal for Obama .
Podesta , the founder of the liberal Center for American Progress think tank , said Bill Clinton ’s challenge is harder .
“ I think he ’s got a high bar because he needs to show enthusiasm , and the press will be looking for any stray remark as a sign that he does n’t fully support ” the Obama campaign , Podesta said , adding , “ It ’s a bar he ’ll get over . ”
Matt McKenna , a spokesman for Bill Clinton , said his boss " looks forward to making the case that Barack Obama is the best candidate to restore America 's standing in the world . "
Paul Begala , a former operative who has spoken to both Clintons in recent weeks , agreed .
He said the former president , whatever mixed feelings remain from the primaries , will work to elect Obama because , “ It ’s killing him to watch what has happened over the past eight years .
It ’s been torture to watch the slow unraveling of so much of what his administration achieved . ”
Radovan Karadzic , the top war crimes fugitive who evaded capture for almost 13 years , was arrested on a suburban bus in a disguise , Serbian newspapers have said .
" He had a long beard and his hair was dyed in black .
He had a travel bag with him , and it appears he was prepared to leave Belgrade " and offered no resistance when detained , the daily Politika said without giving any sources .
Serbian authorities have yet to reveal any details about the capture of Karadzic , one of the world 's most wanted men , only saying in a brief statement that it occurred on Monday night , without even revealing the location .
He remains in custody in Belgrade awaiting extradition to the Hague .
While some papers claimed Karadzic was arrested in a flat in central Belgrade , several others reported he had been caught on a city bus linking a central part of the capital with the suburb of Batajnica .
But his lawyer , Svetozar Vujacic , told reporters Karadzic was arrested on Friday night , while taking a bus between two suburbs of Belgrade , and had been held for three days before the announcement .
" Radovan Karadzic was arrested on Friday morning around 9.30 on the public bus , " Mr Vujacic said .
" By the law he should have been taken to the judge immediately so no one knows who arrested him , who ordered that and who kept him for three days until he was brought here tonight .
" Radovan Karadzic himself does n't know that either .
" He just said that these people showed him a police badge and than he was taken to some place and kept in the room .
" He was blindfolded ... he was kept in some room .
...
And that is absolutely against the law what they did .
" The judge also said that he will look into this matter , who and why kept him for three days .
" He said he does n't want to talk [ and ] he is not eating ... they have offered him some food , but he is not eating .
" The judge said that some medicines will be provided .
He was examined by doctor and he is healthy . "
On the run
During his 13 years on the run , Karadzic has reportedly disguised himself as an Orthodox monk , with a shaved head and hiding in mountains between Bosnia , Serbia and Montenegro .
Some reports even claimed he had fled to Russia , finding shelter among Russian nationalists who supported Bosnian Serbs during the 1992 -1995 war in Bosnia .
Karadzic was last seen and photographed in the former Bosnian Serb military stronghold Han Pijesak in July 1996 , a year after the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia ( ICTY ) made his indictment public .
After that , he was rarely spotted in public , although former UN war crimes tribunal prosecutor Carla del Ponte insisted he had been in hiding on the territory of the former Yugoslavia .
His last sighting was reportedly in 2005 , in the Montenegrin town of Niksic , close to the border with Bosnia , where he allegedly had dinner with his wife in a small restaurant .
This was never confirmed .
There were only a few political reactions to Monday 's action - ultra-nationalist Radical Party official Aleksandar Vucic described Karadzic 's arrest as a " new shame for Serbia . "
Pro-European Serbian President Boris Tadic " has done everything to ensure that Serbia disappears , " the daily Politika quoted Mr Vucic as saying in reference to the shrinking former Yugoslav republic that lost four wars in the 1990s .
European Union foreign policy chief Javier Solana said he hoped Karadzic 's arrest would now help unblock a key EU - Serbia accord .
" We have to talk to the prosecutor of the international tribunal , but I am almost certain he is going to say there is full cooperation , " Mr Solana said .

What this article misses , of course , is McCain ’s personal fight with US regulators who wanted to investigate his friend Charles Keating and and his failing S&L. ;
Yes , he personally intervened to protect a wealthy donor .
Why McCain continues to gets a free pass on that expensive financial failure escapes me .
Nevertheless , it ’s obvious to everyone that John McCain has fought against regulating almost everything , until the meltdown on Wall Street kicked in .
Regulation goes against his 26 year history in Washington .
When McCain said in March of 2008 “ I ’m always for less regulation ” should n’t we believe him ?
Does n’t his own history back up that statement ?
In 2002 , McCain introduced a bill to deregulate the broadband Internet market , warning that “ the potential for government interference with market forces is not limited to federal regulation . ”
Three years earlier , McCain had joined with other Republicans to push through landmark legislation sponsored by then - Sen .
Phil Gramm ( Tex. ) , who is now an economic adviser to his campaign .
The Gramm - Leach - Bliley
Act aimed to make the country ’s financial institutions competitive by removing the Depression - era walls between banking , investment and insurance companies .
That bill allowed AIG to participate in the gold rush of a rapidly expanding global banking and investment market .
But the legislation also helped pave the way for companies such as AIG and Lehman Brothers to become behemoths laden with bad loans and investments .
McCain now condemns the executives at those companies for pursuing the ambitions that the Gramm - Leach - Bliley
Act made possible , saying that “ in an endless quest for easy money , they dreamed up investment schemes that they themselves do n’t even understand . ”
So McCain is shocked that Wall Street did what the Gramm bill proposed and he voted for ?
Is he confused again or just plain stupid ?
@slibuntu : No , there * is* a difference .
It all depends on the particular license .
The restrictions regarding use of open source code depends on the particular license .
Some allow any usage , some allow commercial usage only if modifications to the code are given back to the community , some allow no commercial resale of any part of the code .
In the case of Apple , they are allowed to use the underlying open source code and * do* give back changes to the community .
On top of that underlying FreeBSD ( IIRC ) open source software sits the bulk of OS X ( which is not open source ) .
There 's no violation there .
You do NOT have to make all your code open source just because you use some open source code in your product .
That 's a bit of FUD that Microsoft spread a while back in hopes of getting businesses to avoid Linux .
KDE 4.1 was released just days ago , but the KDE team already prepares the next release for August : KDE 3.5.10 .
While there wo n’t be any new features in it it will contain many bugfixes .
With the release of KDE 4.0 many users were disappointed about missing functions .
And while KDE 4.1 is out the discussion still goes on .
However , most users seem to forget that there is a perfectly valid possibility to use KDE right now without updating yet to a KDE 4.x release : continue using KDE 3.5 .
In fact , many business desktops and many industry setups with KDE do use KDE 3.5.x , and will continue to do so for quite some months and years in the future .
And this alternative will get another release in August : KDE 3.5.10 .
That is actually the second KDE 3.5.x release since KDE 4.0 was released , and shows how much the KDE project is committed to its user base .
Still , it should be clear what the policy is regarding such releases : bugs are fixed when they are either security relevant or when the developer in the project has the time – so as more time a bugfix needs and as less relevant the bug is for the general user base the smaller is the chance that the bug actually gets fixed .
On the other hand , since it is not even said that KDE 3.5.10 is the last bugfix release ever you can also try to submit patches with bug fixes or ( smaller ) new features to the project , and it might be included in a future release .
KDE 3.5 is used on really large setups cross the world , and the KDE project is aware of these setups – so they will support them in the future .
And besides , some developers even still use KDE 3.5 on some of their machines .
Obama : ' I will win '

Do n’t worry about that , ” he said to the crowd of about 1,300 at his third event of the evening , according to the pool report .
He was warmly received by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , who called him " a leader that God has blessed us with at this time . "
Obama echoed some of the themes he discussed when he described Pennsylvanians as " bitter " and stoked controversy three months ago , but did so much more adroitly .
" Now , you want to win .
And saying it does n’t make it so , " he told the crowd .
" It would be nice to think that after eight years of economic disaster , after eight years of bungled foreign policy , of being engaged in a war that should never have been authorized and should never have been waged , that cost us a trillion dollars and thousands of lives , that people would say , let ’s toss the bums out .
Toss the bums out , we ’re starting from scratch , we ’re starting over .
This is not working . "
“ So I understand why a lot of folks are saying , this should just happen .
Why are we having to run all these television commercials ?
Why do we have to raise all this money ?
Just read the papers .
These are the knuckleheads who have been in charge .
Throw ‘em out .
But American politics are n’t that simple , " he said .
" The fact of the matter is , at a certain point , when government has not been serving the people for this long , people get cynical .
They tune out .
And they start saying to themselves , a plague on both your houses .
They are willing to consume negative information more frequently than positive information , for good reason .
They ’ve seen how promises have n’t been kept , " he said .
Full pool report after the jump .

So in three hours , Obama raised a whopping $ 7.8 million .
At the third and final event of the blockbuster evening , Obama again vowed to break the Democratic losing streak by answering Republican charges aggressively and enlisting the American people in his cause .
“ I will win .
Do n’t worry about that , ” he said to the crowd of about 1,300 .
The candidate was particularly fired up in this speech , confident and assertive , having finally shaken off the vacation dust .
He was warmly received by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , the hometown gal was neutral during the primary , but was n’t shy about her Obama affection tonight , calling him “ a leader that God has blessed us with at this time . ”
Obama spoke at length about the difficulties that many Americans were facing ( beyond these four walls at least ) , hitting similar points from his “ bitter ” speech , but without the guns and God landmines .
“ Now , you want to win .
And saying it does n’t make it so , ” he told the crowd .
“ It would be nice to think that after eight years of economic disaster , after eight years of bungled foreign policy , of being engaged in a war that should never have been authorized and should never have been waged , that cost us a trillion dollars and thousands of lives , that people would say , let ’s toss the bums out .

They ’ve seen how promises have n’t been kept . ”
Things could get ugly in the coming weeks , he warned .
“ They ’ve got a whole machinery that they ’re cranking out , ” Obama continued .
“ They ’ve got a book about me , that just kind of sprung full bore out of this guy ’s head . ”
“ John McCain , all he wants to do is talk about me .
They know they ca n’t win on the issues .
So what they ’ll do is they ’ll try to scare people .
He ’s risky .
He ’s risky .
We ’re not sure . ”
It ’s an old playbook , he continued , but Obama said , it ’s not going to work this time .
“ Not only do you have a candidate who does n’t take any guff .
Not only do you have a candidate who will hit back swiftly and forcefully and truthfully .
But you ’ve also got American people who are rising up all over the country and saying , enough is enough . ”
Some new features are sexy .
They come with shiny new interfaces , extra buttons , more power .
These are obvious and easy to spot .
They are fun to develop and fun to release .
However , there ’s another side to improving a product that does n’t get as much respect .
It ’s the optimization .
Nothing new , but everything better .
Small tweaks here , hardware upgrades there .
Everything runs more smoothly but you do n’t really notice it .
You feel it , but there ’s nothing pretty to point to as evidence of the hard work .
The speed initiative
We want to treat speed as a feature .
It should be one of our best features .
So , for the past few months Jeremy and Mark have been working hard on speeding up our apps through software optimizations , caching , and network and hardware improvements .
They deserve a huge round of applause for the results .
They ’ve made a big difference .
Let ’s talk about Basecamp
We ’re rolling these optimizations out to different 37 signals products at different times , but let ’s start with Basecamp , our most popular product .
Basecamp gets used a lot by a lot of people .
It ’s also the type of product that people are in and out of all day long so speed is a critical factor .
We rolled out a series of optimizations this week .
Some data
Here are some charts generated by New Relic that shine a light on the results of the hard work .
These charts compare an hour of traffic this morning with the same hour last week .
As you can see , the changes we ’ve implemented have made a dramatic difference .
Our overall response time was cut very nearly in half , meaning that pages are loading roughly twice as fast as they were for the same time period last week .
At the same time , we ’ve managed to cut CPU usage by about a third and database time by about half .
How we did it
These gains were achieved using a variety of techniques including :
Analysis :
We relied heavily on New Relic ’s outstanding RPM performance management suite to give us insight about the parts of Basecamp that were accessed the most as well as those that were most in need of improvement .

Caching :
We ’ve begun using Memcached in a variety of spots .
Caching can be tricky with dynamic apps like Basecamp since different people often see different things , but we ’ve implemented it carefully where it could be used to its best advantage .

We ’ve been working with a MySQL performance consultant to help us optimize our database calls and queries .
We ’re still early in the process but we ’ve learned a lot so far .

Hardware upgrades :
We recently made some significant upgrades to our database servers .
We went from servers with 2 x Dual Core 2GHz processors , 32GB of RAM , and 6×73 GB 15,000 RPM SAS drives to servers with 2 x Quad Core 3GHz processors , 128GB of RAM , and 8×73 GB 15,000 RPM SAS drives .
We ’ve also upgraded our load balancers and have new switches coming soon as well .
Change you can feel
While you may not immediately notice speed increases like you ’d notice a big new feature , we think that over time you ’ll see your productivity increase due to these speed increases .
Less time for pages to load , less waiting for results .
Everything ’s just smoother .
It ’s change you can feel .
The more you use Basecamp the more you ’ll feel it .

And let Sarah Palin become POTUS
By Jason Miller
And let Sarah Palin become POTUS
Savage animal slaughterer that she is , it ’s apt that Sarah Palin has now brutally plunged a razor - sharp knife into the very heart of the seemingly invincible doubts concerning her capacity to be Vice - President of the United States .
Wielding her chutzpah with the awe - inspiring deftness with which she employs her gun or rifle when hunting defenseless wolves or moose , she appeared on 20/20 and left our skepticism writhing on the ground in agony , immersed in its own blood and gasping its last .
Given her virtuoso performance with Charlie Gibson a few nights ago , John McCain might as well croak now and get it over with .
She ’s ready for the presidency .
All the cynics who dared to question her qualifications to become VP now have about as much credibility as card - carrying members of the Flat Earth Society .
Sarah Palin is the person we need ( and deserve ) to lead us on our incessant quest for global hegemony and in our ongoing orgiastic gang rape of the Earth .
A former beauty pageant contestant noted for her fierce competitiveness who would easily qualify as a MILF in the pornography industry and who takes great pride in her capacity to stick her head up her ass and go for it instead of “ blinking , ” this “ lipstick pitbull ” embodies nearly all that we worship in a nation fueled principally by narcissism , arrogance , willful ignorance , and belligerence .
She may lack the obscene wealth that also triggers our reflexive genuflection , but she will acquire that in time .
Like George Bush , who is demonstrably imbecilic and morally retarded , the “ hockey mom ” who “ worked her way to the top with grit and determination , ” also fuels the naïve , jejune notion that “ anyone can be President of the United States because we live in a democracy . ”
Forget the pablum concocted to pacify the masses ; the POTUS could actually be ‘ anyone who hails from a family with direct ties to the power elite of our bourgeois democracy or who shares their sociopathic tendencies and is willing to sell their souls to do their bidding . ’
But who amongst us wants to burden our atrophying minds attempting to understand complexities when the simplistic sweet little lies are so much more palatable and takes so few brain cells to process ?
As is befitting of a huntress extraordinaire , Palin provides an endless supply of red meat for the benighted , socially conservative American masses to devour with the ferocity of the hungry wolves she loves to annihilate :
Life begins at conception .
No abortion ( including in rape and incest cases ) unless it is necessary to save the life of the mother .
Abstinence only .
Our war crimes and genocide in Iraq are God ’s will .
Cut government spending on socially beneficial programs but keep underwriting the squatters in Palestine and pumping obscene amounts of cash into our murderous military machine .
Islamic extremists are “ hell bent on destroying our nation . ”
Russia invaded Georgia “ unprovoked ” and war with the Russians is a viable option .
Israel would be justified in launching a nuclear strike against Iran to preserve its “ security . ”
US military incursions into sovereign nations like Pakistan are necessary and permissible .
Shooting any non -human animal that moves , asking questions later , devouring their flesh in a delectable stew , wearing their skins and furs , and mounting their heads on our walls as macabre “ trophies ” are our God - given rights as red- blooded Americans .
The Alaskan wilderness , over which she presides , is a repository for OUR precious oil and we must “ drill , baby , drill , ” regardless of how many species we drive to extinction and how much damage we do to the environment .
She is so rife with idiocy , devotion to “ normalized violence , ” and a river of venom that froths and seethes under her guise of “ Christian compassion ” that it is virtually impossible to pinpoint her most loathsome and dangerous trait .
However , her zealous adherence to Western culture ’s paradigm of dominionism , meaning dominion over the environment and nonhuman animals , demonstrates and encapsulates most of Sarah Palin ’s myriad sociopathic tendencies that readily qualify her to occupy the Oval Office .
With the advent of agriculture and the subjugation of animals , humanity embarked upon a war against nature ( and , incidentally , against ourselves too since we are a part of nature ) .
Gradually becoming more and more obsessed with controlling nearly all aspects of our environment , we grew increasingly exploitative , abusive , and murderous in our zeal to “ tame ” the world around us .
Genesis ’s creation myth , which Palin has revealed to be a key component of her worldview , cemented Western culture ’s conviction that humans have the absolute and irrevocable right to dominate the Earth and its non-human animal inhabitants .
Even the advent of “ enlightened ” Humanism afforded little relief to Mother Nature , as it underscored dominionism with its anthropocentricism and speciesism .
So while Palin ’s Creationist beliefs may seem archaic and sophomoric to substantial numbers of US Americans who embrace Humanistic ideas , she still belongs at the forefront of our human - centric charge to devour the planet .
Colonialism , slavery of human and non-human animals , genocide of indigenous people to make wayfor expansion , ecocide to “ clear the land ” and extract OUR resources , and now unbridled capitalism and consumerism have been the hallmarks of Western “ civilization . ”
We in the United States are now the nexus of this culture of death that for centuries has blasphemously extended its malignant influence under the banner of Christianity , a repugnant hypocrisy that grossly perverts the teachings of one of the greatest spiritual leaders in history .
We are a nation ruled by the power elite , a relatively small segment of the US population in the upper echelons of the economic , corporate , military , and political hierarchies .
Our ruling class is comprised of scoundrels , cold - blooded killers , bullies , thieves , hedonists , and avaricious pigs .
The rest of us are ‘ wanna - be ’ power elites , indoctrinated flag - waving true believers , apathetic by - standers looking out for number one , ‘ down - troddens ’ just trying to get by , or outraged activists whose actions are effectively neutralized by the overwhelming might of the system .
So who better to serve as the “ elected ” face of the ruling class than Sarah Palin ?
After all , she is a faux populist , physically attractive woman ( proving that beauty is indeed only skin deep ) , fundamentalist Christian , Paleolithic conservative , savage huntress , foreign policy nincompoop , and “ corruption fighter ” ( with undeniable connections to pork - barrel king , Internet expert and now indicted Alaska Senator Ted Stevens ) .
Palin is one of “ us . ”
Or at least what many of us have been indoctrinated to admire or aspire to be .
Palin epitomizes the banality of evil that permeates our planet murdering nation .
Nursed at the teat of our culture of death and fiercely inculcated with the various components of its dominionism , it would be an existential impossibility for a person of her age to extricate herself from her mental straight - jacket .
On a conscious level , she is probably as clueless about her malevolence as she is about US foreign policy and world affairs .
And many of us perceive Sarah Palin to be a God- fearing , patriotic , “ average Jo ” showing those damn “ intellectual elites ” that we do n’t need no stinkin ’ knowledge to “ git ‘r done , ” champion of “ family ” values and the American Way .
Again , Palin is one of “ us , ” or what many of us wish to become .
Whether we are conscious of it or not , we US Americans are all ( to varying degrees ) , perpetuating the malignant expansion of our culture of death .
We are the cancer .
The Earth is the patient .
And the prognosis is not very reassuring .
Sarah Palin .
Death becomes her .
And we have become death .
Now that ’s a match made in Hell .
Let ’s make her our president ….or at least put her one 72 year old heartbeat away …..

One muggy evening this summer , Qubad Talabani , the 31 - year - old son of the president of Iraq , was chatting over drinks at a Dupont Circle bar when his BlackBerry rang .
“ It ’s Ray Hunt , ” Talabani said , looking at the caller ID on his phone .
The Washington representative of the Iraqi Kurdistan Regional Government apologized for the interruption , and turned away to take the call .
His caller is a man who has no trouble getting his phone calls answered at any hour , anywhere in the world .
A Bush / Cheney fundraising Pioneer , a member of Bush ’s President ’s Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board , and the president of the Dallas - based Hunt Oil company , Ray Hunt is the kind of Texas oilman with easy insider access to the Bush White House .
Perhaps not coincidentally , he also heads the first American oil firm to have received an oil exploration contract with the Iraqi Kurdistan Regional Government , announced last September .
As such , he has come to epitomize one of the more glaring contradictions about the Bush administration ’s policy toward Iraq and its oil wealth .
Namely :
If the Bush administration , as it proclaims , supports passage of an Iraqi oil law that would share the country ’s wealth across ethnic and regional divides , why do Bush - linked companies keep getting Kurdish - area oil concessions that bypass the Iraqi national government ?
Hunt Oil is n’t the only one .
This week , the Wall Street Journal reported that another Bush administration insider , Richard Perle , had approached Talabani seeking an Iraqi Kurdish oil concession on behalf of a consortium involving Turkish oil companies and the Kazakh government .
“ The K18 concession , which is estimated to hold 150 million or more barrels of oil , would potentially be operated by Houston - based Endeavour International , ” reported the Journal .
The Hunt Oil and Perle - Turkish - Kazakh ventures are among more than twenty oil contracts signed ( with dozens more under consideration ) by the Kurdish Regional Government , in a process conducted largely in the dark .
As troubling , several of the proposed Kurdish oil deals would financially benefit key Washington figures with close ties to the Bush administration .
“ Iraq is predicted to pump 70 billion dollars worth of oil this year .
That gives them a 50 billion dollar budget surplus , ” notes a congressional staffer knowledgeable about the situation .
“ The administration , Iraqi government , and everyone say that getting this national oil law is a prerequisite for political reconciliation and the US being able to get out sooner .
To the extent that the situation is becoming chaotic , it is hurting the chances for that . ”
On July 2 , Henry Waxman , chairman of the House Committee on Government Oversight and Reform , wrote Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice a letter laying out documents that seemingly contradict Bush administration claims to have been kept mostly in the dark about the Hunt Oil deal with the Kurdish Regional Government .
Included are emails from US advisers on Iraqi reconstruction expressing gratitude that Hunt Oil officials were keeping them apprised of their efforts .
As Waxman ’s letter to Rice notes :
A Commerce Department official who met with Hunt Oil officials in Kurdistan offered them further support and wished them “ a fruitful visit to Kurdistan . ”
Five days after the announcement of the Hunt Oil contract , a State Department official contacted Hunt Oil to describe another “ good opportunity for Hunt ” in Iraq , prompting a Hunt Oil official to write Ray Hunt : “ This is really good for us … I find it a huge compliment that he is ‘ tipping ’ us off about this …
This is a lucky break . ”
Waxman ’s letter requested documents from the State Department to help clarify the seeming contradictions in the administration ’s position .
His congressional oversight committee continues to investigate the Bush administration ’s policy on Iraq ’s oil deals .
“ No one has come out and said there is any current law that specifically prohibits Kurdistan from doing its own oil deals , ” says the congressional staffer .
“ At the very best , [ the situation ] is very legally ambiguous . ”
In the waning days of the Bush administration and its influence over Iraq , it ’s an ambiguity that international oil tycoons , Kurdish dynasts , and administration insiders seem eager to exploit while they still can .
By the time ambiguities in the current Iraqi law are clarified , such claims may be hard to reverse .
As Talabani told Hunt that muggy evening , it ’s hard to discuss further Kurdish oil concessions “ while there is so much ambiguity ” in the current situation .
But , he added , “ I ’m sure there ’s a way we can find common ground . ”

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- John McCain and Barack Obama have starkly different philosophies about tax policy - how to raise the revenue needed to support government programs , spur growth and ensure economic fairness .
But voters really want to know one thing :
How would the presidential candidates ' views trickle down to their tax bills ?
A report released Wednesday by a nonpartisan policy group in Washington , D.C. , takes a big first step toward answering that question .
According to the Tax Policy Center 's findings , the common assumptions most people make about the plans of McCain , the presumptive Republican nominee , and Obama , the Democrats ' pick , are not wildly off - base .
McCain :
The average taxpayer in every income group would see a lower tax bill , but high - income taxpayers would benefit more than everyone else .
Obama : High - income taxpayers would pay more in taxes , while everyone else 's tax bill would be reduced .
Those who benefit the most - in terms of reducing their taxes as a percentage of after - tax income - are in the lowest income groups .
Under both plans , all American taxpayers could pay a price for their tax cuts : a bigger deficit .
The Tax Policy Center estimates that over 10 years , McCain 's tax proposals could increase the national debt by as much as $ 4.5 trillion with interest , while Obama 's could add as much as $ 3.3 trillion .
The reason : neither plan would raise the amount of revenue expected under current tax policy - which assumes all the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts expire by 2011 .
And neither plan would raise enough to cover expected government costs during those 10 years .
" Distributionally , they 're markedly different .
But in terms of their impact on revenue , the two plans are not terribly different , " said Roberton Williams , principal research associate at the Tax Policy Center and the former deputy assistant director for tax analysis at the Congressional Budget Office .
A closer look
In addition to making the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts permanent , McCain says he would double the exemption for dependents , lower the corporate tax rate , make expensing rules more generous for small businesses and lessen the bite of the estate tax and Alternative Minimum tax .
The net result : compared with their tax bill today , taxpayers on average would see their tax bill cut by nearly $ 1,200 .
That means their after - tax income would rise by 2 % .
But those in the lowest income groups would only see their after - tax income rise by less than 1 % ( or between $ 19 and $ 319 ) .
By contrast , the highest - income households - those with incomes of at least $ 603,000 - would see a boost in after - tax income of 3.4 % , or more than $ 40,000 .
Obama 's plan would keep the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts in place for everyone except those making more than roughly $ 250,000 , and he would increase the capital gains tax .
Obama would also introduce new tax breaks for lower and middle - income groups .
Such breaks include expanding the earned income tax credit , giving those making less than $ 150,000 a $ 500 tax credit per person on the first $ 8,100 in income , giving those making under $ 75,000 a 50 % federal match on the first $ 1,000 of savings , and exempting seniors making less than $ 50,000 from having to pay income tax .
Like McCain , Obama would lessen the bite of the estate tax and the Alternative Minimum Tax , but to a lesser degree .
The net result : compared with their tax bill today , taxpayers on average would see their tax bill cut by nearly $ 160 under Obama 's plan .
That means their after - tax income would rise by 0.3 % .
But those in the lowest - income groups would enjoy the biggest after - tax income rise as a percentage of income - between 2.4 % and 5.5 % ( worth between $ 567 and $ 1,042 ) .
By contrast , the highest - income households - those with at least $ 603,000 in income - would see a dramatic decline in their after - tax income - a drop of 8.7 % , or $ 116,000 .
The campaigns respond
Jason Furman , a newly appointed senior economic adviser to Obama , said his preliminary response is that the report 's findings bear out what Obama 's campaign has been saying : that he 's for the middle class .
" Middle - class families get tax cuts that are three times larger from Obama than from McCain , " Furman said .
" And the McCain plan gives nearly one - quarter of its benefits to households making more than $ 2.8 million annually - the top 0.1 % . "
Douglas Holtz - Eakin , senior economic adviser to McCain , noted that the report does not take into account the spending reforms - such as eliminating earmarks - that are central to McCain 's strategy to support tax relief and help reduce the deficit .
One of the center 's co-directors , William Gale , conceded in a conference call that " if McCain succeeds ( in achieving his proposed spending cuts ) , the fiscal cost of his plan does go down . "
But spending cuts can be politically difficult to achieve , said Len Burman , the Tax Policy Center 's director .
Holtz - Eakin characterized McCain 's plan as one geared toward " reshaping federal bureaucracies and protecting taxpayers ' money .
[ His ] plan is based on kicking down doors in Washington , and delivering tax dollars back to the American taxpayers who are struggling with record gas prices , soaring food costs and a down economy . "
Not the final word
Williams said the Tax Policy Center analysis should be viewed as a work in progress .
Researchers plan to update it as they get more information about the plans from the campaigns and if the candidates introduce new tax policies between now and Election Day .
The center will also incorporate the tax elements of McCain 's and Obama 's health care proposals when they update their findings .
How the candidates ' tax plans would affect economic growth is an open question .
" It depends on how the deficits are closed , " Burman said .
Tax studies have shown that when tax cuts are deficit funded and they 're paid for by raising taxes in the future , " the economy is worse off than if you did n't cut at all , " Burman said .
Over and over again , they were told they would be killed .
" They seemed to be pretty serious about it , " he said .
" I was thinking , ' well if they are going to kill me then we all have to die at some stage .
I know where I 'm going , I 'm a child of God and Jesus by His blood has saved me , so I will be with Him today ' .
So I was n't actually fearful , the fear was taken out of me , amazingly .
Database heresies
While scanning reddit , I saw an article pop up by Jeff Davis lamenting the way most people interact with databases , particularly when it comes to ORM s.
Jeff seems to be pointing out ( and , to an extent , conflating ) two issues :
At the moment , programming languages and SQL do n’t really mesh all that well .
Most people , in Jeff ’s opinion , take the wrong approach to working with a database from their programming language of choice .
The first point is one I ’m happy to concede ; SQL is a fundamentally different beast from , well , pretty much any other language you ’re likely to encounter , and as such common / popular programming languages run into a big impedance mismatch the moment they start trying to do SQL .
To really expose all the functionality of SQL to your favorite programming language , you need either extensive language - level integration of SQL - like features ( see , for example , LINQ on . NET ) or you need to spend a lot of time and effort developing a toolkit to bridge the gap .
So I ’m in agreement on that point .
But the other item — the “ wrong ” approach to database interaction — is one I ’ve got some issues with .
Two ways to do it
Jeff lays out two approaches to database interaction .
First , the one he does n’t like :
The wrong approach , which includes all persistence layers and most ORMs , use object - oriented design to manage data ( by generating simple store - and - retrieve SQL code ) instead of the relational model ; and mash together transient application data with permanent facts that should be made available to other application instances .
This approach considerably increases complexity unless the data is highly independent ( that is , one application instance does n’t care what another instance is doing ) .
Meanwhile , there ’s the “ right way ” :
The idea is to allow the developers to use arbitrary relational expressions in their application language , and cleanly separates transient application data structures from the permanent facts that should be made available to other application instances .
The complex relational expressions in the application language are then translated to equivalent SQL — not simple store - and - retrieve , but real SQL expressions — and then passed to the DBMS which can then optimize and execute the expressions , and the results can be returned and understood by the application language .
This dichotomy is somewhat similar to what I ’ve been saying , for a couple years now , to anyone who ’s willing to listen to me ramble about ORM design .
When you get right down to it , I think there are two ways to come at the problem of ORM :
I ’ve got some objects in my code , and I ’d like to persist them and be able to fetch them back according to their attributes , so I ’m using a relational database as the store .
I ’ve got a relational database and I need to interface with it from my programming language , so I ’m using object - oriented techniques to do that .
These roughly correspond to Jeff ’s “ wrong ” and “ right ” approaches , respectively , but I ’m not convinced that there is a thing as “ wrong ” or “ right ” approach here .
Why the RDBMS won
I really think that the success of relational databases is and has been largely an accident of history .
If object databases or document databases or RDF stores or anything else had been widely / freely available and “ good enough ” at certain critical points over the last couple decades , I suspect they ’d have taken over instead of relational databases , and we’d be seeing articles from purists in those fields decrying the way programmers just use them as dumb data stores .
This causes no end of annoyance for hardcore database guys , but it ’s true : it just so happens that a lot of hype and industry support for “ relational ” databases popped up at just the right time .
Of course , the really hardcore relational purists are looking down their noses at all of us and describing in detail all the ways that SQL and its implementations sold out and compromised Codd ’s vision of the relational model , but that ’s neither here nor there .
This is a drama we ’ve seen play out over and over again in the history of computing : solutions that are good enough at the time , and which can be implemented with the minimum amount of prerequisite knowledge or complexity , win .
Ask an old - school Smalltalk programmer about C++ and Java sometime .
Ask a trained document specialist what she thinks of HTML .
Or ask a relational geek about MySQL .
All of these are second - rate , partial implementations of vastly more elegant and powerful ideas , but they all took off and left the purists in the dust .
It turned out that relational databases were in the right place at the right time , and the “ good enough ” implementations and uses took over the world .
Or , in other words , we ’re looking at yet another instance of Worse is Better .
If you ’ve never read that essay , please do so now .
So what do you really need ?
The key insight of the “ worse is better ” philosophy is that it ’s often preferable to have a simple , partial implementation now than to have a complex full implementation at some unspecified point in the future .
The current crop of web frameworks present a useful microcosm we can study to see this in action .
The “ wrong ” way to do ORM is to start out with a basic Active Record implementation which maps one class to one table , with fields on the class as columns and instances of the class as rows .
Then you layer on more features and stronger SQL support as needed .
This is what Rails has done .
This is what Django has done .
This is what the popular PHP frameworks have done .
Meanwhile there are ORM packages available for modern frameworks which are designed the “ right ” way , but :
They ’re huge and complex , which means that a lot of development effort has to go into building simpler , friendlier interfaces to them .
Because of this , they ’re getting their asses kicked by ORMs which started out simple and supported just enough features to be useful .
This means that a lot of people end up using an ORM which does things the “ wrong ” way , but that ’s OK because it turns out there ’s a huge market out there full of people who care about the “ database ” part much more than they care about the “ relational ” part , if they even care about that at all .
And really , I think a lot of the complaints we see from purists about the “ right ” way to use databases and do ORM comes down to misunderstanding what that market wants and needs .
Yes , there are and always will be places where there ’s a single massive corporate database with dozens or hundreds of applications accessing it .
Yes , those places need to worry about doing things the “ right ” way if they want to keep all of that stuff working .
But that ’s just one part of a very large world .
There are plenty of places — in fact , an ever - increasing number of them — where everything runs in reverse : they start out with an application , and then need a place to keep its data .
For nearly all of these folks , the considerations which require doing things the “ right ” way are simply irrelevant and probably always will be .
And the purists are , frankly , out of touch with this market ; they ’re out on the edge while everybody else is in the big belly .
Why there should be two ways to do ORM
Which gets back to the two ways you can approach ORM .
The “ right ” way , according to the database purists , is to make the database king and think exclusively in relational terms .
What matters is implementing the underlying relational model as completely and as correctly as possible .
The “ wrong ” way is to favor the application , and treat the DB as a data store to back the objects which exist in your code .
The “ wrong ” way has been hugely successful , since it ’s easy and it ’s good enough for most people in most situations .
This means that we need to have ORMs which do things “ wrong ” ; without them , we ’d live in a much less interesting world .
Of course , most people in most situations are not all people in all situations , which means we also need to have ORMs which do things “ right ” ; without them , we ’d once again live in a much less interesting world .
And , of course , both camps end up searching for the ideal happy medium : the “ wrong ” - style ORMs either start building in more advanced features or they die off , and the “ right ” - style ORMs either introduce simpler interfaces or they never have users outside of the niche that ’s willing to put up with the way they work .
To take the canonical ORM debate from the Python world , this is why Django ’s bundled ORM got a huge under - the - hood refit from Malcolm that introduced all sorts of interesting new capabilities ( more on that some other day ) , and why so many people are working steadily on Elixir so that SQLAlchemy will be usable by mere mortals .
I ’ll admit that , once upon a time , I had some misgivings about the “ wrong ” sort of ORM , so I have some idea of where the purists are coming from .
But after a couple of years working , day in and day out , with one of the alleged worst offenders , I ’ve realized that there ’s room for libraries that do n’t expose everything your database can do , and that debates about who ’s “ right ” and who ’s “ wrong ” take a back seat to the much more important question of “ who ’s actually getting shit done ? ”
As it turns out , people on both sides .
And while steak tartare shows up on practically every brasserie menu , chefs now recognize that a hamburger is not simply six ounces of chopped lean beef grilled until crusty .
“ No , that would be an error , ” said Ms. Grasser - Hermé .
“ A hamburger is the architecture of taste par excellence , ” she explained .
“ The meat needs to be a mix of fatty and lean .
Not raw , not rare .
It must be medium rare .
At the same time the bread needs to be smooth , tepid , toasted on the sesame side .
I like to brush the soft side with butter .
There needs to be a crispy chiffonade of iceberg lettuce .
Everything plays a role . ”
In developing the Salle Pleyel burger , Ms. Samuel and Ms. Ezgulian felt the weight of tradition .
“ We ’re a little terrified of making a mistake , ” said Ms. Samuel .
“ We cling to things like the soft buns , sweet - and - sour pickles , onions , tomatoes , cheese .
We need these guideposts because we do n’t have the history , the context .
Otherwise , for us , it ’s not a burger .
It ’s a hot sandwich . ”
Yet Ms. Ezgulian has taken some liberties .
The current version of her burger is a riff on steak tartare .
She ’s kneaded a mixture of chopped sun-dried tomatoes and tangy cornichons and capers into the ground meat .
Parmesan shavings stand in for the usual Cheddar .
Céline Parrenin , a co-owner of Coco & Co , a two - level place devoted to eggs that opened in St. - Germain last year , did n’t feel any such compunction when she and her business partner , Franklin Reinhard , invented the Cocotte Burger .
The Cheddar cheeseburger , with pine nuts and thyme mixed into the meat , sits on a toasted whole - wheat English muffin pedestal .
In a wink at the restaurant ’s egg theme and recalling the time - honored steak à cheval , a fried egg is placed on top .
All the chefs are making hamburgers for the first time , and they are uncertain about the exact cuts of beef they are using .
Mr. Alléno , for example , simply relies on his butcher , Yves - Marie Le Bourdonnec , whose shop , Le Couteau d’Argent , is in the Paris suburb Asnières .
For Mr. Alléno ’s burgers , Mr. Le Bourdonnec delivers a mix of chuck and beef rib .
But the butcher thinks the American T - bone steak is an ideal cut .
The T - bone does not exist in France , but to make his point , Mr. Le Bourdonnec made his own .
He combined a piece of filet , which is tender but less flavorful , with a piece of contrefilet , which is marbled and tasty , but slightly less tender .
Federal officials are converging in support of a sweeping overhaul of financial regulation , making it likely that Wall Street investment banks and other major financial institutions will be subject to a tighter government grip .
Regulators and lawmakers differ on key details about how to move forward , but the impetus for an overhaul appears firmly entrenched , putting it high on the list for action by Congress next year .
At a House Financial Services Committee hearing Thursday , Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke agreed that regulators need new tools to deal with financial crises and stronger oversight authority over major financial institutions .
Officials have been discussing how to revamp the regulatory structure for more than a year .
The talks have taken on greater urgency since the government , worried about the destabilization of financial markets , extended a $ 29 billion emergency loan in March to J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. to buy the collapsing Bear Stearns Cos .
" The financial turmoil that began last summer has impeded the ability of the financial system to perform its normal functions and adversely affected the broader economy , " said Mr. Bernanke .
" This experience indicates a clear need for careful attention to financial regulation and financial stability . "
Sharon Glassman and Christian Mogensen : Murder - Suicide
A 61 year old Boston computer consultant namedshot and killed his wife60 , and then turned the gun on himself last night , September 28 , 2008 .
Prior to carrying out his premeditated plan , Mogensen posted a wedding photo of the couple on his website and added their date of birth , marriage and death .
The couple 's bodies were found late last night after a police SWAT team entered their 20th floor Charles River Park high - rise apartment building .
Law enforcement personnel were dispatched after receiving a 911 call at 9:30 p.m. from a man who said he'd killed his wife and would commit suicide if police entered the apartment .
When police arrived at the residence they heard gunshots and discovered the husband and wife dead of gun shot wounds .
Christian Mogensen was a self employed web developer and IT consultant and Sharon Glassman worked at Brigham and Women 's Hospital , which is affiliated with Harvard Medical School .
Glassman worked in the Trauma and Burn Center as a Program Assistant .
A neighbor who lives a few doors down from the couple and knew them casually remarked that she never heard them argue .
The couple had lived in the building for 10 years .
She said :
" They were both computer types .
They seemed like a very , very compatible couple .
Sharon was just delightful , always with a smile . "

Irin News reports on a little - known side effect of the market for Ecstasy :
The sassafras oil comes from the Cardamom Mountain area , one of the last forest wildernesses in mainland southeast Asia , and where the FFI project is based . (...)
Cambodian sassafras oil is highly sought after as it is of the highest quality - over 90 percent pure , according to the head of the UN Office on Drugs and Crime ( UNODC ) in Cambodia , Lars Pedersen .
" Massive amounts of sassafras oil are smuggled every year into Vietnam and Thailand from Cambodia , " he said .
Sassafras oil is made from the roots of the rare Mreah Prew Phnom tree - also known as Cinnamomum parathenoxylon .
The roots are first chopped into small blocks of wood and shredded into a fibrous consistency .
This is then typically put into large metal vats and distilled over hot wood fires for at least five days in the oil distillation process .
" [ The Mreah Prew Phnom ] is a very rare tree that is now beginning to disappear because of the illegal distilleries in the Cardamom Mountains , " Bradfield said .
" The production of sassafras oil over the last 10 years has severely depleted these trees and if the illicit production is n't stamped out soon , they could become extinct in the near future , " he warned . "
The Latte Factor : How Money Leaks & Drains Add Up To $ 175,000 In 10 Years
Here ’s where to find the extra money to fund your financial goals .
In an effort to bring our spending down and to cushion our income shortfall over the last year or two , we ’ve been working on stretching our budgets a little further .
Unfortunately though , I have the nagging feeling that our budget is still not quite as optimized as we ’d like it to be .
For instance , while our utility bills are somewhat lower in general , it ’s not the case with our water bill , no thanks to the hotter - than - usual summer and drier weather we ’ve been having .
Because I ’m a big freak about our garden and have n’t yet decided to replace our lawn with artificial turf 😉 , we ’ve no choice but to pour a slice of our budget into the upkeep of our yard .
Can we really cut our expenses further ?
I think so .
We know there ’s always room to bring down our bills further if we try hard enough .
Which brings us to the subject of money drains and what it means to really begin operating on a lean budget .
Many of us have frittered away some of our money on occasion .
But what if we ’re able to put a stop to the mindless spending that eats up our money without us even realizing it ?
In a perfect world , I ’ve wondered how much additional savings we’d be able to build by being more careful with the money that passes through our hands .
Small Costs Add Up ! How Much Money Are You Kissing Goodbye ?
The “ latte factor ” is a phrase ( by the financial author David Bach ) which describes the way small costs can catch us by surprise .
Are you curious about how much you could be trading off for convenience and a bit of enjoyment ?
The answer may astound you .
What I ’ve done is a simple exercise that shows what would happen if we seriously account for the common money drains that besiege our budget .
When taken into totality , our vices , habits , impulse purchases and daily fixes can amount to some huge numbers !
But keep in mind that many times , what we consider as a “ waste ” or money drain can be classified as a guilty pleasure .
We may want to ask ourselves if we ’re willing to give some of these up for the resulting savings .
I ’ve worked out an approximate picture of how much money can fall by the wayside by putting together this table and graph based on Bankrate ’s and AOL ’s discussions on well - known money drains .
The table shows the total annual cost of all the money drains combined , plus what your savings would amount to if you invested those savings at an annual rate of 8 % , compounded monthly over 10 years .
Money Drain Average Price Estimated Annual Cost Future Value In 10 Years * Coffee Average price of brewed coffee : $ 1.38
One coffee each week day costs around $ 360 annually .
$ 5,488 Gum Average price for one pack : $ 1 Chew a pack a day for a year : $ 365 $ 5,488 Cigarettes Average price for a cigarette pack : $ 4.54 Pack - a - day smoker ’s annual cost : $ 1,660
Weekend smoker ’s annual cost : $ 236 Pack - a - day smoker ’s cost : $ 25,247
Weekend smoker ’s cost : $ 3,659 Alcohol Average : $ 5 per beer ( includes tip )
One beer a day , annual cost : $ 1,825 $ 27,807 Bottled Water One 20 ounce bottle costs $ 1 One bottle a day for a year : $ 365 $ 5,488 Manicures Average cost : $ 20.53 Weekly manicure , for a year costs $ 1,068 a year $ 16,282 Car washes Average cost : $ 58 Cost of detailing every 2 months , for one year : $ 348 $ 5,305 Weekday lunches out Daily lunch : $ 9 Weekday lunches for one year : $ 2,350 $ 35,857 Junk food , vending machine snacks , soda Average snack : $ 1 Afternoon snacks for one year costs $ 260 $ 4,025 Credit card interest charges Median amount of credit card debt is $ 6,600 .

At 20 cents more for premium , pumping 20 gallons of it instead of regular would cost $ 4 more .
Annually , that ’s a difference of $ 171 for a vehicle that averages 14 miles per gallon — as some big sport- utility vehicles do — and is driven 12,000 miles a year .
$ 2,561 Lottery Typical cost : $ 10 a week For one year : $ 520 $ 7,867 Direct TV A basic program can run $ 100 a month $ 1,200 a year $ 18,295 Total $ 11,548 a year $ 175,994
* Future Value is calculated using an 8 % annual rate of return over a period of 10 years , compounded monthly .
Let ’s Check Our Calculations
Let ’s suppose you are spending $ 11,548 of what you perceive as “ pocket change ” on various incidental items .
The simple savings calculator I used allowed me to enter a monthly deposit of $ 962 per month , which was equivalent to the $ 11,548 of that “ found money ” annually .
Imagine putting that money to better use !
When subjecting this monthly contribution to an 8 % interest rate that was compounded monthly , the result after 10 years is $ 175,994 .
Here are the specifics !
In one short decade , these small , regular expenditures add up to around $ 175,000 .
Throw in a few more costly habits and petty charges and your “ lost ” savings can amount to over $ 200,000 !
If the investment climate over the next 10 years turns out to be kinder than it has been recently , a higher rate of return can yield an even larger sum .
The Latte Factor : Money Drains That Can Add To A Lot
If the small stuff can lead to such significant missed savings , what about the larger money leaks that we fall prey to ?
Some examples :
# 1 Unnecessary upgrades
If you ’re an early adopter of technology , you could be spending more than you should on electronic and gadget upgrades .
Or what about room upgrades when you ’re on vacation ?
Unless it ’s a free upgrade , you may want to think twice about paying extra .
# 2 Package deals or unneeded extras
I ’ve got a relative who bought a new car and who got suckered into paying for a $ 2,000 cleaning kit for the car .
After two years , he ’s hardly touched the kit .
# 3 Extended warranties
Have you ever successfully used any of your extended warranties ?
How many times have they expired without being applied ?
Do n’t pay for these .
# 4 Buying stuff on sale you do n’t use or need
I know people who rationalize that buying stuff on sale means they ’re saving money .
I do n’t agree — you ’re only saving money if you buy stuff on sale you really need and use .
If you ’re hoarding things you ’ll never use , you ’re just wasting your hard - earned money and adding to clutter in your home .
# 5 Bulk purchases
Buying in bulk only makes sense if you can successfully consume everything ( or most of what ) you buy .
Otherwise , it ’s just waste on all counts .
# 6 Free money that is n’t free
How often do you come across free offers that later on snag you for monthly dues ?
Too often .
I signed up for free stuff on a few occasions but have since learned my lesson : the book club selections and free magazines may sound great at first until you ca n’t stop them from arriving at your doorstep !
The catch was that I ended up owing money on items received after the “ free period ” was up .
~ooOoo~
With these illustrations , you can see just how much you may be giving up on savings that may very well be right under your nose !
If you think about it , there may be more than enough here for a home down payment , an IRA account , or even to fully fund a 401k account .
It may just mean that we need to change our habits to make room for these priorities .

Congressman , supported by majority of American people , bravely out to ensure Bush goes down in history as liar and war criminal as Democrats rally to his defense
Paul Joseph Watson
Prison Planet
Wednesday , July 23 , 2008
Congressman Dennis Kucinich will this Friday present his single article of impeachment concerning the Bush administration ’s deliberate and unconstitutional lies that led us to war in Iraq , putting him in tandem with the majority of the American people , yet in the cross hairs of both Neo -Cons and Democrats who have tried to block his efforts at every turn .
Kucinich should be commended for his brave and restless pursuit of impeachment .
Whether Bush had a few months left in office or a few years does n’t matter one iota – the Congressman ’s efforts are aimed squarely at ensuring Bush rightly goes down in history as the most flagrantly criminal and anti-American president in history , while also making sure that a repeat of the debacle we have witnessed over the past eight years is not allowed to happen again .
In a preamble posted on You Tube , Kucinich explains the foundation of his single article of impeachment , the deliberate behind - closed doors scheming and lies that were told in anticipation of the pre-planned invasion of Iraq , while the charade of UN weapons inspectors and diplomacy played out in public .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
Watch the clip .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Democrat elitists like Pelosi and Conyers are desperately trying to downplay Kucinich ’s efforts and insist that impeachment is “ off the table ” .
When Kucinich spent four hours in June reading 35 articles of impeachment and demanding hearings , the Democrat controlled House almost instantly dispatched them for burial to the Judiciary Committee .
According to an Associated Press report , when Kucinich tried to introduce similar articles of impeachment against Dick Cheney last November , “ Republicans , seeing a chance to force Democrats into an embarrassing debate , voted to bring up the resolution .
Democrats countered by pushing through a motion to scuttle the bill from the floor . ”
The bullshit they are trying to make us swallow is that Democrats are shunning Kucinich because they think a debate about impeachment would harm their chances of winning the presidency .
In reality , as far back as November 2005 , polls showed that the majority of Americans supported impeachment on the basis of Bush lying about the invasion of Iraq , which is specifically what Kucinich ’s single article of impeachment that he will present on Friday addresses .
Likewise , latest polls show that almost 70 % of Americans oppose the war in Iraq , with anti-war sentiment swelling the longer the occupation drags on .
Support for a withdrawal from Iraq and the impeachment of George W. Bush is wildly popular with the majority of the electorate that will vote in November , so why are top Democrats doing everything in their power to prevent Kucinich from drawing attention to the matter ?
Because they are nothing more than political whores for the same power structure served by the Neo -Cons , and want to advance the same agenda of pax - Americana , imperial bloodletting and domination demanded by the new world order and the Israeli AIPAC lobby , to which Pelosi and Conyers have pledged their full subservience .
Kucinich ’s full article of impeachment concerning the lies that led us to war appears below .

CREATING A SECRET PROPAGANDA CAMPAIGN TO MANUFACTURE A FALSE CASE FOR WAR AGAINST IRAQ
In his conduct while President of the United States , George W. Bush , in violation of his constitutional oath to faithfully execute the office of President of the United States and , to the best of his ability , preserve , protect , and defend the Constitution of the United States , and in violation of his constitutional duty under Article II , Section 3 of the Constitution “ to take care that the laws be faithfully executed ” , has both personally and acting through his agents and subordinates , together with the Vice President , illegally spent public dollars on a secret propaganda program to manufacture a false cause for war against Iraq .
The Department of Defense ( DOD ) has engaged in a years - long secret domestic propaganda campaign to promote the invasion and occupation of Iraq .
This secret program was defended by the White House Press Secretary following its exposure .
This program follows the pattern of crimes detailed in Article I , II , IV and VIII ..
The mission of this program placed it within the field controlled by the White House Iraq Group ( WHIG ) , a White House task - force formed in August 2002 to market an invasion of Iraq to the American people .
The group included Karl Rove , I. Lewis Libby , Condoleezza Rice , Karen Hughes , Mary Matalin , Stephen Hadley , Nicholas E. Calio , and James R. Wilkinson .
The WHIG produced white papers detailing so - called intelligence of Iraq ’s nuclear threat that later proved to be false .
This supposed intelligence included the claim that Iraq had sought uranium from Niger as well as the claim that the high strength aluminum tubes Iraq purchased from China were to be used for the sole purpose of building centrifuges to enrich uranium .
Unlike the National Intelligence Estimate of 2002 , the WHIG ’s white papers provided “ gripping images and stories ” and used “ literary license ” with intelligence .
The WHIG ’s white papers were written at the same time and by the same people as speeches and talking points prepared for President Bush and some of his top officials .
The WHIG also organized a media blitz in which , between September 7 - 8 , 2002 , President Bush and his top advisers appeared on numerous interviews and all provided similarly gripping images about the possibility of nuclear attack by Iraq .
The timing was no coincidence , as Andrew Card explained in an interview regarding waiting until after Labor Day to try to sell the American people on military action against Iraq , “ From a marketing point of view , you do n’t introduce new products in August . ”
September 7 - 8 , 2002 :
NBC ’s “ Meet the Press : Vice President Cheney accused Saddam of moving aggressively to develop nuclear weapons over the past 14 months to add to his stockpile of chemical and biological arms .
CNN : Then - National Security Adviser Rice said , regarding the likelihood of Iraq obtaining a nuclear weapon , “ We do n’t want the smoking gun to be a mushroom cloud . ”
CBS : President Bush declared that Saddam was “ six months away from developing a weapon , ” and cited satellite photos of construction in Iraq where weapons inspectors once visited as evidence that Saddam was trying to develop nuclear arms .
The Pentagon military analyst propaganda program was revealed in an April 20 , 2002 , New York Times article .
The program illegally involved “ covert attempts to mold opinion through the undisclosed use of third parties . ”
Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld recruited 75 retired military officers and gave them talking points to deliver on Fox , CNN , ABC , NBC , CBS , and MSNBC , and according to the New York Times report , which has not been disputed by the Pentagon or the White House , “ Participants were instructed not to quote their briefers directly or otherwise describe their contacts with the Pentagon . ”
According to the Pentagon ’s own internal documents , the military analysts were considered “ message force multipliers ” or “ surrogates ” who would deliver administration “ themes and messages ” to millions of Americans “ in the form of their own opinions . ”
In fact , they did deliver the themes and the messages but did not reveal that the Pentagon had provided them with their talking points .
Robert S. Bevelacqua , a retired Green Beret and Fox News military analyst described this as follows : “ It was them saying , ‘ We need to stick our hands up your back and move your mouth for you . ' ”
Congress has restricted annual appropriations bills since 1951 with this language : “ No part of any appropriation contained in this or any other Act shall be used for publicity or propaganda purposes within the United States not heretofore authorized by the Congress . ”
A March 21 , 2005 , report by the Congressional Research Service states that “ publicity or propaganda is defined by the U.S. Government Accountability Office ( GAO ) to mean either ( 1 ) selfaggrandizement by public officials , ( 2 ) purely partisan activity , or ( 3 ) “ covert propaganda . ”
These concerns about “ covert propaganda ” were also the basis for the GAO ’s standard for determining when government - funded video news releases are illegal :
“ The failure of an agency to identify itself as the source of a prepackaged news story misleads the viewing public by encouraging the viewing audience to believe that the broadcasting news organization developed the information .
The prepackaged news stories are purposefully designed to be indistinguishable from news segments broadcast to the public .
When the television viewing public does not know that the stories they watched on television news programs about the government were in fact prepared by the government , the stories are , in this sense , no longer purely factual — the essential fact of attribution is missing . ”
The White House ’s own Office of Legal Council stated in a memorandum written in 2005 following the controversy over the Armstrong Williams scandal : “ Over the years , GAO has interpreted ‘ publicity or propaganda ’ restrictions to preclude use of appropriated funds for , among other things , so - called ‘ covert propaganda . ’ …
Consistent with that view , the OLC determined in 1988 that a statutory prohibition on using appropriated funds for ‘ publicity or propaganda ’ precluded undisclosed agency funding of advocacy by third - party groups .
We stated that ‘ covert attempts to mold opinion through the undisclosed use of third parties ’ would run afoul of restrictions on using appropriated funds for ‘ propaganda . ' ”
Asked about the Pentagon ’s propaganda program at White House press briefing in April 2008 , White House Press Secretary Dana Perino defended it , not by arguing that it was legal but by suggesting that it “ should ” be : “ Look , I did n’t know look , I think that you guys should take a step back and look at this look , DOD has made a decision , they ’ve decided to stop this program .
But I would say that one of the things that we try to do in the administration is get information out to a variety of people so that everybody else can call them and ask their opinion about something .
And I do n’t think that that should be against the law .
And I think that it ’s absolutely appropriate to provide information to people who are seeking it and are going to be providing their opinions on it .
It does n’t necessarily mean that all of those military analysts ever agreed with the administration .
I think you can go back and look and think that a lot of their analysis was pretty tough on the administration .
That does n’t mean that we should n’t talk to
people . ”
In all of these actions and decisions , President George W. Bush has acted in a manner contrary to his trust as President and Commander in Chief , and subversive of constitutional government , to the prejudice of the cause of law and justice and to the manifest injury of the people of the United States .
Wherefore , President George W. Bush , by such conduct , is guilty of an impeachable offense warranting removal from office .

Yow .
If you missed the story , US PsyOps personnel are using music as a torture tactic on captives in Iraq .
How silly , you say ?
Torture someone with music ?
Well , check out the playlist .
“ Fuck Your God ” – Deicide “ Die MF Die ” – Dope “ Take Your Best Shot ” – Dope “ White America ” – Eminem “ Kim ” – Eminem “ Barney Theme Song ” – Barney “ Bodies ” – Drowning Pool “ Enter Sandman ” – Metallica “ Meow Mix ” jingle “ Sesame Street Theme ” “ Babylon ” – David Gray “ Born in the USA ” – Bruce Springsteen & the E Street Band “ Shoot to Thrill ” – AC / DC “ Stayin ’ Alive ” – The Bee Gees “ All Eyes on Me ” – Tupac “ Dirty ” – Christina Aguilera “ America ” – Neil Diamond “ Bulls on Parade ” – Rage Against the Machine “ American Pie ” – Don McLean “ Click Click Boom ” – Saliva “ Cold ” – Matchbox 20 “ Swan Dive ” – HedPE “ Raspberry Beret ” – Prince
Sweet fancy square - dancin’ Jesus .
Sergeant Mark Hadsell , of Psy Ops , told Newsweek magazine : “ These people have n’t heard heavy metal . ”
They ca n’t take it .
If you play it for 24 hours , your brain and body functions start to slide , your train of thought slows down and your will is broken .
That ’s when we come in and talk to them . ”
I ’ll talk !
I ’ll talk !
Anything you want to know !
Just , please , for the love of all things sacred , no more Bee Gees .
A quick perusal of this mixtape from
Hell no doubt presents you with some songs you kinda like , but the idea of hearing it over and over and over and over and over and over again ?
Damn , that would be like non -stop exposure to Rock 92 in Greensboro , only worse .
Puts a whole new spin on the term “ extreme rendition , ” huh ?
( And by the way , years of exposure to said Rock 92 have me wondering how Bob Seger did n’t make the cut . )
Of course , the story gets better .
However , human rights organisation , Amnesty International , said such tactics may constitute torture – and coalition forces could be in breach of the Geneva Convention .
You think ?
Amnesty ’s allegations have proponents of musical torture saying some pretty silly shit in defense of the approach , too .
Rick Hoffman , vice president of the Psy Ops Veterans Association , told BBC Radio 4 ’s Today programme that such a tactic would have no long - lasting effect on prisoners .
Bitch , please .
I heard “ Playground in My Mind ” once back in the ’70s and I ’m still in therapy .
Suffice it to say that I can see the merits of both arguments .
On the one hand , I have no doubt that this is an effective no - touch interrogation technique .
On the other , turning a guy ’s brains to mush has to be a violation of something .
Still , guests at our detention facilities in Iraq should be happy that the program is being run by amateurs .
Sure , the playlist above is a good one , but … it could be so much worse .
If I were in charge , we might add a few things :
“ It ’s a Small World After All ”
“ Copacabana ” – Barry Manilow
“ Your Body is a Wonderland ” – John Mayer ( right about here is where the prisoner would begin begging for death )
“ Achy Breaky Heart ” – Billy Ray Cyrus
“ The Chicken Dance ”
“ Da Da Da ” – Trio
“ Tom ’s Diner ” – Suzanne Vega ( just the first couple measures on endless loop )
“ Iâ€™d Do Anything for Love ( But I Wonâ€™t Do That ) ” – Meatloaf ( actually , I ’d just use the section where he repeats the title about 65 times in a row – on loop )
“ The End ” – The Doors ( stop teasing me – please let it be the end )
Soundtrack from episode one of “ Cop Rock ”
“ Hollaback Girl ” – Gwen Stefani
“ The Hamster Dance ”
“ Ice Ice Baby ” – Vanilla Ice
“ Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds ” – William Shatner
“ Someone ’s Knockin ’ at the Door ” – Paul McCartney
“ Muskrat Love ” – Captain & Tennile
“ The Macarena ”
“ The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia ” – Vicki Lawrence
“ Coconut ” – Nilsson
“ Mambo No. 5 ” – Lou Bega
“ Glory of Love ” – Chicago ( hearing Peter Cetera sing the lines “ I am a man / who will fight for your honor ” will make the detainee laugh so hard he ’ll hack up his own gall bladder )
“ Two Princes ” – Spin Doctors ( especially effective if captives are from a culture that has invented musical phrasing )
“ Mr. Roboto ” – Styx
“ Hot Rod Lincoln ” – Commander Cody & the Lost Planet Airmen
“ The Star - Spangled Banner ” – Roseanne Barr
“ The Star - Spangled Banner ” – Carl Lewis
Any five - second snippet of Mariah Carey hitting her dog - slayer note – on a loop
“ YMCA ” – The Village People
“ Mickey ” – Toni Basil
“ I ’m Too Sexy ” – Right Said Fred
“ What ’s Up ? ” – 4 Non-Blondes ( Jesus , I just threw up in my mouth a little )
“ Do n’t Worry Be Happy ” – Bobby McFerrin ( also effective when torturing captives with irony )
“ If You ’re Happy and You Know It ”
“ Kumbaya ” – any youth praise choir in America
I could go on .
Literally – I ’m not even getting warmed up yet .
The more I think about it , the more I ’m convinced that if we could put a satellite with insanely powerful speakers in low orbit over the Middle East , we could use a playlist like this to blast them evil Arab terrorists into permanent submission in a matter of days .
Of course , at that point we ’d probably be in violation of some space - based weaponry treaty or another …
Thanks to Dr. Mike Pecaut for the story tip and links .
An investigation by the WSJ reveals that companies like Intel have begun transferring taxable deferred compensation for senior execs into traditional pension plans , thus saving money on taxes .
This sounds like a scandal , but it really is n't : if companies get tax breaks for regular - employee pension plans , why should n't they get them for executives as well ?
One could presumably argue that companies are just now discovering a tax break that they should have been taking advantage of all along :
In recent years , companies from Intel Corp. to CenturyTel Inc. collectively have moved hundreds of millions of dollars of obligations for executive benefits into rank - and - file pension plans .
This lets companies capture tax breaks intended for pensions of regular workers and use them to pay for executives ' supplemental benefits and compensation .
Any outrage here should be directed at executive compensation in general .
The key issue with regard to taxation is whether the pension practices " discriminate " between low - paid rank - and - file employees and fat - cat execs :
IRS rules say pension plans must not " discriminate in favor of highly compensated employees . "
If a company wants to give its executives larger pensions -- as most do -- it must provide " supplemental " executive pensions , which do n't carry any tax advantages .
And do n't worry : the companies provide these supplemental plans , too .
As with all tax and accounting rules , there 's a lot of room for interpretation , and companies are obviously doing whatever they can to interpret the rules in their favor .
In some cases , no doubt , they 've gone too far .
In others , probably , not far enough .
So , are we really talking about corporations getting " hundreds of millions of dollars " in de facto government subsidies ?
Yes , if Intel is a proper example :
[ Intel 's ] tax saving : $ 65 million in the first year .
In other words , taxpayers helped finance Intel 's executive compensation .
Meanwhile , the move is enabling Intel to book as much as an extra $ 136 million of profit over the 10 years that began in 2005 .
That reflects the investment return Intel assumes on the $ 187 million .

Not even 2 weeks and Apple ’s new iPhone has been already hacked .
An international team of programmers announced on Saturday that the device had been “ pwned ” — hacker jargon for “ controlled ” or “ compromised . ”
This organized group , which calls itself the “ iPhone - dev team , ” played an important role in the worldwide dissemination of the original iPhone , releasing a series of tools that allowed the device to run third - party software and to work in countries where Apple had not yet struck deals with local carriers .
By February 2008 , estimates of the number of unlocked iPhones in circulation around the world ranged from 800,000 to 1.5 million .
The value of the latest hack , dubbed Pwnage 2.0 and available for free download here , is not so clear .
For one thing , although it “ jailbreaks ” the new iPhone — meaning it allows it to use programs not authorized by Apple , it does not yet “ unlock ” it to run on unauthorized cellular networks .
We ’re used to seeing Rupert Murdoch release the hounds on any number of Democratic campaigns , but here Fox News ’ Megyn Kelly demands that McCain mouthpiece Tucker Bounds explain the straight talker ’s lies about Barack Obama .
Fox News via Gawker :
In what promises to be at best a most bizarre story , Ozark , Missouri , police tased 16 - year - old Mace Hutchinson 19 times while he lay on the pavement with a broken back and a broken heel in his foot .
Ozark police defended their actions because the officers felt that the injured boy was a threat to the officers .
" There 's no way that they had to tase me that many times , " said Mace Hutchinson .
Capt .
Thomas Rousset said , " He refused to comply with the officers and so the officers had to deploy their tasers in order to subdue him .
He is making incoherent statements ; he 's also making statements such as , ' Shoot cops , kill cops , ' things like that .
So there was cause for concern to the officers . "
Because they were attempting to rescue the 16 - year - old Hutchinson and secure his safety , police said that their use of a taser should not be questioned .
" It 's a big concern for the officers to keep this guy out of traffic , to keep him from getting hurt , " said Rousset .
The Hutchinson boy had been walking along a freeway overpass above US Highway 65 , when a concerned citizen called 9 - 1 - 1 because he feared for the boy 's safety .
When police arrived they found Hutchinson incoherent and lying on the pavement of Highway 65 .
It appears that Hutchinson had fallen from the overpass onto the shoulder of Highway 65 below and had suffered severe injuries in the fall - - injuries that included a broken back .
When Hutchinson would not make a coherent response to police questions other than " shoot cops , kill cops , " they tased him repeatedly .
They tased him again , and again , and again , and again .
They tased him a total of 19 times .
Police did not explain how repeated tasing of an incoherent subject would make the subject coherent .
Nor did police explain how someone with a broken back lying on the highway is a threat to police officers .
And police did not explain how tasing someone 19 times will prevent him from sustaining further injury .
Police did say that their use of a taser 19 times should not be questioned .
Mace Hutchinson 's family does not understand how the police can justify tasing Mace once , let alone 19 times .
His aunt Samantha said , " I 'm not an officer , but I do n't see the reason for tasing somebody lying there with a broken back .
I do n't consider that a threat . "
Samantha also said that doctors felt that " all injuries are consistent with a fall . "
Mace 's father , Don , insists that Mace fell onto the pavement and did not jump ; however , no one knows why he fell .
Said Don Hutchinson , " They tested his system .
He was clean of drugs and alcohol .
We do n't know why unless just being in shock and the whole thing in itself caused him to forget everything . "
The family is still questioning police actions .
Don Hutchinson claims that surgery , which Mace critically needed , had to be delayed for two days because of the tasing .
" The Tasing increased his white blood cell count and caused him to have a temperature so they could not go into the operation , " Mr. Hutchinson said .
After surgery
Mace was eventually released and is now at home still lying in bed and barely able to move .
" It should be a couple months before I 'm able to walk on my own , " said Mace .
Mace cannot remember how he ended up on the pavement under the bridge .
He knows he did n't willingly jump .
" I know I 'm lucky to survive that far of a fall . "
Police say Hutchinson was aggressive with them and tried to get up and get into traffic .
However , Mace counters that he weighs little and wonders why police simply did not restrain him .
Police also claim
Mace made threatening remarks about harming officers .
The combination of Mace ’s aggression and remarks were why they used the stun gun .
Mace does not remember trying to get up and does n't know how it would have been possible considering his injuries .
" There 's no way I could stand up .
I had a broken back and a broken foot , " Mace said .
The Ozark police have begun an internal probe of the incident .
" I definitely want them to get punished , I do n't want them to get away with it , " Mace said .
Care home grants grandmother , 90 , lifelong wish to be served fish supper by a man in a THONG
When a woman aged 90 asked to be served fish and chips by a waiter wearing a thong , her care home was more than happy to oblige .
After all , she had requested it as part of the home 's ' Make a Wish ' scheme which sees staff trying to make residents ' dreams come true .
An employee , wearing a see - through plastic apron over the skimpy black undergarment , duly fulfilled the elderly lady 's demand , serving her her favourite dish in the dining room .
A 90 - year - old resident of a care home had her ' wish ' fulfilled and was served fish and chips - by a member of staff wearing a thong
But while she enjoyed her cheeky treat , not everyone saw the funny side .
In fact , one saw rather more than they found palatable - namely the waiter 's bare behind and ' endowment ' - and complained to the management that it was unprofessional and degrading .
Yesterday bosses at the home in Cornwall apologised and admitted staff may have ' overstepped the mark ' .
Details of the incident at Woodland House in St Austell were leaked in a fax sent by a whistleblower to senior management at charity Cornwall Care , which runs the home and 17 others in the county .
The anonymous source , understood to be a worker at the home , said : ' A volunteer was asked to purchase the garment .
' He came back with a black lady 's thong .
On the night , other clients in the dining room were told of the event and told that if they did n't like it they could turn their head .
' The thong that was worn had a seethrough plastic apron over the front .
The back part of the body was bare enough to see the black narrow band over the rear area .
' Mind you , one could see the man 's endowment through the clear plastic front . '
The fax continued : '
' This is not providing professional services or standards .
It does however , degrade Cornwall Care .
' It also tells us the manager is abusing her position and needs to be demoted or resign .
This behaviour is not acceptable .
' Will we be asked to wear a bikini next week at work to meet with a male client 's wish , we ask ? '
According to the source , managers first asked one member of staff to act as the waiter but he refused and a second employee stepped forward and stripped off to serve the fish and chips on Monday .
The care home has 36 elderly residents in 30 single rooms and three shared rooms .
Tracie North , director of operations and quality for Cornwall Care , said : ' The care of our clients is our number one priority and fundamental to this is giving them choices and respecting their wishes as adults .
Cornwall Care runs a Make a Wish initiativeand while requests are typically for a day trip out or even a pasty and a pint , one of our residents recently asked if she could have a fish and chips supper served by a man wearing a thong .
' To make this lady 's slightly unusual wish come true , it 's possible our staff overstepped the mark and , while the wish was carried out in a lighthearted way , we are sorry if anyone was offended .
' The lady herself , her family and the member of staff who acted as her waiter believe that while it may have been a bit risque , the wish was carried out with the utmost respect for all those involved and taken in the good humoured way it was intended by residents and staff present at the time .
' We will continue to encourage staff to be innovative in the way we run our care homes but we will be speaking with all our managers to ensure that they know where to draw the line in future . '

Equality minister Harriet Harman has set out plans to allow firms to discriminate in favour of female and ethnic minority job candidates .
She said firms should be able to choose a woman over a man of equal ability if they wanted to - or vice versa .
The new Equalities Bill will also force public sector employers to disclose the gender pay gap in their organisation .
The plans , which will be adopted in England , Wales and Scotland , will also ban all age discrimination .
Setting out the plans in a Commons statement , Ms Harman said the proposed bill - due later this year - would " address the serious inequalities that still exist " in the UK .
' Old boy network '
They would increase fairness and diversity and help Britain compete in the global economy by being more open , she told MPs .
" A society which is equal and fair is one which is more at ease with itself , " she added .
This bill should seek to unite not divide - it has good intentions but its lack of detail and clarity is disappointing
Theresa May
Shadow Commons leader
Mark Easton on the gender gap Q&A : Equalities Bill
The plans would also bring together all previous discrimination law into a single piece of legislation which she said would cut red tape for business .
Allowing " positive action " would help organisations such as the police better reflect the communities they serve by recruiting more female and ethnic minority officers , said Ms Harman .
But if , for example , a headmistress wanted to discriminate in favour of a male teacher to balance an all female team that would be allowed too .
Wage gap Asked how she could justify discrimination in the name of equality , she said she wanted tackle " patterns of discrimination " in the workforce and ensure firms were " not just ' entrenched in the old boy network ' " .
Age discrimination in the workplace has been illegal since 2006 , but the new legislation will tackle more widespread forms of age - related prejudice .

It also aims to close the gender pay gap by forcing firms to publish pay rates .
Female part - time workers still earned 40 % less per hour than their full - time male counterparts , Ms Harman told Today BBC Radio 4's Today programme .
" Do we think she is 40 % less intelligent , less committed , less hard - working , less qualified ?
It 's not the case .
It 's entrenched discrimination .
It 's allowed to persist because it 's all swept under the carpet . "
The bill will also seek to stop pensioners being denied NHS treatment because of their age , although doctors will still be able to refuse treatment if they believe there are sound clinical reason for doing so .
HAVE YOUR SAY
It 's a very artificial way to fix the problem Johnny , East London
Age discrimination will also be outlawed in the provision of goods and services , although there could be exemptions for things like holiday aimed at certain age groups .
It will also give women the right to breastfeed in public and outlaw " homophobic bullying " in the workplace .
Theresa May , for the Conservatives , broadly welcomed the proposals but said they " confused the government 's message " by allowing discrimination in certain circumstances .
" This bill should seek to unite not divide .
It has good intentions but its lack of detail and clarity is disappointing , " she told MPs
She said she was willing to work with the government to improve the legislation .
The Tories want compulsory pay audits for firms found guilty of gender discrimination at employment tribunals .
Lib Dem youth and equality spokeswoman Lynne Featherstone also broadly welcomed the proposals .
But she said : " If the government genuinely wants to tackle equality it must do more to end the growing discrepancy between the rules on pay for the public and private sector .
" Without compulsory pay audits for the private sector these proposals will represent a very real victory for the hawks in the cabinet . "

What are these ?
' God has always been planning things for me '
Shobha Warrier

You may ask , what 's so special about this 21 - year - old when there are hundreds of students passing out from various IITs and joining big companies like Google ?
Naresh is special .
His parents are illiterate .
He has no legs and moves around in his powered wheel chair .
( In fact , when I could not locate his lab , he told me over the mobile phone , ' I will come and pick you up ' .
And in no time , he was there to guide me )
Ever smiling , optimistic and full of spirit ; that is Naresh .
He says , " God has always been planning things for me .
That is why I feel I am lucky . "
Read why Naresh feels he is lucky .
Childhood in a village
I spent the first seven years of my life in Teeparru , a small village in Andhra Pradesh , on the banks of the river Godavari .
My father Prasad was a lorry driver and my mother Kumari , a house wife .
Though they were illiterate , my parents instilled in me and my elder sister ( Sirisha ) the importance of studying .
Looking back , one thing that surprises me now is the way my father taught me when I was in the 1st and 2nd standards .
My father would ask me questions from the text book , and I would answer them .
At that time , I did n't know he could not read or write but to make me happy , he helped me in my studies !
Another memory that does n't go away is the floods in the village and how I was carried on top of a buffalo by my uncle .
I also remember plucking fruits from a tree that was full of thorns .
I used to be very naughty , running around and playing all the time with my friends .
I used to get a lot of scolding for disturbing the elders who slept in the afternoon .
The moment they started scolding , I would run away to the fields !
I also remember finishing my school work fast in class and sleeping on the teacher 's lap !
January 11 , 1993 , the fateful day
On the January 11 , 1993 when we had the Sankranti holidays , my mother took my sister and me to a nearby village for a family function .
From there we were to go with our grandmother to our native place .
But my grandmother did not come there .
As there were no buses that day , my mother took a lift in my father 's friend 's lorry .
As there were many people in the lorry , he made me sit next to him , close to the door .
It was my fault ; I fiddled with the door latch and it opened wide throwing me out .
As I fell , my legs got cut by the iron rods protruding from the lorry .
Nothing happened to me except scratches on my legs .
The accident had happened just in front of a big private hospital but they refused to treat me saying it was an accident case .
Then a police constable who was passing by took us to a government hospital .
First I underwent an operation as my small intestine got twisted .
The doctors also bandaged my legs .
I was there for a week .
When the doctors found that gangrene had developed and it had reached up to my knees , they asked my father to take me to a district hospital .
There , the doctors scolded my parents a lot for neglecting the wounds and allowing the gangrene to develop .
But what could my ignorant parents do ?
In no time , both my legs were amputated up to the hips .
I remember waking up and asking my mother , where are my legs ?
I also remember that my mother cried when I asked the question .
I was in the hospital for three months .
Life without legs
I do n't think my life changed dramatically after I lost both my legs .
Because all at home were doting on me , I was enjoying all the attention rather than pitying myself .
I was happy that I got a lot of fruits and biscuits .

Those familiar with cable news television understand that several programs - even entire networks - broadcast from a particular bias .
Keith Olbermann 's COUNTDOWN on MSNBC is left leaning , as is Dan Abrams ' VERDICT .
Olbermann has become famous for his highly crafted " Special Comments " which take aim at conservatives from George W. Bush to Rudolf Giuliani .
CNN has Glenn Beck and Lou Dobbs - both of whom use vitriol to attack various factions of the political world .
Beck goes after so - called liberals .
Dobbs is an equal opportunity attacker who assaults the Bush administration , members of Congress and ethnic groups from his prejudiced perspective .
FOX has an entire network , with anchors like Bill O'Reilly and Sean Hannity , who routinely lambaste the left .
Each of these pundits , or performers , are known for their ideological leanings .
Those who watch their programs do so presupposing the bias they will see .
Until recently , it had seemed that most of the clearly biased shows on cable news television had been publicly outed as leaning left or leaning right .
But on Friday , viewers learned there was yet another conservative Republican show , as vitriolic as FOX , airing nightly on CNN .
That show is Election Center , hosted by former NBC performer , Campbell Brown .
Election Center , which began airing last January with original anchor John Roberts , is billed as " the network 's daily examination of news from the campaign trail that combines CNN 's unrivaled field reporting and analysis with state - of - the - art broadcasting technology . "
It might be that providing " unrivaled reporting and analysis " on a daily basis was the original intent of CNN when Election Center first aired with John Roberts .
Roberts does n't conflate reporting with agenda .
However , CNN chose a less balanced and more ideological path for the show when it brought on conservative Bush supporter , Campbell Brown , as Election Center 's new anchor .
If Brown 's conservative leanings were n't all that obvious in the beginning , that all changed on Friday when Brown and CNN Headline News anchor , Erica Hill , virulently mocked the House Judiciary Committee for holding a hearing on impeachment .
After Brown and Hill 's searing attack on the Democrats , any sense of legitimacy Brown had tried to muster instantly fell away .
Because of Brown and Hill 's over - the - top trashing of the Congressional impeachment hearing , CNN's Election Center has devolved into the lowest form of " spin . "
It 's lost all credibility .
Witness for yourselves ( in video and text ) the slanted performance by CNN anchors , Brown and Hill , on a show that advertises its " unrivaled field reporting and analysis . "
C. Brown :
You might have thought there was big news on Capitol Hill today .
Democrats were talking about impeaching the president .
But actually it was all just stagecraft .
And Erica
Hill is here .
Tell us about this piece of Kabuki theatre .
Erica E. Hill : Oh and Campbell , theatre it was .
Today 's House Judiciary Committee Hearing was officially billed as " an examination of executive power and its constitutional limitations . "
And from the beginning it was pretty clear this was all just stagecraft in what one Republican lawmaker deemed impeachment light .
The Democratic leadership made it clear impeachment is not on the table at this hearing today for two reasons : not only is there not enough time left in President Bush 's term but also they know any impeachment hearings at this point could cause a major backlash against the Party come November .
So if you can't impeach , why not vent ?
And that is exactly what they did .
Take a listen .
( Democratic Congress members denounce George W. Bush .
Erica
Hill mocks rules established for the Hearing ... )
C. Brown : ( giggling )
Oooh that 's a good one .
Who knew ?
Alright so this is really just stagecraft - not to mention a real waste of taxpayer money and Congress ' time .
E. Hill : ( mocking ) A waste of our money ?
C. Brown : Did any Republicans even bother to show up for it ?
E. Hill : Actually a few did .
Most Republican lawmakers boycotted the hearing but a few were there and those who did attend as you can imagine were downright disgusted .
(... Republican Congressmen Lamar Smith and Trent Franks denounce Democrats and the Hearing ... )
E. Hill :
Well it turns out Representative Lamar Smith was right .
There was no impeachment hearing that came out of it .
As for the President today - clearly not too worried about this Hearing .
He was in Peoria , Illinois , as you can see here - kissin ' babies , smilin ' - taking pictures - not a care in the world .
Check out that guy [ a baby pictured with President Bush ] with his little shades on .
Cute .
C. Brown : Cute baby .
E. Hill : I can't get my kid to wear them .
C. Brown : ( approving hand gesture and smile )
And there 's the President .
Good stuff tonight !
Erica Hill - as always , thanks .
In some instances in broadcast journalism - or in what passes for broadcast journalism - there is room for interpretation .
But in this high - pitched giddy exchange between Brown and Hill , the bias is unmistakeable .
They never offer the possibility that the Congressional Hearing is legitimate - even though the Committee heard testimony from Constitutional scholars , renowned legal experts , and current and former members of Congress .
They never offer that the People 's business is being addressed or that there exists a Constitutional mandate for the Legislative Branch to assess and monitor the deeds and acts of the Executive .
In their ideological disposal of the rule of law , Brown and Hill use the CNN pulpit to dissuade viewers from any real understanding of what the Hearing was addressing and why Democrats , and some Republicans , believed the Hearing should be held .
Where was the journalism ?
Where was the reporting and analysis ?
Do pejoratives like " stagecraft , " " Kabuki theatre , " and " a waste of taxpayer money " rise to constructive criticism for CNN ?
To those who monitor cable news television and the personalities it employs , the fact that Campbell Brown is a Republican is no revelation .
She 's married to FOX News contributor , Dan Senor , who also served as spokesman for George W. Bush 's failed Coalition Provisional Authority , which early on controlled and mismanaged Iraq .
Senor was also George W. Bush 's Deputy Press Secretary under Scott McClellan .
He is currently a founding partner of the global investment group , Rosemont Capital , and a former investment professional at the Carlysle Group - along with George Herbert Walker Bush , James Baker , and other prominent Republicans .
Dan Senor is a high power player in conservative Republican politics and in the world of global finance .
While Senor 's wife , Campbell Brown , does n't lay public claim to being a conservative Republican , her ideological bent is clear to those who watch her perform .
But after Friday 's performance with Erica Hill , Mrs. Brown - Senor 's Republican agenda will be crystal clear to all .
( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlyle_Group )
The harm Brown and Hill caused on Friday by not honestly informing their viewers of what was truly going on in the Judiciary Committee hearing is shameful proof of cable news ' dereliction and wanton abuse of the public 's airwaves .
For me , these abuses of broadcast privileges by depriving the public of its ' right to know ' are tantamount to crime .
As for CNN , its self - exaltation as the " most trusted name in news " is as much an assault on reality as FOX 's claim of " fair and balanced . "
Broadcast journalism has hit an all time low .
For those who believe as I do that Campbell Brown knowingly and wantonly went beyond the bounds of legitimate journalism and should be removed as host of Election Center , please email CNN as quickly as possible at the following addresses :

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- President Bush 's budget chief blamed the faltering economy and the bipartisan stimulus package for the record $ 482 billion deficit the White House predicted for the 2009 budget year .
The White House blames a faltering economy and the stimulus package for the increased budget deficit .
Jim Nussle , the director of the Office of Management and Budget , said the deficit would be about 3.3 percent of the nation 's gross domestic product , the measure of the nation 's total economy .
The fiscal year begins October 1 , 2008 .
The federal deficit is the difference between what the government spends and what it takes in from taxes and other revenue sources .
The government must borrow money to make up the difference .
While the deficit would be a record in absolute dollar terms , Nussle said it would be below the 2004 deficit , 3.6 percent of GDP , and the record deficit of 1983 , 6 percent of GDP , when compared with the size of the overall U.S. economy .
White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said the stimulus package was necessary , even if it increased the deficit .
" We do think the plan was the right one , and it will have an effect , " she said .
" And the best way to help reduce the deficit is to make sure you are keeping a lock on spending , but also that you can also try to help to build the economy .
So we hope this will help us pull out of the economic downturn over the next few months because of the stimulus package .
" I remember that back when we were discussing the stimulus package , both parties recognized that the deficit would increase , and that would be the price that we pay in order to help improve the economy , " she said .
Nussle said the $ 170 billion , bipartisan stimulus , which congressional Democrats and Bush agreed to earlier this year , was a major reason the deficit was expected to reach record levels next year .
The deficit projection for 2009 would have been only 2.2 percent of the economy , or $ 272 billion , if the stimulus package is excluded , Nussle said .
Watch Nussle warn Congress not to increase spending »
" The determination was made that getting the economy back on track was a higher priority than immediate deficit reduction , " Nussle said .
He said the OMB projects that the deficit would fall after the 2009 budget year , and he predicted that the government would have a surplus in budget year 2012 , if the president 's budget blueprint is followed .
" Near - term deficits are temporary and manageable if -- and only if -- we keep spending in check , the tax burden low and the economy growing , " Nussle said , warning that congressional Democrats were planning to add billions of dollars in spending to the federal budget .
President Bush inherited a budget surplus of $ 128 billion when he took office in 2001 but has since posted a budget deficit every year .
View a history of the government deficits and surpluses »
The Bush administration has spent heavily on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , and faces a large budget shortfall in tax revenue in part because of Bush 's tax cuts and a souring economy .
A Democratic point man on the budget , Sen. Kent Conrad of North Dakota , blasted the administration for its " reckless fiscal policies , " blaming the president 's tax cuts for driving the government into deficit and saying Bush " will be remembered as the most fiscally irresponsible president in our nation 's history . "
Watch Conrad call the federal debt Bush 's legacy »
Conrad , who chairs the Senate 's budget committee , accused the president of " squandering " the surplus he inherited from President Bill Clinton and said the increased debt the government has taken on to cover the deficit has undermined the value of the dollar and hurt the overall economy .
" If they gave out Olympic medals for fiscal irresponsibility , President Bush would take the gold , silver and bronze , " Conrad said .
" With his eight years in office , he will have had the five highest deficits ever recorded .
And the highest of those deficits is now projected to come in 2009 , as he leaves office . "
But a senior administration official says the budgetary problems stem from what he called inadequate defense , intelligence and homeland security resources that were handed down from Clinton .
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office in March projected the deficit for the 2008 fiscal year , which ends September 30 , would be $ 357 billion .
It predicted the 2009 deficit to be $ 342 billion , if the president 's proposals were adopted .
Both assumptions , however , were made before the economic stimulus package was passed by Congress and signed by the president this spring .
The CBO said it would release revised deficit estimates in September .
The two major presidential candidates -- Democrat Sen. Barack Obama and Republican Sen. John McCain -- used news that the United States ' budget deficit will hit a record high as an opportunity to criticize each other 's fiscal plans .
CNN 's Brianna Keiler and Scott Anderson contributed to this report .

A clear explanation of why anarchists oppose terrorism , and why terrorism or propaganda by deed can be of no benefit to the working class , as capitalism is a social relationship , not a group of bad individuals .
This essay was was published as a pamphlet around late 1978 or 1979 , in the aftermath of the Sydney Hilton Bombing .
The black humour of the time around the anarchist movement was that the police and security forces framed Ananda Marga because they came before Anarchism in the alphabet .
The arguments in this pamphlet are still as valid today as when they were written 30 years ago .

( CNN ) --
When you hear the name " Indiana Jones , " you think of an archaeologist carrying an idol and dodging a giant boulder .
When you hear about " Dow Jones , " you might wonder if it 's up or down that day .
However , in this case , Indiana and Dow Jones are siblings , 12 and 7 years old , respectively .
Dow and Indiana Jones participate in many sporting events .
Indiana says , " announcers love to say our names . "
Indiana Elizabeth Jones shared her story with the iReport community , and we spoke with her mother , Jennifer Jones .
The Port Deposit , Maryland , resident says Indiana got her name simply because her husband 's family is from that state .
As for Dow Joseph Jones , there was serious talk of naming him Jack Ryan Jones , to keep the Harrison Ford theme .
( Jack Ryan is the character Ford played in a series of action movies . )
Instead , her husband named their son Dow on a dare while Jennifer was asleep in the hospital bed after giving birth .
She said she cried when she found out and even thought about having Dow 's name changed .
CNN.com asked users to share their unusual names after a 9 - year - old New Zealand girl named Talula Does the Hula from Hawaii won the right to change her name .
( Full story )
Dozens of members of iReport.com community explained the stories behind their odd names , as well as what they 've experienced in their day - to - day lives .
Some names might not seem problematic until they 're actually used on a daily basis .
Open Weaver Banks of Ho - Ho-Kus , New Jersey ( speaking of odd names ) , says that she shared her story with iReport.com in hopes that parents would think twice before giving their children an unusual name .
Open is an unusual name , but it 's not necessarily a name that one might expect to cause regular difficulties .
Weaver Banks , however , says that she often has problems with it .

" I have a hard time using my credit cards for personal items , because clerks will accuse me of using a business card .
I can not tell my name to someone without having to explain it .
Some days , it is exhausting , and I can't even disguise the annoyance in my voice . "
Banks ' childhood was " painful " because of her name , too .
" I still give my mother a hard time about the name choice , and she tries to explain that she was young , she liked how it sounded , it was 1970 and various other reasons , " she explains .
" I actually tried going by another name for a year , and I realized that as much as I truly hate my name , it is embedded in me and so much a part of my experience . "

Some people avoid the use of their name altogether to avoid questions , confusion or embarrassment .
" At times , for the sake of avoiding an uncomfortable conversation or throwing someone off guard , I answer to the names of ' Mary ' or ' Kelly ' , " says Bluzette Martin of West Allis , Wisconsin .
At restaurants , " the thought of putting an employee through the pain of guessing how to spell and pronounce ' Bluzette ' just is n't worth it to me . "
Martin was named after " Bluzette , " an up - tempo jazz waltz written by Jean " Toots " Thielemans .
Despite her daily problems with this name , it certainly has its perks , like when she met Thielemans in 1987 at a club in Los Angeles .
" When I met [ him ] , he thanked my mother , " she says .
She called her mother in the middle of the night and told her that she had a surprise for her .
She gave the phone to Thielemans , and he started doing his famous whistling , to the tune of " Bluzette . "

Even celebrities are n't immune to the use of unusual names .
Take boxer George Foreman 's children , all named George .
( Or actor Jason Lee 's son , Pilot Inspektor , or comedian Penn Jillette 's daughter , Moxie CrimeFighter . )
These are just - plain bizarre names , like that of iReporter Holden Holden .
Holden , a sophomore at Shippensburg University in Pennsylvania , says that having a double name has its pros and cons .
He says he has a face people will remember because his name is easy to remember .
Unfortunately , he says , he 's not very good about remembering names himself , so it can lead to some awkward moments .
Holden 's grandfather died a month before he was born but was always called by his last name as a nickname .
" My last name is my mother 's maiden name , which she reverted to after she divorced , " he explains .
Holden also says that he plans to run for president in 2036 .
" Since my name is pretty easy to remember , it 'll be easier to garner votes that way . "

As for Dow Jones ' mother , she did n't go through with changing his name .
Now she sees it as something unique for someone with the very common last name " Jones . "
And perhaps that 's the bright side to having an unusual name :
It sets you apart from the crowd .
Dow 's sister does n't seem to mind .
" There is a new Indiana Jones movie out this year , so all my friends think it 's pretty cool , " she says .

Senator John McCain is sailing toward his coronation as the Republican presidential nominee while the Democratic candidates battle fiercely .
But Republicans also are engaged in some tough infighting that could disrupt the national convention and make it more difficult for him to unite the party in the fall .
Across the country , at state and county GOP conventions , diehard supporters of maverick Ron Paul are staging uprisings in an effort to secure a role for Paul at the national convention in Minneapolis - St. Paul .
And in the four primaries since clinching the nomination in early March , McCain has yet to reach 80 percent of the vote , as Paul and former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee continue to siphon away votes , even though Huckabee has withdrawn from the race .
The lingering anti-McCain sentiment among some voters and the continuing Paul insurgency suggest that McCain has not fully quelled hostility from some elements in his party .
Paul remains the lone holdout who is still actively campaigning .
He has indicated he is unlikely to endorse McCain , and his zealous supporters have turned out in large numbers to battle for delegates at recent GOP gatherings in Maine , Minnesota , Missouri , Nevada , and Oklahoma .
The Paul supporters do not see themselves as fighting for a hopeless cause , but as members of a new movement founded on libertarian principles .
Paul 's newest book , " The Revolution : A Manifesto , " has soared quickly to number one on the New York Times bestseller list .
" This is about continuing the message and having a voice of freedom , constitutionalism , and peace inside the Republican Party , " said Paul 's Maine coordinator , Ken Lindell , a former state representative .
" The goal at the national convention is to get a speaking slot for Dr. Paul to deliver that message . "
Other Paul loyalists say they may try to open debate on the party platform at the convention in early September .
Paul , a congressman from Texas , opposes the war in Iraq and what he describes as an interventionist US foreign policy .
He also advocates minimal government , abolishing the Internal Revenue Service , and a return to a monetary policy based on the gold standard .
Paul has 19 delegates to McCain 's 1,413 , the latter being well more than the 1,191 needed for the nomination , according to the latest Associated Press unofficial tally .
Paul 's campaign , which shattered online fund - raising records early in the campaign , had $ 5.1 million in cash at the end of March .
In Minnesota , Paul loyalists captured seven delegate slots at congressional district meetings , and in Nevada , the convention abruptly recessed on April 26 after balloting showed Paul supporters winning at least half of the initial contests for delegate slots to the national convention .
" We want them to know we 're not going to roll over any more , and as long as [ Paul ] is running , we 'll stand by him , " said Arden Osborne , a Paul supporter and chairman of the Nevada Liberty Alliance .
Osborne believes he won one of the slots to the national convention during the state convention in Reno .
Congressman wants hearings on Army recruiting scandal David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Thursday August 7 , 2008

This A Houston congressman is angry after learning that an Army recruiter in his district lied to a student who had changed his mind about enlisting and threatened he would be arrested as a deserter .
KHOU 11 news , which first reported the story last week , has found that the problem is not confined to Houston .
In fact , " citations for recruiter wrongdoing have nearly doubled over the past several years , and complains are up too . "
" That 's not what our country 's about , " Rep. Gene Green told KHOU .
" There 's a problem with the system in the Army . "
Green has written a letter to the Pentagon and also intends to ask the House Armed Services Committee to investigate or hold hearings .
There are two Texans on that committee , and Green plans to get both of them involved .
Green appeared on the syndicated program Democracy Now ! on Thursday morning and was particularly concerned that the recruiter involved in a similar incident in Houston three years ago had actually been promoted to station commander following the incident .
Douglas Smith of the US Army Recruiting Headquarters told Democracy Now ! , " Just because someone has done something wrong does n't mean that they get the death penalty . "
" There 's a difference between the death penalty and a promotion , " replied Democracy Now ! host Amy Goodman .
" He was actually promoted after this .
...
What was the negative penalty ? "
" I 'm not allowed to tell you , " Smith replied .
" That 's covered under Army regulations . "
" And that , " KHOU reported , " fired up the congressman enough for him to send off this letter to the Secretary of the Army demanding to know ' why more was not done ' and ' what steps the Army will take to ensure this does not happen again . ' "

For example , if you counted 4 hands and 2 fingers , then you have approximately 4.5 hours left until sunset .
Keep in mind that this will still only give you a rough estimate of the remaining time in a day .
Once you 've reached the horizon , you can also count how many fingers could fit in the space between the sun and horizon if you ca n’t fit a whole hand there .
This is also helpful if you cannot fit your whole hand between the sin and the horizon .
In this case , you will only need to count the fingers between the sun and horizon instead .
Each finger that will fit in this space represents 15 extra minutes before sunset .
Multiply the number of fingers by 15 and add this to the number of hands you counted .

Was FDR right when he said “ The only thing we have to fear is fear itself ” ?
How many times have you seen this bumper sticker ?
It ’s really not that hard to slap a bumper sticker on the back of your jacked up 4× 4 and think you ’re a badass .
Some of the clowns rolling around in my neck of the woods adorn their mud-mobiles with bumper stickers and a healthy set of bumper nuts .
Even these guys do n’t have what it takes to handle the top 10 scariest hobbies .
I assure you that any of the next 10 hobbies , bumper nuts or not , will loosen up your sphincter for at least a split second .
10 . Sky Diving
Anyone will tell you the scariest part of sky diving is right before you leave the plane .
After that it ’s just the thrill of a lifetime .
9. Kayak Shark Fishing
Shark fishing from the beach is one thing , but pulling an 8 ′ shark onto your kayak is completely another .
Just how crazy do you have to be to let one of these guys pull you around the ocean ?
8. Rattlesnake Roundup
The gimmick at a rattlesnake roundup is to go out and hunt down as many rattlesnakes as possible .
Every year there are some 20,000 snakes pulled from their dens , weighed in , milked for their venom then cooked up for the masses .
7. Cave Diving
You might not think cave diving would be that scary until you ’re there .
Its easy to get lost , hung up on the rocks , or just simply run out of air due to lingering a bit too long with breathtaking views like this .
6. Glacier Surfing
Okay .
Head to Alaska and find your favorite glacier .
Wait around in freezing cold water … for it to break off .
When it does , ride the tidal wave on a surf board while the ice chases you down .
Holy Crap !
5. Storm Chasing
Getting up close and personal with a tornado is n’t my idea of a good time .
4. Bull Fighting
Matadors and the thousands of yearly participants in the Running of the Bulls festival all have one thing in common .
They love the bulls .
I just do n’t get it .
Sure you can dodge him a couple times but eventually he ’s gonna slip that horn in your sweet spot .
See , I told you we ’d loosen up that sphincter .
3. Lion Hunting
Hunting .
Not so scary .
Becoming part of the food chain … now that ’s scary !
It just goes to show you how scary nature can be .
2. MMA Fight
Sure these guys are million dollar prize fighters , but there are thousands of kids out there doing this as their hobby .
Do n’t get me wrong , I love a good MMA match .
I just ca n’t imagine taking a punch from these animals let alone a submission hold where my sphincter starts leaking 😉
Several guys I ’ve talked to say it does n’t hurt after the first punch .
Give me a break .
1. Noodling
For those of you not familiar , noodling is basically fishing with your hands .
A noodler feels around the snake infested water with his hands and feet for a large hole .
Then usually goes underwater to ram their fist down a catfish ’s throat .
The catfish ( the largest of which can be 50 - 70 lbs. ) , will latch on to the fisherman ’s hand , trying to protect it ’s comfy home .
The noodler then has the task of dragging their catch ( still latched onto their arm ) out of the water and either onto shore , or into a boat .
On the plus side , if they manage do all of this before they run out of air , and then retrieve their arm from the grip of the catfish ’s many teeth … well , they ’ve got dinner for a week .

Clinton 's Up - Is - Down World Throughout history , it ’s been common for politicians to shade the truth when caught in a tight spot .
But sometimes politicians push the limits , crossing the line into an Orwellian world where up is down , where bullies are victims , where people objecting to the lies are shouted down .

If that world seems familiar to Americans , it should .
It is the world in which we ’ve lived for the past seven or eight years under George W. Bush , as his clever operatives routinely turn truth inside out .
Now , Hillary Clinton ’s campaign is applying many of these same head - spinning tactics to win the Democratic presidential race .
As for Bush , remember how Iraq War critics were treated in 2002 - 03 .
Anyone who spoke up against the rush to invade – the likes of Al Gore , weapons inspector Scott Ritter and the Dixie Chicks – saw their loyalty , their motives and even their sanity questioned .
Gore was bitter and delusional .
Ritter was a Saddam Hussein sympathizer for questioning Bush ’s clams about Iraqi WMD .
For disrespecting Bush , the Dixie Chicks deserved to face boycotts , have their CDs crushed under trucks , and even have their lives threatened .
Angered that France urged caution on Iraq , Bush ’s backers poured French wine into gutters and re-named “ French fries ” as “ Freedom Fries . ”
At a lower level , our Consortiumnews.com articles , which objected to the twisted pre-war intelligence and to the wishful thinking about the war , drew a flood of venomous e-mails .
Even though Bush ’s aides encouraged this bullying and Bush winked at the harsh treatment of dissenters , much of the U.S. news media treated him as the victim .
In this view , he was the target of irrational hatred from crazed Americans suffering from what was termed “ Bush Derangement Syndrome . ”
Reality had no place in Bush World .
When Iraq ’s WMD never materialized , Bush blamed Saddam Hussein for not letting U.N. inspectors in , although the inspectors had been scouring Iraq for months until Bush forced them to leave in March 2003 , just before the invasion .
[ For more details on Bush ’s lies , see our book , Neck Deep . ]
Hillary ’s Version
What ’s been striking about recent turns in the Democratic presidential contest is how the tactics of Hillary Clinton ’s campaign have come to mirror the Bush strategies – simultaneously playing the bully and the victim , asserting that up is down , and bashing anyone who notices the contradictions .
Stunned by Obama ’s surprising successes and his delegate lead , Clinton ’s campaign has thrown what it calls the “ kitchen sink ” at the Illinois senator – including overt attacks on his ethics and sub rosa insinuations about his race and religion .
On Feb. 26 , Internet gossip Matt Drudge reported that a Clinton staffer e-mailed around a photo taken of Obama during a 2006 trip to Kenya when he was dressed in a turban and other traditional garb of a Somali Elder .
That reinforced earlier rumors spread about Obama as a secret Muslim , though he has long belonged to a Christian church in Chicago .
Obama ’s campaign manager David Plouffe denounced the Clinton campaign for circulating the photo , complaining of “ shameful offensive fear - mongering . ”
Instead of showing remorse , the Clinton campaign denied knowledge of the photo and went on the attack .
“ If Barack Obama ’s campaign wants to suggest that a photo of him wearing traditional Somali clothing is divisive , they should be ashamed , ” said Clinton campaign manager Maggie Williams .
Some Clinton defenders went further , arguing that Sen.
Clinton was the real victim , since there was no hard evidence that the Clinton campaign was orchestrating the Internet smears of Obama , which also have been spread by right - wing operatives in talk radio and on the Internet .
On March 2 , however , when Hillary Clinton had a chance to slam the door on these tactics , she did n’t .
Asked on CBS ’s “ 60 Minutes ” whether she believed rumors claiming that Obama was a closet Muslim , Clinton responded in a way that left the question open .
“ No , no , why would I ? ” she said , before adding : “ there is nothing to base that on .
As far as I know . ”
New York Times columnist Bob Herbert called Clinton ’s response “ one of the sleaziest moments of the campaign . …
As far as I know .
If she had been asked if she thought President Bush was a Muslim , would her response have included the caveat ‘ as far as I know ’ ?
What about Senator McCain ?
Why then , with Senator Obama ? ” [ NYT , March 8 , 2008 ]
But the Clinton campaign has been filled with such moments of injecting doubts about Obama ’s truthfulness and integrity , a nasty strategy that the Clintons used to call “ the politics of personal destruction ” – when they were on the receiving end in the 1990s .
Now , Hillary Clinton has become a chief practitioner of this brand of politics , taking even minor questions about Obama and hyping them into character issues .
‘ Change You Can Xerox ’
At the Feb. 21 debate , Clinton lashed out at Obama for alleged “ plagiarism ” – or “ change you can Xerox ” – in his borrowing of a rhetorical phrase about the importance of words that was used previously and recommended to him by his friend , Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick .
Though politicians frequently copy phrases and ideas from one another , plagiarism – the unauthorized use of someone else ’s words usually in printed form – is considered a serious ethical violation and was clearly meant to suggest dishonesty by Obama .
However , during the same debate in which she leveled the plagiarism charge , Clinton twice used wording that appeared lifted from former Sen.
John Edwards and her own husband .
( Her campaign dismissed those complaints about plagiarism as silly and insignificant . )
Again , there was a similarity to Bush ’s behavior , such as when he and his supporters attack their critics for lacking realism or not facing the facts – when it is the Bush camp that has demonstrated a breathtaking contempt for reality .
This throwing - stones - from - a - glass - house audacity may achieve some psychological advantage , creating confusion about who ’s really at fault or at least giving pause to anyone who might dare point out the discrepancies .
Even earlier in the Democratic campaign , the Clintons had put this approach on display , attacking Obama over his positions – on the Iraq War , positive comments about Ronald Reagan , and Obama ’s relationship with a sleazy real - estate developer – when the Clintons were arguably more vulnerable on the exact same points .
Hillary Clinton voted to give President Bush authorization to invade Iraq ( while Obama opposed the invasion ) ; the Clintons both have praised Reagan far more than Obama has ; and the Clintons had closer ties to an ethically challenged developer , Whitewater ’s James McDougal , than Obama apparently had with Tony Rezko .
[ See Consortiumnews.com ’s “ The Clinton Audacity . ” ]
Distasteful Medicine Beyond the arrogance of this holier - than - thou behavior , it often is mixed with an annoying dose of victimhood whenever someone tries to give them a taste of their own medicine .
For instance , after scoring political points in Ohio and Texas by bashing Obama ’s ethics , the Clinton campaign was outraged when Obama suggested that the Clintons should follow his lead and release their tax returns .
A New York Times editorial and many good - government activists had made the same point – and during the Feb. 26 debate , NBC ’s Washington bureau chief Tim Russert asked Sen .
Clinton to release her tax returns before the Texas and Ohio primaries , noting that she had loaned her campaign $ 5 million and that much of Bill Clinton ’s income came from “ overseas business dealings . ”
In response , Clinton offered a disingenuous answer .
“ Well , I ca n’t get it together by then , but I will certainly work to get it together .
I ’m a little busy right now .
I hardly have time to sleep , ” she said .
The truth is that she could have her tax returns released with one or two phone calls to her accountant and her press office .
She appears instead to have something in those returns that she does n’t want the voters to know – even as she insists that she ’s been fully “ vetted ” and Obama deserves more intense scrutiny from the press .
When Obama pressed on the tax - return issue , the Clinton team – surprise , surprise – accused him of acting like a Republican .
Clinton spokesman Howard Wolfson implied that Obama was “ imitating Ken Starr , ” the right - wing special prosecutor who pursued the Clintons in the 1990s .
Clinton adviser Ann Lewis said Obama was “ using Republican talking points ” and had “ recycled many of the same Republican attacks . ”
[ Washington Post , March 7 , 2008 ]
Yet , using Republican attack lines was exactly what Clinton did to Obama in the Feb. 26 debate when she claimed Obama had “ basically threatened to bomb Pakistan . ”
That was a charge that President Bush and Sen. John McCain had made against Obama earlier .
It also was n’t true .
As Obama explained , his real position was that he would authorize an attack on al - Qaeda bases inside Pakistan if the Pakistani government refused to act .
He was n’t threatening to “ bomb Pakistan ” in any reasonable interpretation of his words .
NAFTA Flap
In the days before the key Ohio and Texas primaries , the Clinton campaign also made hay out of a leaked Canadian government memo saying that an Obama adviser , University of Chicago economics professor Austan Goolsbee , had equivocated to a Canadian diplomat about Obama ’s tough talk on renegotiating the NAFTA trade deal .
[ NYT , March 4 , 2008 ]
Clinton accused him of giving “ the old wink - wink , ” again portraying Obama as untrustworthy .
It took the Obama campaign several days to pin down and explain the details of the meeting , which both Obama and Goolsbee said had been misrepresented in the memo .
But the political damage was done , especially in NAFTA - averse Ohio .
Much less attention was given to disclosures in Canada – after the primaries – that the Clinton campaign had given similar NAFTA assurances to the Canadian government to assuage its concerns about Clinton ’s equally tough talk on NAFTA .
Ian Brodie , chief of staff to Prime Minister Stephen Harper , told reporters that the Clinton campaign had called the Canadian Embassy in Washington to tell officials to take her anti-NAFTA rhetoric “ with a grain of salt , ” the AFP wire service reported on March 6 .
Inside Canada , the leaking of the Obama memo – especially while documents about any Clinton assurance apparently were withheld – prompted complaints that Harper , a close ally of President Bush and the Republican Party , may have been interfering with the U.S. political process to help his conservative friends in Washington .
But the bigger question may relate to whether Democratic voters want a nominee whose campaign seems to have bought into the negative , reality - bending , albeit winning strategies of the Republicans .
Some Democrats may view Clinton ’s adoption of these Republican tactics as wrong and even disqualifying .
Others , however , may look kindly on the Clinton approach , under the old theory :
If you ca n’t beat them , join them .

It ’s been 75 years since the federal government , on the spurious grounds of fighting the Great Depression , ordered the confiscation of all monetary gold from Americans , permitting trivial amounts for ornamental or industrial use .
This happens to be one of the episodes Kevin Gutzman and I describe in detail in our new book , Who Killed the Constitution ?
The Fate of American Liberty from World War I to George W. Bush .
From the point of view of the typical American classroom , on the other hand , the incident may as well not have occurred .
A key piece of legislation in this story is the Emergency Banking Act of 1933 , which Congress passed on March 9 without having read it and after only the most trivial debate .
House Minority Leader Bertrand H. Snell ( R - NY ) generously conceded that it was " entirely out of the ordinary " to pass legislation that " is not even in print at the time it is offered . "
He urged his colleagues to pass it all the same : " The house is burning down , and the President of the United States says this is the way to put out the fire .
[ Applause . ]
And to me at this time there is only one answer to this question , and that is to give the President what he demands and says is necessary to meet the situation . "
Among other things , the act retroactively approved the president ’s closing of private banks throughout the country for several days the previous week , an act for which he had not bothered to provide a legal justification .
It gave the secretary of the Treasury the power to require all individuals and corporations to hand over all their gold coin , gold bullion , or gold certificates if in his judgment " such action is necessary to protect the currency system of the United States . "
The Emergency Banking
Act reached back in time to amend the Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917 , which had originally been intended to criminalize economic intercourse between American citizens and declared enemies of the United States .
One provision of the act granted the president the power to regulate and even prohibit " under such rules and regulations as he may prescribe any transactions in foreign exchange , export or earmarkings of gold or silver coin or bullion or currency by any person within the United States . "
In 1918 , the act was amended to extend its provisions two years beyond the conclusion of hostilities , and to allow the president to " investigate , regulate , or prohibit " even the " hoarding " of gold by an American .

Everyday Utilitarianism : Who Gets the TV First ?
I ’ve often thought it would be fun to write a book on “ everyday utilitarianism ” — how to apply mathematical formalizations of utilitarianism and game theory to help you solve everday life dilemmas , like who should get to use the television first or whether you should go out with that guy .
The basic idea would be that each chapter would revolve around a particular mathematical principle and demonstrate it using a concrete example from everyday life .
Since I ’ll probably never get around to writing such a book , I figured I ’d just write up such examples on my blog when I encountered them and maybe someone else would take the idea and run with it .
So here ’s the first example :
It ’s 8 pm , and you settle down in front of the television to watch American Idol .
Unfortunately , at the very same time your roommate is also settling down in front of the television to play one of his video games .
Quickly , the two of you get into a tiff about who will get to use the television first .
You both would prefer using the television first rather than second , yet , since American Idol is a live show , watching it now is a rather different experience from watching it later , while the video game will remain the same all night .
How can you prove mathematically to your roommate that you should get to use the television first ?
Let U ( TV_0 = A ) , which we ’ll write AT0 , represent the number of utiles ( essentially , a measure of enjoyment ) you get from watching the TV first , while BT0 represents the number of utiles your roommate gets from watching the TV first .
( AT1 and BT1 represent the utiles from watching it second . )
Obviously our goal is to maximize the total number of utiles ( i.e. enjoyment ) in the world , by picking the solution that leads to our greatest number .
First we write down what we know .
Obviously you both would prefer to watch the show first , rather than second :
AT0 > AT1
BT0 > BT1
But since Amereican Idol is live , we can also say that the benefit you get from watching it first is bigger than the benefit your roommate gets from playing his game first .
In other words :
AT0 - AT1 > BT0 - BT1
Finally , we want to find out which is bigger : you going first and him second , or you going second and him first .
Let >< represent “ which is bigger ? ”
AT0 + BT1 >< AT1 + BT0
Now , to solve , we take what we know :
AT0 - AT1 > BT0 - BT1
And we add AT1 to both sides :
AT0 > BT0 - BT1 + AT1
And then add BT1 to both sides :
AT0 + BT1 > BT0 + AT1
Which precisely answers are question above : it ’s better for you to go first .
By this time in the proof , however , your roommate should have wandered off , leaving you to watch American Idol in peace .
Unfortunately , not having seen your proof , he thinks you ’re just a selfish ass as opposed to trying hard to do what ’s best for the whole world .
You should follow me on twitter here .

The much awaited 10 inch version of Asus ’ EeePC is all ready to hit the market with Asus Eee PC 1000 while the EeePC 904 has an 8.9 inch screen .
The Eee PC 904 sports 1GB ram with 80 GB of space with Intel Celeron and Windows XP however the PC is fitted into a chassis that is same as the EeePC 1000 which allows the 904 model to have a larger keyboard .
The EeePC 1000 comes with a choice of Linux and Windows XP based models wherein the Linux based model has 40 GB of solid state drive compared to the 80 GB of the windows system .
The best part about the EeePC 1000 is the Intel Atom processor .
Bluetooth connectivity and 802.11a/g/n
Wi -Fi are common to both the Linux and windows models of 1000 and in comparison the 904 has 802.11b/g Wi -Fi connectivity .
Despite their differences both the 904 and the 1000 models have built - in webcams , six cell batteries , and resolution of 1,024 by 600 pixels .
Asus has priced the EeePC 904 at 269 Pounds , while the Linux version of EeePC 1000 is for 369 pounds and the Windows XP version is for 349 pounds .
The EeePC 1000 model has already been sent to the distributors while the EeePC 904 model is due out in the next week .
The jaws of a great white shark can inflict a bone - crunching bite of up to 1.8 tonnes , according to Australian researchers .
The fearsome predator 's chomp is around three times more powerful than a lion 's , at least 20 times stronger than a human 's and just over half as strong as Tyrannosaurus rex .
But today 's largest predatory fish would have come off much worse against a now extinct leviathan of the deep called Carcharodon megalodon , or " big tooth " , that died out 1.5 m years ago .
At 16 metres ( 52ft ) long and 100 tonnes , it would have put Jaws to shame , and the new analysis suggests that its colossal mouth could have produced a bite force of 10.8 to 18.2 tonnes .
" Nature has endowed [ the great white shark ] with more than enough bite force to kill and eat large and potentially dangerous prey , " said Stephen Wroe at the University of New South Wales in Sydney Australia .
" Pound for pound the great white 's bite is not particularly impressive , but the sheer size of the animal means that in absolute terms it tops the scales .
It must also be remembered that its extremely sharp serrated teeth require relatively little force to drive them through thick skin , fat and muscle . "
Trying to measure the bite of a live shark might sound like suicidal devotion to your field of science .
The researchers got around the danger by using an engineering technique called finite element analysis .
The method , which is used widely in building and car design , involves creating a computer model of the passage of stresses and strains through a material .
The first step is to create an accurate 3D digital representation of the skull or fossil - in this case the skull of a 2.4 metre long male shark - using an X - ray scanning technique called computer tomography .
This 3D shape is then broken up into tetrahedral blocks or " elements " that are linked together and react realistically to stresses and the movements of nearby elements .
In this way , scientists can apply imaginary forces to the structure and work out what stresses the shape can withstand .
The results are reported in the Journal of Zoology .
The technique was first applied to biological structures by Emily Rayfield at the University of Bristol in 2001 .
She first analysed the skull of Allosaurus , a carnivorous dinosaur but later applied the technique to T rex .
How the great white compares ...
The new analysis suggests that a 2.4 metre male shark can inflict a bite of 1.8 tonnes
King of the chompers is the extinct shark Carcharodon megalodon .
At 16 metres long and 100 tonnes , its jaws could have produced a bite force of 10.8 - 18.2 tonnes
An African lion 's jaws can produce a bite of 560kg
An adult human can muster a puny 80kg
The extinct Tyrannosaurus rex is estimated to have had a bite of 3.1 tonnes

If you do n’t believe this story is true , read this .
And if you do n’t believe John McCain was involved , read this .
UPDATE : Sorry , I ’ve had to turn off comments on this post .
Apparently the word “ drugs ” in the title was like honey to the spambots .
Kerry : McCain confused , ' unbelievably out of touch '
John Kerry , who 's served in the past as Obama 's heavy - hitter on national security , expressed incredulity at McCain 's remark this morning that the timing of troops return is " not too important . "
" It is unbelievably out of touch and inconsistent with the needs of Americans and particularly the families of troops who are over there .
To them it ’s the most important thing in the world when they come home , " he said .
" It ’s a policy for staying in Iraq . "
Kerry and Obama aide Susan Rice also both said McCain is " confused " * -- a line some in McCain 's camp will surely take as a shot at the candidate 's age .
" He confuses who Iran is training , he confuses what the makeup of Al Qaedais , he confuses the history going back to 682 of what has happened to Sunni and Shia , " Kerry said .
Rice cited a " pattern of confusing the basic facts and reality that pertain to Iraq . "
UPDATE : Asked if " confused " was a shot at McCain 's age , Rice responded : " What I meant by that was very simple :
That on critical factual questions that are fundamental to understanding what is going on in Iraq and the region , Senator McCain has gotten it wrong , and not just once but repeatedly . "
Kerry called the suggestion it had something to do with age " unfair and a ridiculous . "
" There are plenty of Senators and Congressmen in Washington , D.C. , who understand the difference and do n’t make the mistakes that he has made with respect to those policies , " Kerry said , mentionin John Warner .
" They know who the Sunni are and they know who the Shia are . "

Su Shi ( 1036 - 1101 ) , also known as Su Dongpo was an avid student of Buddhist teachings .
He was quick - witted and humorous ; as a Zen Buddhism follower he was very serious and self - disciplined .
He often discussed buddhism with his good friend , Zen Master Foyin .
The two lived across the river from one another .
Following is an interesting and famous story about him and Zen Master Foyin .
One day , Su Dongpo felt inspired and wrote the following poem :
I bow my head to the heaven within heaven
Hairline rays illuminating the universe
The eight winds cannot move me
Sitting still upon the purple golden lotus
The “ eight winds ” in the poem referred to praise , ridicule , honor , disgrace , gain , loss , pleasure and misery – interpersonal forces of the material world that drive and influence the hearts of men .
Su Dongpo was saying that he has attained a higher level of spirituality , where these forces no longer affect him .
Impressed by himself , Su Dongpo sent a servant to hand - carry this poem to Foyin .
He was sure that his friend would be equally impressed .
When Foyin read the poem , he immediately saw that it was both a tribute to the Buddha and a declaration of spiritual refinement .
Smiling , the Zen Master wrote “ fart ” on the manuscript and had it returned to Su Dongpo .
Su Dongpo was expecting compliments and a seal of approval .
When he saw “ fart ” written on the manuscript , he was shocked .
He burst into anger : “ How dare he insult me like this ?
Why that lousy old monk !
He ’s got a lot of explaining to do ! ”
Full of indignation , he rushed out of his house and ordered a boat to ferry him to the other shore as quickly as possible .
He wanted to find Foyin and demand an apology .
However , Foyin ’s door closed .
On the door was a piece of paper , for Su Dongpo .
The paper had following two lines :
The eight winds cannot move me
One fart blows me across the river
This stopped Su Dongpo cold .
Foyin had anticipated this hot - headed visit .
Su Dongpo ’s anger suddenly drained away as he understood his friend ’s meaning .
If he really was a man of spiritual refinement ,
completely unaffected by the eight winds , then how could he be so easily provoked ?
With a few strokes of the pen and minimal effort , Foyin showed that Su Dongpo was in fact not as spiritually advanced as he claimed to be .
Ashamed but wiser , Su Dongpo departed quietly .
This event proved to be a turning point in Su Dongpo ’s spiritual development .
From that point on , he became a man of humility , and not merely someone who boasted of possessing the virtue .

Women are twice as likely as men to develop MS
The number of people suffering from the neurological disease multiple sclerosis ( MS ) worldwide could be far more than the estimated 1.3 m , researchers say .
A major new study into the disease has been launched by the Multiple Sclerosis International Federation ( MSIF ) and the World Health Organization ( WHO ) .
They hope to answer key questions about MS , the cause of which is unclear .
Governments are being urged to invest more in education and services to improve sufferers ' quality of life .
Specialist equipment MS is a degenerative disease of the central nervous system .
It typically emerges in young adults and can lead to severe disability .
Click to see a map showing the worldwide spread of MS Symptoms often include aching , loss of balance , muscle spasm and paralysis and general fatigue .
But there are still many mysteries surrounding MS .
There must be many people out there who we just do n't know about
Peer Baneke , MSIF
It is not clear what causes it or why women are twice as likely as men to develop it .
Or why it is so much more common in colder countries than warmer ones .
The study has found that although most cases occur in the developed world , every country that took part in the survey , rich or poor , had some instances .
Peer Baneke , the chief executive of the MSIF , says the rough estimate of 1.3 m cases worldwide is probably a big underestimation .
" The diagnosis of multiple sclerosis is very difficult , " he said .
" You really need neurologists who have the knowledge to distinguish it from other things . "
It also needs specialist equipment which poorer health systems simply cannot access .
MRI scanners , for example , are in short supply in the developing world .
" There must be many people out there who we just do n't know about , " said Mr Baneke .
Stigma
The survey also looks at the experiences of people with MS .
In many countries , sufferers face stigma and misunderstanding .
Kanya Puspokusumo , a 36 - year - old Indonesian , was diagnosed in 2001 .
She said that some people thought MS was similar to Aids .
Even though she explained it was not transmitted from one person to another , many still excluded her socially .
Dr Hithaishi Weerakoon is a doctor in Sri Lanka who was diagnosed with MS more than a decade ago .
Many families do not acknowledge MS , she says , and keep affected family members hidden away .
Others say , wrongly , that it has developed as a condition because of sins in a past life .
Those associated with the study say this is an important start - but that far more research needs to be done , especially in developing countries where the process of identifying cases systematically and collecting data is still at a very early stage .

Dems turn out the lights but GOP wo n't go home Part II
Here are the latest updates on the continuing GOP protest on the House floor :
The House adjourned about three hours ago , but GOP lawmakers — outraged that Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - Calif . ) and the Democrats went home for five weeks without allowing a vote on offshore drilling — have refused to leave the floor .
Even though C - SPAN can't show you what 's going on ( C - SPAN is prevented from showing what 's happening on the floor when the House is out of session ) , Republicans are holding an unprecedented session on the House floor .
They have brought in dozens of their members , who are walking up and down the aisles making speeches .
They have packed the floors and galleries with staffers .
When Capitol Police tried to remove reporters from the gallery , Republicans stopped it from happening .
The crowd has repeatedly broken out in chants of " Vote , vote , vote ! "
There are several dozen Cub Scouts sitting on the House floor in seats normally occupied by members .
Update : A GOP staffer just informed me that post - adjournment protests by the minority party are not unprecedented .
The Democrats did it back in 1995 , when the Republicans were in control .
Democrats placed a big photo in the speaker 's chair of then - Speaker Newt Gingrich ( R - Ga . ) wearing a diaper .
Republicans note they are being more respectful this time .
Rep. Kevin Brady ( R - Texas ) , who was on a plane headed home , went back to the Capitol , walking on to the floor dragging his luggage .
He got a standing ovation .
Rep. John Shadegg ( R - Ariz . ) called it a " new Boston Tea Party ! "
Rep. Mike Pence ( R - Ind . ) said he was " not leaving until we call this Congress back into session and vote for energy independence . "
Rep. Tom Cole ( Okla . ) , chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee , said the dimly lit chamber is a " vision of the future by the Democrat Party :
The lights are out , there 's no power , and the air conditioning is gonna go off soon . "
Like the rest of the Mac nerd world , I saw the announcement of Squirrel Fish as very promising and inspiring news .
The WebKit team has redesigned its JavaScript parser , emphasizing speed performance by switching from a parsed - tree system to a bytecode - interpreted system .
The result is a much faster system that apparently offers the promise of even further optimizations as time goes by .
KUDOS to the WebKit team !
When I last read about JavaScript performance , it was on Jeff Atwood ’s substantial comparison of many browsers and their respective performances .
At that time Safari already stood near the front of the pack , only being narrowly beaten by Opera in terms of overall performance .
I expect that unless other browsers have also been dramatically enhancing their JavaScript performance during this time , the Squirrel Fish parser will put Apple ’s WebKit far in front of the other major browsers in the market .
At a time when JavaScript is being used more and more in web applications , the benefits of this advantage could be magnified into a noticeably superior user experience on many web sites .
What About AppleScript ?
This announcement got me thinking about Apple ’s scripting languages and where the most growth and progress is being seen .
Here we have a dedicated product team , responsible for providing a scripting service more or less only intended for use within the context of a web page .
Yet this team seems to have a stronger corporate charter for making progress than the AppleScript team , which is responsible for the language that provides system - wide scripting glue to both users and developers .
JavaScript must be the single most prioritized interpreted language being developed within the walls of Apple .
Yet AppleScript , an often - maligned proprietary Apple language , is still the system - wide standard .
As a variety of web technologies permeate the desktop ( and other platforms such as the iPhone ) , JavaScript is becoming increasingly popular and well - recognized .
While AppleScript is lauded for being accessible to naive users , it ’s factual ease of use is becoming less relevant as JavaScript ’s actual ease of use explodes .
How is JavaScript becoming actually easier for users ?
By means of simple , forced exposure .
Just as an awkward , text - based system such as HTML has become so dominant that many secretaries and construction workers are passably fluent in it , so are the majority of users who are likely to use scripting passably fluent with JavaScript .
Apple should make JavaScript its default scripting language .
There , I said it .
It was n’t easy , because I hold a soft spot in my heart for AppleScript .
But I ’m slightly more of a pragmatist than a romantic .
If JavaScript is what Apple cares most about , and JavaScript is where massive performance improvements are going to be made , then Apple should leverage those improvements to the benefit of every desktop scripter .
It sounds like I just said “ Apple should kill AppleScript , ” but I did n’t .
You see , the Open Scripting Architecture , on which AppleScript runs , is designed from the start to support multiple languages .
Think of the “ Open Scripting ” part of the system as the part that lets a script tell another application to do something .
The specific scripting language you use to accomplish the rest is really of no concern whatsoever .
Two languages , such as JavaScript and AppleScript , can easily live side by side .
The idea of using JavaScript as a Macintosh scripting language is not new .
Mark Aldritt of Late Night Software has for years published a plugin called JavaScript OSA which provides the functionality I ’m talking about .
Here ’s a simple script in AppleScript to activate iTunes :
tell application " iTunes " activate end tell
And here is the same action written with JavaScript OSA :
with ( MacOS.appBySignature ( ' hook ' ) ) { activate ( ) }
It ’s a little clunky , I ’ll grant you .
It ’s a nuisance that in this incarnation , I had to use the old - style application signature code .
But these cosmetic problems are easy enough to fix .
If Apple provides its own JavaScript language layer for OSA , it could divert the majority of resources it currently spends on AppleScript .
Instead of struggling to keep AppleScript “ modern enough , ” these fine engineers could instead devote themselves to fine - tuning the JavaScript experience for desktop scripting .
Apple is leading the pack in the development of an interpreted scripting language : JavaScript .
It ’s time to move on .
Adieu , AppleScript .
Police say local knowledge would have been needed for a major sheep rustling operation in the Wirrulla district on South Australis 's west coast .
They say 100 pregnant merino ewes have been stolen from a property , with the total value estimated to be $ 10,000 .
Ceduna CIB officer Dave Sheldon says it was a substantial and well - organised heist .
" There would have to be some level of organisation but it 's difficult at this stage to say whether it's a group of people or whether it's a small operation in terms of the number of people running it , " he said .
" Speaking to people in the community there are thoughts that if you had a good sheepdog or two you could probably achieve something like this with very few people involved . "
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
June auto sales plunged , according to reports from the nation 's major automakers , as Americans shunned pickups and SUVs in the face of record gas prices and growing concerns about the weak economy .
Despite high gas prices , sales of many fuel efficient car models also fell sharply in the month as automakers were caught without the supply of vehicles that people suddenly wanted to buy .
The initial reading of industrywide auto sales from Autodata showed sales tumbled to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 13.6 million vehicles in the month , down from the 14.3 million pace in May , which was also considered a weak month for sales , and 2 million cars and light trucks below the year - ago pace .
It was also the weakest sales pace in 15 years .
The unadjusted sales fell 18 % , which is the sharpest drop since October 2002 , when the decline was due to comparisons with a record sales month , not historically weak demand .
It was far worse than the 12 % decline forecast by sales tracker Edmunds.com , although somewhat better than estimates of a private forecast from auto industry consultant JD Power & Associates , which had seen sales falling as low as a 12.5 million annual rate .
While the shortage of fuel efficient cars on dealer lots hit even the sales of Asian automakers , they were in far better position than the traditional Big Three U.S. automakers to deal with the shift in American 's buying preferences .
In fact , the Asian brands captured 46.2 % of overall sales , edging out the 45.8 % of sales that went to the U.S. brands , according to Autodata .
The same thing happened in May , marking the only two times that the U.S. brands have fallen behind the Asian brands in U.S. marketshare .
European brands made up the rest of sales , placing the Big Three in their weakest competitive position ever compared to their overseas rival .
Until last year , there had never been a month that American car buyers preferred the combined offerings of Asian and European automakers to those of the Big Three .
At least General Motors ( GM , Fortune 500 ) held onto the title as the nation 's No. 1 automaker in terms of sales .
GM only narrowly edged Toyota in the May sales report , but even though its sales fell 18 % in June , it opened up some distance with its Japanese rival in U.S. sales .
General Motors reported that its U.S. sales fell 18 % in June versus a year ago .
Sales of GM 's light trucks , which includes pickups , SUVs and so - called crossovers , tumbled 16 % .
But that was better than GM 's car sales , which dropped 21 % in the month .
" We 're doing all we can to meet customer demand for our popular crossovers and cars , including increasing overtime or adding Saturday shifts , " said Mark LaNeve , vice president at GM .
Still , the results were better than forecasts of an overall 25 % decline in sales .
And it was good enough for GM to hang onto the title of the No. 1 automaker in terms of U.S. sales .
Shares of GM finished 2 % higher Tuesday on the news .
Weaker sales than expected
Other big automakers missed forecasts , however .
Toyota Motor ( TM ) reported a 21 % drop in U.S. sales in June from a year ago , far worse than the forecast from Edmunds.com of only a 12 % drop in sales .
It was the biggest year - over - year decline in U.S. sales in 10 years for Toyota .
The Japanese automaker , which is No. 2 in U.S. vehicle sales , saw a 15.6 % jump in sales of its compact Corolla .
But sales of its fuel efficient subcompact Yaris , as well as of the Camry , Toyota 's best selling U.S. model going into this month , declined slightly .
The Prius , the nation 's best - selling gas - electric hybrid , saw its sales fall by a third , due to tight supplies .
" This was a missed opportunity for Toyota this month , " said Jesse Toprak , chief industry analyst for Edmunds .
" We 've heard a lot of reports from dealers they could have sold twice as many Priuses , if not more , if they had them in inventory . "
But it was n't just a problem for Toyota , said Toprak .
None of the automakers had anticipated the sudden rise in gas prices or the sudden demand for fuel efficient vehicles .
" Even the most capable are not set up to respond to market place changes this quickly , " he said .
" It 'll take from a few months to a few years to fully respond to the change in demand . "
Ford Motor ( F , Fortune 500 ) , the No. 3 automaker in terms of U.S. sales , posted a 28 % decline in sales -- steeper than Edmunds.com 's forecasts of a 25 % drop .
Ford saw demand for its SUVs plunge by more than half and for pickups and other trucks fall more than a third .
Even crossovers , a sign of strength in the light truck segment until recently , saw sales off 18 % from a year earlier , as buyers went searching for more fuel efficient vehicles in the face of record $ 4 gas prices .
Weak demand or not enough supply ?
But Ford also did n't have the cars buyers were looking for , as its car sales fell 12 % .
" That limited supply we believed had an impact , " said George Pipas , the director of sales analysis for Ford .
Bob Schnorbus , chief economist for J.D. Power & Associates , said the sudden shift in demand for smaller , fuel - efficient vehicles came at the worst possible time for the industry .
That 's because automakers were not able to quickly ramp up production of the cars now in hot demand due to scheduled plant shutdowns to gear up for production of next year 's models .
Ford has announced plans to cut back production of its light trucks and an increase in production of cars .
But it has n't been able to respond to the sudden increase in demand for cars .
" Clearly , the rapid rise in gasoline prices , and the resulting shift toward fuel efficient vehicles , has been challenging , " said Jim Farley , Ford group vice president , in a statement .
Making matters worse , Schnorbus said rising gas prices and the overall sluggish economy are making consumers reluctant to hit dealerships .
" Anywhere you want to look , credit conditions , the job market , stock market , you can see the consumers are getting hammered , " Schnorbus said .
" If there was ever a time when you want to sit back and wait out the storm , now is the time to do it . "
Toprak added that many people with gas - guzzling SUVs or pickups are finding some dealers unwilling to take those vehicles in a trade because of declining resale value .
" We 've never seen that before , " he said .
Worst month ever ?
Honda Motor ( HMC ) bucked the industry trend , as its U.S. sales edged up 1.1 % in the month .
But that was a bit weaker than the 4 % rise forecast by Edmunds .
Chrysler , which fell behind Honda in U.S. sales last month to become the No. 5 U.S. automaker , saw its sales plunge 36 % in the month , worse even than the 31 % drop forecast by Edmunds .
The automaker tried to lure car buyers nervous about gas prices with an incentive that locked in $ 2.99 a gallon gas for three years .
It announced Tuesday it was extending that offer through the end of July , despite the weak June sales .
On Monday , Chrysler announced plans to shut its St. Louis assembly line that builds minivans on Oct. 31 .
It will also cut one of two shifts at an adjoining plant that makes full - size pickups .
The two cutbacks will result in the loss of 2,400 hourly jobs .
Nissan also saw sales fall more sharply than anticipated .
Its sales were off 18 % , far worse than the forecast of an 8 % decline .
One other factor leading to the weak sales in June was fewer sales days and one less weekend compared to the year - earlier period .
The Japanese automakers reported smaller percentage declines in sales than the raw numbers indicated because they based their comparisons on a daily sales rate , rather than absolute sales .
From the NYT :
Senator John McCain ’s top domestic policy adviser , former Congressional Budget Office director Douglas J. Holtz - Eakin , recently said in a conference call with reporters that Mr. McCain ’s health care proposal would “ put 25 to 30 million individuals out of the ranks of the uninsured , into the ranks of the insured . ”
In an article released Tuesday , a panel of prominent health economists concludes that Mr. Holtz - Eakin ’s projection is off by , well , 25 to 30 million .
NOTE from Jacki : I try not to weigh in too often on work - related stuff , but you have to know what we ’re talking about with McCain ’s health care plan .
If you get your health insurance through work , you can kiss that good - bye .
See , McCain will tax your benefits as if they were salary .
So you will see more money come out of your paycheck with no additional salary to compensate for that loss .
Then , employers will be inclined to drop coverage because they wo n’t see the point in offering it when you can get it elsewhere and there is no longer a tax break attached to it .
You will lose the benefit of employer - negotiated and monitored group plans .
G-d forbid you have a medical history – any medical history – good luck getting affordable coverage ( if you can get decent coverage at all ) in the individual market .
McCain wants to give you a tax credit that wo n’t cover the average plan and wo n’t keep up with the rising costs of care .
Oh , and that buying across state lines thing – bad for you , great for the insurance industry .
They get to set up shop in states with the least regulation .
Ezra Klein and Jonathan Cohn both have excellent pieces out today .
If Sarah Palin does n’t scare the sh*t out of you , McCain ’s health care plan will .
More than 1,000 dogs were rescued from a West Virginia kennel over the weekend , prompting a national effort by animal groups to find them new homes .
The Whispering Oaks Kennel in Parkersburg surrendered the dogs , mostly purebred dachshunds , to the Humane Society of the United States after sheriff 's deputies searched the facility , the Associated Press reports .
The Humane Society called the rural property a puppy mill where dogs were kept in cages and dilapidated sheds for breeding .
The dogs were never let out and rarely handled by humans .
Officials said the animals did not appear to have been abused , but noted that it would be impossible for that many animals to be properly cared for .
Sharon Roberts , the owner , was not charged with animal neglect but agreed never to operate a dog breeding facility again .
She told the Associated Press she was the victim of a " witch hunt ' ' by animal rights activists .
The dogs are being housed at a temporary shelter as rescuers examine them before trying to find them homes .
" These resilient little animals are already beginning to perk up under the care of their temporary guardians at the emergency shelter , " Scotlund Haisley , senior director of Emergency Services at the Humane Society , said in a news release .
" Thankfully they will soon be taken in by humane organizations around the region , evaluated and put up for adoption . "

Foreigners with mental illnesses are banned from visiting the Beijing Olympics , according to the document released by The Beijing Olympic organizing committee .
The Mental Health Foundation was unhappy with the decision and said that this policy goes against the principles of the Olympics .
The officials said that many sportsmen taking part in the Olympics are likely to suffer from mental illnesses but the ban will make them keep it a secret for fear of exclusion .
A nine - page guide , including 57 topics was issued on Monday was published on the organizer 's official Web site .
Anyone going against this guideline is expected to be " refused to board , enter China , or be fined " .
The document says that having Olympic tickets will not be enough to enter China as visitors will have to apply for visas in China embassies and consulates .
Chinese officials are worried about the possible protests during the Olympics , increasing control on visas and resident permits for visitors .
Any illegal gatherings and protests are said to be subject to administrative punishments or criminal prosecution .
The document states that entry to China will be denied to people " who might conduct acts of terrorism , violence and government subversion " as well as smugglers , drug traffickers , prostitutes , people with mental illnesses , STD 's or epidemic diseases .
The guideline also says that visitors will not be allowed to certain areas of the country such as Tibet .
It covers the list of items that cannot be brought to the country such as weapons , imitation weapons , ammunition , explosives , counterfeit currency , drugs and poisons .
The guide bars the display of insulting slogans or banners at any sporting venue and says that anyone insulting the national flag or insignia will face criminal prosecution .
Visitors are also not allowed to sleep outdoors to preserve public hygiene .
The detailed document is considered to oppose the statement of the International Olympic Committee president Jacques Rogge , promising the freedom of speech in China .

Non-movement conservatives may well have this reaction :
I ’ve voted a straight Republican ticket every year of my life since 1975 , when I first came of voting age , but I was stunned and horrified by McCain ’s choice of Palin .
I simply cannot even consider voting for McCain after this choice , which speaks loudly of his own selfishness and fundamental frivolousness .
So I was shocked when I turned to the conservative blogs looking for others who shared my dismay and found a celebration going on .
They really honestly believe that Palin ’s “ inexperience ” and Obama ’s “ inexperience ” are equivalent .
I have had no luck at all in the past 24 hours trying to explain that Obama is quite obviously an impressive man ( with whom I disagree on almost every major issue ) with extraordinary qualities of organization , discipline and leadership .
I see nothing in Palin ’s record to suggest that she has any such qualities .
He is a man who has spent his adult life thinking serious thoughts about serious issues and having serious conversations about them with other serious , well - informed people ; while Palin quite as clearly has done none of those things .
He was the president of the Harvard Law Review ; she was the point guard on her high school basketball team .
He has surrounded himself in his campaign with world - class people ( with whom , again , I disagree on almost every issue ) ; and though I am doubtless an elitist and snob for saying so , I doubt that she has even met a half - dozen world - class people in her lifetime .
While Obama might do a hundred things as President that I believe are bad for the country , I am confident that he would surround himself with experienced , informed , competent advisors and that he would make no world - destroying blunders .
I cannot say the same about Palin and , in view of what this choice reveals about McCain ’s character and judgment , I can not say the same of him either .
The Palin pick says much more about McCain than it does about Palin ( all it says about her is that she did n't have the good sense to turn it down ) .
What it says about McCain is that he is more interested in politics than policy , more interested in campaigning than governing , tactical when he should be strategic , and reckless when he should be considered .
He is as big a gamble as president as Palin is as vice - president .
This decision was about gut , about politics , about cynicism , and about vanity .
It 's Bushism metastasized .
We want to hear what you think about this article .
Submit a letter to the editor or write to letters@theatlantic.com .
The hill that Hillary Rodham Clinton must climb to beat Barack Obama for the Democratic presidential nomination will grow a little steeper on Monday , as it has most days lately .
Margaret Campbell , a Montana state legislator , plans to declare her support for Senator Obama , of Illinois .
She becomes the 69th superdelegate he has picked up since the Feb. 5 coast - to - coast string of primary elections and caucus votes .
In the same period , Senator Clinton , of New York , has seen a net loss of two superdelegates , according to figures from the Obama campaign that Clinton aides do not dispute .
That erosion may dim Mrs. Clinton ’s remaining hopes even more than internal campaign turmoil , which led to the ouster on Sunday of the campaign ’s chief strategist , Mark Penn .

Shout out to : Jeff :: ( www.lucidinteractive.ca) for using OSX ’s Airport to try and generate traffic on our first crack
Also would like to thank Alkaloid Networks for support
To all the noobies :
Do n’t call us and asking about how to crack networks .
Like this guy actually did
Date : 11/23/2005
Overview
This is a good one , let me tell you !
There can be so many issues setting up your box to actually get the tools working and i’m not even touching on that , but if you can get everything to work , you ’ll be cracking wireless networks like a pro in no time .
Disclaimer : I ’m not a pro .
Pre-Installation
Checklist
Tools I ’ve been really , really successful with basically one tool set called AirCrack .
Download that .
Kismet is an excellent tool for sniffing out wireless networks as well and could prove useful .
An encrypted wireless network .
We ’ll be working on WEP encrypted networks as well as static passkey WPA or WPA - PSK
Note :
Make sure you can get your card into monitor mode ( sometimes called raw monitor or rfmon ) .
This is VERY important
WEP Crackin
Theory
A little theory first .
WEP is a really crappy and old encryption techinque to secure a wireless connection .
A 3 - byte vector , called an Initalization Vector or IV , is prepended onto packets and its based on a pre-shared key that all the authenticated clients know … think of it as the network key you need to authenticate .
Well if its on ( almost ) every packet generated by the client or AP , then if we collect enough of them , like a few hundred thousand , we should be able to dramatically reduce the keyspace to check and brute force becomes a realistic proposition .
A couple of things will cause us some problems .
If the key is not static , then you ’ll mix up all your IVs and it ’ll take forever to decrypt the key .
Theres no traffic , therefore no packets – we can fix this .
MAC Address Filtering – we can fix this too .
Setting up your tools
We ’re gonna need 3 or 4 shells open , we have 5 tools :
airodump – Grabbing IVs
aircrack – Cracking the IVs
airdecap – Decoding captured packets
airreplay – ( My Favourite ) Packet injector to attack APs .
kismet – Network Sniffer , can grab IVs as well .
For a standard WEP hack we ’ll usally only need airodump , aircrack , and kismet ( server and client ) .
If we run into some problems we might have to use airreplay to fiddle about .
I ’ll leave you to config all these tools up , for the most part they should just be defaults with the exception of kismet .
Finding the Network
First step is we need to find a netork to crack .
Start up kismet and start sniffing for APs .
Leave it on for a bit so that it can discover all the important information about the networks around .
What we want from kismet is :
Encryption type : Is it WEP 64 - bit ?
128-bit ?
What channel is it on ?
Can greatly speed up IV collection .
AP ’s IP Address
BSSID
ESSID
All this info is n’t required but the more you have , the more options you have later to crack and sniff .
We can get a lot of this from airodump as well but I find the channel is important .
Capturing IVs
Alright , we know what we wanna crack , so lets start capturing packets .
You can use kismet to capture files but I prefer airodump because it keeps a running count of all the IVs I ’ve captured and I can crack and airodump will automatically update aircrack with new IVs as it finds them .
Note : kimset can interfere with airodump so make sure you close it down before starting airodump .
Airodump is pretty straight forward with its command line looking something like this :
./airodump < interface > < output prefix > [ channel ] [ IVs flag ]
interface is your wireless interface to use – required .
output prefix is just the filname it ’ll prepend , – required .
channel is the specific channel we ’ll scan , leave blank or use 0 to channel hop .
IVs flag is either 0 or 1 , depending on whether you want all packets logged , or just IVs .
My wireless card is ath0 , output prefix i’ll use “ lucid ” , the channel we sniffed from kismet is 6 , and IVs flag is 1 because we just want IVs .
So we run :
./ airodump ath0 lucid 6 1
Airodump will come up with a graph showing us all the APs and their relevant info , as well as client stations connected to any of the APs .
BSSID PWR Beacons # Data CH MB ENC ESSID 00:23:1F:55:04 : BC 76 21995 213416 6 54 . WEP hackme BSSID STATION PWR Packets Probes 00:23:1F:55:04 : BC 00:12:5B:4C:23:27 112 8202 hackme 00:23:1F:55:04 :BC
00:12:5B:DA:2F:6A 21 1721 hackme
The second line shows us some info about the AP as well as the number of beacons and data packets we ’ve collected from the AP .
The two last lines show us two authenticated clients .
Where they are connected to and the packets they are sending .
We wo n’t use this client info in a straight theory hack but in practice we ’ll need this info to actively attack the AP .
This step may take a long time or could be very short .
It depends how busy the AP is and how many IVs we are collecting .
What we are doing is populating a file “ lucid.ivs ” with all the IV important packet info .
Next , we ’ll feed this to aircrack .
To move onto the next step , we ’ll want at least 100,000 packets ( under # Data in airodump ) but probably more .
Using IVs to Decrypt the Key
Ok , pretend you have enough IVs now to attempt a crack .
Goto a new terminal ( without stopping airodump – remember it ’ll autoupdate as new IVs are found ) and we ’ll start aircrack .
It looks something like this :
. /aircrack [ options ] < input file >
There are a lot of options so you can look them up yourself , i’ll be using common ones here that should get you a crack .
Our input file is “ lucid.ivs ” , the options we will use are :
-a 1 : forces a WEP attack mode ( 2 forces WPA )
either - b for the bssid or -e for the essid : whichever is easier to type but I like using a BSSID because its more unique .
-n 64 or -n 128 : WEP key length , omit if not known by now .
So our command will look like :
./aircrack -a 1 -b 00:23:1F:55:04 : BC -n 128 lucid.ivs
and off it goes , resembling the picture from the top .
Keep an eye on the Unique IV count as it should increase if airodump is still running .
For all intents and purposes you are done .
That ’ll pop open most old wireless routers with some traffic on them .
Anticipated Problems
There are lots of problems that can come up that will make the above fail , or work very slowly .
No traffic
No traffic is being passed , therefore you ca n’t capture any IVs .
What we need to do is inject some special packets to trick the AP into broadcasting .
Covered below in WEP Attacks
MAC Address filtering AP is only responding to connected clients .
Probably because MAC address filtering is on .
Using airodumps screen you can find the MAC address of authenticated users so just change your MAC to theirs and continue on .
Using the -m option you can specify aircrack to filter packets by MAC Address , ex. -m 00:12:5B:4C:23:27
Ca n’t Crack even with tons of IVs Some of the statistical attacks can create false positives and lead you in the wrong direction .
Try using -k N ( where N=1..17 ) or -y to vary your attack method .
Increase the fudge factor .
By default it is at 2 , by specifying -f N ( where N>=2 ) will increase your chances of a crack , but take much longer .
I find that doubling the previous fudge factor is a nice progression if you are having trouble .
Still Nothing
Find the AP by following the signal strength and ask the admin what the WEP key is .
WPA Crackin
Differences
WPA is an encryption algorithm that takes care of a lot of the vunerablities inherent in WEP .
WEP is , by design , flawed .
No matter how good or crappy , long or short , your WEP key is , it can be cracked .
WPA is different .
A WPA key can be made good enough to make cracking it unfeasible .
WPA is also a little more cracker friendly .
By capturing the right type of packets , you can do your cracking offline .
This means you only have to be near the AP for a matter of seconds to get what you need .
Advantages and disadvantages .
WPA Flavours
WPA basically comes in two flavours RADIUS or PSK .
PSK is crackable , RADIUS is not so much .
PSK uses a user defined password to initialize the TKIP , temporal key integrity protocol .
There is a password and the user is involved , for the most part that means it is flawed .
The TKIP is not really crackable as it is a per-packet key but upon the initialization of the TKIP , like during an authentication , we get the password ( well the PMK anyways ) .
A robust dictionary attack will take care of a lot of consumer passwords .
Radius involves physical transferring of the key and encrypted channels blah blah blah , look it up to learn more about it but 90 % of commerical APs do not support it , it is more of an enterprise solution then a consumer one .
The Handshake
The WPA handshake was designed to occur over insecure channels and in plaintext so the password is not actually sent across .
There are some fancy dancy algorithms in the background that turn it into a primary master key , PMK , and the like but none of that really matters cause the PMK is enough to connect to the network .
The only step we need to do is capture a full authenication handshake from a real client and the AP .
This can prove tricky without some packet injection , but if you are lucky to capture a full handshake , then you can leave and do the rest of the cracking at home .
We can force an authenication handshake by launching a Deauthentication Attack , but only if there is a real client already connected ( you can tell in airodump ) .
If there are no connected clients , you ’re outta luck .
Like for WEP , we want to know the channel the WPA is sitting on , but the airodump command is slightly different .
We do n’t want just IVs so we do n’t specify an IV flag .
This will produce “ lucid.cap ” instead of “ lucid.ivs ” .
Assume WPA is on channel 6 and wireless interface is ath0 .
./ airodump ath0 lucid 6
Dictionary Brute Force
The most important part of brute forcing a WPA password is a good dictionary .
Check out http://www.openwall.com/wordlists/ for a ‘ really ’ good one .
It costs money , but its the biggest and best I ’ve ever seen ( 40 Million words , no duplicates , one . txt file ) .
There is also a free reduced version from the same site but i’m sure resourceful people can figure out where to get a good dictionary from .
When you have a good dictionary the crack is a simple brute force attack :
./aircrack -a 2 -b 00:23:1F:55:04 : BC
-w / path/to/wordlist
Either you ’ll get it or you wo n’t… depends on the strength of the password and if a dictionary attack can crack it .
Using Aireplay
Aireplay is the fun part .
You get to manipulate packets to trick the network into giving you what you want .
WEP Attacks
Attacks used to create more traffic on WEP networks to get more IVs .
ARP Injection
ARP Replay is a classic way of getting more IV traffic from the AP .
It is the turtle .
Slow but steady and almost always works .
We need the BSSID of the AP and the BSSID of an associated client .
If there are no clients connected , it is possible to create one with another WEP attack explained below : Fake Authentication Attack .
With airodump listening , we attack :
./aireplay - 3 - b < AP MAC Address > -h < Client MAC Address > ath0
Note :
The - 3 specifys the type of attack ( 3=ARP Replay ) .
This will continue to run , and airodump , listening fron another terminal , will pick up any reply IVs .
Interactive Packet Replay
Interactive Packet Reply is quite a bit more advanced and requires capturing packets and constructing your own .
It can prove more effective then simple ARP requests but I wo n’t get into packet construction here .
A useful attack you might try is the re-send all data attack , basically you are asking the AP to re-send you everything .
This only works if the AP re-encrypts the packets before sending them again ( and therefore giving you a new IV ) .
Some APs do , some do n’t .
aireplay - 2 - b < AP MAC > -h < Client MAC > -n 100 -p 0841 -c FF : FF : FF : FF : FF : FF ath0
Fake Authentication Attack
This attack wo n’t generate any more traffic but it does create an associative client MAC Address useful for the above two attacks .
Its definately not as good as having a real , connected client , but you gots to do what you gots to do .
This is done easiest with another machine because we need a new MAC address but if you can manually change your MAC then that ’ll work too .
We ’ll call your new MAC address “ Fake MAC ” .
Now most APs need clients to reassociate every 30 seconds or so or they think they ’re disconnected .
This is pretty arbitrary but I use it and it has worked but if your Fake MAC gets disconnected , reassociate quicker .
We need both the essid and bssid and our Fake MAC .
./aireplay -1 30 -e '< ESSID >' - a < BSSID > -h < Fake MAC > ath0
If successful , you should see something like this :
23:47:29 Sending Authentication Request 23:47:29 Authentication successful 23:47:30 Sending Association Request 23:47:30 Association successful :-)
Awesome !
Now you can use the above two attacks even though there were no clients connected in the first place !
If it fails , there may be MAC Address Filtering on so if you really want to use this , you ’ll have to sniff around until a client provides you with a registered MAC to fake .
WPA Attacks
So far , the only way to really crack WPA is to force a re-authentication of a valid client .
We need a real , actively connected client to break WPA .
You might have to wait a while .
Deauthentication Attack
This is a simple and very effective attack .
We just force the connected client to disconnect then we capture the re-connect and authentication , saves time so we do n’t have to wait for the client to do it themselves ( a tad less “ waiting outside in the car ” creepiness as well ) .
With airodump running in another console , your attack will look something like this :
aireplay -0 5 - a < AP MAC > -c < Client MAC > ath0
After a few seconds the re-authentication should be complete and we can attempt to Dictionary Brute Force the PMK .
Conclusion
Well thats that .
APs crack fairly often but sometimes there is just nothing you can do .
Obviously you are not allowed to illegally crack other people ’s wireless connections , this is purely for penetration testing purposes and some fun .

Because Prospa and other such companies rely on growth together and that is why they offer easier accessibility , quicker processing and better customer support to make sure small businesses are never in trouble .
DIGG THIS
Every now and then , the rumor arises that I have a Palestinian wife .
Some of my kin were highly amused by a debate on that subject that was being conducted by letters to the editor in their local paper recently .
Apparently , it does not occur to anyone simply to ask me .
As a matter of fact , I do n’t have a wife .
I ’m a widower , and the one wife I had was a sweet Midwestern girl of Methodist , German and Swedish extraction .
I do n’t have a Palestinian mistress or girlfriend .
I do n’t even have a Palestinian bowling pal .
The recurring Palestinian wife rumor , I believe , is a result of some people finding it impossible to believe that an American would have any sympathy for the Palestinian people without an ulterior motive .
That is a credit to the effectiveness of the Israeli propaganda machine , which has , for more than 50 years , stereotyped Palestinians as a wild , violent people .
It is a stereotype helped greatly by the news media , which rarely reports in depth on anything foreign , and by Hollywood , where lately the venerable Nazi has been replaced as the chief villain by the Arab terrorist .
Actually , Palestinians are a gentle people .
If you get to know some and hear their side of the story , you will feel sympathy for them , too , unless you have a flint heart .
The Palestinians were run over by history .
I know that various ethnic groups in the United States fiercely contend for the title of victim , but the Palestinians had it imposed on them .
There was nothing they could do when the Ottoman Empire absorbed their land .
There was nothing they could do when the British Empire took their land away from the Ottoman Turks at the end of World War I .
There was nothing they could do when the British Empire created the Palestine Mandate .
There was nothing they could do when the British Cabinet , for reasons historians still argue about , decided Palestine would make a nice national home for European Jews when and if the British Empire ever decided to give up its occupation of Palestine .
That it did in 1947 , after considerable encouragement by Jewish terrorist organizations — the Irgun , led by Menachem Begin , and the Stern Gang , led by Yitzhak Shamir .
Yes , Jews used terrorist tactics against the British occupation , and now Palestinians are using terrorist tactics against the Israeli occupation .
In 1948 , about 700,000 Palestinians were made refugees and then told they could not return to their homes .
Their homes , land and businesses were eventually confiscated .
In 1967 , Israel seized the West Bank and East Jerusalem from Jordan , the Golan Heights from Syria and the Gaza Strip from Egypt .
These are now the " occupied territories . "
The state of Israel has no legal claim to even 1 square inch of any of this territory , but with the backing of the United States it has been able to tell the rest of the world to go stuff it .
Palestinians appreciate the irony of the fact that the United States went to war allegedly to get Albanian refugees back into Kosovo and went to war twice against Iraq allegedly to enforce United Nations resolutions .
Of course , we ’ve done nothing for the return of the Palestinian refugees , and we ’ve ignored the fact that Israel is in open defiance of more than 60 United Nations resolutions .
We ’ve also ignored the fact that Israel is the only country in the Middle East that really does have weapons of mass destruction , including nuclear bombs .
For us , it ’s all about domestic politics .
I ’ve never heard of a Palestinian donor invited to spend the night in the Lincoln Bedroom .
All Americans should feel a great deal of sympathy for the younger generations of both Palestinians and Israeli Jews .
These young people were born into a conflict started by people long dead or now in their dotage .
The issue is simple :
It ’s land .
Both sides are dying over land .
Unless some outside power forces an agreement on them , they will go on dying , generation after generation after generation .
You do n’t need a Palestinian wife to feel sympathy for these people .
All you need is to know the facts .
Learn the truth , and you will feel sympathy for Palestinians — but not very proud of American Middle East policy , which is a continuing failure driven by greed and cowardice on the part of American politicians .
The hypocrisy of it has poisoned our image around the world .

To kick off this post , we ’ll start with an excerpt from The Wind from the Sun , a short story by Arthur C. Clarke :
“ Hold your hands out to the sun .
What do you feel ?
Heat , of course .
But there ’s pressure as well – though you ’ve never noticed it , because it ’s so tiny .
Over the area of your hands , it only comes to about a millionth of an ounce .
But out in space , even a pressure as small as that can be important – for it ’s acting all the time , hour after hour , day after day .
Unlike rocket fuel , it ’s free and unlimited .
If we want to , we can use it ; we can build sails to catch the radiation blowing from the sun . ”
When it comes to space - technology prediction , almost no one has ever reached the level of Arthur C. Clarke .
Once again , it seems that Mr. Clarke was right .
Just next week , NASA is planning to launch a new space propulsion system named NanoSail - D.
The technology consists of a 10 square - meter metallic polymer sail that uses solar pressure as a mean of propulsion for spacecrafts .
Even though Mr. Clarke passed away last March , I doubt that we ’ll stop hearing about him anytime soon , and I ’m sure he ’ll keep on amazing us again and again with his prophetic writings .

An editor I once worked for told me that when his parents and grandparents discussed the day ’s news over dinner , they would inevitably finish by asking each other : “ Is it good for the Jews ? ”
“ Whether it was a war or an earthquake or men landing on the moon , it would always come down to that , ” he recalled .
“ They saw everything through that lens . ”
This year , I ’ve developed a comparable pathology .
I am terrified that the Bush administration is going to attack Iran sometime before it leaves office on January 20 .
Whenever there is a new tremor in Washington or the wider world , I ask myself :
Does this make an American strike against Iran more or less likely ?
So it is with the recent dustup in Georgia .
I fear it has increased the chances that the United States will bomb Iran .

The pending merger of US beer giant Anheuser - Busch and a Belgian company that brews and sells beer in Cuba is thrusting presumptive Republican presidential nominee John McCain into the middle of thorny Cuba - US relations .
McCain 's wife , Cindy , owns the third largest Anheuser - Busch distributor in the country - which means she would stand to profit by partnering with a company that is in business with the Cuban government .
McCain is a staunch advocate of the embargo against Cuba , which bars most American companies from doing business in the island nation .
Among the yet - to - be - resolved issues in the $ 52bn deal is whether Belgian giant InBev - expected to operate under the name Anheuser - Busch - InBev - will continue to market its Cuban line of beer , and what that may mean for US distributors .
Two of McCain 's top Florida supporters , Miami representatives Lincoln and Mario Diaz - Balart , assailed the InBev-Anheuser Busch deal earlier this month , saying they are " deeply concerned " that Anheuser - Busch is about to be purchased by a company " with ties to the Cuban dictatorship , a state sponsor of terrorism " .
A spokesman for the Diaz - Balarts said last night the two congressmen stand by their statement .
According to financial disclosure statements , Cindy McCain also owns stock in Anheuser - Busch and would stand to make as much as $ 2 m in profit if she sells the shares after the merger .
McCain 's campaign did not respond to questions about whether Cindy McCain 's distributorship in Arizona , Hensley and Company , would continue to market InBev products after the merger goes through .
The private company , with annual sales estimated at between $ 150 m and $ 200 m , already distributes InBev products , including Stella Artois , Beck 's and Lowenbrau .
A longtime McCain supporter said the Arizona senator has maintained a rigid firewall between himself and his wife 's business operations , and new owners wo n't change matters .
" Making a connection between InBev , John McCain and Cuba policy is a ridiculous stretch of the imagination , " said Ana Navarro of Miami , who has known McCain for years and serves as a co-chair of his National Hispanic Advisory Council .
" First , because John McCain has nothing to do with the operation of his wife 's business and secondly , her business has nothing to do with Anheuser - Busch 's sale .
Does Publix ( a grocery store chain ) control the decisions of Frito - Lay ? "
InBev is n't saying whether or not it will keep what it calls its " modest " Cuban interests .
European countries have no hurdles to doing business in Cuba , and a spokeswoman for InBev said the company " continuously reviews " its commercial activities to ensure compliance with international laws .
Marianne Amssoms , InBev 's vice - president of global external communications , said the company 's Cuban interests are all handled out of Europe .
She said the company 's Cuban interests " do not violate US , EU or international law " .
She said the business in Cuba is less than half of 1 % of InBev 's global business .
According to the company 's website , its plant in Holguin , in eastern Cuba , employs 570 full - time workers .
A spokesman with the US treasury department , which along with the US state department oversees provisions of the embargo , said the agency could not yet comment on whether the embargo would apply or how the new company would be affected by the embargo law .
Venezuela ’s new assertiveness has brought it to the centre of international controversy : to some it has been stolen by populist dictator , while for others , it is the centre of a continent - wide democratic revolution .
There is much at stake .
Venezuela sits atop huge oil reserves , which are being used to foment a new order .
President Hugo Chávez , who survived a military coup in 2002 , has supported a number of controversial social programs that have pushed Venezuela onto the United States government 's and media 's radar screens .
What makes Venezuela tick ?
Who is behind the movement and what does it seek ?

Anti-Porn Protest Gets Weird
The Lion ’s Den chain has undergone an impressive image change lately .
I do n’t know about your local store , but the one near my hometown is lovely and even features clean and friendly restrooms .
When I lived in Louisville , the local Lion ’s Den was one of 2 stores where I could enter knowing with full confidence that the staff would be respectful and make sure that my fellow customers also treated me appropriately .
Unfortunately , a Lion ’s Den in Indiana has come under attack by anti-porn protesters , who are not only violating local ordinances in their protest , but also harassing customers and employees by means such as taking their pictures and posting them on the internet .
Now , I will come right out and say that I am not a fan of the push for increasingly edgy porn that has led to a flood of violent and painful portrayals of sex between male / female actors , as well as male / male actors .
I ’m also aware that watching violent porn has been shown in some research to increase a desire to engage in violent sex .
Yes , we ’re monkeys with a drive to impersonate what we see from the day we ’re born .
Does that make all porn , the porn industry , and all sex toys something to wage a war against ?
Does it mean that porn is nothing but horrid and getting rid of it will fix major social ills ?
Or perhaps that decent people do n’t patronize sex stores ?
* Cough *
So why are protesters in Indiana flipping out in front of their local Lion ’s Den over an unrelated sex crime that happened before the store even opened ?
Heck if I know !
People get very excited about their causes and lack the sense to see if the information backs them up .
These folks are upset , and rightfully so , about a sex crime against a female minor that occurred prior to the opening of the store .
In response , they have organized to try to shut down the store by violating area laws ( with no response from police or government ) and attempting to ruin the lives of customers and employees .
It seems that they believe this store , and its wares , somehow caused the crime .
Countless studies and professional accounts demonstrate that adult products , especially when tastefully done ( but including the trashy stuff ) , can help couples to have more frequent and enjoyable sex .
Both men and women are turned on by watching explicit videos , so it is NOT just a guy thing .
While some porn producers have gone to the unpleasant side , others have invested in high quality films with a focus on women ’s pleasure and lots of sexy outfits and performers who apparently love their jobs !
Now , if you do n’t like porn , then do n’t buy it .
I ’m a vegetarian but I do n’t run around threatening people who go to McDonalds .
Instead , I refuse to support the meat industry with my cash and try to increase attractive veg options for people to consider .
And if you still want beef , well all the more for you … so enjoy .
If you hate violent porn , then have a constructive conversation with your local vendors , offering alternatives and seeking solutions .
Or , make your own erotica according to your tastes and offer it to the public !
You could even donate the proceeds to your local sexual assault center .
Those who commit such vile offenses have bigger problems than watching porn , and eliminating pornography is not going to solve those issues .
But I doubt the protesters in Indiana have bothered to read this far .
As a woman , and as a volunteer at my local domestic violence shelter , I agree that the crime they have organized behind is terrible , tragic , and must be acted upon .
I question , however , the value of their actions regarding the prevention of future harm to minors .
Perhaps there is a way for all sides to sit together and see how both can serve their community in ways that raise awareness and resources toward the protection of vulnerable girls .
By threatening customers , government officials , police , and store employees , this caring but erring group has diverted attention away from valuable efforts that would provide sustainable and essential assistance in the areas they seek to address .
Again , this store was not open when the crime occurred and I have read no reason to believe that they participated or encouraged this behavior in any way .

Cold sores can flare up periodically
The secret of how the cold sore virus manages to persist for a lifetime in the human body may have been cracked by US scientists .
The herpes simplex virus 1 ( HSV - 1 ) can lie dormant in facial nerves , emerging periodically to cause sores .
A Duke University Medical Center team may have uncovered how it can reactivate itself from a dormant state .
The finding , published in the journal Nature , could eventually lead to new treatments .
When fighting a virus , the immune system relies heavily on the protein chemicals produced by the virus which it uses to help mark it for destruction .
Herpes viruses manage to evade the immune system by shutting down production of these proteins completely , and remaining in this state for long periods before starting to replicate again .
Wake - up call
This is why patients , once infected , have occasional flare - ups of cold sores or genital herpes , and can never get rid of the infection completely .
However , there is one thing that HSV - 1 does produce , the precise role of which has puzzled scientists for some years .
It is a type of RNA , a single strand of genetic information copied from the DNA of the virus .
In other viruses , these RNAs make proteins that are useful to the virus , but in herpes , this was not the case .
The Duke University team suspected that it somehow helped keep the virus in its dormant state , and studied what happened to these " latent RNAs " in mice .
They found they were broken down into even smaller strands , called microRNAs , and these appeared to block the production of proteins which reactivated the virus .
Effectively , they were helping keep the virus in its dormant state .
Professor Bryan Cullen , who led the research , said : " We have provided a molecular understanding of how HSV - 1 hides and then switches back and forth between the latent and active phases . "
He said a drug based on blocking these microRNAs could in theory " wake up " all the viruses , making them vulnerable to antiviral therapy , and raising the possibility of a cure for herpes .
Professor Roger Everett , a Medical Research Council virologist based in Glasgow , said that the research represented a step forward in a " long - standing problem " in the field .
The next step , he said would be to see what happened in an animal using a virus engineered to block production of these RNAs .

Wedding Rituals

Tying the knot in any culture comes with a laundry list of traditions and rituals , including the old rhyme , " something old , something new , something borrowed and something blue . "
Here are some wedding traditions from around the world that go beyond the white dress and veil .
Wardrobe Change

In modern China , brides pick not one wedding dress , but three .
First , there 's the traditional qipao or cheongsam , an embroidered , slim - fitting frock that 's usually made red for weddings , because red is a strong , lucky color in Chinese culture .
Next , the bride might swap into a white poufed ball gown that would n't look out of place at an American wedding — a bridal nod to the popularity of Western trends .
Finally , the bride ducks out of the reception to change into a third dress , this one a gown of her color choice or a cocktail dress .
Painted Hands

Before an Indian bride gets married , she and her female friends and family decorate their hands and feet with elaborate designs called menhdi .
These temporary designs are made from the plant dye henna , and they last just a few weeks .
The menhdi designs are incredibly intricate and take hours to apply , not including the time the bride must wait for the henna paste to dry and stain her skin .
Turning the occasion into a " mehndi party " makes the process more fun — and provides some friends and family to help the bride out if she needs anything while she 's being adorned .
Jumping the Broom

A number of cultures , from Celts to Roma ( or Gypsies ) have incorporated some sort of leap over a broom into their wedding traditions .
Today , broom - jumping is most often found in African - American weddings , the tradition rooted in the days of slavery when marriage between enslaved men and women was n't legally sanctioned .
In the antebellum period , enslaved men and women would declare their union by jumping over a broom together .
Mazel Tov !

The breaking of the glass in Jewish weddings , in which the groom crushes a glass under his foot at the end of the ceremony , is a tradition with murky roots .
Some hold that the breaking glass symbolizes the destruction of the great Temple in Jerusalem in A.D. 70 , while others say that the broken glass is a reminder that joy should always be tempered .
Either way , breaking the glass is usually undertaken in the spirit of happiness today , with wedding guests calling out " mazel tov ! " ( good luck ! ) after the glass shatters .
Baby Bridesmaids

Royal weddings in the United Kingdom do bridesmaids with a twist .
Usually , the bride 's attendants are young girls rather than the contemporaries .
At Queen Elizabeth II 's wedding in 1947 , there were eight bridesmaids , most younger than the 21 - year - old bride .
Diana had five bridesmaids , the youngest of whom was 5 .
The oldest was 17 .
Royal bride Kate Middleton took it even younger in her 2011 wedding , inviting her husband - to - be 's goddaughter and Camilla Parker Bowles ' granddaughter , both 3 , down the aisle .
Peruvian Cake Pull

In Peru , single female guests take part in a tradition a little sweeter than a bouquet toss .
Charms attached to ribbons are tucked between the layers of the wedding cake .
Before the cake is cut , each woman grabs a ribbon and pulls .
At the end of one ribbon is a fake wedding ring .
The guest who picks that ribbon is said to be next in line for marriage .
Slaughtering a Cow

Traditional Zulu weddings are marked by vibrant colors and dance - offs between the bride and groom 's families .
Like many brides across the world , Zulu brides might start the day in a Western " white wedding " dress , but change into traditional tribal clothing after a church wedding .
In a traditional ceremony , the groom 's family slaughters a cow to welcome the bride .
The bride places money inside the stomach of the cow to symbolize that she is now part of the family .
Joyous Processional

Lebanese - style weddings kick off with music , dancing and joyful shouting right outside the groom 's doors .
This is the " zaffe , " a rowdy , traditional escort made up of friends , family , and sometimes professional musicians and dancers .
This group escorts the groom to his bride 's house , and then sends them off in a shower of shouted blessings and flower petals .
Ransom for the Bride

Russian grooms have to work for their brides .
Before the wedding , the groom shows up at the bride 's home and asks for his beloved .
In jest , her friends and family refuse him until he pays up in gifts , money , jewelry or simple humiliation .
Grooms are forced to do silly dances , answer riddles , and perform goofy tests of worthiness like diapering a baby doll .
Once the groom impresses friends and family with this bridal ransom , or " vykup nevesty , " he 's allowed to meet his bride - to - be .
Ransom for the Shoes
While Russian grooms are ransoming their brides , Pakistani men have to pay up if they want to keep their shoes .
After a Pakistani wedding , the couple returns home for a ceremony called the " showing of the face . "
Family and friends hold a green shawl over the couple 's heads and a mirror as the bride removes the veil she wears throughout the wedding ceremony .
While the newlyweds are busy gazing at one another , the bride 's female relatives make off with the groom 's shoes and demand money for their safe return .
Democrats have been , are and will continue to be people of faith - and this interfaith gathering is proof of that .
In following this path , the Democratic Party is simply trying to show that it is faithful to American values .
One of those values , as expressed in the National Motto , is , " If you do not trust in God , then we do not want to think of you as being one of us . "
There is no better way for the Democratic Party to show its support for this principle than to say as loudly and as publicly as possible to atheists , " If you do not trust in God , then you are not invited to be one of us . "
People of faith are welcome to contribute to politics .
In order to do so , however , they will have to get off their knees , unclasp their hands , and do something productive .
Enshrining the prating rubbish of the religion racket as an important element of secular administration , as Obama seems to want to do , is a catastrophic betrayal of good government .
At a time when the majority of Americans believe that religion should be kept out of politics , this is a desperate move by a confused party .
I have heard the arguments that they are simply trying to reclaim the symbols of Christianity from the Republican party .
This is a bad mistake because it betrays the progressive values the party espouses .
Sure , it has been frustrating to see how the Republicans have claimed to be the party of Jesus while increasing the gap between rich and poor , preaching hatred of gays , attempting to restrict the reproductive rights of women , and pushing theocracy .
I do not blame Democrats for wanting to change this .
But up until the 2008 campaign , I have generally admired the Democrats refusal to pander in this way .
It has been a big part of what gave the party their appeal .
With the DNC convention , however , they are in danger of losing that appeal .
Efforts by atheists to request inclusion at the service have failed , as have requests to halt the service altogether .
Disappointing but hardly surprising .
But it gets worse .
We now have an unequivocal statement that we atheists have no place in the Democratic Party of 2008 .
The Democratic nominee , Barack Obama , has said on multiple occasions that " secularists are wrong when they ask believers to leave their religion at the door before entering the public square . "
This should have put the secular community on alert .
After all , we cannot afford another president who seeks to abolish the separation of church and state .
What Obama needs to understand is that we are simply asking for the Constitution to be upheld .
But even Obama 's confusion could not have prepared us for the shot just fired across our bow .
Rev. Daughtry , the Pentecostal minister in charge of the interfaith service , made it clear from the beginning that she did not know what do to with nontheists .
Never mind that the interfaith service has been promoted as a unity event .
Daughtry now says , Clearly , the millions of atheists , agnostics , secular humanists , and other freethinkers who reject the notion of religious faith are not valued by the Democratic Party of 2008 .
So much for unifying the party .
As Atheist Ethicist points out , Given estimates that up to 40 % of likely Democratic voters in this election do not believe in the personal god of the three big monotheisms , it would seem that the party risks everything by alienating us .
However , I suspect that this risk is illusory at best .
They know that no political party is going to welcome us , and they may even be hoping that we will protest so they can say , " See we piss off those evil atheists too .
" I agree completely with PZ Myers ( Pharyngula ) when he says , H/ Ts to Stupid Evil Bastard and Bligbi

Barack Obama 's campaign 's superiority in its use of the internet as a political tool in the US presidential race was underlined in by a new media conference in New York yesterday , where senior Republican advisers admitted their party had become complacent in the past four years and lost the initiative .
Mindy Finn , who led internet strategy for Mitt Romney during the primaries , said the Republicans had lost their edge .
" The right was very big on the web in 2000 , 2002 and 2004 , and Bush was effective at getting his message out through videos and the blogosphere , " said Finn .
" But now we 've got complacent . "
The conference , organised by the Personal Democracy Forum , brought together a panel of chief internet strategists from several 2008 presidential campaigns - including that of Obama , Hillary Clinton , John Edwards , John McCain as well as Romney .
The vast gulf in internet - driven campaign energy between Obama and his Republican opponent McCain was underlined by the fact that Obama has just past the magical figure of one million supporters on the network site Facebook .
McCain by contrast has about 150,000 .
McCain 's internet strategist , Mark Soohoo , insisted that this was not a measure of Obama 's political support .
" Just because we do n't have a million Facebook friends does n't mean we do n't have supporters - if it did , the polls would be showing an Obama lead by nine to one . "
Tracy Russo , part of Edwards 's web team , said that McCain 's grasp of social networking tools was " like trying to teach your grandmother about Twitter and then applying it to government " .
Soohoo countered that it was a mistake to assume McCain had no knowledge of new media .
" You do n't have to use a computer to know how it shapes the country , " he said .
" John McCain is aware of the internet .
This is a man who has a long history of understanding a range of issues . "
The one area of agreement between all panel members was that Obama 's campaign had led the field in applying internet social networking tools to a presidential run , with massive results .
His success in primaries and caucuses across the country , as well as in raising unprecedented amounts of money through small donations , can be traced back to the internet .
The Democratic candidate 's top web strategist said the inspiration all flowed directly from the candidate himself .
" [ Obama 's ] been the driving force of the ethos and the use of the web , " said Joe Rospars .
" It has all flowed from his background as a community organiser and his knowledge of working on the ground . "
Rospars denied Obama had been more stand - offish to bloggers than other candidates , saying the campaign 's approach of spreading itself locally in all 50 states was intimately tied into the " blogosphere " .
He added that , if Obama reached the White House , he would introduce open communications into government , with meetings streamed live on the web .
Peter Daou , Clinton 's internet chief , said 2008 was the first presidential election where the internet " really did arrive " .
Though he said it would be too complicated to merge Clinton 's enormous database of supporters ' emails with Obama's , everything would be done to use the collated information in the coming election to persuade her supporters to back him .

A Liberal government would increase funding for research and support of post - secondary students and universities by hundreds of millions of dollars , party leader Stéphane Dion pledged on Wednesday .
Speaking at the University of Western Ontario in London , Dion said the measures that he would introduce if he wins the Oct. 14 federal election would ensure that Canada continues to have top - class universities with excellent research facilities , and make a post - secondary education more affordable .
The plan calls for a 60 per cent increase of funding for university - based research , to $ 500 million a year .
It also proposes a $ 100 - million fund to enable scientists , researchers and graduate students to take on projects that extend beyond the barriers of their disciplines .
" The Canada we Liberals want is not the Canada where only the upper middle class and the rich are able to broaden their minds with a degree or diploma , " Dion told a crowd of students at the school .
A Liberal government would ensure all students can receive guaranteed loans of $ 5,000 , regardless of parental income , Dion said , while adding his party would work with provinces and territories to reduce " punitive " student loan interest rates .
Dion also said he would create a $ 1,000 education grant that would be delivered to students four times annually instead of complicated tax credits that are often only available at the end of the year .
At an event later in the day , Dion also pledged a Liberal government would spend $ 1.25 billion towards the creation of a national child - care program .
Liberal proposals would create ' large deficit ' : Harper
Meanwhile , NDP Leader Jack Layton began his day at a children 's centre in Toronto , where he proposed a $ 1.45 - billion plan that would initially create 150,000 national child care spaces in the first year of a New Democratic Party government .
During a campaign stop in Welland , Ont. , on Wednesday , Conservative Leader Stephen Harper again took aim at the various programs promised daily by his opponents , calling the level of spending proposed by Dion and Layton " mind- boggling . "
" Our government will not preside over disastrous financial policies ; that is not why we are here , " Harper told reporters .
" I would rather lose an election , and I would rather lose a vote in Parliament than do something that I know would put the Canadian economy into deep jeopardy . "
Harper cited Dion 's announcement on Tuesday of a proposed catastrophic drug plan , saying estimates done by provincial premiers put the projected cost of such a plan at $ 6 to $ 10 billion a year , a far cry from the $ 800 million Dion had said would be needed .
He also accused Dion of siding with Green party Leader Elizabeth May on calling for a GST increase .
" People should be under no illusion — raising consumer taxes , carbon taxes , the GST is the policy of these two parties , " Harper said .
In his blistering criticism of the Liberal spending plans , Harper then invoked the name of Bob Rae , the current Liberal MP and former Ontario NDP premier who has taken on a more visible role in Dion 's campaign in recent days .
" In this province in the 1990s , Bob Rae and the NDP took a slowdown and turned it into the biggest recession since the 1930s , " Harper said .
The Conservative leader 's comments came after he spoke to a group of parents about tobacco and children 's health , and announced his party would ban the use of candy - flavoured tobacco additives such as bubble gum and cotton candy .
Harper will head to Quebec later in the day to campaign in Chicoutimi — the birthplace of the sovereignty movement and long considered a bastion of the Bloc Québécois , the CBC's Paul Hunter reported from the campaign .
NDP looking to get more seats in Toronto
The NDP is looking to pick up more of the 22 Toronto - area seats in election , said the CBC's Julie Van Dusen , who is covering the campaign from Ottawa .
The NDP currently holds three seats in the area , including Layton's .
" Basically their theme is going to be … that the Liberals have taken Toronto for granted for too long , " said Van Dusen .
Also on Wednesday , Bloc Québécois Leader Gilles Duceppe continued to press his message that the Bloc was the only party that can prevent a Conservative majority , the CBC's Tim Duboyce reported from the campaign .
Duceppe reiterated his comments to a small group of supporters during a breakfast in Sept - Îles , Que .
The Bloc leader will head to a campaign event in Baie - Comeau later in the day .
After the great floods of 1993 swamped this tiny town in eastern Iowa , Mike Luck begged the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to help protect it from future disasters .
Corps officials responded that this community of fewer than 700 residents probably would have to chip in more than $ 1 million to help build the federally engineered levee system it sought , the former mayor recalled .
Unable to raise the funds , New Hartford built an earthen berm , which breached recently when Beaver Creek flooded , part of the widespread flooding in six Midwestern states .
“ There was no way we could get that kind of money pulled together for a levee , ” Luck said .
“ It took this town more than three years of bake sales and barbecues to raise enough money for new playground equipment .
“ It felt like the government was telling us , ‘ You ’re not big enough or important enough for us to spend our money to save , ’ ” Luck said .
As the waters in the Midwest recede and an early tally of the region ’s devastating floods reaches billions of dollars , some communities are blaming their woes on the federal government , saying it turned its back on their pleas for help building or bolstering the barriers protecting them from the Mississippi River and other waterways .
Federal rules require communities to help pay for projects that can cost millions , which can put them out of reach .
In Iowa , where 71 % of the 949 towns have populations of fewer than 1,000 , those rules can be a forbidding obstacle .
So some Midwestern towns built their own flood protection , adding to an aging patchwork system of varying quality .
State officials in the Midwest say their budgets are too tight to create a uniform system for every waterway , and look enviously at California , which is spending $ 5 billion in bond money to double Sacramento ’s flood protection over the next decade .
“ That ’s almost as much as our entire state budget , ” said Richard Leopold , director of the Iowa Department of Natural Resources .
The agency oversees the state ’s flood - plain management system , but relies on more than 130 local agencies to oversee the maintenance of the barriers .
“ We asked the state Legislature for $ 300,000 this year so we could do dam and levee inspections , and other flood issues , and we did n’t get a dime , ” Leopold said .
Corps spokesman Gene Pawlik said part of the problem dates from the Reagan administration , which directed the corps to weigh the economic benefit against the cost of each project .
Projects in these rural areas sometimes require an “ investment so large , it may be determined not in the best federal interest to do anything . ”
In some cases , local groups have raised the levels of their levees , only to be told by the corps , state officials , or both to drop them to their original height .
Federal and state regulations can prohibit raising levee height because that can affect water levels in other drainage areas or downriver .
“ It ’s like getting a ticket from a policeman -- you try to talk him out of it , but you know , ‘ the rules , ’ ” said David Bleigh , president of the flood - threatened South River Drainage District , near Palmyra , Mo .
The district added two feet to its levees after the 1993 flood , Bleigh said , but the corps ordered them reduced back to their original 28 - foot height .
The conflict reflects a grim calculus , said Doug Johnston , chairman of the community and regional planning department at Iowa State University : Some small communities may not be a good investment .
“ Of course , it ’s cold to have to tell that to the residents who ’ve lived there for generations , ” Johnston said .
Federal engineers reported in 2004 that although La Porte City , Iowa , had flooded “ on at least 10 occasions over the past century , ” there was no “ economic justification ” for a federal flood - protection project .
“ We ’ve been fighting this fight with the corps since 1993 , and it ’s always the same :
The cost of building the protection has got to be at least worth the value of property it ’s protecting in the long run , ” said La Porte City Mayor Rick Lubben .
The town flooded again this year .
Iowa officials predict crop losses statewide will be at least $ 3 billion .
In Cedar Rapids , the state ’s second - largest city , more than 1,200 city blocks flooded .
Leaders estimate that up to $ 1 billion will be needed .
The toll is a reminder of the lack of a unified system to fight floods on the upper Mississippi River , a step that a presidential task force recommended after the 1993 floods .
“ The problem is nobody knows who ’s in charge , and this is a problem you have up and down the Mississippi , ” said Brig .
Gen. Gerald Galloway , formerly with the Corps of Engineers , who led the task force .
After the 1993 report , Congress authorized the corps to study comprehensive flood - control plans for the upper Mississippi .
That report said it would cost billions and would not be cost - effective .
But how the corps sets priorities for such projects may change , officials say .
Congress has instructed the agency to reevaluate that process .

Artist 's Statement
I got to thinking about this cartoon when I read an op -ed in the Times by Bob Herbert on Al Gore ’s envelope - pushing advocacy of 100 % conversion to renewable energy sources within ten years , and his glum certainty that it would be D.O.A. in the national discourse .
“ When exactly was it that the U.S. became a can ’t - do society ? ” he asked .
I am not providing a link to this op - ed because on re-reading it it occurs to me that my whole cartoon is stolen from it , but he , too , recalled this country ’s great defining achievements of the twentieth century : World War II , the Marshall plan , the Civil Rights era , the Apollo program .
When did we lose faith in our ability to pull off great , audacious things ?
In Kim Stanley Robinson ’s trilogy about climate change he envisions unprecedentedly huge , hubristic global engineering projects -- the U.S. Army Engineering Corps restarting the stalled thermohaline circulation by dumping trillions of tons of salt into the oceans , for example .
What seems so heartbreakingly implausible about this scenario is not the Herculean physical and logistical challenge of it , but the political will that would be necessary to initiate it .
I really ca n’t see this country , rigidly ruled as it is by old lizard - eyed oil barons like Dick Cheney , men with mechanical hearts who ’d rather sell out their grandkids ’ futures than see a quarterly drop in profits , converting to renewable sources of energy until they have wrung the very last dime from the last consumer insecure enough about his penis size to buy the last Hummer on the last used - car lot in America .
I keep thinking of Chris Rock ’s routine about how we used to cure diseases .
"
What 's the last shit a doctor cured ? " he asks .
" Polio .
You know how long ago polio was ?
1952 .
That 's like the first season of Lucy . "
You think they 're gonna cure AlDS ?
No -- they can't even cure athlete 's foot .
They ain't curing AlDS .
Shit , they ain't never curing AlDS .
Do n't even think about that shit .
They ain't curing it , ' cause there ain't no money in the cure .
The money 's in the medicine .
That 's how you get paid : on the comeback .
That 's how a drug dealer makes his money : on the comeback .
Panel 1 : The Empire State building in fact took 410 days to construct .
It was the tallest building in the word for forty years and remains so in my heart , even as Pluto will always remain our ninth planet .
Surrounding the base of the building in my drawing are several monumental structures of the Ancient world : from left to right , the Pharos Lighthouse , the legendary Tower of Babel ( drawn , hastily , after Breughel ’s depiction ) , the Great Pyramids , the Hanging Gardens of Babylon , and the Colossus of Rhodes .
All of these , except for the Tower of Babel ( which was probably based on the Etemenaki , a ziggurat in Babylon ) , were real .
I was dweebily obsessed with the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World as a child .
My favorite was the Phraos , which by contemporary accounts may have been more than 600 feet tall , unsurpassed in height by any human construct for sixteen centuries .
As a former connoisseur of very tall buildings and an American citizen , I ’m increasingly embarrassed and disgusted by the stymied state of the Freedom Tower .
It was bad enough when they replaced Daniel Liebeskind ’s rather graceful , futuristic design that echoed the Statue of Liberty with an ugly hulking bunker that turns a blind concrete face to the street like some titanic cenotaph or Temple of Phobos , a Brutalist monument to the culture of fear fostered by the Bush Administration .
But the fact that it ’s been seven years since the destruction of the World Trade Center , and that , in that time , we ’ve done jack shit at ground zero except sell ghoulish souvenirs to rubbernecking tourists is a shame upon the nation .
It seems somehow disgracefully emblematic of this country ’s inability to do a single fucking thing right under the reign of its illegitimate idiot frat - boy king .
I realize that the Ground Zero fiasco is a bureaucratic clusterfuck implicating about a dozen New York city and state agencies as well as the feared organizations of 9/11 widows , and yet it seems to me that a really inspiring symbolic gesture for President Obama to make at his inauguration would be to issue some sort of executive mandate to get something built on that spot pronto .
It would provide us all , as a country , some emotional closure on that ghastly open wound , and herald a new era of what America 's one true and rightful King called Taking Care of Business .
Panel 2 : This is the unfairest panel in the cartoon , since I ’m certainly we could still win a world war if only someone would fight us in one .
My friend Ellen , a reader of John Keegan ’s excellent military histories , pointed out to me that we simply do n’t fight pitched battles anymore .
The Russians really let us down when they just collapsed like a stack of towels piled too high instead of duking it out on Battlefield Europe like we were gearing up for for fifty years .
Now we ’ve got all these cool toys and no one to play with .
We ’ve got radar - invisible planes and our enemies do n’t have radar .
We ’ve got bombs that can vaporize cities and our enemies live in caves .
We ’ve got the best - trained army on earth and our enemies have girls blowing themselves up on buses .
Sucks , man .
Panel 3 : Okay maybe we did n’t completely rebuild Europe in four years but by the end of the Marshall Plan ’s implementation the economies of most of the countries in Europe were outperforming their prewar levels .
It ’s hard to believe me managed this when , after seven and six years of occupation , respectively , we ca n’t even get the people of Afghanistan or Iraq to quit blowing each other up already .
( Gone are the days when you captured the enemy ’s capital and that was it , like in Capture the Flag , they had to give up . )
New Orleans — talk about a shame upon the nation !
An entire American city was destroyed -- and one of our best cities , too , one of the least American , the most untouched by the scourge of Puritanism .
( I still remember my awe at learning there were drive - thru daquiri stands in New Orleans . )
And not only did our federal government let it drown , it then , instead of rebuilding it — as we did Berlin , the capital of Hitler ’s empire — just said , nah , you know what ?
On second thought , fuck it .
This is the behavior of junkies and terminal winos , people who no longer care about themselves enough to bother keeping their homes clean or fixing things or carrying out the most basic functions of taking care of themselves .
The toilet gets stopped up and they just close the bathroom door and start crapping in a bucket .
By the way , I do n’t necessarily agree with this character ’s* implication — I just thought it was what the character would believe , and a funny punchline .
Personally I do n’t think the Bush administration let the people of New Orleans starve on the rooftops because they were black , but because they were poor .
( Okay - - it probably did n't help that they were mostly black . )
This administration does n’t give a shit about anyone who did n’t contribute to their campaign .
Those people were not only broke , and probably Democrats , they were n’t even voters .
And I think Bush and company still see the whole episode as a P.R. snafu rather than the shameful moral failure that it was .
As I ’ve said before , this was the moment when most Americans lost faith in the war in Iraq , because they realized that this government was n’t competent to carry out its most essential functions , much less an ambitious and complicated undertaking like a foreign occupation .
It laid bare the divide between the elites , by and for whom the government is run , and the citizenry , who are , like the Iraqis , the subjects of an indifferently managed occupation .
It became shockingly clear that our government no longer had any intention of keeping up its end of even the most basic Hobbesean social contract .
It ’s a useful lesson to remember in case my friend Rob is right and the next few years see fossil fuel depletion , food shortages , and the general collapse of infrastructure : do not expect the people in charge to do anything to help .
By the time most people are considering shooting their fellow churchgoers and PTA members over the last can of creamed corn on the shelf , our leaders will already be on private jets bound for gated compounds in Belize .
Panel 4 : Then again , maybe this is the unfairest panel in the cartoon .
No criticism of NASA ’s competence implied .
I ’m a big fan of the Hubble , the Mars rovers , and the various unmanned probes that ’ve sent back such beautiful images .
I ’m just reiterating my wistful complaint , often stated , that living in the future is less cool than I was led to believe it would be .
Most of the technological advances have been in the area of consumer gadgetry rather than big , exciting breakthroughs .
I ’m not asking for faster - than - light drive or time travel .
I just hoped I ’d get to walk on another planet , or at least the lameass old Moon , for crying out loud , before I died .
Instead we ’re trying to fix the toilet on the space station .
Some guy did just perfect a jetpack that ’ll work for longer than a minute but it 's roughly the size of a Geo and appears to lift the operator four inches off the ground .
This ‘ ancient astronaut ’ business was huge in the Seventies , when I grew up .
( It was recently resurrected as a pulp trope in the last Indiana Jones film . )
I remember realizing , sometime in middle school , how much it would explain if human beings were a hybrid between apes and some truly intelligent alien species .
Then I grew up and realized this idea was stupid .
Not everybody did .
This assumption that aliens must have helped ancient humans build the Pyramids or Stonehenge speaks of a basic lack of faith in human ingenuity , the same lack of faith evident in the crackpot accusation that the government faked the moon landing , or the 9/11 wackjobs ’ tired rejoinder that , if you think their accusations are incredible , what ’s really hard to believe is that the whole thing was planned by a few guys in a cave !
Well , actually , that ’s easy to believe .
Human beings ’ ignorance and cruelty are equalled only by their brilliance and daring .
In the same way , I feel like lately Americans have lost some fundamental faith in our own ingenuity and boldness -- we no longer believe ourselves capable of great things .
Can we really be the blood descendants of the same people who turned the great eastern forest into a megalopolis , the Great Plains into a breadbasket ; who built Manhattan and Mount Rushmore and the Hoover Dam ; who split the atom , crushed the Third Reich and Imperial Japan , invented the movies and rock and roll , and walked on the moon ?
This nation of obese , illiterate consumers and litigants , these pampered whining puds who ’d sell out the liberties their forefathers died for in exchange for a little illusory safety ?
What the hell ever happened to us , anyway ?
I ’m reminded me of how Peter Bogdanovitch * sometimes ruefully introduced himself in the 80s : “ I used to be Peter Bogdanovitch . ”
We used to be the Americans .
Understand , I ’m not being sentimental about the past , indulging in nostalgia for a time I never knew : I prefer living in a time when it ’s no longer okay to talk about “ niggers ” or “ faggots , ” when we can see photographs of the moons of Neptune , when a man can view more pornography than existed on the whole planet in 1945 in one afternoon at the click of a button .
Even the ancient Greeks romanticized bygone eras ; in the time of Homer they believed that they were living in an Iron Age , enervated and decadent compared to the distant Golden Age of larger - than - life heroes like Achilles and Odysseus .
But i n the coming years we may have to deal with some of the greatest challenges to civilization and survival that our species has faced since the last ice age , and it seems as if most of us are afraid we ’re not up to it .
There ’s something wistfully pessimistic about the book The World Without Us and the various cable TV specials that have adapted or copied it , with their vividly rendered CGI scenes of our buildings and bridges collapsing , our monuments eroding .
There ’s a morbid yearning behind these visions , disturbingly like an adolescent ’s fantasies about his own funeral .
Adolescents like to daydream about such things becausse the prospect of facing their actual futures is so unimaginable , and hence terrifying .
Come on , everybody !
The game ’s not over yet !
I believe it was Patrick Henry , at a meeting of the delegates of the Colony of Virginia at St. John ’s Church in Richmond on March 23rd of 1775 who uttered the now - famous speech : Over ?
Did you say ‘ over ’?
Nothing is over until we decide it is !
Was it over when the Germans bombed Pearl Harbor ?
Hell no !
And it ai n’t over now !
‘ Cause when the going gets tough … [ long pause ] … the tough get goin ’ !
Who ’s with me ?
Let ’s go !
Come on !
AAAAAAHHHH — [runs out alone ; returns ]
What the fuck happened to the Delta I know ?
Where ’s the spirit ?
Where ’s the guts -- huh ?
This could be the greatest night of our lives , but you ’re gonna let it be the worst !
‘ Ooh , we ’re afraid to go with you , Bluto , we might get in trouble . ’
WELL , JUST KISS MY ASS FROM NOW ON !
Not me !
I ’m not gonna take this !
Wormer : he ’s a dead man !
Marmalard : dead !
Niedermeyer … [ response : “ dead ! ” ]
LET ’S DO IT !
GO !
GO !
GO !
GO !
YEAAAAAAGGHHHHHH !
* Whom longtime readers will recognize as protagonist of the classic cartoon “ Yep , It ’s a Bigass Tragedy ” **
Younger readers may not even have heard of director Peter Bogdanovitch , but , believe it or not , after the release of his films The Last Picture Show and What ’s Up , Doc ? in the early 70s , he was as hot a commodity and big a critical darling as was Quentin Tarantino after Pulp Fiction , or David Lynch after Blue Velvet .
After the usual hubris and follies and some ghastly personal tragedies his career foundered and he fell from the fickle grace of Hollywood .
You may have seen him in recent years as the therapist ’s therapist on The Sopranos .

Obama : I ’ll Boost Funds for Bike - Ped Projects If Elected
Barack Obama riding with his family last week .
Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama addressed bicycle advocates and industry leaders at a Chicago fundraiser on Thursday , lending more weight to the pro-bike comments he delivered in Portland , Oregon last month .
Industry mag Bicycle Retailer has the scoop :
Barack Obama , in a private 20 - minute meeting with members of the Bikes
Belong board of directors , told them if he were elected president he
would increase funding for cycling and pedestrian projects .
And the
presumptive Democratic presidential nominee also said he would support
Safe Routes to Schools programs .
Stan Day , SRAM ’s president , said that Obama " gets it . "
He pointed out
that Obama understands that bicycles can be part of a solution to
issues as diverse as health care , obesity , energy and environmental
policy .
" He does his homework and he can connect the dots , " he said .
Obama ’s Oregon campaign co-chair , Representative Earl Blumenauer , said it was remarkable for a candidate to meet with bike advocates so early in the general election season .

Audit faults KBR 's charges to Navy after Katrina Audit faults KBR 's prices
Pentagon report alleges cases of post - hurricane overcharging
KBR overcharged the U.S. Navy for providing meals to workers and service personnel in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina , according to a Pentagon audit .
The Pentagon Inspector General said he could find no documentation in Navy contracting files to back up KBR claims it paid fair and reasonable prices to subcontractors that served meals in New Orleans .
" The prices KBR agreed to pay were greatly inflated , " the 86 - page audit said .
" The Navy paid approximately $ 4.1 million for meals and services we calculate should have cost $ 1.7 million , more than a $ 2.3 million difference , " said the audit , signed by Assistant Inspector General for Acquisition Management Richard Jolliffe .
KBR paid for 227,500 meals over a 34 - day period , yet the subcontractors served only 113,654 , fewer than half , and the remaining meals were discarded , the audit said .
It recommended the Navy demand a refund from KBR of at least $ 1.4 million .
The overcharges were one element of mismanagement by Houston - based KBR , of three Navy contracts valued at $ 229 million for cleanup and restoration of Navy facilities damaged after Hurricane Ivan in 2004 and Katrina in 2005 , the audit said .
Altogether , the audit requested that the Navy seek refunds of at least $ 8.5 million for " inappropriate " payments to KBR .
KBR spokeswoman Heather Browne said " KBR does not agree with many of the conclusions contained in the report . "
" We fully cooperated with the inspector general in its review and provided our comments , including exceptions , to the inspector general , " she said in an e-mailed statement .
" We will continue to work with the Navy to resolve any items associated with the contract that are unresolved . "
KBR was put on contract by the Naval Facilities Engineering Command 's Southeast division in Jacksonville , Fla. , to provide post - hurricane recovery to damaged government buildings , including removing sodden carpet and drywall and debris , repairing roofs and providing trailer parks for displaced Navy families .
KBR is the largest contractor in Iraq , providing support services for the Army as well as repairing oil infrastructure .
The complaints in this audit echo previous charges about the company 's contracting practices for work in Iraq and Kuwait , including poor oversight of subcontractors and passing on inflated prices to the U.S. military .
Retailers are typically obsessed with what to put under their roofs , not on them .
Yet the nation ’s biggest store chains are coming to see their immense , flat roofs as an untapped resource .
In recent months , chains including Wal - Mart Stores , Kohl ’s , Safeway and Whole Foods Market have installed solar panels on roofs of their stores to generate electricity on a large scale .
One reason they are racing is to beat a Dec. 31 deadline to gain tax advantages for these projects .
So far , most chains have outfitted fewer than 10 percent of their stores .
Over the long run , assuming Congress renews a favorable tax provision and more states offer incentives , the chains promise a solar construction program that would ultimately put panels atop almost every big store in the country .
The trend , while not entirely new , is accelerating as the chains seize a chance to bolster their environmental credentials by cutting back on their use of electricity from coal .
The first thing David Braben does is point out how lucky he feels .
" It was a case of right place , right time , " he says , surrounded by more than 160 game developers who work at his Frontier studio on the outskirts of Cambridge .
Luck was something in short supply in 1982 , when Braben wrote Elite with his then - colleague Ian Bell .
The pair were trying to create something different : a game without an end .
The result , the spacefaring trading game Elite , was hard for some people to get their heads around – including the publishers they needed to sell the game .
" Elite broke virtually all the rules , " he says .
" Publishers at the time were n't interested – they wanted something where you had three lives , that took 10 minutes to complete . "
That was until a meeting with AcornSoft , which decided to take the title on .
It was an inspired decision : the game went on to sell a million copies , becoming one of the most influential games of all time – even the producers of Grand Theft Auto have likened their bestseller to a hi-tech , urban equivalent of Elite .
Since then things have moved on a little .
Braben now runs Frontier , an independent developer who recently launched Lost Winds , a Wii title , to critical acclaim .
The studio has another game under development called The Outsider – an immersive , open - ended thriller about someone accused of assassinating the US president .
Braben is proud of his achievements , and of how important and mature the British games industry has become in the past 25 years .
" A lot of people from around then have managed to create a very big industry out of nothing .
For a small country , that 's impressive , " he says .
" We 've now got a company full of people who like games ; not businessmen from other industries with no love for them . "
Despite being optimistic about the future , he also sees threats on the horizon – including a lack of graduates with the right training .
" One of the problems at the moment is that we 're the most expensive country to set up in and we 've got a real skill shortage , " he says .
" There are fewer maths , computer science and physics graduates coming through , while in parallel there 's been a rise in computer games courses . "
Braben admits that such courses offer some value , but he says they do not produce the intimate knowledge of programming and that he requires .
" The thing is that most kids these days know a huge amount about games anyway ; you pick it up just by playing .
But the skills you need to make games are different to what they teach .
There are exceptions , of course , but as a general rule they do n't teach what we need . "
Still , he remains positive about games in general .
He 's a fan of the GTA franchise , and mentions others working at the forefront of expansive , intelligent games .
" Bioware does some interesting things , and Peter Molyneux is pushing the boundaries , " he says .
" And I 'm very interested in Spore . "
So , 25 years ago , did he ever think the games industry would get where it is today ?
" In terms of machine performance , we 're around where I thought we'd be – things like the PlayStation 3 , these are cutting edge machines .
But in terms of the software to use on them ?
I think we 're lagging behind . "
" We 're still at the beginnings of the industry , though .
The changes are all gradual – look at a game from two to three years ago , and it 's so much less sophisticated , " he says .
" The way you interact with characters , the depth of stories ; these are all moving quickly .
The point of the old days was that people could experiment , and now it 's coming full circle : developers like us can try things out , but you 've got so much more in terms of resources . "
We are big fans of Game Center CX here at Wired .
It 's a popular Japanese TV show in which a comedian attempts to clear some of the wickedest classic videogames ever devised .
Although it is n't available in English yet , its producers are working to bring Game Center CX * to U.S. shores .
As a first step , two translated episodes were shown at a film festival in New York last weekend .
Writer and * CX fan Jenn Frank was in attendance , and wrote about the experience for Wired.com .
NEW YORK – In Japan , Game Center CX is no mere television show ; it is a pop phenomenon .
Each episode covers a lot of terrain – there are interviews with developers , trips to Akihabara , phone calls to fans – but the main attraction is a segment called " Arino 's Challenge . "
In it , comedian
Shinya Arino sits at a small television monitor in a mundane , sterile office , struggling ( really struggling ) through old games for the Famicom , the Japanese version of the 8 - bit Nintendo Entertainment System .
Last weekend , two episodes of the Japanese show were presented as part of the New York Asian Film Festival at the IFC
Center .
Rechristened Retro Game Master , each episode was subtitled and narrated in English .
Saturday 's inaugural screening was , thrillingly , the first time I 've had any inkling of what the people on - screen have been saying .
Game Center CX 's charm is undeniable , and thanks to the power of the internet , Arino and his co-workers have found a fan base here in the United States .
In some ways , this is amazing : Not even the author of the venerable Game Center CX episode guide speaks a word of Japanese .
Then again , the feeling of being stumped by an old Nintendo game needs no translation .
That feeling transcends language .
On the show , Arino 's assistants bring him junk food and hint books as he attempts to plow his way through games like Mega Man 2 and Hudson 's Adventure Island .
When
Arino is in a very tight spot , the assistants might carefully diagram a new strategy on a nearby dry - erase board .
Arino 's tiny victories and failures are underscored by classical music , punctuated by cheers and groans .
The show is silly – it knows it is silly – but there is real drama , genuine pathos .
When Arino , down to his very last Mario , squeaks out a narrow defeat of the final boss of Super Mario World , it is impossible not to cheer .
Saturday and Sunday 's screenings were of the games Mystery of Atlantis and Ghosts 'n Goblins , episodes taken from Game Center CX 's second season .
Both games are notoriously difficult and , because they are so excruciating , most people have never seen the ending screens .
On Saturday , the audience chuckled and groaned when we saw , for instance , the final screen in Mystery of Atlantis ( " CONGRATULATION ! " ) .
It was hilariously underwhelming .
Ghosts 'n Goblins is similarly anticlimactic :
The screen recommends that you play through again , from start to finish , for the " real " ending .
In that episode , the beleaguered Arino refuses to play the game again , instead passing his controller to his young assistant .
Word of the Retro Game Master event had traveled the internet quickly but quietly , so it was a wonder anyone arrived at all .
But there the fans were ( tens of them ! ) , assembling themselves in the IFC 's lobby after Saturday 's screening .
Matt Hawkins , a Gamasutra contributor , was there covering the NYAFF .
So was Brett Michel , a film critic for The Boston Phoenix who ardently follows Kotaku .
Another Kotaku reader , Brian Balsan , had taken the subway in from Queens .
Chris Person , a recent film school graduate with a broken foot , had limped in from Brooklyn .
A.J. Mazur – also a recent film school grad , incidentally – had taken a train from Connecticut .
David Goldberg , a retro game enthusiast and 1UP reader , recognized my voice from across the lobby and maneuvered over to introduce himself .
Actually , most of the Game Center CX fans were maneuvering their way across the lobby toward a slim , slight woman who stood near me , wielding a camcorder .
She was Yuko Shiomaki , Style Jam's VP of international marketing , and she was soliciting on - camera greetings for Arino .
In a way , English - language internet coverage of * Game Center CX *had brought Shiomaki to the IFC Center on Saturday , too .
She hinted that the initial impetus for Style Jam's Retro Game Master project was , in large part , English - language blogs and their continued online evangelism of the series .
( Apparently , the very existence of said blogs astonished the folks at Fuji Television ; I am pleased to report that Style Jam 's promotional literature for Retro Game Master repeatedly invokes " a write - up in Wired magazine . " )
Shiomaki and I very briefly discussed Style Jam 's involvement in localizing * Game Center CX * for North American audiences .
With the screenings of Retro Game Master at the film fest , Style Jam aims to generate interest in an eventual North American DVD release ( Retro Game Master does not yet have a U.S. distributor ) , as well as to measure the fans ' response .
In that regard , the two episodes were basically a proof - of - concept prototype .
Retro Game Master is , in a word , a success .
For most fans , understanding Arino was the biggest payoff .
He is witty .
" It was great ! " retro gamer Goldberg told me .
" I mean , I 've watched parts of episodes on YouTube , things like that , but to be able to know exactly what was going on was amazing .
It even added to the tension and the drama and everything . "
For Mazur and Person , the real joy was the venue itself .
" The experience of seeing the show in a theater made it better ; ( the audience ) was sort of playing off each other , " Person said .
" There was something weirdly communal about it .
It 's the sensation of ' hand me the controller ! '
You 're frustrated for ( Arino ) . "
" It 's frustrating , " Mazur added .
" You feel helpless , but you want him to persevere .
We 've all had that experience , sitting with friends , playing games .
And now hopefully it 'll be on TV . "
In Saturday morning 's episode of Retro Game Master , Arino tackled Mystery of Atlantis .
And it was nice to watch with other fans .
It was interactive , participative :
There were audible gasps ( mine ) and applause , sometimes sighs , sometimes a smattering of cheers .
Later , I watched the original episode again , just to compare , and it really was an uncompromisingly direct translation .
After Sunday 's Ghosts 'n Goblins screening , I again checked the source material , and sure enough :
The show is essentially unchanged .
As a fan , I count this in Retro Game Master 's favor .
In fact , few liberties have been taken , and then only with the cast 's names .
In the Ghosts 'n Goblins episode , assistant director Hiroshi Sasano is simply called " Assistant S. "
As for Arino , the two episodes were prefaced by a clip of him introducing himself – in splendidly terrible English – as the kacho .
Of course , that is n't really much of name change : Kacho means section chief in the Japanese business hierarchy .
Arino identifies himself as such with his pregame battle cry : Kacho On !
In fact , the only place the translation truly strays from the source material is the title of the show itself .
" I do n't see why they have to name it Retro Game Master , " I said to Chris Kohler earlier that week .
" I mean , the title was already in English , sort of . "
( But it does n't mean anything , Chris Kohler told her .
– Ed. )
Apart from this tiny quibble , the localization was absolutely pitch - perfect .
Perhaps some audience members were uncertain about Patrick Harlan 's voiceover , which was especially ambitious .
( Others loved it . )
For most , though , the only real disappointment was that certain segments – the interviews , the phone calls , the treks through Akihabara – were conspicuously missing .
In fact , only the gameplay segments had been translated for our English - speaking audience .
For me , this ought n't have been a problem .
Usually , when I watch Game Center CX I get impatient with the culture pieces and human - interest segments .
I want the show to get on to the good bits ; I want to see the main event .
In the screenings of Retro Game Master , though , I realized I missed the interviews , the phone calls , the field trips .
Without all those little extras to mitigate the show , the* * gameplay segments seemed , at times , to drag their heels .
Kotaku reader Balsan said he hopes , as I do , that the powers that be intend to subtitle episodes of Game Center CX in their entirety .
Cornering Style Jam's Shiomaki , Balsan remarked : " I would love them to show the whole hour .
Or at least , if not the whole hour , the ' TamaGe ' section , where ( Arino ) is going around Tokyo , you know .
Because he 's playing in those retro arcades , which are difficult to find here in America now .
So it 's great to see him interact with these people , go into these places , and find this old , like , King of Fighters arcade ( machine ) . "
Balsan also insisted that the market for * Retro Game Master * absolutely exists .
" There is a lot about this program that so suits my interests , " he said , " because I 've grown up on games , I talk about games , I write about games .
The Famicom , the Genesis ....
This is my program , right here ! "
And while Saturday and Sunday 's turnouts were , by any reasonable account , fairly small , the sample audience 's enthusiasm should certainly come as encouragement to Style Jam and its potential investors .
Style Jam first introduced the * Retro Game Master * project last May in Cannes , France .
Shiomaki told me that " it is the kacho's dream " to , someday soon , be welcomed to American soil by cheering fans .
If you 're in New York City , you can catch an encore presentation of the * Retro Game Master * episodes .
The Mystery of Atlantis episode will be screened Saturday at noon .
The Ghosts 'n Goblins episode airs at noon Sunday and again at 11:30 a.m. July 2 . Admission is free .

In a stunning development , it is being reported by several news organizations that Dr. Ivins told a friend that at some point during the investigation the FBI offered $ 2.5 million and “ a sports car of his choosing ” to his son for info that could be used to implicate his father in the anthrax killings .
Was he the only witness offered money to come forward ?
I have also learned that this “ new DNA ” test that connected this strain of anthrax to the lab Dr. Ivins worked in , took place in early 2002 .
So why are we being told that if they had it 3 years ago , Hatfill would n’t have been charged ?
Some kind of new evidence is bound to be forthcoming today ( unless some big news event breaks and takes all the attention away from this case , like say , when Donald Rumsfeld announced on Sept.
10th 2001 that 2 trillion was “ missing ” from the Pentagon ) because they are supposedly briefing the victims families about the case this morning .
So that gives me a brief window of opportunity to explore a little more of the “ evidence ” that has been leaked by the investigators so far .
Paid Witnesses
Cruising through the news cycles now is the reported story that , according to a friend of Dr. Ivins , Ivins complained to him awhile ago that the FBI was so aggressive in their persuit of him , “ they offered his son $ 2.5 million to rat him out and tried to turn his hospitalized daughter against him with photographs of dead anthrax victims . ”
CBS .
“ In the current case , Ivins complained privately that FBI agents had offered his son , Andy , $ 2.5 million , plus “ the sports car of his choice ” late last year if he would turn over evidence implicating his father in the anthrax attacks , according to a former U.S. scientist who described himself as a friend of Ivins . ”
CBS .
If this statement is found to be accurate ( at this point no - one , including Jean Duley , has even implied that Dr. Bruce Ivins was a liar ) then that is a huge development in this case .
Because it means that someone on the FBI ’s investigative team was so desperate to pin this on Ivins that they would offer huge sums of tax - payer money to ANY witness for ANY information .
Once impropriety is exposed in one part of an investigation , as long as the investigator that committed it is still on the team , you HAVE to question all the other parts of that investigation .
Meaning ; if they offered cash to one witness to step forward , then it follows that it is possible that they offered that same cash to another witness .
During the Aug. 2nd press interview that Jean Duley ’s boyfriend , Mike McFadden , gave , he admitted that Duleyhad been talking with the FBI for awhile .
“ Duley had numerous meetings withthe FBI in the past month , McFadden said , but he declined to provide specific information about those meetings . ”
Fredrick News Post .
According to the timelinethat his statement creates , that means the FBI was in communications with Duley BEFORE she reported Dr. Ivins strange group therapy rant on the 9th of July .
This is VERY important because it sets up the FBI ’s case that Ivins has a history of mental illness as well as the restraining order that Duley files later on the 24th .
But then the interview takes a strange turn .
Out of nowhere McFadden claims that “ ” She had to quit her job and is now unable to work , and we have spent our savings on attorneys . ” .
Others have already done a fantastic job of picking this comment apart , so I wo n’t waste your time withthe obvious problems with his comment .
But I will ask this : why is McFadden introducing the idea of Duley ’s financial sacrifice at this point ?
He would even go further with this theme : “ She sacrificed all this stuff because she wanted to do the right thing . ” .
FNP .
Sounds to me like someone is justifying something , now does n’t it ?
Look , we now know that the FBI was n’t opposed to paying witnesses huge sums of cash for their testimony in this case .
That being said , lets look at the facts .
The FBI was in contact with Duley BEFORE she called the cops about the July 9th rant ;
The FBI , according to Duley ’s audio testimony , told Duley to file the restraining order ; and according to Duley ’s statements , the FBI prepped her by sharing case file information with her , as a witness , so that she would include that information in the court records , without having that information vetted or scrutinized by the courts ; and now we know that the FBI in this case , was n’t above paying cash to get witnesses to help .
Conclusion : Was Jean Duley paid millions to help set up Dr. Ivins ?
That may be the case .
We need to look into her financial background to see if she has come into a windfall of some kind since she was in contact with the FBI .
Paying a witness to testify is one thing ; but paying someone to file fraudulent claims in court and to make false statements to the police , is quite another .
By ALL accounts thus far , Jean Duley ’s comments are the exception to every stated opinion of this man and , at the same time , they are the basis for EVERY legal action taken against him that seems to set up the FBI ’scase .
It is illegal for the FBI to pay a person to file fraudulent claims with any official agency and it is equally illegal for someone to accept payment to do so .
For these reasons there should be a serious investigation into the actions taken by the FBI investigative team and Jean Duley ’s financial records .
New DNA Test
On this past Sunday , the story broke that the FBI had “ new DNA evidence ” that would link this strain of anthrax to Dr. Ivins lab .
This story got allot of traction for a few days , until it was uncovered by many that the DNA evidence linked to a sample that many people in the lab had access to , and that it still was n’t , at that time , in it ’s weaponized form ; a process that many of his fellow scientists say he was just incapable of doing .
According to the New York Sun : “ Using new genome technology , researchers looked at samples of cells from the victims to identify the kind of anthrax Ames strain that killed them , the scientist said .
They noticed very subtle differences in the DNA of the strain used in the attacks than in other types of Ames anthrax . ”
NYS .
The New York Sun goes on to say : “ The science is known as DNA fingerprinting .
Although any two samples of anthrax bacteria will likely share roughly the same DNA structure , there are tiny differences from sample to sample . ”
NYS .
“ The new genome technology that tracked down Ivins was either not available or too expensive to use often until about three years ago . “
NYS .
Really ?
From an article from New Scientist dated May 9th 2002 ;
“ The DNA sequence of the anthrax sent through the US mail in 2001 has been revealed and confirms suspicions that the bacteria originally came from a US military laboratory . ”
The data released uses codenames for the reference strains against which the attack strain was compared .
But New Scientist can reveal that the two reference strains that appear identical to the attack strain most likely originated at the US Army Medical Research Institute for Infectious Diseases at Fort Detrick ( USAMRIID ) , Maryland .
The new genetic sequencing work was done by the Institute for Genomic Research in Rockville , Maryland ( TIGR ) , and Paul Keim ’s team at the University of Northern Arizona at Flagstaff .
The idea was to tease out subtle differences between the two genomes that might identify the source of the attack strain … ” New Scientist .
Notice the similar hot - points from the articles .
This is the same “ evidence ” they had since early 2002 , but because it did n’t get much attention , they picked it up and dusted it off as if it was something new pointing to Dr. Ivins .
But we know that all it pointed to was the Ames strain of anthrax at the lab .
Well , apparently they knew that back in 2002 .
So , the FBI ’s “ new DNA evidence ” and the reason they started looking at Dr. Ivins for this ?
I do n’t think so .
This story get ’s worse and worse by the minute .
Someone from the local or state - level investigations units in Maryland needs to step in and take over this investigation , or there needs to be a congressional hearing on the level of the 9/11 commission .
We know that the FBI has botched the investigation from the beginning and now , we are being spoon fed misleading evidence from the FBI team .
The FBI ’s Keystone Cops production is embarrassing .
They tend to forget that they are supposed to be trying to find the ‘ terrorist ” that used OUR ANTHRAX to kill civilians and to attack MEMBERS OF CONGRESS .
What makes the FBI so sure that there wo n’t be another attack while they are framing the second guy for this ?
This is deeply serious , and unless the congress wants the citizens of this country to know that our government is either completely inept or actually protecting the terrorists who sent the anthrax , then they need to step in and take the FBI off this case now .

If all goes well this summer , an Air New Zealand 747 jumbo jet will take off from Auckland this fall powered by fuel refined from the seed of a fast - growing weed .
The three - hour test flight could mark one of the more promising -- and more unusual -- steps by the financially strapped airline industry to find cheaper and more environmentally friendly alternatives to fossil fuel .
“ We ’re confident that the test will go well , ” said David Morgan , Air New Zealand ’s general manager for airline operations , before leading visitors to a farm here where the weeds are being researched .
If the flight is successful , “ it ’ll be a real milestone not only for Air New Zealand but for aviation . ”
The secret : oil from poisonous seeds of the jatropha tree , which grows in warm climates around the world .
For the last year , scientists here have been perfecting a process for turning the oil into jet fuel .
On Wednesday , the airline announced plans to use the new fuel for 10 % of its needs by 2013 .
Advertisement
The jatropha oil is also significantly cheaper than crude oil .
It could cost an estimated $ 43 a barrel , or about one - third of Wednesday ’s closing price of $ 122.30 for a barrel of crude oil .
The test flight is particularly noteworthy because it will come at a time when ethanol and other biofuels have come under increasing scrutiny because of their side effects .
Production of ethanol has been blamed for corn shortages that have contributed to higher food prices .
Other biofuels have been blamed for deforestation and contributing to global warming .
The test will also come as record fuel prices are prompting airlines to raise fares and jam more people into fewer , more fuel - efficient planes .
With jet fuel prices up 70 % from a year ago , U.S. carriers could see losses of more than $ 7 billion this year , analysts estimate .
On Wednesday , UAL Corp .'s United Airlines , the nation ’s second - largest carrier , said it planned to ground 100 older , fuel - guzzling planes and shed as many as 1,600 jobs as it faces a $ 3 - billion fuel bill in what it called an “ unprecedented fuel environment . ”

“ This is an extraordinary crisis with the potential to reshape the industry with impacts throughout the global economy , ” said Giovanni Bisignani , chief executive of the International Air Transport Assn. , as he opened an annual gathering of airline executives in Istanbul , Turkey , on Monday .
A partial solution may lie here on a hillside with a vista of Honolulu , where Air New Zealand and aircraft maker Boeing Co. have been working with Hawaiian agriculture experts to develop a strain of weed that could help the industry reduce its dependence on crude oil .
The weed , which resembles a fruit tree , can be grown virtually anywhere , does n’t need much water or fertilizer and is not edible .
In India , the plants are mainly used as hedges to keep cows out of farm fields .
In the U.S. some researchers , including one in Santa Barbara , have been growing the trees to process biodiesel that can be used in automobiles and factory machines .
“ It ’s an ugly - looking plant , to be honest with you , ” said Lance Santo , an agronomist for Hawaii Agriculture Research Center , as he held a golf - ball - size nut that had fallen from a jatropha plant .
Advertisement
Within the nut were two seeds resembling peanuts .
They contained 30 % to 40 % oil .
Researchers looking at various crops discovered that the quality of jatropha oil was better than most for making jet fuel .
Jatropha - based fuel also produces about half the harmful carbon emissions of fossil fuel .
Air New Zealand said its jatropha oil for the test flight would come from fields in southeastern Africa and India .
The oil will be refined into jet fuel at an unspecified “ hydro plant ” in the U.S. that the carrier declined to name , citing competitive reasons .
For safety , the initial test flight will involve running only one of the four engines with the fuel .
If the test is successful , the fuel will gradually be used on all of the engines in subsequent test flights .
Researchers here have found that an acre of the plant can yield about 300 gallons of oil , or five to seven times more than other potential feedstocks such as soybeans .
Advertisement
Though little is known in the U.S. , jatropha is widely viewed as a potential wonder plant in many parts of the world where longtime fuel shortages have led to development of alternative energy sources to power automobiles and factories .
But the latest effort by Air New Zealand , which is also getting help from jet - engine maker Rolls - Royce , is the first to process the oil for jet fuel and comes after nearly two years of research into a second generation of biofuels .
After it gets its first supply of jatropha - based jet fuel in July , the airline will have to wait a few months for regulatory approvals and fuel certifications to begin the test flights , which , if all goes well , could occur in September .
At the agricultural field office here , jatropha is also seen as holding promise for agriculture in Hawaii , once the world ’s largest sugar - cane producer .
With lower - cost foreign competition , Hawaii has only two cane growers now , down from a dozen when Santo began working for the state ’s agriculture department in 1972 .
Advertisement
Agriculture experts are not sure whether jatropha can replace sugar cane as a major crop , but researchers are also looking at other uses , including plant extracts that they recently discovered had properties similar to those of latex .
“ It ’ll be a while before we can say it ’s a miracle plant , ” Santo said .
“ But we ’ve just scratched the surface . ”

Bobble Babes Boobs and beer may seem like a good combination when you are young and drunk , but surely you can find a better way of satisfying your “ urges . ” .
If you feel the need to get this beer accessory , keep it away from all the girls you know , or you ’ll never get a taste of the real thing .
Drew ’s Famous Inflatable Ring Toss Beer Bottle Hat
It does n’t matter how drunk anyone is , this game is not fun .
This seems to be the frat boy equivalent to bad bridal shower games .
As soon as you see one of your buddies put this on his head , and ask for someone to play , it ’s time to walk out the door and go find new friends dude .
Beer Mug of Blooms Sometimes couples will fight , and you will want to apologize to your wife or girlfriend with flowers .
Good idea .
Picking out Beer Mug of Blooms as the ultimate “ I ’m Sorry ” gift ?
Bad idea .
Do n’t even think about it .
Girls – thinking of sending this to your man ?
Go ahead if you want him coming home from the office with an atomic wedgie and a new feminine nickname .
Beer Pager
Just when you thought that being the drunk emotional guy was the most embarrassing thing at the party , you meet the guy with the Beer Pager .
He hates losing his beer , and wants to let everyone know that fact , by purchasing this device with his hard earned money .
Beer Fart Extinguisher
Let ’s face it , farts will always be funny .
However , spending real money on something called the “ Beer Fart Extinguisher ” may be pushing it .
We get it ; bodily gas is hilarious but only to a certain extent .
Leave your wallet at home if you know you are going to a place selling this extinguisher .
Be recognized as the guy who laughed at the product for a couple minutes instead of the guy who actually bought it .
Rideable Cooler
The only time that riding your cooler is acceptable is when you are under the age of 12 , and your scooter broke because your Mom ran it over with her mini-van .
So , if you are over the age of twenty one , and thinking of purchasing this ride able cooler , Let ’s just hope that you have good friends that will snap some sense into you and how totally ridiculous you ’d look riding on this thing .
Beirstick
Ahh , is n’t it just wonderful when binge drinking is made into a fast , two second process ?
Nothing screams “ I ’m classy , sophisticated , patient , and not blacking out on the front lawn later ” better than using the all mighty Beirstick in front of all your friends .
Beer Goggles
I ’m not sure what ’s creepier here , the beer goggles or the mannequin wearing them .
If you are drunk enough to put these bad - boys on in public … you deserve to sleep with whoever it is says yes , just do n’t come complainin to me the next morning .
Boob beer Cover Hands down , the most ridiculous beer gadget out there .
Break this puppy out at a party and you will look like either a child breastfeeding or what you are , which is an idiot drinking beer with a plastic boob on the top .
Beer Belt Maybe this Beer Belt is convenient to some people , but those people better prepare themselves to go home alone , and also be the butt of every joke or stare throughout the night .
You may feel like a winner , but you sure do n’t look like one .
Leave the belt at home , and just hold on to your beer like a normal guy should , alright ?
Beer Alarm
Next time you are at a bar , and you see some guy with this Beer Burglar alarm , not only drink his beer but shout “ I ’m stealing your beer , and there is nothing you can do about it ” as loud as you can .
It ’s not like this alarm is really going to stop you .
Drinking Straw Glasses
If the classic beer helmet is n’t making the cut anymore , the next step in ridiculous beer accessories would have to be the drinking straw glasses .
The ‘ glasses ’ are made from a long piece of flexible tubing , so all you have to do is put them on , insert the short end into your mouth and the long end into your drink – and watch the drink swirl through the straw and around your eyes with every sip .
The only difference between normal glasses and these would be that this will most likely impair your vision even more , and also your judgment !
Perfect !
IBreath
You know you should not be driving if your ipod doubles as a life - saving breathalyzer .
Anyone who buys this , should probably take a step back from the cash register and consider taking a couple other steps .
12 steps , if you get my drift .
IBreath Little Whizzer Designed to look like a famous statue in Europe , the Little Whizzer offers a rather disgusting way to drink your beer .
If one of your friends happens to plop this on the bar one night at their party , you ’re definitely going to have to re-think that friendship .
Moaner Lisa
I look at this and try to imagine the meeting at the manufacturer ’s conference room .
“ Hey , what if we make a bottle opener that looks like a woman , you use her ass to open the bottle and she moans as you pop the cap off ! ”
And then someone responds positively .?!
I ca n’t imagine there were any females in that conference .
Come to think of it , I do n’t think there were any brains either .
Mohawk Helmet
Beer helmets have taken a turn for the worst .
In all reality , who even thought that they could get worse ?
I believe a man is getting fired from his job right now as we speak , after his boss found photos of him on Myspace wearing this hat .
Let ’s just say it does not scream mature .
Remote Controlled Cooler Feeling extremely lazy , thirsty , and ready to get drunk ?
You ’re in luck because now your cooler can come to you , so you do n’t have to get all the way up and actually use your limbs or muscles !
Tongue Shaped Opener Quite possibly the strangest bottle opener out there .
Completely unnecessary and the idea of your tongue opening a bottle is enough to make anyone get the chills .
Leave this in the junk drawer .
There are plenty of other cool bottle openers out there that do n’t involve fake taste buds and red plastic lips !
Must be frustrating being a scientist .
There you are , incrementally discovering how the universe works via a series of complex tests and experiments , for the benefit of all mankind - and what thanks do you get ?
People call you " egghead " or " boffin " or " heretic " , and they cave your face in with a rock and bury you out in the wilderness .
Not literally - not in this day and age - but you get the idea .
Scientists are mistrusted by huge swathes of the general public , who see them as emotionless lab - coated meddlers - with - nature rather than , say , fellow human beings who 've actually bothered getting off their arses to work this shit out .
The wariness stems from three popular misconceptions :
1 ) Scientists want to fill our world with chemicals and killer robots ;
2 ) They do n't appreciate the raw beauty of nature , maaan ; and
3 ) They 're always spoiling our fun , pointing out homeopathy does n't work or ghosts do n't exist EVEN THOUGH they KNOW we REALLY , REALLY want to believe in them .
That last delusion is the most insidious .
Science is like a good friend : sometimes it tells you things you do n't want to hear .
It tells you the truth .
And we all know how much that can hurt , do n't we , fatso ?
Many people find bald , unvarnished truths so disturbing , they prefer to ram their heads in the sand and start dreaming at the first sign of scientific reality .
The more contrary evidence mounts up , the harder they 'll ignore it .
And even the greatest , most widely - admired scientists can provoke this reaction .
Take Darwin .
Or rather , take The Genius Of Darwin ( Mon , 8 pm , C4 ) , the latest documentary from professional God-hatin ' Professor Yaffle impersonator Richard Dawkins , which sets out to calmly and lucidly explain a )
Why Darwin was so ace , and b ) Just how much evidence there is to support his findings .
Darwin's theory of evolution was simple , beautiful , majestic and awe - inspiring .
But because it contradicts the allegorical babblings of a bunch of made - up old books , it 's been under attack since day one .
That 's just tough luck for Darwin .
If the Bible had contained a passage that claimed gravity is caused by God pulling objects toward the ground with magic invisible threads , we 'd still be debating Newton with idiots too .
Since Darwin's death , Dawkins points out , the evidence confirming his discovery has piled up and up and up , many thousand feet above the point of dispute .
And yet heroically , many still dispute it .
They 're like couch potatoes watching Finding Nemo on DVD who 've suffered some kind of brain haemorrhage which has led them to believe the story they 're watching is real , that their screen is filled with water and talking fish , and that that 's all there is to reality - just them and that screen and Nemo - and when you run into the room and point out the DVD player and the cables connecting it to the screen , and you open the windows and point outside and describe how overwhelming the real world is - when you do all that , it only spooks them .
So they go on believing in Nemo , with gritted teeth if necessary .
What was it that spooked them so ?
Probably natural selection 's lack of reassuring narrative .
It lays the ruthless , godless world pretty bloody bare .
As Dawkins says : " The total amount of suffering in the natural world is beyond all decent contemplation .
During the minute it takes me to say these words , thousands of animals are running for their lives , whimpering with fear , feeling teeth sink into their throats .
Thousands are dying from starvation or disease or feeling a parasite rasping away from within .
There is no central authority ; no safety net .
For most animals the reality of life is struggling , suffering and death . "
Woo - hoo !
Compare and contrast with the plot of Finding Nemo and it's easy to understand why people would rather believe in the purdy singing clown fish .
But this is our reality , people .
Like the man says , there 's no safety net - so since we 're all in this together , we 'll have to make our own .
And we can't do that with our eyes and minds shut now , can we ?
Newsweek seems to think there is n’t any excuse .
We have one .
John McCain has no clue what he ’s talking about when it comes to the economy .
He ’s run this race as a war hero , and now we ’re finding out that , as one voter said on TV a while back , it ’s great that you ’re a war hero but how does that help me get a job ?
A war hero who is clueless about the economy is of little use to America during an economic crisis .
More from Newsweek :
The question remains :
Are the fundamentals sound ?
Was McCain right , or hopelessly rosy - eyed ?
It depends on which fundamentals you want to emphasize .
There are times when all the fundamentals are unsound , as was the case in 1931 .
And there are times when all the fundamentals appear to be sound , as was the case in the mid- to late 1990s .
The rest of the time , the fundamentals reside somewhere between the two poles ( the left pole signifying we ’re totally screwed and the right pole signifying that happy days are here again ) .
Today , we ’re closer to being totally screwed .
Consider .
The U.S. needs to create about 150,000 jobs per month just to keep pace with growing population .
When payroll jobs fall for eight straight months and the unemployment rate spikes , and when new weekly unemployment claims remain above 400,000 , the economy may not be fundamentally sound .
When inflation in the past 12 months has run at 5.4 percent , well over the twice the level with which central bankers are comfortable , the economy may not be fundamentally sound .
When foreclosures are running at record rates and housing prices fall by nearly 16 percent year over year , the economy may not be fundamentally sound .
When the two largest financial institutions in the nation , which guarantee about half of the mortgages , fail and have to be taken over by the government , when the fourth - largest investment bank files for Chapter 11 , and when the Federal Reserve effectively nationalizes a massive insurance firm that is a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average , the economy may not be fundamentally sound .
In an economy where consumption constitutes 70 percent of activity , retail sales falling two months in a row may indicate that the economy may not be fundamentally sound .
When industrial production decreases , the economy may not be fundamentally sound .
When the nation ’s three major automakers , some of the largest remaining manufacturing entities , report sales declines of over 20 percent and beg the taxpayers for loans , the economy may not be fundamentally sound .

Khan 's condition has shown a little improvement now ( Photo : Prakash Natvalne )
Three employees of an event management firm in India have been arrested for putting the life of a reality TV show participant in danger , police say .
Anjar Khan , 22 , took part in the show in the central Indian city of Indore where contestants were asked to stay under water for as long as possible .
He collapsed and is in hospital in a " serious condition " , doctors say .
Reality TV shows have become huge hits in India with thousands queuing up to take part in them .
Something wrong Mr Khan participated in a programme at a shopping mall in Indore on Sunday to publicise a new reality TV show " Khatron Ke Khiladi " [ Dare devils ] where participants were dared to remain under water in a huge glass tank .
He was inside the water tank for some minutes before the organisers realised there was something wrong and he was pulled out .
Reports say he lost consciousness in the tank and had water in his lungs .
He managed to walk a few steps but then collapsed .
He was taken to a nearby hospital where he has been on artificial respirator ever since .
" He was brought to the hospital with a major part of his system such as pulse and blood pressure in an extremely critical condition , " Dr GMR Shah of Mayur Hospital told the BBC .
Dr Shah said Khan would continue to be on ventilator for some more days although his condition had shown some improvement .
According to reports , no doctors or paramedics were present at the mall when the incident took place .
Officials say the organisers did not have permission to hold the contest .
Senior police officer Mahesh Chandra Jain said the arrested employees would be charged with " gross negligence which put a person 's life in danger " .

After winning a Special Jury Prize for Independent Vision at Sundance for her first film , “ In Between Days , ” director So Yong Kim was invited to workshop her project “ Treeless Mountain ” at the exhaustive and consistently effective Sundance Writers and Directors labs .
A US / Korean co-production , South Korean native Kim who cites Belgian directors the Dardenne Brothers and Russian master Andrei Tarkovsky as major influences in her work describes Treeless Mountain , which debuted at Cannes in 2007 , and making its Canadian debut at the Toronto Film Festival 2008 , as the story of a girl who must watch over her sister when their mother leaves to find their missing father .
The girls end up living with their alcoholic aunt in the countryside .
Seen from the point of view of the children , the film affords a rare perspective of Kim ’s hometown Pusan , and South Korea in general .

The monarchs of money have been exposed as arrogant fools .
Now we are all paying the price for their hubris
For decades , we have worshipped at the shrine of gold .
Prime ministers and presidents have bowed before its keepers .
The monarchs of cash , arbiters of wealth , supposed founts of all wisdom , have bestridden Europe and the United States , humbling all in their path .
Investment bankers , hedge fund managers , private equity bosses have strutted in their huge townhouses , tossed away thousands at charity auctions , held court at polo matches and racecourses , launched fleets of yachts and squadrons of Lear jets in a fashion which many of history 's dictators would have envied .
Today , we awaken to discover that like so many wizards of Oz , these supremely confident figures are in reality foolish old men - and some young ones - mouthing hollow incantations from behind curtains .
A Lehman Brothers worker dons a branded hat and drowns his sorrows with fellow investment bankers
Their universe is crumbling .
They rule from the summits of glass towers , but now many can scarcely afford the rents .
Markets are tumbling , currencies trembling , great companies begging for lifelines .
The money men have made fools of us .
In the years of their dominance , they insisted that the markets were the highest judges and must be left free to rule .
Now that the markets signal their downfall , they are running sobbing to governments and taxpayers , begging for our money to save them from the poorhouse .
Humble
The bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers , which makes the collapse of Northern Rock seem a mishap in an eggcup , is the heaviest blow to fall upon Western capitalism for decades .
In a year , Lehman 's shares have fallen from $ 65 to zilch .
This represents not the eclipse of a single investment bank , nor the follies of one management , but a failure which rocks the whole financial system .
A vision of capitalism stands discredited .
Almost every bank boss in the Western world is today trembling in his Gucci loafers .
Few , if any , even know the scale of their own institutions ' exposure to risk .
It will be months , maybe years , before we can be sure that the financial structure on both sides of the Atlantic can weather this storm .
The rest of us , humble savers and mortgage holders and workers in the real world , are entitled to our anger .
For years , we have been told that we should stifle our resentment about the huge rewards which the City and Wall Street have paid themselves .
No matter that in a rational world , no 30 or 35 - year - old could be worth a million a year or more .
Only these masterminds , it was said , understood how to pull the levers of their wonderful engines of wealth .
The City of London was once a quaint little place where a few thousand people shuffled cash , affected bowlers or even top hats and spent three hours over lunch .
Nowadays , however , the financial services industry accounts for almost a third of Britain 's economy .
What causes pain in the City will eventually hurt each one of us .
Fantasists
When the people controlling the huge financial institutions of London and New York lose the plot , consequences are felt in every household in Britain and America .
What has happened reflects the intrusion of reality on a legion of fantasists in Porsches .
For a start , they lost sight of what the word ' bank ' used to mean .
A bank was once a solid , comfortable , rather dull place which took in money from depositors , then lent it to businesses and private citizens at a profit .
Then along came a generation of ambitious , clever and greedy people .
They thought this was a boring way to do business .
They could instead accelerate and enlarge the process on a grand scale .
They borrowed
huge sums in the wholesale money market , and used these to place bets on whatever took their fancy - currencies , shares , commodities , property .
For a long time , enough of these bets romped home winners to provide shareholders with handsome returns , and traders with amazing incomes .
In truth , we should not call the screen - kings ' traders ' , but ' bookmakers ' .
The good ones made enough money to buy themselves Mayfair houses before they were 30 , drink Bollinger for breakfast and buy their cocaine in Bond Street .
Desk cleared : A Lehman Brothers employee leaves the offices in Canary Wharf , East London after the firm went bankrupt overnight
They devised ever more inventive ways to recycle debt , to shuffle liabilities ' off balance sheet ' and blow bubbles that impressed not only babies in bathtubs , but chief executives in government .
You may remember a few years ago , some commentators speculated that this new cycle of wealth generation had rendered redundant all traditional ideas about economic ups and downs , booms and busts .
Many marketmakers and even economics ministers believed that from here on in , the Western world would get richer and richer .
Those of us sceptical about Santa Claus never subscribed to this doctrine .
But not in our wildest moments did we imagine the recklessness with which business was being conducted in the towers around St Paul's , Canary Wharf and Wall Street .
Today , all is revealed .
The collapse in the value of property , against which a mountain of debt was secured , has exposed the fragility of the edifice on which trillions of pounds depend .
We are left waiting to discover whether the real world - in which people work to make and sell goods , to provide real services - can survive the shock .
For decades , the money men have ruled us .
Private equity overlords have confidently proclaimed that they could run any business better than its own managers .
Luxury
Now these same people stand gasping and bewildered , hoping that central banks and governments can pour enough public money into the system to compensate for their ghastly mistakes .
Almost the worst part of it all is that the rest of us cannot afford the luxury of standing on the riverbank , watching the City 's gilded idiots thrashing in the torrent , and rather enjoying their comeuppance .
The financial services industry is too important to Britain for that .
And it is an area in which we and the Americans are alleged to possess unique skills .
The current failure , in the eyes of the world , is the failure of an Anglo - American model .
Unless the reputations of the City and Wall Street can recover , unless our money industry can be stabilised and revived , there is a danger that British financial services will go the same way as so many other British economic mainstays - shipbuilders , car makers , textile weavers and such like - which have vanished over the past century .
If the world decides that we do not know how to manage its money , then as a nation we are in deep trouble .
Today , in both Britain and America , the financial community has suffered a devastating loss of confidence .
It is inevitable and right that regulation will be tightened on both sides of the Atlantic , to prevent a recurrence of the recklessness which has created this disaster .
If regulation goes too far , however , if the risk - takers are too tightly shackled , then the City of London will atrophy .
It will find itself offering little to investors that other nations , rival financial centres , cannot provide for themselves .
It may sound paradoxical to bemoan the causes of the Anglo - American financial system 's failure , then to say that we must not change it too much .
But we should acknowledge that for at least two decades before it overreached itself , the City brought great prosperity to this country .
It is impossible to devise a model that generates successes without also allowing failures .
Henceforward , we need to find means of moderating risk exposure , without destroying incentives and opportunities for entrepreneurs .
This will not be easy .
Demoralisation and even panic prevail today , and are likely to persist through many months to come .
City and Wall Street bosses deserve no crumb of our pity .
Their hubris has created a crisis of capitalism in which almost all have been complicit .
But the U.S. and British governments cannot and will not allow the financial system to fail .
It will take years to rebuild the confidence which has been destroyed , but rebuilt it must be .
Our livelihoods for the rest of the century depend upon it .
How to Format a US Business Letter By Ali Hale
Whatever you do – whether you ’re a student , employed in an office job , or working as a freelancer – I can guarantee that at some point in your life , you ’ll need to sit down and write a formal business letter .
It might be to a customer , to an employer with a job that you want , or to apply for university funding .
Perhaps it ’ll even be to a literary agent or publisher who just might take on your undiscovered novel .
Of course , you ’ll want the letter to be well - written – but almost as important is knowing how to format it correctly .
This article is about US business letter format ( for UK readers , do n’t worry , I ’ll be writing a follow - up one for you . )
The main formats for business letters in the US are called full block format and modified block format .
Full block format means that all the elements of the letter are left - justified so that the start of each line is at the left - hand margin .
This is the more formal style , so use it if you ’re unsure which to go for .
Modified block format means that some elements of the letter are shifted over to the right .
Nowadays , this style is appropriate in most contexts .
Here ’s a full block format letter
And a modified block format one :
Let ’s break those down into the main elements , in top - to - bottom order :
Your Address
Your address , also known as the “ return address ” , should come first .
( Note that this applies when using standard plain paper .
If you have letter headed paper , you should omit this . )
123 Acacia Avenue
Newtown
Anywhere
AN 98765
Your return address should be positioned :
On the left - hand side if you ’re using full block format
On the right - hand side ( tab across , rather than right - aligning ) if you ’re using modified block format
Why put your address ?
Even if the recipient has your details in their address book , you want it to be as hassle - free as possible for them to reply – you ’re likely to receive a speedier response .
The Date
Directly beneath your address , put the date on which the letter was written :
May 15 , 2008
To avoid any confusion , especially if you are writing to a business abroad , it is best to put the date in word rather than number form , and you should omit the “ th ” .
The date should be positioned on the left - hand side , for full block format and for modified block format
Why put the date ?
It ’s standard practice to include the date on which the letter was written .
Correspondence is often filed in date order .
It makes it much easier for the recipient to send a timely reply , and easier for you to chase up an answer if necessary .
Eg .
“ In my letter of May 15 … ”
Reference Line
I ’ve not included this on the diagram as guidance varies on where it should be placed .
You may include a reference line , starting with “ Re : ” This is often used when corresponding with large companies , or when applying for a job .
The reference line can either appear beneath the date , OR beneath the recipient ’s address .
If you use a reference line , you should usually omit the subject line ( see below ) .
The reference line should be left - aligned for both full and modified block formats .
Different types of letters will require different types of subject and reference lines , so choose the one that ’s most appropriate to your case .
Why put a reference line ?
You should use a reference line if the recipient has requested specific information , such as a job number or invoice number , or if you ’re replying to a letter .
This makes it easier for the recipient to get a speedy response to you .
Recipient ’s Name and Address
Beneath this , you should put the name and address of the person you ’re writing to , just as it would appear on the envelope .
If you ’re using a window envelope , this should be aligned on the page to show through the window – but even if it wo n’t be visible until the letter is opened , it should still be included .
The recipient ’s name and address should be positioned on the left - hand side , for both formats .
Why put their address ?
If you ’re writing to someone in an office , it probably wo n’t be them who opens the post .
An administrator is likely to do so – and letters may be separated from their envelopes at this stage .
Particularly if there are multiple departments within one building , or if you are starting your letter “ Dear Bob ” , a name and address ensures your letter reaches the correct recipient .
The Greeting
After their address , you should leave a line ’s space then put “ Dear Mr Jones ” , “ Dear Bob ” or “ Dear Sir / Madam ” as appropriate .
Follow this with a colon .
The greeting , sometimes called the “ salutation ” , should always be left - aligned .
Why put a greeting ?
Business letters are a formal type of writing , and it ’s considered polite to start with a greeting .
Although you can get away with starting emails “ Hi ” or “ Hello ” , letters follow more conservative conventions .
The Subject
Optionally , you may wish to include a subject for your letter .
This is becoming more common , perhaps as people have become used to the subject lines of emails .
If you do put a subject line , it should be in uppercase , directly below the “ Dear name : ”
The subject ( if you include one ) should be left - aligned for full block format , but can be either left aligned or centred for modified block format .
Why put the subject ?
It ’s a good idea to include a subject so that the recipient can see at a glance what the letter refers to .
Try to be succinct but include as much information as possible , eg . “ Funding application from Joe Bloggs , candidate 222-456 ” .
The Text of Your Letter
Now , finally , you can write the main body of your letter .
Your text should have :
Single - spacing between lines
A blank line ( NOT an indent ) before each new paragraph
( And , of course , you should conform to all the usual rules of grammar , punctuation and spelling : for example , ensuring that you start each sentence with a capital letter , and finish with a full stop . )
Why leave blank lines ?
In the business world , it ’s standard practise to put a blank line between paragraphs .
This helps to break up the text on the page and make it more readable .
The Closing
After the body of text , your letter should end with an appropriate closing phrase and a comma .
The safest option is “ Yours faithfully ” ( when you do n’t know the name of the person to whom you are writing , ie .
when you began “ Dear Sir / Madam ” ) or “ Yours sincerely ” ( when you do know their name ) .
If you are already acquainted with the recipient , it may be appropriate to use a phrase such as “ Best regards ” , “ With warmest regards ” , or “ Kind regards ” .
The closing should be :
Left - aligned for full block format
On the right ( tab across so it matches up with your address ) for modified block format
Why use these phrases ?
Although “ Yours sincerely ” and “ Yours faithfully ” might sound archaic , they are time - honoured ways to close a formal letter .
Your Name and Signature
Put several blank lines after the “ Yours sincerely , ” or “ Yours faithfully , ” then type your name .
You can optionally put your job title and company name on the line beneath this .
Joe Bloggs
Marketing Director , BizSolutions
Your name and signature should be :
Left - aligned for full block format
On the right ( tab across so it matches up with your address ) for modified block format
Why leave a blank space ?
The blank space is so that , when you ’ve printed the letter , you can sign it with your name .
This is taken as proof that the letter really is from the person whose name is typed at the bottom .
Sometimes , another person may sign the letter on your behalf .
If this is the case , they should put the letters “ p.p. ” before their name , which stands for the Latin per procurationem meaning “ by agency ” .
Business letter tone
It ’s very important that you choose the right voice and tone when writing your business letter .
Using the correct format but choosing an improper type of language might affect your desired outcome .
Here ’s what the guys from thebalancecareers.com wrote about this :
Make the purpose of your letter clear through simple and targeted language , keeping the opening paragraph brief .
You can start with , “ I am writing in reference to … ” and from there , communicate only what you need to say .
The subsequent paragraphs should include information that gives your reader a full understanding of your objective (s ) but avoid meandering sentences and needlessly long words .
Again , keep it concise to sustain their attention .
Enjoy writing your letters , and use the examples above to help you with the formatting if you do get stuck .
Your Step by Step Recap
Formatting a business letter correctly might seem a bit daunting , especially if you ’ve never or rarely written this type of letter before – perhaps you ’re applying for a job for the first time , for instance , and writing a covering letter .
Here ’s a quick recap of what we ’ve covered , so you can use it as a handy checklist :
Step # 1 : Decide Whether You ’re Using “ Full Block Format ” or “ Modified Block Format ” .
Try not to mix - and - match between these .
Remember , full block format ( with everything left - justified ) is the more formal of the two styles – but these days , modified block format ( with some elements shifted over to the right ) is fine for most contexts .
Step # 2 : Include Your Address
Your address should go on the left for full block format and on the right for modified block format .
Do n’t right - justify the text – tab across .
Step # 3 : Include the Date
The date should go directly after your address , and should be left - justified whatever format you ’re using .
Write it like this : “ May 15 , 2008 ” .
Step # 4 : Potentially Include a Reference Line
If you ’re corresponding with a large company or if you ’ve been asked to include a specific reference number in your letter , type “ Re : ” then the reference line .
If you ’re using a reference line , omit the subject line .
Step # 5 : Include the Recipient ’s Name and Address
This should be left - justified , whatever format you use .
It ’s important to include their full name as well as the address in case the letter becomes separated from the envelope ( which it usually will in a large office ) .
If you ’re using a window envelope , make sure the recipient ’s name and address are positioned to appear within the window .
Step # 6 : Include the Greeting
The greeting , sometimes called the salutation , should be followed by a colon .
( E.g . “ Dear Mr Jones : ” ) It should always be left - justified .
Step # 7 : Consider Including a Subject Line
The subject line is optional , but it ’s become increasingly common practice .
Your subject line should show the recipient , at a glance , what your letter is about .
It can be left - justified or centered in modified block format .
Step # 8 : Write the Letter Itself
The text of your letter itself should be left - justified ( in all formats ) and single - spaced .
You should put a blank line between paragraphs , rather than indenting them .
Write in an appropriate business - like tone .
Step # 9 : Add an Appropriate Closing
Close your letter with a phrase like “ Yours sincerely ” ( a safe formal option ) or “ Best regards ” ( a good option for someone who you already know ) .
Follow this with a comma .
Step # 10 : Add Your Name
Leave a blank space for your signature , then type your name at the end of the letter .
If appropriate , you can put your job title and company name on the line beneath your name .

This was home , an over run garden now sporting wild roses , plastic trees and of course , the box .
Oh , it was easy to see it was a home of some sort .
Crude windows had been cut out , covered with rose colored glass .
The sides had roses carved and burned into it , almost obscuring the old letters , made in china .
It was a rather large box , one could only guess what had originally been in it but whatever it was , it was made in china and smelled of cows .
It was just them now .
Supposedly their were others living somewhere out there , but they liked their privacy .
After the war , not much survived .
Most of China survived , apparently radioactive fallout was n’t a big deal .
But that was a big irradiated ocean away .
All the cockroaches died .
Yeah , that was always fun to talk about .
The twinkies made it of course .
Not unaffected but they made it .
The fallout had made them even more durable .
Now , even the human digestive system can’t break them down .
That was fun the first time around .
At first he just thought it was a really big turd but nope , the twinkie just passed right on through .
The really freaky thing was though , even though it was n’t breaking down , a man could somehow survive by only eating those .
Eventually though , all that ’s left is to re-eat some .
The trick was to clean them and throw them all together with the new ones .
Oh sure it could be an old one , and after 3 years they were all probably old ones but their was always that chance …
It ’s that kind of thinking that can keep you going .
The little couple walked through the garden , passing all the old service bots , frozen into position , indicator lights still flashing .
They made great scarecrows , and the lights looked awful pretty at night .
He could n’t take it anymore .
Why did he have to be the only one left ?
And he hated taking orders , always being polite .
He spent a lot of nights outside , looking at the flashing lights .
He needed out .
So he went , but he went the right way .
That night he went inside and killed her .
Should have never built the bitch in the first place .

TORONTO ( Reuters ) - Canadians who may have become tired of being passed over as porn stars will have a new , home - grown outlet to showcase their erotic talents .
Federal regulators have granted Alberta - based Real Productions approval to launch a new digital pornography channel , which promises to serve up at least 50 percent domestic content .
The Canadian Radio- Television and Telecommunications Commission ( CRTC ) approved the Category 2 pay - television service on Wednesday , allowing Northern Peaks to become “ Canada ’s first adult video channel offering significant Canadian adult content . ”
“ I think as Canadians there is a bit of a tiredness in seeing all American stuff , ” Shaun Donnelly , president of Real Productions , said during an interview on Friday .
“ There is always that thrill for something that is local and you get the sense that these are people you can meet at the supermarket . ”
The CRTC only required 15 percent Canadian content , but Northern Peaks agreed to provide “ not less than 50 percent of the broadcast day and not less than 50 percent of the evening broadcast period to Canadian programming , ” according to the license .
“ We want to be Canada ’s adult channel and I think to do that , 15 percent would n’t cut it , ” Donnelly said .
Real Productions boasts the largest collection of Canadian adult - themed content in the country with more than 200 film titles and 75 television episodes in its library .
The regulator stipulated the license will only be issued once Real Productions enters into an agreement with at least one licensed distributor .
Donnelly , who has also produced television programs for Playboy TV in the U.S. and Granada Television in Britain , said all five major Canadian cable and satellite carriers have expressed interest in hosting the channel and are reviewing the proposal .
“ I ’ve been in touch with the cable companies throughout the process and went ahead with it based on the interest we had , ” he said
Northern Peaks will be restricted to certain types of programming including long - form documentaries , dramatic series , feature films , game shows , mini-series , sitcoms and made - for - TV movies .
The CRTC received no interventions in connection with the application , which was initially launched in October 2007 .

ATLANTA --
When Eric Shanteau touched the wall second at the U.S. Olympic trials , he was overcome by the joy of reaching a lifelong goal .
The celebration did n't last long .
Shanteau had barely locked up his trip to Beijing when he was forced to deal with a gut - wrenching choice :
Should he have surgery for the testicular cancer hardly anyone knew about ?
Or , should he put it off for another month so he could swim at his first Olympics ?
Shanteau chose the Olympics .
Surgery will have to wait .
In an exclusive interview with The Associated Press , Shanteau said he learned just a week before leaving for the U.S. Olympic trials that he has cancer .
Eric Shanteau , who received his cancer diagnosis before the trials in Omaha , will not risk his life just to swim in his first Olympics .
Al Bello / Getty Images
" I was sort of like , ' This is n't real .
There 's no way this is happening to me right now , " Shanteau said by telephone from the team 's pre-Beijing training camp in California .
" You 're trying to get ready for the Olympics , and you just get this huge bomb dropped on you . "
His doctors cleared him to compete at the trials in Omaha , Neb. , determining he would n't be at great risk to delay treatment .
Then , Shanteau surprisingly made the team in the 200 - meter breaststroke , finishing second ahead of former world - record holder and heavy favorite Brendan Hansen .
He 's putting off surgery until after the Olympics because it would keep him out of the water for at least two weeks , ruining his Beijing preparations .
The 24 - year - old Georgia native will be monitored closely over the next month by U.S. Olympic team doctors and vows to withdraw if there 's any sign his cancer is spreading .
" If I did n't make the team , the decision would have been easy :
Go home and have the surgery , " said Shanteau , who grew up in suburban Atlanta .
" I made the team , so I had a hard decision .
But , by no means am I being stupid about this . "
Still , there are no guarantees .
" With any cancer , you want to find it early and treat it early for the best outcome , " Dr. Brett Baker , the Austin , Texas - based urologist who delivered the news to Shanteau , said Friday .
" That was my recommendation .
It 's difficult to say in his scenario what to expect .
The risk , of course , is that time is an opportunity for disease progression . "
Seeking out advice from team doctors and other outside experts , Shanteau came up with his own plan .
He will have his blood tested once a week and a CT scan done every two weeks through the Olympics , hoping that will be enough to keep a handle on the disease .
" If something comes up abnormal , " he said , " then that 's kind of a barrier I should n't cross . "
In most cases of this type , Baker said it 's impossible to know for sure exactly what type of testicular cancer the patient has -- or , even the very slight chance that it's not cancer at all -- until the tumor is removed surgically for a biopsy .
" Sometimes , the best decisions are not always exactly the way the doctor sees it , " Baker said .
" I do n't consider him crazy at all .
I think if he 's happy and content with playing it out this way , that 's the most important thing . "
If Shanteau can't compete , the Americans would add Scott Usher as their second swimmer in the 200 breast .
The third - place finisher in Omaha was told of Shanteau 's condition the day after the race and encouraged to keep training .
" I 've been trying to play in my head what I would do in his situation , " Usher said Friday before heading to a solo training session at Purdue University .
" I do n't know if I would have taken the same route he has , to be honest .
...
Cancer is not something you want to mess around with . "
It was found after Shanteau noticed an abnormality and was finally persuaded by his girlfriend to see a doctor in Austin , where he trains on a star - studded team that includes Hansen , Ian Crocker and Aaron Peirsol .
On June 19 , exactly one week before he was scheduled to leave for the trials , Shanteau got the news .
" It almost numbed me , " he said .
" I 'll remember that day for the rest of my life .
Talk about a life - changing experience .
That 's as big a one as you can have , I think .
You 're changed for the rest of your life . "
If everything had gone according to the expected script in Omaha , Shanteau would have already gone through surgery and be on the road to recovery .
But the improbable happened in the 200 breaststroke , where Hansen -- considered a lock to make the team -- faded badly on the final lap .
Scott Spann powered by to win the race , and Shanteau passed Hansen as well to claim the second spot on the team .
Shanteau was going to the Olympics .
But his thoughts quickly shifted to the cancer .
" A lot of people kept asking me after that race , ' What was going on ?
We thought we would get a little more reaction out of you , ' " he said .
" That kind of made it a little bittersweet .
It went well .
I made the team .
Then I had to go back and deal with reality . "
Only a few close friends and family knew about Shanteau 's condition before the Olympic trials .
He decided to go public with his story because he hopes to inspire others who have cancer .
According to the National Cancer Institute , testicular cancer is relatively rare , accounting for 1 percent of male cancer cases in the U.S.
It 's often diagnosed in younger men .
About 8,000 men are diagnosed and 390 die from the disease each year .
The cancer is usually slow to spread and highly treatable , but follow - up care is extremely important because of the risk of recurrence , the NCI said .
Surgery to remove the affected testicle is the most common form of treatment .
Mark Schubert , head coach and general manager of the U.S. team , supports Shanteau 's decision to swim in Beijing .
" Eric is handling this situation with courage and poise , and his decisions to compete at the Olympics and to share his story for the benefit of others , are evidence of that courage , " Schubert said .
" While we are hopeful that he will be able to compete , Eric 's heath remains the absolute top priority . "
Shanteau 's camp already has heard from the agent of Lance Armstrong , who overcame the same disease and won the Tour de France seven straight times .
" Lance 's agent told my coaches that I 'm the closest thing to Lance Armstrong that there is on the planet right now , " Shanteau said .
" If I can have a fraction of the impact that he 's had , just a tiny little bit , then I think what I 'm going through will be good . "
Up to now , Shanteau 's biggest international accomplishment was finishing fifth in the 200 breaststroke at last year 's world championships in Australia .
He faces long odds to make the medal stand in Beijing , having posted only the ninth - fastest time in the world this year .
" Making the Olympic team was the hard part , " he said .
" The Olympic Games should be fun .
I 'm not worried about swimming fast there . "
At the trials , Shanteau could n't help but think about his disease when outside the pool .
He put it aside as soon as he entered the water , however .
He expects it will be the same in Beijing .
" I want the swimming aspect so badly , " Shanteau said .
" I know what I 'm risking ... but it 's basically just a longer recovery time .
After the Olympics , I 'll have nothing but time .
That 's why it was n't too hard to make this decision . "
I live near a military base .
The sounds and rumbles of the large tankers often catch me unawares .
Momentarily , I may imagine that my little condo will be crushed under the weight of the behemoth .
Several times a day one of the 157th Air Refueling Wing 's eight KC - 135R Stratotankers will depart or return from refueling F - 16s from Vermont , and A - 10s and F - 15s from Massachusetts .
No matter what my political views at the time , the sounds always fill me with wonder .
Forces far beyond my every day world are performing their unique jobs .
Today one of the tankers flying overhead elicited a reaction from a little girl that changed my world , inconveniently .

Dorothy Wickenden has an interesting article in this week 's The Talk Of The Town in The New Yorker .
She compares the changing positions and strategies of John McCain and Barack Obama .
She concludes that Obama , if he is to win , must tell the public the inconvenient truths that can inspire change .
He can make voters part of the solution by helping them understand the issues .
She believes that the next president can be its most powerful leader .
" Congress will not redeem themselves until consumers demand that they do so by making some inconvenient changes of their own .
A little more audacity will yield a lot more hope . "
The little girl 's screams of terror have inconveniently changed my views .

TSA Proud of Confiscating Non-Dangerous Item
This is just sad .
The TSA confiscated a battery pack not because it ’s dangerous , but because other passengers might think it ’s dangerous .
And they ’re proud of the fact .
“ We must treat every suspicious item the same and utilize the tools we have available to make a final determination , ” said Federal Security Director David Wynn .
“ Procedures are in place for a reason and this is a clear indication our workforce is doing a great job . ”
My guess is that if Kip Hawley were allowed to comment on my blog , he would say something like this : “ It ’s not just bombs that are prohibited ; it ’s things that look like bombs .
This looks enough like a bomb to fool the other passengers , and that in itself is a threat . ”
Okay , that ’s fair .
But the average person does n’t know what a bomb looks like ; all he knows is what he sees on television and the movies .
And this rule means that all homemade electronics are confiscated , because anything homemade with wires can look like a bomb to someone who does n’t know better .
The rule just does n’t work .
And in today ’s passengers - fight - back world , do you think anyone is going to successfully do anything with a fake bomb ?

US home prices fell at the fastest pace of the year in May , compared with the same month in 2007 , suggesting no end to the three - year housing slump .
Prices dropped 4.8 % , faster than the 4.6 % year - over - year decline in April , the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight said in a report on Tuesday .
The one - month decline , from April , was 0.3 % , Washington - based Ofheo said .
Eight out of nine regions showed declines as the worst housing slump in more than a quarter of a century deepened with banks cutting lending following $ US400 billion ( $ 412 billion ) in mortgage - related losses and writedowns .
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson last week asked Congress to approve legislation allowing the government to extend credit to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and buy their stocks if needed to stem further declines in housing .
A new law including provisions for stricter regulation of the government sponsored enterprises '' may have a positive impact on future house price performance , '' Ofheo Director James Lockhart said in a statement .
Prices fell the most from a year ago in California , Washington , Oregon , Alaska and Hawaii , which recorded a 14.5 % drop .
Florida , Georgia , the Carolinas and states in the south atlantic fell 5.8 % , Ofheo said .
In New York , New Jersey and Pennsylvania the decline was 2.1 % .
Regional prices
The only region to see a price gain was the West South Central with an increase of 0.5 % .
It includes Oklahoma , Arkansas , Texas and Louisiana .
The monthly house price index is down 4.9 % from its peak in April 2007 , Ofheo said .
The decline in May from April was better than the 0.8 % average estimate of seven economists surveyed by Bloomberg News .
Ofheo is the government agency that is the regulator of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
California had the most foreclosure filings in June for the 18th consecutive month , increasing 77 % in June from a year earlier to 68,666 , according to data from Irvine - based RealtyTrac Inc .
Sales of previously owned homes probably will drop to 5.39 million in the US this year , 24 % below the 2005 all - time annual high of 7.08 million , the National Association of Realtors said in a July 8 forecast .
Measured monthly , home sales reached a peak in September 2005 , at an annualized pace of 7.25 million .
The median US home price probably will tumble 6.2 % in 2008 to $ US205,300 , the realtors group said in its forecast .
Last year 's 1.4 % drop was the first national decline in the US median since the Great Depression , according to Lawrence Yun , chief economist of the housing group .
Foreclosures jump
New foreclosures rose to a seasonally adjusted 0.99 % of all US home loans in the first quarter , up from 0.83 % in the prior period , the Mortgage Bankers Association said on June 5 .
The total inventory of homes in foreclosure increased to 2.47 % and the delinquency rate , loans with one or more payments overdue , grew to 6.35 % .
All were the highest in a series that goes back to 1979 , the Washington - based trade group said .
Housing prices will fall another 10 % to 15 % over the next 12 months , making it a mistake for policy makers to raise borrowing costs to curb inflation , said Bill Gross , who manages the world 's biggest bond fund at Pacific Investment Management Co .
Home prices in 20 cities dropped 15.3 % in April from a year earlier , according to S&P / Case - Shiller , the most since the group began collecting data .

Long a problem in the western U.S. , the New Zealand mud snail currently inhabits four of the five Great Lakes and is spreading into rivers and tributaries , according to a Penn State team of researchers .
These tiny creatures out - compete native snails and insects , but are not good fish food replacements for the native species .
" These snails have an operculum , a door that closes the shell , " says Edward P. Levri , associate professor of biology at Penn State 's Altoona Campus .
" They can be out of the water for longer than other snails and when fed to fish , they are not digested and sometimes come out alive .
This has a potential to alter the salmon and trout fisheries because they alter the food chain . "
The New Zealand mud snail grows to a maximum of a quarter of an inch and is more normally a sixteenth to an eighth of an inch in length .
The hard shell is capable of sealing off the soft animal from outside influences .
In New Zealand , the snails reproduce asexually , resulting in identical clones , or sexually .
However , in invaded areas , asexual cloning is the only mode of reproduction .
This mud snail spread to England as early as 1850 and Europe in the late 1800s .
It is found in Japan , but when the snail arrived there is unknown .
The first mud snail found in the U.S. was in 1987 in the Snake River , Idaho , but the species did not appear in the east until 1991 in Lake Ontario .
The western and eastern U.S. populations are separate episodes of introduction , because they represent different clones ; in each case , only one snail needed to be introduced to begin the invasion .
The snails in the Great Lakes region appear to be the same as one clone found in Europe .
" In the western U.S. , this species is of special concern largely because of their ability to modify ecosystems , " Levri told attendees August 8 at the Ecological Society of America 's annual meeting in Milwaukee .
The snails in western streams alter the nitrogen and carbon cycling .
They are primarily grazers and detritus eaters with very wide food preferences .
In some places in streams in Yellowstone National Park , they reach population densities of 323 individuals per square inch .
Levri , working with undergraduates Warren J. Jacoby , Shane J. Lunen , Ashley A. Kelly and Thomas A. Ladson , found that densities in the Great Lakes are not anywhere near that in the West .

" In our most recent survey , we were lucky if we found a few hundred per square meter , " says Levri .
" In Lake Erie they are not very abundant , but it is unclear what they are doing 100 feet below the surface . "
In New Zealand , the mud snails are not a problem because of native trematodes -- flukes -- that infect the snails and controls their population and reproduction .
Some people have suggested that those who want to control the snail introduce this trematode to the U.S. to control the snails .
" There are two problems with introducing these trematodes , " says Levri .
" The first is that any introduction of a nonnative species can cause worse problems than they were expected to cure .
The second is that these flukes have a multiple - host life cycle , infecting ducks that are apparently not affected before infecting the snails .
This might work in the west where the snails are in shallow water , but no duck is going to dive 100 feet to get snails . "
Levri and his team found that in Lake Ontario , the densities of the snails peak between 50 and 82 feet and they were rarely found in water less than 16 feet .
" What we can do is limit their expansion , " says Levri .
" That means that recreational water users must be very careful moving from one place to another .
We advise anglers to freeze waders and fishing gear , or use Formula 409 or something like that to kill the snails . "
He notes that signs are beginning to mark areas in New York where the snail is found to warn people to clean their gear .
The Penn State researcher warns that the snails are difficult to control , noting " I have frozen them for 12 hours at a time and about 50 percent of them survive . "

The release of the FBI ’s " evidence " against Bruce Ivins , the now - deceased Ft. Detrick scientist targeted by the FBI as the alleged culprit in the 2001 anthrax letters case , demonstrates either ( 1 ) the FBI is covering for the real culprits , or ( 2 ) what we are witnessing is a dramatic drop in the intelligence of the average FBI official  maybe it ’s something in the water .
In making the case for the latter , I offer as exhibit number - one the FBI ’s contention [ .pdf file ] that the origin of the return address on some of the anthrax - laden envelopes  " Greendale School "  was explained by Ivins ’ membership in the American Family Association , a group of Christian fundamentalists who often lobby and litigate on behalf of conservative causes :
" The investigation into the fictitious return address on envelopes used for the second round of anthrax mailings , ‘ 4th GRADE , ’ ‘ GREENDALE SCHOOL , ’ has established a possible link to the American Family Association ( AFA ) headquartered in Tupelo , Mississippi .
In October 1999 , MA , a Christian organization , published an article entitled ‘ AFA takes Wisconsin to court .
‘ The article describes a lawsuit filed in federal court , by the AFA Center for Law and Policy ( CLP ) , on behalf of the parents of students at Greendale Baptist Academy .
The article focuses on an incident that occurred on December 16 , 1998 , in which case workers of the Wisconsin Department of Human Services went to the Greendale Baptist Academy in order to interview a fourth - grade student .
The case workers , acting on an anonymous tip that Greendale Baptist Academy administered corporal punishment as part of its discipline policy , did not disclose to the staff why they wanted to interview the student .
The case workers interviewed the student in the absence of the student ’s parents and informed the school staff that the parents were not to be contacted .
The AFA CLP filed suit against the Wisconsin Department of Human Services , citing a violation of the parents ’ Fourth Amendment rights . "
You ask : so what ?
As do I .
But those geniuses over at FBI headquarters are waaaay ahead of us :
" [ Redacted ] donations were made to the AFA in the name of ‘ Mr. and Mrs. Bruce Ivins ’ on eleven separate occasions beginning on December 31 , 1993 .
After an approximate two year break in donations , the next donation occurred on November 11 , 1999 , one month after the initial article referencing Greendale Baptist Academy was published in the AFA Journal .
It was also discovered that the subscription to the AFA Journal , in the name of Mr. & Mrs. Bruce Ivins was active until March 2005 . "
This does n’t even rise to the level of a logical fallacy , which has to have at least some internal coherence to so qualify .
It ’s just plain weird .
At this point , one has to wonder if the FBI itself has become a casualty of some previously unknown biological agent that has caused its employees to be afflicted with the Algernon Syndrome .
There is , however , an internal consistency in the body of " evidence " released so far , and it consists of stretching even the most marginal bits of information to the breaking point in an often hilarious effort to prove Ivins ’ guilt .
The AFA angle may seem bizarre , but it is no less so than the Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority gambit , which the FBI engages in to divert attention from the fact that they at no point place Ivins anywhere near the Princeton , N.J. , location the deadly missives were mailed from .
Instead , they point to Ivins ’ alleged " obsession " with Kappa Kappa Gamma and the fact that the group maintains a storehouse near that location .
What are they smoking over at FBI headquarters ?
The FBI points to Ivins ’ alleged evasiveness when it came time for him to hand over samples of the anthrax strain he was working on : on two occasions he gave them the wrong samples .
Yet even this  their strongest real evidence by far  is by no means clear .
Ivins ’ lawyer , Paul F. Kemp , points out that the investigators either asked for the wrong sample , or else did n’t make themselves clear as to what they were requesting .
National Public Radio reports
Kemp saying that " when investigators asked Ivins for an anthrax sample , he thought they were asking for a pure culture sample .
It was n’t until six weeks later that they called and said they had wanted something else . "
Ivins , says Kemp , " never denied to the FBI that the anthrax could have come from his batch . "
Ivins , the FBI avers , was the " custodian " of the particular anthrax strain contained in the letters , and this conclusively proves his guilt .
However , since this strain was developed in 1997 , more than 100 people have at some point shared this " custodianship " with the accused .
It is therefore not true that , as FBI officials put it , Ivins was the " one individual who controlled it . "
The FBI also claims the envelopes containing the anthrax must have come from the Frederick , Md. , mail facility where Ivins maintained a post office box .
Yet , as noted in the FBI ’s own affidavit , those envelopes could have come from any one of hundreds of post offices : as the affidavit put it , the printing defects that made these particular envelopes identifiable were distributed " to post offices throughout Maryland and Virginia . "
No traces of anthrax were found in Ivins ’ car or home .
Other than tracing the anthrax strain to a flask in Ivins ’ lab , our intrepid G - men have no physical evidence pointing to his guilt .
All they have is the AFA / Greendale " connection " and an e-mail written by Ivins right after 9/11 in which he stated :
" ’ Bin Laden terrorists for sure have anthrax and sarin gas ’ and have ‘ just decreed death to all Jews and all Americans , ’ language similar to the anthrax letters warning ‘ WE HAVE THIS ANTHRAX DEATH TO AMERICA DEATH TO ISRAEL . ’ "
This does n’t rise to the level of circumstantial evidence  it ’s just simplistic nonsense .
How else would one describe Osama bin Laden ’s views , which he and his followers have expressed on many occasions ?
Certainly these were a prime subject of public discussion at the time Ivins ’ e-mail was written .
Stylistically , what the FBI ’s " case " against Ivins resembles is nothing so much as the case for invading Iraq .
Here we see the same cherry - picking of " intelligence " and isolated factoids , mixed together in one very unappetizing goulash , which we are supposed to swallow without so much as a grimace .
In this era when circumstantial and highly selective evidence is enough to set America on a course to war , it ’s also enough to convict a man of the most heinous crimes and blacken his name forever .
That ’s the kind of world we ’re living in  truly a nightmare universe , in which the FBI , instead of doing its job , is doing its best to make sure that we never get to the heart of this sinister mystery .
What ’s really scary about all this is that these are the people who are supposed to be protecting us from terrorists hell - bent on our destruction .
In which case God help us all .
One searches , in vain , through the released documents for a reason to believe that , even if Ivins was somehow connected to the anthrax attacks , he acted alone .
Which brings us to the scariest aspect of this entire affair : the real culprits are still out there .
I use the plural because it ’s clear , at least to me , that no one could have carried out this scheme to poison the U.S. mails alone .
Ivins , if he was involved , had to have help .
Yet our protectors , the FBI , seem indifferent to this strong possibility .
Their chief interest appears to be in protecting their own backsides , and what ’s left of their reputation .
This confirms , once again , my contention that the 9/11 terrorist attacks were of such unusual physical and psychic force that they tore a hole in the space - time continuum and allowed us to slip into an alternate universe known as Bizarro World , where everything is topsy - turvy : up is down , wrong is right , and the FBI is n’t concerned with solving crimes , but only in sweeping them under the rug .
NOTES IN THE MARGIN
As I noted above , the Algernon Syndrome  which inflicts a rapid dumbing - down on its victims  is pandemic , and it appears not to be limited to our law enforcement agencies .
It also seems to have taken its toll on the pundits .
Exhibit A : Andrew Sullivan , commenting on Glenn Greenwald ’s series of superb pieces on the anthrax case :
" Glenn reminds me that it was the anthrax attacks that took the post - 9/11 sense of threat to a whole new level  and moved the Iraq invasion forward as a possible response .
That we now think the threat was actually a domestic source with no connection with Islamism is a critical piece of historical adjustment . "
Speaking of " historical adjustment , " this seems like as good a time as any to remind Sullivan that he did more than his part in moving forward the idea that we ought to invade Iraq as a response to the anthrax attacks , and I quote :
" The sophisticated form of anthrax delivered to Tom Daschle ’s office forces us to ask a simple question .
What are these people trying to do ?
I think they ’re testing the waters .
They want to know how we will respond to what is still a minor biological threat , as a softener to a major biological threat in the coming weeks .
They must be encouraged by the panic - mongering of the tabloids , Hollywood and hoaxsters .
They must also be encouraged by the fact that some elements in the administration already seem to be saying we need to keep our coalition together rather than destroy the many - headed enemy .
So the terrorists are pondering their next move .
The chilling aspect of the news in the New York Times today is that the terrorists clearly have access to the kind of anthrax that could be used against large numbers of civilians .
My hopes yesterday that this was a minor attack seem absurdly naïve in retrospect .
So they are warning us and testing us .
At this point , it seems to me that a refusal to extend the war to Iraq is not even an option .
We have to extend it to Iraq .
It is by far the most likely source of this weapon ; it is clearly willing to use such weapons in the future ; and no war against terrorism of this kind can be won without dealing decisively with the Iraqi threat .
We no longer have any choice in the matter . "
Sullivan did n’t stop there , however .
Back then , you ’ll remember , he was railing against the " fifth column " on " both coasts " that was supposedly sympathetic to bin Laden , and he was pining  aching  for a " muscular " response , one that would deal a decisive blow to what he termed " Islamofascism " :
" Slowly , incrementally , a Rubicon has been crossed .
The terrorists have launched a biological weapon against the United States .
They have therefore made biological warfare thinkable and thus repeatable .
We once had a doctrine that such a Rubicon would be answered with a nuclear response .
We backed down on that threat in the Gulf War but Saddam did n’t dare use biological weapons then .
Someone has dared to use them now .
Our response must be as grave as this new threat . "
Sullivan did n’t just want to invade Iraq  he wanted to nuke the entire country .
On the basis , I might add , of exactly zero evidence that the Iraqis were behind the anthrax letters , the same level of evidence that the FBI , today , considers sufficient to convict Ivins of that crime .
Does Sullivan really believe no one remembers what he wrote , or is it that he  thoroughly immersed in his new role as war opponent and Obama supporter  no longer recalls his frothy - mouthed call to commit genocide in Iraq ?

In contrast to our other design awards , we decided to split the application award into categories .
It does n't make sense to judge small consumer apps that do a single thing together with huge enterprise applications that manipulate immense sets of convoluted data — such as the 4 million different bonds that traders manage through BondWorks .
Workflow applications that integrate many steps or coordinate several user roles have still different requirements , as do multi-platform apps that work across several devices .
Solving a big problem is more difficult than solving a small problem .
However , if your app does only one thing , it had better to it really , really well .
So , the criteria for polish are stricter for small applications than for enterprise applications .
With thousands of screens in some applications , they can't all be perfect , but the flow between screens and the ability to select the correct feature for any given situation must be great .
So , instead of comparing apples and oranges , we decided to judge each application style in relation to its peers and select the best designs in each category .
That we would ever classify a radiology application as " lightweight " defies the imagination , but it 's appropriate in the case of VitreaTeach because it focuses on one thing : allowing residents and experienced radiologists to manage images for learning purposes .
We might even call it the Pinterest of medical science .
But , of course , Pinterest itself would n't work for radiologists — partly because of the privacy concerns for any medical information and partly because of the benefits that domain - specific features provide .
For example , VitreaTeach both offers special access to cases from the user 's own hospital and knows something about anatomy and pathology .
Interestingly , one of the things that make the design cleaner than other medical systems is the simple tagging that provides much of the taxonomy support for the images .
Designers simplified tagging after user research found that full , formal anatomy and pathology taxonomy hierarchies added too much overhead .
Augmenting Human Capabilities
Software 's real goal should not be to simply process transactions in a system where users are nothing more than data operators who click required buttons to make things happen .
Rather , software should work to augment human capabilities , helping us to overcome weaknesses and emphasize our strengths .
A vital way for computers to help users is to direct their attention to a smaller number of important issues instead of overwhelming them with all possible options .
For example , BondWorks originally presented 85 attributes of tradable bonds on the search results screen .
However , search log analysis showed that nearly three quarters of users were searching on only 10 of the attributes , so the screen was redesigned to focus on those attributes .
OEConnection proactively takes the next step when a spare part is backordered from the manufacturer : the software automatically proceeds to search other dealers ' inventory for the desired part .
Traditionally , users would have had to issue each type of search separately from separate application areas .
But that 's exactly the approach that turns humans into robotic button - ushers ; better to turn the computer into a problem - solving tool that understands the domain and lets users expend their brainpower on higher - level issues .
As another example , the Highlight application 's basic feature is to make audio recordings searchable by letting users add a marker when something interesting occurs .
For real - world tasks — such as conducting interviews or sitting in a foreign - language class — users would n't actually know that " something interesting " was being recorded until after it happened .
To accommodate this common scenario , the application has an offset feature that automatically places the marker into the recording a certain number of seconds before the button is pushed .
Instant time travel .
More to the point , Highlight uses the computer 's flexibility to augment human skills by taking over the tedious job of rewinding the recording when users realize that something interesting should have been marked .
This reduces users ' cognitive load and frees them to concentrate on listening to the event they 're recording instead of attending to the device .
Another simple way Highlight augments human capabilities is in its ability to associate a picture with each recording .
This is particularly simple when doing interviews , where users can snap a photo of the interviewee with the same phone that 's recording the audio .
These photos come in handy later when retrieving recordings from long lists , because it 's often easier for our poor brains to associate an interview with the person 's photo instead of relying on a textual description .
We also saw a trend to focus screen real - estate allocations on the information that 's most important in the current context , while showing less UI chrome .
More content , less application overhead .
Some winning applications had special small control panels for direct access to important operations that would usually have required a switch in context .
This does n't quite equate to a modeless design , because complex applications do tend to have several distinct stages or areas of workflow and data .
But surfacing crucial features to live above the regular UI architecture is yet another way of empowering users to act on their insights instead of delaying them by the rigid demands of the way the application is structured .
Linear Workflow and Wizards
We want to empower users to be creative and accomplish advanced things with our software .
But we should also recognize that users sometimes just want to get their tasks done without having to explore numerous options and new ideas .
To speed users through infrequent or complicated tasks , it 's often good to present a linear workflow with minimal disruptions or alternatives .
Yes , the lack of flexibility can feel constraining , but it can be faster to just power through all the steps instead of having to ponder which steps are needed .
Also , the cost of too much freedom is that users have to decide the order of the steps — something that they 're often happy enough to delegate to the computer .
Wizards are the classic approach to linear workflows , and several winning applications include nicely designed wizards .
The Climate Action Planning
Tool uses the simpler approach of offering numbered steps to guide users .
An early design included a Before You Start step , but user studies showed that people ignored it .
In the final design , the Before activities appear under Step 1 : Gather Baseline Energy Consumption Data .
Users just want to get going , so you need to be somewhat heavy - handed if setup work is required before starting the real activity .
Wizards do n't work for everything .
In user testing , Eventbrite developers discovered problems with a wizard for creating new events in the system .
Because users ' mental models of setting up a new event did n't include all the necessary steps , they often dropped off and did n't complete the wizard .
So , the team decided instead to go with a 2 - step process in which users first entered all the information and then customized their pages .
When creating a linear workflow , take care not to signal to users that they can ignore subsequent steps — unless it 's true .
For example , after the first 6 steps , Eventbrite 's workflow was as follows :
Step 7 : Change the color scheme on the registration page .
Step 8 : Choose privacy settings .
It might have seemed logical to first fully create the thing that the privacy would apply to , and then to choose the privacy settings .
To some users , however , Step 7 signaled that all the " real " set - up was done and that the remaining steps would be frivolous decorating .
If they did n't care about the decor or were satisfied with the default colors , some people simply stopped at Step 7 and never got to the privacy options .
Living in an Ecosystem
A major trend among the winning applications is a modularized approach to the total user experience , with major features outsourced to other applications .
Designers accept that their product will live in an ecosystem of other applications ( and websites ) and that users will often prefer to do certain things elsewhere in that ecosystem .
Relying on other applications to perform work for your app is obviously not a new idea .
Having applications work together goes back at least to the pipes in Unix .
But we see this done more often now than in years past , when a more monolithic approach was common .
Unless you 're IBM or Google , you 'll never build a spreadsheet that rivals Excel .
Furthermore , most business users already own Excel and know how to use it .
Thus , instead of building spreadsheet - like features into your application , it might be better to find a smooth way to integrate with Excel through data export and import .
Many data - rich applications among our winners chose this course .
As another example , Wakelicious did n't implement a complete system for uploading and storing videos for internet playback .
Instead , it offers a simple integration with YouTube , which not only saved the team tremendous development effort but also gives users access to a pre-populated content library from which to choose wakeup calls to send their friends .
One caveat about relying on other software is that it 's often best to modify or simplify the user interfaces to fit the needs of your users ; because of its broader purview , 3rd - party software often embodies unneeded complexity that it 's best to hide .
eReview , for example , built on top of SharePoint but designed a more streamlined process than the one provided out - of - the - box .
Although it 's great to leverage existing applications and internet resources , applications must also provide their own value - add in their core domain .
This was most clearly shown by the Climate Action Planning Tool , which actually started out as a regular Excel spreadsheet that could perform the necessary calculations .
Developing it into a real application to guide facilities managers through the workflow — and explain and illustrate the complicated concepts involved in reducing CO2 — made the experience much more successful .
Super - Tooltips : Interaction Design Technique of the Year
In Application Design Showcase # 1 , we declared the lightbox to be the interaction design technique of the year .
This time , we saw improvements in a broad range of interaction techniques but no single new widget that was widely used .
Several applications , however , enhanced an old idea : the tooltip .
These " super " tooltips stretch far beyond their original intent and thus earned the spot as the year 's most improved interaction design technique .
Emerging in the 1990s , tooltips ( or " bubble help " ) started off by providing small explanatory texts that appeared as contextual help when the user pointed to a command button or other interface element .
The new super - tooltip is n't really a " tip , " but we 'll stick to this well - established name with its long history in GUI development .
A super - tooltip is actually an explanatory pop-up that appears as a rollover effect when users point to an item in the user interface .
This " item " might be a command or a button — as with traditional tooltips — but it can also be a user - created object , such as a message or product order .
The following screenshot shows a typical super - tooltip visual design :
In addition to static help text , super - tooltips usually contain dynamic status information about the object that users are pointing to .
This lets users see the information in the context of a larger overview screen , instead of having to click through to a separate screen with detailed object properties and editing options .
Super - tooltips are thus particularly suited to complex applications with many data objects that users must consider together .
The super - tooltip should n't include editing options ; it should be for information only , since it appears on hover and disappears when users move the mouse .
Users should also retain the option to click through to a specific screen that 's optimized for viewing and revising an object 's properties in greater detail .
The entire Dixio application could be viewed as an even more souped - up super - tooltip .
However , that would n't be entirely accurate because Dixio explanations appear when users double - tap ( or long - tap ) a word .
Thus , it 's not a rollover / hover effect and has to be explicitly dismissed .
Usability Methods
Most winners extensively employed a wide variety of usability methods , which is certainly one reason they ended up with such good user interfaces .
Iterative design and user testing were particularly common and frequently used to grind down complexity relative to early design ideas that seemed good but proved too difficult .
Another common trend was the steady reduction in documentation and help text throughout the iterations , as user testing repeatedly revealed the old lesson that users do n't read very much .
Simple user testing with a handful of users can often substantially improve product success , and was used by 85 % of the winning projects .
For example , an early design for the Mobile Unified Communication client used the command Add Call for placing a new phone call while putting the current party on hold .
Although this seems logical enough , it was confusing to users who thought the command was for conference calls .
Changing the command label to New Line did the trick .
One - third of the winners used field studies ( also known as ethnography ) , venturing onsite to observe users ' natural behaviors in their own environments .
From BondWorks sitting with brokers as they made deals , to OEConnection hanging out in dealership parts departments , to VitreaTeach watching radiologists at hospitals , domain - specific applications require domain - specific user research .
Although it seems obvious that domain - specific applications need field studies , most design projects in the past typically did without them .
When we analyzed the first decade of Intranet Design Annual winners , we found that field studies were used by only 10 % of the winners from 2001 –2003 and just 23 % of winners from 2007 –2009 .
Although this represented more than a doubling within a single decade , it 's still sad that less than a quarter of good intranet teams ran field studies at decade 's end .
Going from a quarter of projects to a third in a few years shows continued progress for this important method .
In addition to field studies , we also saw substantial growth in a usability method that was often overlooked in the past : sitting in on support calls .
Knowing why customers call with problems is a prime way to discover pain points — as long as you recognize that a customer 's description of the problem might be far afield from the underlying root cause that the redesign must address .

Explanation : The Moon 's measured diameter is around 3,476 kilometers ( 2,160 miles ) .
But apparent angular size , or the angle covered by an object , can also be important to Moon enthusiasts .
Angular size depends on distance , the farther away an object is , the smaller an angle it covers .
Since the Moon is 400,000 kilometers away , its angular size is only about 1 / 2 degree , a span easily covered by the tip of your finger held at arms length , or a measuring tape held in the distance by a friend .
Of course the Sun is much larger than the Moon , 400 times larger in fact , but today the New Moon will just cover the Sun .
The total solar eclipse can be seen along a track across northern Canada , the Arctic , Siberia , and northern China .
( A partial eclipse is visible from a broader region ) .
Solar eclipses illustrate the happy coincidence that while the Sun is 400 times the diameter of the Moon , it is also 400 times farther away giving the Sun and Moon exactly the same angular size .

Are Hillary Supporters Going to Launch a Coup ?
Rumors have been surfacing about the possibility of Hillary and her minions staging a coup at the Democratic Convention .
Could this happen ?
Yes it can !
One can only hope .
Despite Senator Obama ’s best efforts , many Hillary supporters are still quite angry at the DNC and Obama for “ stealing ” the Caucuses and buying off the super delegates .
Do they have a point ?
Yes , I would say so considering that Hillary won more votes .
Moreover , the controversy over Florida and Michigan made it quite clear that the Obama Campaign was only interested in ensuring the sanctity of every vote insofar as it benefited Obama .
Moroever , let us not forget the misogynistic undertones of many of the attacks on Hillary that emanated from Obama ’s supporters .
Indeed , who can forget Obama ’s dismissal of a female reporter as “ sweetie ? ”
How angry are some of Hillary ’s foot soldiers ?
Take a look at this YouTube video :

And for good measure , the pissed off Hillary voter :
[ youtube ] http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KACQuZVAE3s[/youtube]
So what do these Hillary fanatics expect to achieve in Denver if they cause a ruckus ?
Do they really think that they can prevent Obama from receiving the nomination ?
I would wager that they are not so deluded as to think that by some miracle they can convince the supers to vote for Hillary .
What they do mean to achieve is illustrating that Obama may be doomed to defeat and that Hillary in no way should be linked to that potential defeat .
If Obama loses in November it would leave Hillary as the undisputed master of the Democratic Party .
Harvard Illinois , located only a half hour or so from where I live , is home to very large white elephant .
Please consider the story of the White Elephant of Harvard .
When the sun sets in Harvard , the lights inside the empty Motorola plant power up and a bright glow arches across the sky in this small farm town .
The massive campus — the size of 350 football fields , with a 1.5 - million - square - foot building of shimmering glass and steel — demands to be noticed .
Not that anyone in town could forget it .
The $ 100 million cellular - phone plant promised to turn Harvard , a city of 9,000 about 70 miles northwest of Chicago , into a boom town .
When the facility shut down in 2003 , just five years after its opening , the McHenry County community was indeed changed , but not as expected .
The plant , with four connected buildings , two day - care centers , a cafeteria large enough to seat 1,100 , an auditorium and miles of biking and walking trails , is on the market for $ 18 million to $ 22 million .

WED . , JUL 16 , 2008 General Motors Corp. said Tuesday it will lay off salaried workers , cut truck production , suspend its dividend and borrow $ 2 billion to $ 3 billion to weather a severe downturn in the U.S. market .
GM said the moves will raise $ 15 billion to help cover losses and turn around its North American operations , including $ 10 billion from internal cost- cutting and $ 5 billion from selling some assets and borrowing against others .
" In short , our plan is not a plan to survive .
It is a plan to win , " GM Chairman and CEO Rick Wagoner said in a broadcast to employees .
Dead Malls
The 800,000 square - foot mall was shuttered in September , 1979 .
It has been left standing since .
Abandoned .
I cautiously walked inside the gaping hole where the doors once were , and to my amazement there were still labels and decor on the walls from the anchor ( presumably Sears ) when it was open in the 1970s .
This was like a living time capsule .
" Curtains " and a brand name was written on one wall , and above all exits was printed " Thank you ... Please come again ... "
I would have gone in further , as the actual mall part was accessible through here , however , the mold was obnoxious .
The mold smell was so strong it made me dizzy and gave me a strong headache , so I went out .
I started walking down the outside of the anchor to find more entrances like this to take more pictures , and I saw them .
Dogs .
There were two Dobermans about 100 feet ahead of me in the way that I was walking .
They were walking , also , and had not noticed me .
Immediately I turned around and made a break for my car , which was 50 feet or so away .
The dogs had noticed me running and came quickly , but I was way too far ahead of them and in my car by the time they were even halfway so they turned around and went inside the mall .
This disappointed me , because at this point I was not afraid of any people I would encounter .
However , dogs are a different story .
They are completely unpredictable and unreasonable .
After this I took my car around the mall and got out only to take pictures and go right back in , for fear the dogs may be nearby .
At some points they were , but mostly they did their own thing .
Also , I found out that the gaping holes at that anchor that was presumably Sears were to be found ALL over the mall .
The entire mall was open .
Mall entrances , anchor doors , even service entrances and the boiler area were all completely open .
I walked in some doorways but only to take pictures and leave .
I would have gone in further to explore , but it just did n't seem safe .
I drove around the perimeter of the mall this past Sunday ( 18th May 2008 ) .
It basically looks the same as in your pictures : horrible , rotting , depressing , but a very intriguing place nonetheless .
There appears to be a chainlink fence surrounding the entire property .
But if you wanted to get inside , I doubt anything ( or anyone ) would really stop you .
I would never , ever , attempt to gain entry by myself .
Maybe if I had some friends along ( and some decent weaponry ) , it would be cool .
The Harvey Police Dept is situated very close to the mall .
Maybe you could get permission from them , though I doubt they would explicitly allow it .
I come from a rather sheltered upbringing , so it surprises me that there are places in the US that are allowed to look like this .
It is a truly disgusting display of neglect and apathy .
Much of the resources online are dedicated to ‘ what happened ’ but few delve into ‘ why ’ - I think an understanding of the events that caused Dixie Square ’s failure is as interesting as the downfall of the mall itself .
Probably more important than anything else is urban sprawl , which both created and destroyed Dixie Square as well as Harvey as viable places to live and shop .
So what ’s driving urban sprawl ?
It has to be more than just the economy .
And it is .
There are also other considerations , such as the notion of white flight .
The issues of who is moving where also drives what happens with urban spaces .
As urban sprawl pushed development farther and farther out , the land value in places like Harvey plummeted .
As this happened , the ( predominantly ) African - Americans living in poor conditions ( caused by urban sprawl ) on the south side of Chicago moved into Harvey and surrounding areas .
Because of this , the remaining whites in Harvey also left .
Land values plummeted even more , crime rates rose , and more people left .
People began to shop at newer , bigger malls in newer suburbs like Woodfield Mall in Schaumburg , or Orland Square in Orland Park .
This feedback negative cycle makes places like Harvey worse and worse , while constantly investing in things that are shiny - and - new .
No one wins except for greedy developers and the brand new suburb - du - jour , and places like Dixie Square become the retail equivalent of a fossil record , indicating poor decisions in urban planning .
More factoids on Harvey and the Dixie Mall
In 1960 Harvey was almost entirely white .
By 1980 it was over 90 % black .
In 1979 the mall was used during the chase scene in the Blues Brothers movie .
In 1993 a young woman was raped and murdered in the abandoned JCPenney store .

More than 90 percent of American wine production occurs on the West Coast , but because the majority of consumers live east of the Mississippi , a large part of carbon - dioxide emissions associated with wine comes from simply trucking it from the vineyard to tables on the East Coast .
A standard wine bottle holds 750 milliliters of wine and generates about 5.2 pounds of carbon - dioxide emissions when it travels from a vineyard in California to a store in New York .
A 3 - liter box generates about half the emissions per 750 milliliters .
Switching to wine in a box for the 97 percent of wines that are made to be consumed within a year would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by about two million tons , or the equivalent of retiring 400,000 cars .

But here ’s another reason to sell wine in a box .
America will soon become the largest wine market in the world .
In recent years , we overtook Italy , and France is now in our sights .
( This is total consumption , not per person ; we are still well behind by the latter measure . )
As Americans drink more wine , we will be drinking it not only on special occasions like dates and weddings , but also on Monday nights with pizza .
That ’s a lot of wine  and potentially a big carbon footprint .
Although some sommeliers may scoff at wine from a plastic spigot , boxes are perfect for table wines that do n’t need to age , which is to say , all but a relative handful of the top wines from around the world .
What ’s more , boxed wine is superior to glass bottle storage in resolving that age - old problem of not being able to finish a bottle in one sitting .
Once open , a box preserves wine for about four weeks compared with only a day or two for a bottle .
Boxed wine may be short on charm , but it is long on practicality .
Which leads to a final reason for boxed wine : it ’s so much more economical .
Having an affordable glass of wine may be the best way to keep our 15 - year bull market for wine consumption running .
It also would help keep per-glass prices of wine from rising as the dollar falls .
The main obstacle to a smaller carbon footprint for wine is the frequently abysmal quality of wine put in boxes .
But that ’s an easy fix : raise the quality .

" Whether one believes in a religion or not , and whether one believes in rebirth or not , there is n't anyone who does n't appreciate kindness and compassion . " --
His Holiness the Dalai Lama , from " Kindness , Clarity , and Insight " by Snow Lion Publications .
" In the present circumstances , no one can afford to assume that someone else
will solve their problems .
Every individual has a responsibility to help guide our global family in the right direction .
Good wishes are not sufficient ; we must become actively engaged . " --
His Holiness the Dalai Lama , from " The Path to Tranquility : Daily Wisdom " , available from Snow Lion Publications .
" Human beings by nature want happiness and do not want suffering .
With that
feeling everyone tries to achieve happiness and tries to get rid of suffering , and everyone has the basic right to do this .
In this way , all here are the same , whether rich or poor , educated or uneducated , Easterner or Westerner , believer or non-believer , and within believers whether Buddhist , Christian , Jewish , Muslim , and so on .
Basically , from the viewpoint of real human value we are all the same . " --
His Holiness the Dalai Lama , from " Kindness , Clarity , and Insight . "
" When receiving the teachings , it is important to have the correct attitude .
It is not practicing the Dharma properly to listen with the intention of gaining material advantage or reputation .
Neither should our goal be higher rebirth in the next life , nor should we be wishing only for our own liberation from samsara .
These are all attitudes we should reject .
Instead , let us listen to the teachings with the determined wish to attain the state of omniscience for the sake of all beings . " --
His Holiness the Dalai Lama from " The Path to Tranquility : Daily Wisdom " , available from Snow Lion Publications .
" Self - discipline , although difficult , and not always easy while combating
negative emotions , should be a defensive measure .
At least we will be able to prevent the advent of negative conduct dominated by negative emotion .
That is ' shila ' , or moral ethics .
Once we develop this by familiarizing ourselves with it , along with mindfulness and conscientiousness , eventually that pattern and way of life will become a part of our own life . " --
His Holiness the Dalai Lama , from " Live in a Better Way : Reflections on Truth , Love and Happiness " , available from Snow Lion Publications .
" It is our custom to say that someone is " lucky " or " unlucky " if they meet with fortunate or unfortunate circumstances , respectively .
It is however , too simplistic to think in terms of random " luck . "
Even from a scientific point of view , this is not a sufficient explanation .
Should something unfortunate happen , we immediately think , " Oh , how unlucky ! "
And yet this is not sufficient to explain what happened - there must be a cause .
We seem to cal " luck " that factor which overrides external conditions to bring about a positive situation .
But that too is a cause ; it is an inner cause , which we call " merit . " --
His Holiness the Dalai Lama , from " Answers : Discussions with Western Buddhists " , published from Snow Lion Publications .
" With a selfish attitude , oneself is important , and others are not so important .
According to Shantideva 's advice , a technique to help in turning this attitude around is to imagine - in front of yourself as an unbiased observer - your own selfish self on one side and a limited number of other beings on the other side - ten , fifty , or a hundred .
On one side is your proud , selfish self , and on the other side is a group of poor , needy people .
You are , in effect , in the middle - as an unbiased , third person .
Now , judge .
Is this one , single , selfish person more important ?
Or is the group of people more important ?
Think .
Will you join this side or that side ?
Naturally , if you are a real human being , your heart will go with the group because the number is greater and they are more needy .
The other one is just a single person , proud and stupid .
Your feeling naturally goes with the group .
By thinking in this way , selfishness gradually decreases ,
and respect of others grows .
This is is the way to practice . "
" If there is love , there is hope to have real families , real brotherhood , real equanimity , real peace .
If the love within your mind is lost , if you continue to see other beings as enemies , then no matter how much knowledge or education you have , no matter how much material progress is made , only suffering and confusion will ensue .
" Human beings will continue to deceive and overpower one another .
Basically ,
everyone exists in the very nature of suffering , so to abuse or mistreat each
other is futile .
The foundation of all spiritual practice is love .
That you
practice this well is my only request . " --
His Holiness the Dalai Lama , from " The Path to Tranquility : Daily Wisdom . "
" Love and kindness are the very basis of society .
If we lose these feelings ,
society will face tremendous difficulties ; the survival of humanity will be
endangered . " --
His Holiness the Dalai Lama , from " The Dalai Lama , A Policy of
Kindness " , published by Snow Lion Publications .
" No religion basically believes that material progress alone is sufficient for humankind .
All religions believe in forces beyond material progress .
All agree that it is very important and worthwhile to make a strong effort to serve human society .
" To do this , it is important that we understand each other .
In the past , due to narrow - mindedness and other factors , there has sometimes been discord between religious groups .
This should not happen again .
If we look deeply into the value of a religion in the context of the worldwide situation , we can easily transcend these unfortunate happenings .
For , there are many areas of common ground on which we can have harmony .
Let us just be side by side - helping , respecting , and understanding each other - in common effort to serve humankind .
The aim of human society must be the compassionate betterment of human beings . " --
His Holiness the Dalai Lama , from " Kindness , Clarity , and Insight " , published by Snow Lion Publications .
" We find that if a person lives a very selfish life and is never concerned about the welfare of others , he will have few friends , and people will not take much notice of him .
At the time of his death , there will not be many people who will regret his passing .
Some deceptive and negative persons may be very powerful and wealthy , and therefore some people - for economic reasons and so forth - might portray themselves as friends , but they will speak against such person behind their back .
When these negative person die , these very same " friends " may rejoice at their death .
" On the other hand , many people mourn and regret the death of a person who is
very kind and always altruistic and who works for the benefit of others .
We
find that altruism , as well as the person who possesses it , is regarded as the friend of all , and it becomes the object of veneration and respect by others . " --
His Holiness the Dalai Lama , from " Path to Bliss : A Practical Guide to Stages of Meditation " , published by Snow Lion Publications .
" Before we can generate compassion and love , it is important to have a clear
understanding of what we understand compassion and love to be .
In simple terms , compassion and love can be defined as positive thoughts and feelings that give rise to such essential things in life as hope , courage , determination , and inner strength .
In the Buddhist tradition , compassion and love are seen as two aspects of the same thing : Compassion is the wish for another being to be free from suffering ; love is wanting them to have happiness . " --
His Holiness the Dalai Lama , from " The Compassionate Life " , available from Snow Lion Publications .
" With the realization of ones own potential and self - confidence in ones ability , one can build a better world .
According to my own experience , self - confidence is very important .
That sort of confidence is not a blind one ; it is an awareness of ones own potential .
On that basis , human beings can transform themselves by increasing the good qualities and reducing the negative qualities . " --
His Holiness the Dalai Lama , from ' The Dalai Lama 's Book of Wisdom '
" I find that because of modern technological evolution and our global
economy , and as a result of the great increase in population , our world has
greatly changed : it has become much smaller .
However , our perceptions have not evolved at the same pace ; we continue to cling to old national demarcations and the old feelings of ' us ' and ' them ' .
" War seems to be part of the history of humanity .
As we look at the situation of our planet in the past , countries , regions and even villages were economically independent of one another .
Under those circumstances , the destruction of our enemy might have been a victory for us .
There was a a relevance to violence and war .
However , today we are so interdependent that the concept of war has become out dated .
When we face problems or disagreements today , we have to arrive at solutions through dialogue .
Dialogue is the only appropriate method .
One - sided victory is no longer relevant .
We must work to resolve conflicts in a spirit of reconciliation and always keep in mind the interests of others .
We can not destroy our neighbors !
We can not ignore their interests !
Doing so would ultimately cause us to suffer .
I therefore think that the concept of violence is now unsuitable .
Nonviolence is the appropriate method . " --
His Holiness the Dalai Lama , from ' An Open Heart : Practicing Compassion in Everyday Life ' , available from Snow Lion Publications .
" The mind 's own basic nature is ultimately neutral .
It can be influenced by
negative as well as by positive emotions .
Take , for instance , those who have a short tempter .
When I was young I was quite short - tempered .
However , the mood never lasted for twenty - four hours .
If negative emotions are in the very nature of our mind , then as long as the mind is functioning the anger must remain .
That , however is not the case .
Similarly , positive emotions are also not in the nature of the mind .
The mind is something neutral , reflecting all sorts of different experiences or phenomena . " --
His Holiness the Dalai Lama , from ' Live in a Better Way : Reflections on Truth , Love and Happiness ' , available from Snow Lion Publications .
" Sometimes we feel that one individual 's action is very insignificant .
Then we think , of course , that effects should come from channeling or from a unifying movement .
But the movement of the society , community or group of people means joining individuals .
Society means a collection of individuals , so that initiative must come from individuals .
Unless each individual develops a sense of responsibility , the whole community cannot move .
So therefore , it is very essential that we should not feel that individual effort is meaningless - you should not feel that way .
We should make an effort . " --
His Holiness the Dalai Lama , from ' The Dalai Lama 's Book of Love and Compassion ' , available from Snow Lion Publications .
" According to Buddhism , there is a commensurate relationship between cause and effect where pain and pleasure are concerned .
The immediate cause is karma .
Karma means action .
Tomorrow 's events depend very much on today 's actions , this year 's events on last year 's , while this century 's events are linked with those of the previous centuries .
The actions of previous generations affect the lives of the generations that follow .
This is also a kin of karma .
However , there is a difference between actions carried out by a group of people or sentient beings jointly , and actions carried out by single person .
In individual cases , the actions of the earlier part of one 's life have an effect on the latter part of one 's life . " --
His Holiness the Dalai Lama , from ' Live in a Better Way : Reflections on Truth , Love and Happiness ' , available from Snow Lion publications .
" Our practice of the Dharma should be a continual effort to attain a state
beyond suffering .
It should not simply be a moral activity whereby we avoid
negative ways and engage in positive ones .
In our practice of the Dharma , we
seek to transcend the situation in which we all find ourselves : victims of our own mental afflictions - such as attachment , hatred , pride , greed , and so forth - are mental states that cause us to behave in ways that bring about all of our unhappiness and suffering .
While working to achieve inner peace and happiness , it is helpful to think of them as our inner demons , for like demons , they can haunt us , causing nothing but misery .
That state beyond such negative emotions and thoughts , beyond all sorrow , is called nirvana . " --
His Holiness the Dalai Lama , from ' An Open Heart : Practicing Compassion in Everyday Life " , available from Snow Lion Publications .
" An affectionate disposition not only makes the mind more peaceful
and calm , but it affects our body in a positive way too .
On the
other hand , hatred , jealousy and fear upset our peace of mind , make
us agitated and affect our body adversely .
Even our body needs peace
of mind and is not suited to agitation .
This shows that an
appreciation for peace of mind is in our blood . "
" Just as we should cultivate more gentle and peaceful relations with
our fellow human beings , we should also extend that same kind of
attitude towards the natural environment .
Morally speaking , we
should be concerned for our whole environment .
" This , however , is not just a question of morality or ethics , but
also a question of our own survival .
For this generation and for
future generations , the environment is very important .
If we exploit
the environment in extreme ways , we may receive some benefit today ,
but in the long run , we will suffer , as will our future generations .
When the environment changes , the climatic condition also changes .
When the climate changes dramatically , the economy and many other
things change .
Our physical health will be greatly affected .
Again ,
conservation is not merely a question of morality , but a question of
our own survival . " --
His Holiness the Dalai Lama , from ' The Dalai
Lama , A Policy of Kindness ' , published by Snow Lion Publications .
" Meditation is a ' familiarization ' of the mind with an object of
meditation .
In terms of how the mind is familiarized with the
object , there are many types of meditation .
In one type , the mind is
generated into the entity of a particular type of consciousness , as
in meditating compassion or meditating wisdom .
In such meditation
you are seeking to generate your own mind into a compassionate
consciousness or a wisdom consciousness - compassion and wisdom not
being the object on which you are meditating , but that entity into
which you are seeking to transform your consciousness through a
process of familiarization . " --

You are , in effect , in the middle - as an unbiased , third person .
Now , judge .
Is this one , single , selfish person more important ?
Or is the group of people more important ?
Think .
Will you join this side or that side ?
Naturally , if you are a real human being , your heart will go with the group because the number is greater and they are more needy .
The other one is just a single person , proud and stupid .
Your feeling naturally goes with the group .
By thinking in this way , selfishness gradually decreases ,
and respect of others grows .
This is is the way to practice . "
" If there is love , there is hope to have real families , real brotherhood , real equanimity , real peace .
If the love within your mind is lost , if you continue to see other beings as enemies , then no matter how much knowledge or education you have , no matter how much material progress is made , only suffering and confusion will ensue .
" Human beings will continue to deceive and overpower one another .
Basically ,
everyone exists in the very nature of suffering , so to abuse or mistreat each
other is futile .
The foundation of all spiritual practice is love .
That you
practice this well is my only request . " --
His Holiness the Dalai Lama , from " The Path to Tranquility : Daily Wisdom . "
" Love and kindness are the very basis of society .
If we lose these feelings ,
society will face tremendous difficulties ; the survival of humanity will be
endangered . " --
His Holiness the Dalai Lama , from " The Dalai Lama , A Policy of
Kindness " , published by Snow Lion Publications .
" No religion basically believes that material progress alone is sufficient for humankind .
All religions believe in forces beyond material progress .
All agree that it is very important and worthwhile to make a strong effort to serve human society .
" To do this , it is important that we understand each other .
In the past , due to narrow - mindedness and other factors , there has sometimes been discord between religious groups .
This should not happen again .
If we look deeply into the value of a religion in the context of the worldwide situation , we can easily transcend these unfortunate happenings .
For , there are many areas of common ground on which we can have harmony .
Let us just be side by side - helping , respecting , and understanding each other - in common effort to serve humankind .
The aim of human society must be the compassionate betterment of human beings . "
-- His Holiness the Dalai Lama , from " Kindness , Clarity , and Insight " , published by Snow Lion Publications .
" We find that if a person lives a very selfish life and is never concerned about the welfare of others , he will have few friends , and people will not take much notice of him .
At the time of his death , there will not be many people who will regret his passing .
Some deceptive and negative persons may be very powerful and wealthy , and therefore some people - for economic reasons and so forth - might portray themselves as friends , but they will speak against such person behind their back .
When these negative person die , these very same " friends " may rejoice at their death .
" On the other hand , many people mourn and regret the death of a person who is
very kind and always altruistic and who works for the benefit of others .
We
find that altruism , as well as the person who possesses it , is regarded as the friend of all , and it becomes the object of veneration and respect by others . "
-- His Holiness the Dalai Lama , from " Path to Bliss : A Practical Guide to Stages of Meditation " , published by Snow Lion Publications .
" Before we can generate compassion and love , it is important to have a clear
understanding of what we understand compassion and love to be .
In simple terms , compassion and love can be defined as positive thoughts and feelings that give rise to such essential things in life as hope , courage , determination , and inner strength .
In the Buddhist tradition , compassion and love are seen as two aspects of the same thing : Compassion is the wish for another being to be free from suffering ; love is wanting them to have happiness . " - - His Holiness the Dalai Lama , from " The Compassionate Life " , available from Snow Lion Publications .
" With the realization of ones own potential and self - confidence in ones ability , one can build a better world .
According to my own experience , self - confidence is very important .
That sort of confidence is not a blind one ; it is an awareness of ones own potential .
On that basis , human beings can transform themselves by increasing the good qualities and reducing the negative qualities . "
-- His Holiness the Dalai Lama , from ' The Dalai Lama 's Book of Wisdom ' .
" I find that because of modern technological evolution and our global
economy , and as a result of the great increase in population , our world has
greatly changed : it has become much smaller .
However , our perceptions have not evolved at the same pace ; we continue to cling to old national demarcations and the old feelings of ' us ' and ' them ' .
" War seems to be part of the history of humanity .
As we look at the situation of our planet in the past , countries , regions and even villages were economically independent of one another .
Under those circumstances , the destruction of our enemy might have been a victory for us .
There was a a relevance to violence and war .
However , today we are so interdependent that the concept of war has become out dated .
When we face problems or disagreements today , we have to arrive at solutions through dialogue .
Dialogue is the only appropriate method .
One - sided victory is no longer relevant .
We must work to resolve conflicts in a spirit of reconciliation and always keep in mind the interests of others .
We can not destroy our neighbors !
We can not ignore their interests !
Doing so would ultimately cause us to suffer .
I therefore think that the concept of violence is now unsuitable .
Nonviolence is the appropriate method . " --
His Holiness the Dalai Lama , from ' An Open Heart : Practicing Compassion in Everyday Life ' , available from Snow Lion Publications .
" The mind 's own basic nature is ultimately neutral .
It can be influenced by
negative as well as by positive emotions .
Take , for instance , those who have a short tempter .
When I was young I was quite short - tempered .
However , the mood never lasted for twenty - four hours .
If negative emotions are in the very nature of our mind , then as long as the mind is functioning the anger must remain .
That , however is not the case .
Similarly , positive emotions are also not in the nature of the mind .
The mind is something neutral , reflecting all sorts of different experiences or phenomena . " --
His Holiness the Dalai Lama , from ' Live in a Better Way : Reflections on Truth , Love and Happiness ' , available from Snow Lion Publications .
" Sometimes we feel that one individual 's action is very insignificant .
Then we think , of course , that effects should come from channeling or from a unifying movement .
But the movement of the society , community or group of people means joining individuals .
Society means a collection of individuals , so that initiative must come from individuals .
Unless each individual develops a sense of responsibility , the whole community cannot move .
So therefore , it is very essential that we should not feel that individual effort is meaningless - you should not feel that way .
We should make an effort . " --
His Holiness the Dalai Lama , from ' The Dalai Lama 's Book of Love and Compassion ' , available from Snow Lion Publications .
" According to Buddhism , there is a commensurate relationship between cause and effect where pain and pleasure are concerned .
The immediate cause is karma .
Karma means action .
Tomorrow 's events depend very much on today 's actions , this year 's events on last year 's , while this century 's events are linked with those of the previous centuries .
The actions of previous generations affect the lives of the generations that follow .
This is also a kin of karma .
However , there is a difference between actions carried out by a group of people or sentient beings jointly , and actions carried out by single person .
In individual cases , the actions of the earlier part of one 's life have an effect on the latter part of one 's life .
--
His Holiness the Dalai Lama , from ' Live in a Better Way : Reflections on Truth , Love and Happiness ' , available from Snow Lion publications .
" Our practice of the Dharma should be a continual effort to attain a state
beyond suffering .
It should not simply be a moral activity whereby we avoid
negative ways and engage in positive ones .
In our practice of the Dharma , we
seek to transcend the situation in which we all find ourselves : victims of our own mental afflictions - such as attachment , hatred , pride , greed , and so forth - are mental states that cause us to behave in ways that bring about all of our unhappiness and suffering .
While working to achieve inner peace and happiness , it is helpful to think of them as our inner demons , for like demons , they can haunt us , causing nothing but misery .
That state beyond such negative emotions and thoughts , beyond all sorrow , is called nirvana . " - His Holiness the Dalai Lama , from ' An Open Heart : Practicing Compassion in Everyday Life " , available from Snow Lion Publications .
" An affectionate disposition not only makes the mind more peaceful
and calm , but it affects our body in a positive way too .
On the
other hand , hatred , jealousy and fear upset our peace of mind , make
us agitated and affect our body adversely .
Even our body needs peace
of mind and is not suited to agitation .
This shows that an
appreciation for peace of mind is in our blood . "
" Just as we should cultivate more gentle and peaceful relations with
our fellow human beings , we should also extend that same kind of
attitude towards the natural environment .
Morally speaking , we
should be concerned for our whole environment .
" This , however , is not just a question of morality or ethics , but
also a question of our own survival .
For this generation and for
future generations , the environment is very important .
If we exploit
the environment in extreme ways , we may receive some benefit today ,
but in the long run , we will suffer , as will our future generations .
When the environment changes , the climatic condition also changes .
When the climate changes dramatically , the economy and many other
things change .
Our physical health will be greatly affected .
Again ,
conservation is not merely a question of morality , but a question of
our own survival . " --
His Holiness the Dalai Lama , from ' The Dalai
Lama , A Policy of Kindness ' , published by Snow Lion Publications .
" Meditation is a ' familiarization ' of the mind with an object of
meditation .
In terms of how the mind is familiarized with the
object , there are many types of meditation .
In one type , the mind is
generated into the entity of a particular type of consciousness , as
in meditating compassion or meditating wisdom .
In such meditation
you are seeking to generate your own mind into a compassionate
consciousness or a wisdom consciousness - compassion and wisdom not
being the object on which you are meditating , but that entity into
which you are seeking to transform your consciousness through a
process of familiarization . " --
His Holiness the Dalai Lama , from ' Kindness ,
Clarity , and Insight ' , published by Snow Lion Publications .
" Three qualities enable people to understand the teachings : objectivity , which means an open mind ; intelligence , which is the critical faculty to discern the real meaning by checking the teachings of Buddha ; and interest and commitment , which means enthusiasm . " --
His Holiness the Dalai Lama , from ' The Path to Tranquility : Daily Wisdom ' .
" There are two types of prayer .
I think prayer is , for the most
part , simply reminders in your daily practice .
So , the verses look
like prayers , but are actually reminders of how to speak , how to deal
with other problems , other people , things like that in daily life .
For example , in my own daily practice , prayer , if I am leisurely ,
takes about four hours .
Quite long .
For the most part , I think my
practice is reviewing : compassion , forgiveness , and , of course ,
shunyata .
Then , in my case , the tantric practices including
visualization of death and rebirth .
In my daily practice , the deity
mandala , deity yoga , and the visualization of death , rebirth , and
intermediate state is done eight times .
So , eight times death is
eight times rebirth .
I am supposed to be preparing for my death .
When actual death comes , whether I will succeed or not , still , I
do n't know .
" Then , some portion of prayer is to appeal to Buddha .
Although we do
not consider Buddha as a Creator , at the same time we consider Buddha
as a higher being who purified himself .
So he has special energy ,
infinite energy or power .
In certain ways , then , in this type of
prayer , the appeal to Buddha can be seen as similar to the appeal to
God as the Creator . " --
His Holiness the Dalai Lama , from ' Healing
Anger : The Power of Patience from a Buddhist Perspective ' , published
by Snow Lion Publications .
" I think that every human being has an innate sense of " I " .
We
cannot explain why that feeling is there , but it is .
Along with it
comes a desire for happiness and a wish to overcome suffering .
This
is quite justified : we have a natural right to achieve as much
happiness as possible , and we also have the right to overcome
suffering .
" The whole of human history has developed on the basis of this
feeling .
In fact it is not limited to human beings ; from the
Buddhist point of view , even the tiniest insect has this feeling and ,
according to its capacity , is trying to gain some happiness and avoid
unhappy situations . "
" We are born and reborn countless number of times , and it is possible
that each being has been our parent at one time or another .
Therefore , it is likely that all beings in this universe have
familial connections . " --
His Holiness the Dalai Lama , from ' The Path
to Tranquility : Daily Wisdom " .
" Buddhism does not accept a theory of God , or a creator .
According
to Buddhism , one 's own actions are the creator , ultimately .
Some
people say that , from a certain angle , Buddhism is not a religion but
rather a science of mind .
Religion has much involvement with faith .
Sometimes it seems that there is quite a distance between a way of
thinking based on faith and one entirely based on experiment ,
remaining skeptical .
Unless you find something through
investigation , you do not want to accept it as fact .
From one
viewpoint , Buddhism is a religion , from another viewpoint Buddhism is
a science of mind and not a religion .
Buddhism can be a bridge
between these two sides .
Therefore , with this conviction I try to
have closer ties with scientists , mainly in the fields of cosmology ,
psychology , neurobiology and physics .
In these fields there are
insights to share , and to a certain extent we can work together . " --
His Holiness the Dalai Lama , from " The Dalai Lama : A Policy of
Kindness " , published by Snow Lion Publications .
" As we analyze our mental experiences , we recognize that the powerful emotions we possess ( such as desire , hatred , and anger ) tend not to bring us very profound or long - lasting happiness .
Fulfilled desire may provide a sense of temporary satisfaction ; however , the pleasure we experience upon acquiring a new car or home , for example , is usually short - lived .
When we indulge our desires , they tend to increase in intensity and multiply in number .
We become more demanding and less content , finding it more difficult to satisfy our needs .
In the Buddhist view , hatred , anger , and desire are afflictive emotions , which simply means they tend to cause us discomfort .
The discomfort arises from the mental unease that follows the expression of these emotions .
A constant state of mental unsettledness can even cause us physical harm . " --
His Holiness the Dalai Lama , from An Open Heart : Practicing Compassion in Everyday Life , available from Snow Lion Publications .
" THE UNUSUAL ATTITUDE
Your cultivation of love and great compassion should not be left in a
state of mere imagination or wish alone ; rather , a sense of
responsibility , a genuine intention to engage in the task of
relieving sentient beings of their sufferings and providing them with
happiness , should be developed .
It is important for a practitioner
to work for and take upon himself or herself the responsibility of
fulfilling this intention .
The stronger your cultivation of
compassion is , the more committed you will feel to taking this
responsibility .
Because of their ignorance , sentient beings do not
know the right methods by which they can fulfill their aims .
It is
the responsibility of those who are equipped with this knowledge to
fulfill the intention of working for their benefit . " --
His Holiness
the Dalai Lama , from Path to Bliss : A Practical Guide to Stages of
Meditation , published by Snow Lion Publications .
" We often speak of the external enemy .
For example , in my own case ,
our Chinese brothers and sisters are destroying Tibetan rights and ,
in that way , more suffering and anxiety develops .
But no matter how
forceful this is , it cannot destroy the supreme source of my
happiness , which is my calmness of mind .
This is something an
external enemy cannot destroy .
Our country can be invaded , our
possessions can be destroyed , our friends can be killed , but these
are secondary for our mental happiness .
The ultimate source of my
mental happiness is my peace of mind .
Nothing can destroy this
except my own anger . " --
His Holiness the Dalai Lama , from ' The Dalai
Lama 's Book of Wisdom ' , available from Snow Lion Publications .
" As far as your personal requirements are concerned , the ideal is to
have fewer involvements , fewer obligations , and fewer affairs ,
business or whatever .
However , so far as the interest of the larger
community is concerned , you must have as many involvements as
possible and as many activities as possible . " --
His Holiness the
Dalai Lama , from ' The Path to Tranquility : Daily Wisdom ' , available
from Snow Lion Publications .
" In the Buddhist teachings on altruism and compassion , certain
expressions are used such as " Disregard your own well - being and
cherish the well - being of others . "
Such exhortations may sound
intimidating , but it is important to understand these statements
regarding the practice of voluntarily sharing someone else 's pain and
suffering in their proper context .
Fundamentally , the basis on which
you can build a sense of caring for others is the capacity to love
yourself . " --
His Holiness the Dalai Lama , from ' The Compassionate
Life ' , available from Snow Lion Publications .
" The most important thing is practice in daily life ; then you can
know gradually the true value of religion .
Doctrine is not meant for
mere knowledge , but for the improvement of our minds .
In order to do
that , it must be part of our life .
If you put religious doctrine in
a building and when you leave the building depart from the practices ,
you can not gain its value . "
" The foundation for practicing the seven - point cause and effect
method is cultivating a mind of equanimity .
Without this foundation
you will not be able to have an impartial altruistic view , because
without equanimity you will always have partiality towards your
relatives and friends .
Realize that you should not have prejudice ,
hatred , or desire towards enemies , friends , or neutral persons , thus
lay a very firm foundation of equanimity . "
" When I was in Tibet I had little information , through books or from
personal contact , about the nature and value of other traditions .
Since I 've become a refugee , I have had more opportunity to have
closer contact with other traditions , mainly through individuals , and
I have gained a much deeper understanding of their value .
As a
result , my attitude now is that each one is a valid religion .
Of
course , even from the philosophical viewpoint , I still believe that
Buddhist philosophy is more sophisticated , that it has more variety
or is more vast , but all other religions still have tremendous
benefits or great potential .
So on both bases , I think my attitude
towards other religions is greatly changed .
Today , wherever I go and
whenever I meet someone who follows a different religion , I deeply
admire their practice and I very sincerely respect their tradition . "
" One of the characteristics of karmic theory is that there is a
definite , commensurate relationship between cause and effect .
There
is no way that negative actions or unwholesome deeds can result in
joy and happiness .
Joy and happiness , by definition , are the results
or fruits of wholesome actions .
So from that point of view , it is
possible for us to admire not so much the immediate action , but the
real causes of joy . "
" Consciousness will always be present , though a particular
consciousness may cease .
For example , the particular tactile
consciousness that is present within this human body will cease when
the body comes to an end .
Likewise , consciousnesses that are
influenced by ignorance , by anger or by attachment , these too will
cease .
But the basic , ultimate , innermost subtle consciousness will
always remain .
It has no beginning , and it will have not end . "
" When the days become longer and there is more sunshine , the grass
becomes fresh and , consequently , we feel very happy .
On the other
hand , in autumn , one leaf falls down and another leaf falls down .
The beautiful plants become as if dead and we do not feel very
happy .
Why ?
I think it is because deep down our human nature likes
construction , and does not like destruction .
Naturally , every action
which is destructive is against human nature .
Constructiveness is
the human way .
Therefore , I think that in terms of basic human
feeling , violence is not good .
Non-violence is the only way . "
" Judging by our own experiences in this life and those of others , it
is very obvious that consciousness is a phenomenon susceptible to
change and transformation .
Due to the force of bad companionship and
different conditions , people change for the worse , becoming very
aggressive .
Likewise we see human beings changing for the better ,
becoming more gentle , kind , and so forth .
This is an indication that
an impermanent phenomenon is changeable , and therefore is subject to
transformation . "
" One great question underlies our experience , whether we think about
it or not : what is the purpose of life ?
From the moment of birth
every human being wants happiness and does not want suffering .
Neither social conditioning nor education nor ideology affects this .
> From the very core of our being , we simply desire contentment .
Therefore , it is important to discover what will bring about the
greatest degree of happiness . "
" So from the Buddhist viewpoint , in our daily life we are sometimes
too sensitive toward minor things .
At the same time , toward other
major problems that can create long - term consequences , we are not so
sensitive .
Because of this , we find in the scriptures that ordinary
people like ourselves are described as childlike or childish .
In
fact , the term ' jhipa ' ( Tib. ' byis pa ' ) , or childish , is used in
different ways : sometimes it is used in terms of age , which is the
conventional usage ; sometimes it is used for ordinary sentient
beings , as opposed to the Arya beings , the superior beings .
Then
sometimes it is used to described people who are concerned only with
affairs of this life and have no interest or regard for the affairs
of their future life , or life after death .
So , the tendency of our
childish nature is to take small things too seriously and get easily
offended , whereas when we are confronted with situations which have
long - term consequences , we tend to take things less seriously . "
" When approaching a technique like the Buddhist training of the mind ,
we must understand and appreciate the complexity of the task we are
facing .
Buddhist scriptures mention eighty - four thousand types of
negative and destructive thoughts , which have eighty - four thousand
corresponding approaches or antidotes .
It is important not to have
the unrealistic expectation that somehow , somewhere , we will find a
single magic key that will help us eradicate all of these
negativities .
We need to apply many different methods over a long
period of time in order to bring lasting results .
Therefore , we need
great determination and patience .
It is wrong to expect that once
you start Dharma practice , you 'll become enlightened within a short
period of time , perhaps in one week .
This is unrealistic . "
" Cyclic existence means bondage , and liberation means freedom from
this bondage .
...[ T ]he causes of cyclic existence are contaminated
actions and afflictions .
If the roots of the afflictions are
eliminated and if new actions are not ' accumulated ' , since there are
no affiliations to activate the predispositions of contaminated
actions persisting from the past , the causes of cyclic existence have
been eliminated .
Then there is freedom from bondage .
Some say that
as long as one still has mental physical aggregates wrought by former
contaminated actions and afflictions , one has a nirvana with
remainder .
When these no longer remain , there is a nirvana without
remainder .
' Without remainder ' means that there is no remainder of
mental and physical aggregates wrought by contaminated actions and
afflictions , but the continuum of consciousness and the continuum of
uncontaminated mental and physical aggregates still exist . "
Here at Wired.com a few of us were excited about turning our iPhones into wireless modems with the $ 10 NetShare application – but none of us could get it to work .
Fortunately , we got our connections up and running with some help straight from
NetShare 's maker , Nullriver .
So we 've created a step - by - step tutorial in case you 're stuck , too .
Before we begin , do note that we could not get FireFox 3 to work with
NetShare using Nullriver 's settings ; the company said it only tested the app on FireFox 2 .
Safari , however , works just fine .
Without further ado , here 's our tutorial :
Step 1 : Download NetShare
Search for NetShare in the iPhone 's App Store . *
Pay 10 bucks and download it .
__
Step 2 : Create a New Network
__
On your Mac , click on your Airport icon and select " Create Network . "
Type whatever name you 'd like :
We used " iPhone tether " with the channel set to
Automatic ( 11 ) .
Then click OK .
__Step 3 : Open System Preferences –> Network
__
In the Network panel in System Preferences , select your Airport connection and click " Advanced . "
__Step 4 : Configure TCP /IP
__
Choose the TCP / IP tab .
Select " Using DHCP with manual address " and set your IP v4 Address to 192.168.10.2 .
__
Step 5 : Configure Proxies
__
Click the Proxies tab .
Now , checkmark the " SOCKS Proxy " box and enter
192.168.10.1 in the SOCKS Proxy server .
After the colon , enter 1080 as the port number .
Click OK and then hit the Apply button .
__Step 6 : Select Your Network on iPhone
__
In your iPhone 's Settings app , choose the network you created and hit the blue arrow .
__Step 7 : Configure Static Settings
__
Hit the Static tab and enter 192.168.10.1 for the IP address .
Step 8 : Disable Sleep
Do n't let your iPhone sleep , because you 'll get disconnected .
In iPhone 's settings , go to General– > Auto - Lock and set it to " Never . "
__Step 9 : Open NetShare
__
Now open NetShare and run Safari on your Mac .
You should be able to start browsing the web .
Step 10 ( Optional ) : Confirm Connection
If you want to double check whether you 're connected , load Terminal ( in the Utilities folder ) on your Mac and type " ping 192.168.10.1 . "
If you see some activity , you 're all set .
** Update : August 7 , 11 p.m. PDT : I 've received some reports of people unable to get NetShare to work properly after following these instructions .
I 've run into this problem once :
The software is glitchy , that 's for sure .
Try rebooting your iPhone if NetShare does n't seem to be showing any signs of activity .
If that does n't work , try slightly tweaking the IP addresses : 192.168.10.3 for the TCP / IP settings , for example , and 192.168.10.5 for the SOCKS Proxy .
* Update : August 3 , 9:18 a.m. PDT : Yes , we 're aware the app has been removed – again .
We will look into this and keep you posted .

A district in Manhattan has the highest human development index in the US Americans live shorter lives than citizens of almost every other developed nation , according to a report from several US charities .
The report found that the US ranked 42nd in the world for life expectancy despite spending more on health care per person than any other country .
Overall , the American Human Development Report ranked the world 's richest country 12th for human development .
The study looked at US government data on health , education and income .
The report was funded by Oxfam America , the Rockefeller Foundation and the Conrad Hilton Foundation .
The report combines measurements of health , education and income into one measurement - the human development index - based on that used by the United Nations .
Health insurance
The report , Measure of America , identifies significant progress in the US in the last 50 years .
Life expectancy - which averages 78 - has risen eight years since 1960 .
Japan has the world 's highest life expectancy - 82.1 years - according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ( OECD ) .
Some Americans are living anywhere from 30 to 50 years behind others when it comes to issues we all care about : health , education and standard of living
Sarah Burd - Sharps
Author , Measure of America
The US report identifies obesity and the lack of health insurance for some 47 million Americans as the most significant factors in premature death .
It also provides a snapshot of the inequalities between the richest and the poorest Americans and between different ethnic groups .
" The Measure of America reveals huge gaps among some groups in our country to access opportunity and reach their potential , " said the report 's author , Sarah Burd - Sharps .
" Some Americans are living anywhere from 30 to 50 years behind others when it comes to issues we all care about : health , education and standard of living .
" For example , the state human development index shows that people in last - ranked Mississippi are living 30 years behind those in first - ranked Connecticut . "
See a state - by - state breakdown of the development index
Enlarge Map
Asian males in the US were found to have the highest human development index score and were expected to live 14 years longer than African - American males , who had the lowest human development index rating .
African - Americans had a shorter lifespan than the average American did in the late 1970s .
The report further breaks down its findings into the US 's 436 Congressional districts .
The 20th district , around Fresno , California , was ranked last - with people earning one - third as much as residents of the top - ranked US district , - in Manhattan , New York .
More US babies die in their first year than in most other rich countries
The US north - east has the highest overall ranking because people there earn more , are more highly - educated and have the second highest life expectancy .
West Virginia , Louisiana , Arkansas and Alabama are four of the five bottom states on the index .
Mississippi is ranked lowest .
Among other findings :
Of the world 's richest nations , the US has the most children ( 15 % ) living in poverty
Of the OECD nations , the US has the most people in prison - as a percentage and in absolute numbers
25 % of 15 - year - old students performed at or below the lowest level in an international maths test - worse than Canada , France , Germany and Japan
If the US infant mortality rate were equal to first - ranked Sweden , more than 20,000 more babies would survive beyond their first year of life

The bit at the bottom of the table ?
That ’s the unannounced games , ones that do n’t have titles yet and have never been seen .
By our reckoning , that ’s 1 from Konami , 1 from IREM and 9 ( yes , NINE ) from Sony ’s Japanese division .
11 in total , fantastic .
If the Team Ico game is n’t in that 9 somewhere we ’re giving up .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
One of the Marines shown in a famous World War II photograph raising the U.S. flag on Iwo Jima was posthumously awarded a certificate of U.S. citizenship on Tuesday .
The Marine Corps War Memorial in Virginia depicts Strank and five others raising a flag on Iwo Jima .
Sgt. Michael Strank , who was born in Czechoslovakia and came to the United States when he was 3 , derived U.S. citizenship when his father was naturalized in 1935 .
However , U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services recently discovered that Strank never was given citizenship papers .
At a ceremony Tuesday at the Marine Corps Memorial -- which depicts the flag - raising -- in Arlington , Virginia , a certificate of citizenship was presented to Strank 's younger sister , Mary Pero .
Strank and five other men became national icons when an Associated Press photographer captured the image of them planting an American flag on top of Mount Suribachi on February 23 , 1945 .
Strank was killed in action on the island on March 1 , 1945 , less than a month before the battle between Japanese and U.S. forces there ended .
Jonathan Scharfen , the acting director of CIS , presented the citizenship certificate Tuesday .
He hailed Strank as " a true American hero and a wonderful example of the remarkable contribution and sacrifices that immigrants have made to our great republic throughout its history . "

Humanity stands on the threshold of a peaceful and prosperous future , with an unprecedented ability to extend lifespans and increase the power of ordinary people – but is likely to blow it through inequality , violence and environmental degradation .
And governments are not equipped to ensure that the opportunities are seized and disasters averted .
So says a massive new international report , due to be published late this month , and obtained by The Independent on Sunday .
Backed by organisations ranging from Unesco to the US army , the World Bank to the Rockefeller Foundation , the 2008 State of the Future report runs to 6,300 pages and draws on contributions from 2,500 experts around the globe .
Its warning is all the more stark for eschewing doom and gloom .
" The future continues to get better for most of the world , " it concludes , " but a series of tipping points could drastically alter global prospects . "

It goes on .
" This is a unique time in history .
Mobile phones , the internet , international trade , language translation and jet planes are giving birth to an interdependent humanity that can create and implement global strategies to improve [ its ] prospects .
It is increasingly clear that the world has the resources to address our common challenges .
Ours is the first generation with the means for many to know the world as a whole , identify global improvement systems , and seek to improve [ them ] . "
What is more , say the authors of the report , produced by the Millennium Project of the World Federation of the United Nations Associations , many important things are already getting better .
Life expectancy and literacy rates are increasing worldwide , while infant mortality and the number of armed conflicts have been falling fast .
Per capita income has been growing strongly enough to cut poverty by more than half by 2015 – except , importantly , in Africa .
Even better , it says , " advances in science , technology , education , economics and management seem capable of making the world work far better than it does today " .
Medical breakthroughs , for example , are offering the hope of defeating inherited diseases , tailoring cures to individual patients , and even creating replacement body parts .
And computers are spreading even to remote villages in developing countries and dramatically increasing in power to provide " collective intelligence for just - in - time knowledge to inform decisions " .
The report reserves its greatest enthusiasm for the internet , which it says is " already the most powerful force for globalisation , democratisation , economic growth and education in history .
" The internet allows self - organisation around common ideals , independent of conventional institutional controls and regardless of nationalities or languages .
Injustices in different parts of the world become the concern of thousands or millions of people who then pressure local , regional or international governing systems to find solutions .
" This unparalleled social power is reinventing citizens ' roles in the political process and changing institutions , policy - making and governance . "
And this is happening in a world that is already becoming freer and more democratic .
Over the past 30 years , the number of free countries has more than doubled from 43 to 90 , it reports , while those that are partly free increased from 46 to 60 .
Just over one - third of humanity still lives in the 43 countries with authoritarian regimes , but half of these people are in China .
On the other hand , the report warns " half the world is vulnerable to social instability and violence due to rising food and energy prices , failing states , falling water tables , climate change , decreasing water - food - energy supply per person , desertification and increasing migrations due to political , environmental and economic conditions " .
These – and other threats such as increasing terrorism , corruption and organised crime – threaten to undo the improvements of recent years and blight the chance of a better future .
Food prices have more than doubled in a year and have already plunged 37 countries into crisis , greatly increasing hunger and poverty .
And price rises seem set to continue because food production needs to increase 50 per cent by 2013 and double in 30 years .
" With nearly three billion people making $ 2 or less per day , long - term global social conflict seems inevitable without more serious food policies , useful scientific breakthroughs and dietary changes , " says the report .
Global warming is occurring faster than expected .
This could cause southern Africa to " lose more than 30 per cent of its maize crop by 2030 " and help to increase the number of people facing water scarcity fourfold to a massive three billion by 2025 .
The rate at which the world 's ice is melting , it says , " has doubled over the last two years " , and it quotes a US military report which predicts that global warming " can be an incubator of civil strife , genocide and the growth of terrorism " .
Yet nuclear power – the solution increasingly favoured by governments , which are planning to add another 350 reactors to the 438 already operating around the world – will not do the job .
" For nuclear energy to eliminate the greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels , about 2,000 nuclear power plants would have to be built , at $ 5 - 15 bn per plant , over 15 years – and possibly an additional 8,000 plants beyond that to 2050 . "
The report says that there is not enough uranium in the world to fuel all those reactors , that another Chernobyl - type accident could halt the expansion in its tracks , and that the rapid spread of the atom around the world increases the chances of nuclear proliferation and terrorism .
It estimates that there is a 75 per cent chance that terrorists will have acquired nuclear weapons within the next 10 years , adding : " Links between terrorists and organised crime are worrisome , especially considering that , on average , there were 150 reports of unauthorised use of nuclear or radioactive materials to the International Atomic Energy Authority per year between 2004 and 2007 . "
Organised crime , it adds , " continues to grow in the absence of a comprehensive , integrated global counterstrategy " .
It reckons that it is now worth some $ 2 trillion a year .
There are grounds for hope , however .
The use of renewable energy is growing , and China 's largest car maker plans for half its cars to be hybrids within two years .
But the report 's authors say that governments are not up to the job : " Many of the world 's decision - making processes are inefficient , slow and ill - informed , especially when given the new demands from increasing complexity [ and ] globalisation . "
They call on world leaders to do more long - term planning , and to join in global approaches to the interlocking crises .
" Climate change cannot be turned around without a global strategy .
International organised crime cannot be stopped without a global strategy .
Individuals creating designer diseases and causing massive deaths cannot be stopped without a global strategy .
It is time for global strategic systems to be upgraded . "
Jerome Glenn , the report 's main author added : " There seems to be an interest in creating global strategies , but it needs a little push .
There 's more within us now to collaborate in the face of shared problems . "
Computer power
25 years until a computer 's capacity equals the power of the human brain .
After another 25 years , everyone will be able to access processing power greater than that of all the brains on Earth combined .
The great melt
5 years before the Arctic could be ice - free in summer .
Sea-ice last year shrank to 22 per cent below the previous record low , a level that had not been expected to be reached until 2030 - 50 , opening up the Northwest Passage .
Fossil fuel
850 coal - fired power stations are planned to go into operation across the US , China and India over the next four years .
Each station would operate for about 20 years , greatly accelerating global warming .
Solar energy
25 % of Europe 's electricity could come from solar - powered stations in North Africa by 2050 .
African leaders and aid organisations are to invest $ 10 bn ( £ 5 bn ) a year in renewable energy over the next five years .

CNBC has been informative tonight .
Right now Larry Kudlow is yelling about reinstating the uptick rule , something I had never heard of before .
Apparently , part of the problem on the market today was short - sellers driving down the price of shares of good companies like Goldman , hoping the treasury will come in and “ rescue ” them , further deflating the vlaue of the stock and rewarding the short - sellers more .
It even has a name - “ bear raiding . ”
What a mess .
*** Update ***
The Bush legacy :
Pressure is building on the pristine “ AAA ” rating of the United States after a federal bailout of American International Group Inc , the chairman of Standard & Poor ’s sovereign ratings committee said on Wednesday .
The $ 85 billion bailout of AIG on Tuesday by the U.S. Federal Reserve “ has weakened the fiscal profile of the United States , ” S&P ’s John Chambers told Reuters in an interview .
“ Lack of a pro-active stance could have resulted in further financial stress and put pressure on the U.S. triple - A rating , ” Chambers said .
“ There ’s no God - given gift of a ‘ AAA ’ rating , and the U.S. has to earn it like everyone else . ”

John Bovenzi , the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation 's ( FDIC ) chief operating officer , speaks to a customer outside an IndyMac Bank branch at the company 's corporate headquarters in Pasadena , California July 14 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Danny Moloshok
( Reuters ) - Federal Deposit Insurance Corp ( FDIC ) might have to borrow money from the Treasury Department to see it through an expected wave of bank failures , the Wall Street Journal reported .
The borrowing could be needed to cover short - term cash - flow pressures caused by reimbursing depositors immediately after the failure of a bank , the paper said .
The borrowed money would be repaid once the assets of that failed bank are sold .
“ I would not rule out the possibility that at some point we may need to tap into ( short - term ) lines of credit with the Treasury for working capital , not to cover our losses , ” Chairman Sheila Bair said in an interview with the paper .
Bair said such a scenario was unlikely in the “ near term . ”
With a rise in the number of troubled banks , the FDIC ’s Deposit Insurance Fund used to repay insured deposits at failed banks has been drained .
In a bid to replenish the $ 45.2 billion fund , Bair had said on Tuesday that the FDIC will consider a plan in October to raise the premium rates banks pay into the fund , a move that will further squeeze the industry .
The agency also plans to charge banks that engage in risky lending practices significantly higher premiums than other U.S. banks , Bair said .
The last time the FDIC had borrowed funds from the Treasury was at nearly the tail end of the savings - and - loan crisis in the early 1990s after thousands of banks were shuttered .
The fact that the agency is considering the option again , after the collapse of just nine banks this year , illustrates the concern among Washington regulators about the weakness of the U.S. banking system in the wake of the credit crisis , the Journal said .
Ken Deffeyes , who did so much to bring this current situation to our attention with his writing and books , who has said that he is no longer a prophet , but has become a historian .
His remark implies that the much of the debate over peak oil is perhaps over .
And there I would disagree with him , because I remain critically concerned , as Euan is , that the world does not really understand the size of the problem that is approaching , and the speed of that arrival .
Further the information that controls the shape of the production curve , post peak is usually derived relating to the pattern of the peak in the United States .
To anticipate that the world curve will look the same , overlooks the critical difference that , at the present time , there is no satisfactory alternative fuel to satisfy demand .
Thus the market imperatives to extract more oil in the immediate short term to meet needs may over - ride more rational concerns about achieving maximum ultimate recovery by producing the oil more slowly .
This is a different situation than that which held over the time that the American production plot was developed , and alternate supplies of oil were available from abroad .
One of the significant concerns relates to the rate at which production decreases in mature fields .
The average value has been assumed to lie at around 4 – 4.5 % , and it is initially disquieting to note the comment that the Wall Street Journal recently quoted from the IEA .
Project delays averaging 12 months , coupled with global average decline of 5.2 % - up from 4 % last year – are the factors behind these revisions .
Over 3.5 mb /d of new production will be needed each year just to hold global production steady .
“ Our findings highlight again the need for sustained , and indeed , increased investment both upstream and downstream — to assure that the market is adequately supplied , ” stated [ IEA Executive Director Nabuo ] Tanaka .
The acceleration in the decline rate is likely to continue as more horizontal wells become the norm in oil fields and as these become spent and drop out of production .
To explain why this is one should understand the difference between the behavior of vertical and horizontal well production , particularly in the way that they behave as the oil in the reservoir declines under the driving waterfloods that push oil to the well and how they interact with the well .
With a vertical well the water level rises slowly in the well , reducing the overall extraction length , but making that change slowly , over time .
( Oil production is a function of the length of well exposure , among other things ) .
With the horizontal well production remains relatively stable , until water reaches the horizon where the wells have been located , and then the entire well can become flooded , with an immediate and rapid drop in production .
In fields where these wells dominate , production declines of 10 – 14 % have been observed , and , as horizontal wells become more common , it is towards that value that decline rates are heading in the future .
These decline rates are not used in the conventional models that look at what the oil supply situation will look like over the next few years .
Discussions that I have had , informally , with several people that talk about the peak oil situation have found them somewhat defensive about using the lower values of around 4.5 % .
It is as though , having grasped the nettle required to face the reality that oil production is peaking , that they then hesitate to look at the abyss that higher decline rates are going to bring .
That decline rates will increase is not itself news , Andrew Gould of Schlumberger was talking of 8 % declines as long ago as 2005 .
Secondly , the industry is dealing with a phenomenon that is exaggerated by the lack of investment over the past 18 years .
This phenomenon is the decline rate for the older reservoirs that form the backbone of the world ’s oil production , both in and out of OPEC .
An accurate average decline rate is hard to estimate , but an overall figure of 8 % is not an unreasonable assumption .
The maintenance required to slow the rate of decline , and increase the overall recovery , is a key element of the supply picture going forward .
While I do n’t think he was alluding in any way to the increasing use of horizontal wells , his number , and his position giving him more than most the sense of accuracy of the number is a recognition of the change to come .
Unfortunately , as the example of Cantarell is demonstrating when production starts to drop at around 14 % it does not take long for the entire export situation for a country to markedly change , which in turn will have a significant effect on those that import that oil .
And yet while individual fields such as Cantarell , Yibal , and the North Sea have shown these higher decline rates are not uncommon , their impact on total world production declines has not been widely remarked .
Stuart and Khebab wrote about this in complimentary pieces last November , in analyses more detailed than this .
I do n’t agree with some of their conclusions , but do believe that this is a critical question that requires some more detailed consideration than it is currently getting ,
The evidence seems to be pointing to an overall increase in the global decline rate for existing wells .
What this means is that , if world production is around 86 million barrels a day , then to replace existing declines next year , an additional new production of 4.47 mbd at 5.2 % decline , instead of the 3.87 mbd required at 4.5 % decline , will be needed just to stabilize supply at a fixed level .
If the rate is accelerating this difference of 600,000 bd will increase and drop the top line of the curves such as those that Khebab and others have so carefully assembled .
This increased decline rate is already being reported , and thus the potential peak in 2010 that the graph shows is already at risk and we may struggle to get much above the numbers that we are at today .
Bear in mind that decline rates are cumulative over the years , and that outyear production must be that much greater to sustain supply , relative to today ’s production .
At present there is still considerable complacency about how the oil supply situation will play out .
There is an implication that this is just a difficult period to get through , and that , in a relatively short time the situation will get better .
Sadly I would suggest that even our current thinking here is largely overly optimistic , and that instead it is going to be much more difficult , faster than we expect .
But also , in light of peoples ’ expectations about oil really being there at a reasonable price , the greater the dangers of civil unrest , as it occurs without proper public education as to the reason that “ there is no more ” signs start to spring up at gas stations .
Obama denies a rumor and questions the question
Sen .
Barack Obama on Thursday batted down rumors circulating on the Internet and mentioned on some cable news shows of the existence of a video of his wife using a derogatory term for white people , and criticized a reporter for asking him about the rumor , which has not a shred of evidence to support it .
“ We have seen this before .
There is dirt and lies that are circulated in e-mails and they pump them out long enough until finally you , a mainstream reporter , asks me about it , ” Obama said to the McClatchy reporter during a press conference aboard his campaign plane .
“ That gives legs to the story .
If somebody has evidence that myself or Michelle or anybody has said something inappropriate , let them do it . ”
Asked whether he knew it not to be true , Obama said he had answered the question , my colleague Carrie Budoff Brown reports from the plane .
“ Frankly , my hope is people do n’t play this game , ” Obama said .
“ It is a destructive aspect of our politics .
Simply because something appears in an e-mail , that should lend it no more credence than if you heard it on the corner .
Presumably the job of the press is to not to go around and spread scurrilous rumors like this until there is actually anything , an iota , of substance or evidence that would substantiate it . ”

So was it even acceptable to ask the question ?
Before Obama could answer , communications director Robert Gibbs interjected : “ You just did . ”
“ That is my point , ” Obama said .
“ I just think people have to think about it before they ask . ”
NOTE : Obama 's clearly right that this is how stories for which there 's no evidence at all make it into the public eye .
So I 'm not linking or detailing the rumor , since there 's just zero credible evidence for it .
This is probably a silly old media vestige , of course ; Google has no such standards .
And Obama 's discussion of it is , more broadly , news :
As he acknowledged yesterday , beating back whisper campaigns is perhaps the central challenge his campaign faces .
ALSO : Reason 's David Weigel examines the original source of the rumor and finds that he can't keep his story straight .
( And yes , I 'm now linking something that links the original .
It 's such an effective challenge to it that it seemed worth the cost . )
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - More than half of Americans would rather die than live with a severe disability , according to a survey .
Glen House is seen at the base of Pikes Peak in the Rocky Mountains , just west of Colorado Springs , in this September 13 , 2003 file photo .
House became the first person to climb the mountain in a wheelchair .
REUTERS / Handout
In the online poll commissioned by Disaboom , a Web site and social network for people affected by disabilities , 52 percent of the 1,000 “ nationally represented ” adults chose death over losing the ability to live an independent life .
Disaboom , which launched the survey to better understand people ’s perceptions of disabilities , said more than 54 million Americans -- 1 in 6 people -- live with some form of debilitating condition .
“ We want to show everyone that it ’s not the end , it ’s a new beginning , ” Glen House , co-founder of Disaboom and a quadriplegic for 18 years , said in an interview .
The poll , conducted by Kelton Research , found significant differences in attitudes based on age , income , location and level of education .
Middle - aged Americans were less willing to live with a severe disability than older Americans , it found .
In the 35 to 44 age group , 63 percent chose death over severe disability , compared with half of the 55 to 64 group and 56 percent of those 65 and older .
House , who was 20 when he broke his neck in a skiing accident , is also a director of rehabilitation at Penrose Hospital in Colorado Springs and the first person to climb Pikes Peak in the Rocky Mountains in a wheelchair .
Asked if he was shocked by the findings , House said : “ If you asked me when I was 20 , I probably would have been in that group as well , because I did n’t know anybody who lived with severe disability . ”
After his accident , he said , he had “ amazing support . ”
“ Right from the beginning I thought ‘ Let ’s move on , ’ ” House said .
The survey found people with higher household incomes were more likely to choose death over severe disability -- 59 percent of those earning $ 75,000 or more compared with 45 percent of those making $ 25,000 or less .
Only 45 percent of people living in the South picked death , compared with 61 percent in the West .
College graduates were more likely to choose death ( 57 percent ) than respondents who have did not finish high school ( 30 percent ) .
Sherri Shepherd Admits to Multiple Abortions
is an Emmy award winning comedian and a co-host on ABC morning talk show The View .
The television celebrity recently sat down for an interview with the black Christian women 's magazine Precious Times .
Shepherd shared the fact that before she converted to Christianity , she led a promiscuous lifestyle .
" I was in a very abusive relations .
I was sleeping with a lot of guys and had more abortions that I would like to count .
I have very low self esteem and just wanted to die . "
The comedian is apparently very worried about the state of Barbara Walters soul .
She may have made a major blunder in sharing the following sentiment about her sometimes prickly boss :
" Oh , sometimes I say , ' Lord , Juanita Bynum or Joyce Myers would be so good at this table .
They could lay hands on Barbara Walters and get her saved .
I ask the Lord ' Why am I here ? '
I have to trust God when he says ' Because I said so . ' "
Shepherd is really a woman of sharp contrasts .
She has put her foot in her mouth several times on The View , heaping a fair amount of criticism upon herself .
She was even chastised by working partner Whoopi Goldberg , who said that Sherri needs to think more before speaking because a lot of what she says " just is n't appropriate . "
The firestorm hit with full force overnight .
Shepherd opened The View today with a 5 minute spin of the entire situation .

There ’s some news being posted around today that Facebook Beacon is making a comeback !
Well my friends , it never went away .
You just probably never interacted with it if you did n’t notice it .
If you ’ve visited sites including Kongregate or Fandango you would have noticed that the service still functions as before .
Techcrunch and Mashable also picked up the story .
Looks like even the technology media seems to forget about these things .
No , Beacon did n’t disappear , it just was n’t as obvious as it was previously .
Another thing that will be functioning in a similar fashion to Beacon : Facebook Connect .
While it does n’t work exactly like Beacon , Facebook Connect will let anybody add Beacon like features to their site .
The only difference is that a suspicious looking pop-up at the bottom of the site does n’t randomly show up when you visit a site .
Instead you will be forced to log - in and grant access to the site you are visiting .
In contrast , Beacon does n’t require you to log - in .
Beacon is actually more of a promotional offering in which sites can pay to have user actions published via their newsfeed ( and mini - feed ) without logging in to the service .
Is it a little more invasive ?
Definitely !
Does it make sense for promotional purposes ?
Totally !
So welcome back Beacon , a service which never actually went away .
Some of us just forgot that it ’s still around .
Deadly Assumption # 5 : My Bank Accounts Are Fully Insured
July 21 , 2008
[ This is a re-run of an article I posted on this website in the this site 's first month , in 2005 : Article 91 .
I reprint it here without changing a word . ]
When you open an account at a bank , you are told in writing that your account is insured by the FDIC .
What is the FDIC ?
It 's the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation .
What is a corporation ?
It is a legal entity that is created specifically to insure its owners from bankruptcy .
If the corporation goes bankrupt , the owners ( investors ) will be protected from further lawsuits .
They lose only the money they invested in the now bankrupt corporation .
Is the FDIC a private corporation ?
No .
It 's a government corporation .
So , does this make it more reliable ?
More reliable than what ?
It is as reliable as the U.S. government .
If you go to the FDIC 's Website , you learn the following :
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) preserves and promotes public confidence in the U.S. financial system by insuring deposits in banks and thrift institutions for up to $ 100,000 ; by identifying , monitoring and addressing risks to the deposit insurance funds ; and by limiting the effect on the economy and the financial system when a bank or thrift institution fails .
This sounds good .
Depositors want someone to supervise banks .
No one wants his bank to go bankrupt ( bankrupt = bank + rupture ) .
There is another crucial question :
What is the ratio between deposits and FDIC reserves ?
The FDIC receives no Congressional appropriations -- it is funded by premiums that banks and thrift institutions pay for deposit insurance coverage and from earnings on investments in U.S. Treasury securities .
With insurance funds totaling more than $ 44 billion , the FDIC insures more than $ 3 trillion of deposits in U.S. banks and thrifts -- deposits in virtually every bank and thrift in the country .
Let 's see : $ 3 trillion divided by $ 44 billion .
That tells us that the reserves are a little less than 1.5 % of the money value of the insured accounts .
For every dollar in an account , there is a penny and a half in the FDIC .
Or is there ?
If you go to the Bank Insurance Fund , Balance Sheets , June 2004 , you will find that there were not $ 44 billion in assets , but rather $ 34.7 billion .
Of this $ 34.7 billion , only $ 12.3 billion is classified as " Available - for - sale securities . "
These were U.S. government securities .
Most of the portfolio ( $ 19.4 billion ) is invested in " Held - to - maturity securities , " meaning U.S. government bonds : high interest rate assets .
As to where the missing $ 6.3 billion in assets ( $ 44 b minus $ 37.7b ) are , the balance sheet does not say .
So , to insure $ 3 trillion in deposits , the FDIC has in ready reserve about $ 12 billion in government T - bills .
To get its hands on this money during a banking crisis , the FDIC must sell these T - bills for cash .
To whom ?
At what discount ?
Where will buyers get the money ?
At some point , the Federal Reserve System would step in and buy the FDIC 's liquid assets .
But how long would $ 12 billion , or $ 37.7 billion , or even $ 44 billion last in a true banking panic ?
Not long .
The bottom line is this : your bank accounts are insured unless there is a banking crisis .
Then , you must hope for the best .
The greatest threat is a gridlock in the payments system .
Bank A can not pay bank B at the end of the day because bank C has not paid bank A . How could this happen ?
Think of what happens to banking if a terrorist group releases anthrax into a major city , killing a million people in three days , and then announces that it has targeted another city .
How long would your local ATM have money inside ?
It would not take an act of terrorism .
It came close in the summer of 1998 , when the hedge fund , Long Term Capital Management , almost went bankrupt .
The New York Federal Reserve Bank intervened .
An officer called major American banks and suggested a meeting in which they would extend billions of dollars of extra credit to LTCM .
In justifying this decision to Congress in October , 1998 , FED Chairman Greenspan said this :
It was the judgment of officials at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York , who were monitoring the situation on an ongoing basis , that the act of unwinding LTCM 's portfolio in a forced liquidation would not only have a significant distorting impact on market prices but also in the process could produce large losses , or worse , for a number of creditors and counterparties , and for other market participants who were not directly involved with LTCM .
In that environment , it was the FRBNY 's judgment that it was to the advantage of all parties -- including the creditors and other market participants -- to engender if at all possible an orderly resolution rather than let the firm go into disorderly fire - sale liquidation following a set of cascading cross defaults .
Notice his phrase , " cascading cross defaults . "
This is another phrase for " payments gridlock . "
The FDIC will be helpless to deal with such a scenario .
This is why wise investors are not totally dependent on insured bank accounts to provide their liquidity -- money -- in a banking crisis .
They have other strategies : the kinds of strategies that are discussed on this website .
That is why I created this website .

Noncompete clauses are a reality of the modern labor market as companies seek to keep their employees from using the experience and information they gain in one position from turning into a liability when those employees find jobs elsewhere .
California law was a bit of an exception , as it appeared to limit the scope of these clauses , but the relevant statutes had been interpreted differently in the State and Federal court systems .
Now , the California Supreme Court has issued a ruling ( PDF ) that holds that , with the exception of a few narrow situations explicitly spelled out by law , noncompete clauses have no legal standing .
The case is actually an offshoot of the Enron collapse , which took down consulting firm Arthur Anderson in its wake .
One of Anderson 's employees , Raymond Edwards , was offered a job by HSBC , which purchased his division from Anderson .
The legal agreements involved with the transfer sparked a lawsuit .
HSBC required Edwards to obtain a waiver of his noncompete with Anderson as a condition of employment ; Anderson would n't waive it unless Edwards released it of " any and all " liabilities related to Edwards ' work there .
Thinking he might get caught up in the many lawsuits involved in the collapse of Enron and Anderson , Edwards refused to sign , lest he find himself footing his own legal bills .
As a result , the job offer from HSBC was withdrawn .
Edwards sued , alleging a number of employment and contractual issues ; after the case made its way through trial court and appeals , the Supreme Court was left to focus on two of these .
The first was the " any and all " language .
California employment law mandates that employers assume many specific liabilities , including legal responsibility for actions performed on their behalf .
The court simply ruled that , since these liabilities can't be legally waived , the " any and all " language is assumed to exclude these — in short , any and all should be read to mean " any and all that are legally permissible . "
But the more significant ruling came when the noncompete clause itself was considered .
The California legal code promotes employment mobility by stating , " Except as provided in this chapter , every contract by which anyone is restrained from engaging in a lawful profession , trade , or business of any kind is to that extent void . "
The exceptions focus largely on the actions of principals when corporations or partnerships are dissolved .
State courts had largely interpreted this outlawing any agreement that placed any constraint on employment .
But the US court system ( the Ninth Circuit includes California ) had read this statute to be in line with the laws prevailing in other states , interpreting " restrain " to mean " prohibit . "
Thus , according to the Ninth Circuit , only agreements that blocked all employment in a field were invalid .
This was the California Supreme Court 's chance to clarify the situation , and the Justices took the opportunity to issue a definitive ruling .
" The agreement restricted Edwards from performing work , " they wrote in determining , " the noncompetition agreement that Edwards was required to sign before commencing employment with Andersen was therefore invalid because it restrained his ability to practice his profession . "
The decision does n't apply to other states but , given that the state Supreme Court is expected to be the ultimate authority on state law , it 's likely that future Ninth Circuit rulings will follow this ruling .
It 's especially significant given that California is home to a lot of software companies .
Noncompetes are the norm in this field , as the property involved is mostly intellectual .
The difficulty of determining what exactly competes with a software company or web service could have acted as a significant deterrent to employee mobility .
China.org.cn reports on the photos posted to our forum last week of a Foxconn factory worker .
Forum user markm49uk had found the photos on his brand new iPhone .
This led to speculation on the identity and the fate of the factory worker 's job .
Fortunately , it 's been confirmed that the employee was not fired based on comments from a Foxconn representative :
" She is definitely not fired , " an unidentified representative from Foxconn 's factory in Shenzhen , southern China , told the newspaper Xiandai Kuaibao .
The representative did confirm that she was an employee at the Shenzhen factory and that it was likely that the test photos were left on the iPhone 's memory " accidentally " .

Ever since the first arcade games appeared , gamers have tried to leave their own mark on their favorite titles .
Back then , you left a cool , perhaps offensive , set of initials in the machine 's high - score column .
Over time , software companies have tried to key into this desire by giving gamers an increasingly impressive set of tools to personalize their games .
But now , gaming companies - aided by hardware advances , online networks and the proliferation of broadband - are equipping players with an unprecedented amount of creative power to , in essence , design their own games and share them online with others .
Gamers , who were once enticed by the fantasy of becoming heroes , sports stars and warriors , are now being invited to become game developers .
" This started with the YouTube age , " said Shane Satterfield , editor in chief of GameTrailers.com and vice president of content for Spike Digital Entertainment .
" People have been given the power to create their own movies and share them , and it 's opened the gates for other forms of media . "
Last year , Halo 3 allowed users to create their own maps for multiplayer games .
Earlier this summer , Electronic
Arts released the first title from its collaboration with Steven Spielberg , called Boom Blox , which lets players create their own explosive challenges and share them with others online .
This fall , things will heat up with Guitar Hero World Tour , which invites players to make their own Guitar Hero songs that other people can download and play .
Spore , the latest title from famed designer Will Wright , premieres next month with a robust creature creator that can be used to conceive a wild array of animals .
And then there 's LittleBigPlanet , a new Sony PlayStation 3 title out in October which was built from the ground up as a way for gamers to flex their creative muscles .
The most anticipated game for the PlayStation 3 this fall , it endows players with the ability to make levels and challenges using a wide variety of tools and objects that respond faithfully to physics .
The games are part of a new wave of titles that encourage casual players to make in - game creation a pursuit that rivals the game - playing itself .
" A lot of people enjoy playing games and they 're excited by the idea of making games .
But they do n't know how to go about it , " said Mark Healey , creative director of Media Molecule , developer of LittleBigPlanet .
" The desire has been there for a long time , but it 's only now the technology is making it easier to put the power into people 's hands . "
Healey said the mantra of LittleBigPlanet developers was that they wanted their creation to be for video games what YouTube was for video .
But they sought to take it a step further by giving people the practical and easy - to - use tools to actually make the game , unlike YouTube , which simply facilitates video sharing .
To be sure , traditional game playing is not going away by a long shot .
Most gamers will be happy to play out the vision of a trained professional .
But developers see new opportunities to engage players with this sort of wish fulfillment .
" It 's empowering people ; it makes people feel they made something cool , " said Amir Rahimi , producer for EA 's Boom Blox .
" What is unique is we do it in a way the casual audience can be the game designer .
... With Boom Blox anyone can get in there and create . "
The added benefit of including these creative and sharing tools is that it extends the usefulness of a game well beyond its traditional life cycle .
Creators can keep making whatever they want , and players can try out a virtually endless supply of user - created levels and challenges .
Guitar Hero World Tour , which launches in October , is a good example .
While the game will include about 85 well known songs , it also will offer a selection of user - generated songs through its GH Tunes online library .
" The games are so huge and expensive these days and there 's only so much game you can give a consumer , so it makes sense to expand it out to a huge audience of people , " said Scott Pease , director of development at Neversoft , developer of Guitar Hero World Tour .
" Even if only 1 percent of players get into creating , that 's a ton of content you can offer that extends the life of the game . "
Satterfield said the challenge will be to make sure the best user - generated content rises to the top .
Gamers will want a reliable way to explore their peers ' creations .
Otherwise , players might sour on the idea of trying out the work of amateurs .
Pease said Guitar Hero World
Tour will offer a slew of YouTube - like features like ratings , best songs of the week and a top artist showcase .
LittleBigPlanet will also feature a similar structure to encourage exploration .
And the game is including a self - reporting system to ensure that creators do n't tread into offensive territory .
Satterfield said a lot of eyes will be on LittleBigPlanet in particular to see how it performs .
If it does anywhere near what people expect , he said , it 's likely other developers will follow suit .
" LittleBigPlanet is a big experiment for the industry , " Satterfield said .
" It remains to be seen if this will work .
There has n't been a game that gives you this much freedom to create and share . "
Your career is a direct result of hard work and a substantial investment of time and money .
Does n’t it make sense to fully protect it ?
A disability could render you helpless by taking away the one thing that you need to safeguard all of your assets : your income .
Home , auto , life , and health insurance are certainly valuable investments , but failure to couple them with disability insurance will jeopardize your full financial security .
For example , health insurance might cover the potential fiscal pitfalls of the medical bills that result from a disability , but the rest of your financial obligations are not going to come to a halt .
Vehicle payments , mortgages , insurance premiums , and even savings for the future are all important expenses that cannot be ignored just because you are disabled .
Unfortunately , the chances of becoming disabled might be greater than you think .
According to the 1994 Statistical Abstract of the United States , in the course of a year , odds are that 1 in 10 people between the ages of 25 and 64 will suffer a disability .
When comparing that ratio to the odds of being victim of a house fire ( 1 in 122 ) ; injured in an automobile accident ( 1 in 160 ) ; or even of death ( 1 in 117 ) , the advantage of disability insurance is clear .
A February 2000 article in the New York Times reported that 1 in 7 people between the ages of 35 and 60 will become disabled for five years or more .
Read
Despite these glaring statistics , many people still take a substantial risk by ignoring the benefits offered by a disability insurance policy .
In 2000 , a survey by The Consumer Federation of America and The American Council of Life Insurers found that 82 percent of people do not have long - term disability insurance or believe their coverage is inadequate .
The alternatives to disability insurance all carry a degree of risk or have some sort of drawback .
Social Security benefits are difficult to qualify for and the disability must prevent you from working in any occupation .
Worker ’s compensation benefits are limited and only cover job - related sickness or injury .
Other options — relying on savings , family , and / or friends — are not guaranteed and have considerable downside .
Guard your assets — do n’t leave yourself vulnerable by neglecting to protect your income .
We 've had our fair share of laughs from Zune Guy 's obsession with inking his body with permanent reminders of just how infatuated he is with Redmond 's PMP , but we must say , it 's a bit weirder to see someone coming ever closer to doing the same with our logo .
Apparently one Egor Lavrov has established a tattoo contest in which he accepts donations as votes for logos , and after the polls close , he has agreed to give 25 % of the money raised to charity and 25 % to the person who submitted the winning tattoo idea .
Oh , and he 's going to get the most highly ranked image inked on his arm .
We 'd be dubious about paying to cast a vote ( read : we 'd refrain entirely ) , but what 's up with our model being on steroids , anyway ?
At GM's " blogger town hall " at the end of yesterday 's Chevy Volt unveil , the General 's Vice Chairman and product czar , " Maximum " Bob Lutz , made mention to a Volt feature we had n't yet heard about , and is even more techie - cool than the iPod - like interface on the center stack .
Apparently , the Volt will " know how far you are from home " using what we 're assuming is an on - board GPS system .
The plug - in electric extended range hybrid 's computer will then use that distance , along with route information , to determine how long the car needs to run the gas engine to charge the on - board battery pack , allowing the vehicle to truly maximize fuel economy .
Even if you 're not drinking the GM Kool - Aid , you 've got to be wow'ed by a system like that — as long as it actually works .
Read the full quote from " The " Bob after the galleries and the jump below .
" with the Volt , you never have to worry you use the full 40 ( mile range ) , the worst thing that happens is the gasoline engine comes on , and the car will know how far you are from home , and it will only run the gas engine long enough to give you enough charge to get you home where you can actually plug it into the wall outlet .
So the car will be smart enough to know where its home base is . "

How cool is this as a feature if it works ?
Washington Post Comments on Terrorist Plots
From this article , published last April :
Batiste confided , somewhat fantastically , that he wanted to blow up the Sears Tower in Chicago , which would then fall into a nearby prison , freeing Muslim prisoners who would become the core of his Moorish army .
With them , he would establish his own country .
Somewhat fantastically ?
What would the Washington Post consider to be truly fantastic ?
A plan involving Godzilla ?
Clearly they have some very high standards .
I ’m sick of people taking these idiots seriously .
This plot is beyond fantastic , it ’s delusional .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - President George W. Bush eased pressure on financial markets Tuesday with assurances that a $ 700 billion bailout for the financial sector can be revived , but the crisis spread further through European banks .
The dollar rallied and U.S. stocks recovered 3 percent after suffering their blackest day in 20 years on Monday as the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the rescue plan .
The White House , Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson , congressional leaders and the two candidates hoping to succeed Bush as president , Sens. John McCain and Barack Obama , kept up a steady drumbeat of support for the plan , and around the world markets stabilized .
“ There ’s an overarching belief that at some point this week , whether it ’s Wednesday or Thursday , we ’ll get something passed by the House , ” said Arthur Hogan , chief market analyst at Jefferies & Co in Boston .
But global money markets remained frozen , and London interbank offered rates shot to record levels , indicating banks were not lending to each other .
The rate for overnight dollar loans rose to nearly 6.9 percent from just over 2.5 percent on Monday .
Without the bailout plan , which would allow the U.S. Treasury to buy toxic mortgage - related assets from banks , credit markets could remain frozen and lead to a recession .
“ I assure our citizens and citizens around the world that this is not the end of the legislative process , ” Bush said .
From Dublin to Moscow , the financial crisis was an ominous presence .
Ireland unveiled a blanket guarantee for savings held by its banks , and for the second time in a month Russia briefly shut down its stock markets .
France , Belgium and Luxembourg poured 6.4 billion euros into Franco - Belgian bank Dexia to avoid defaults on its loans , and France promised new bank measures to help savers .
Shares of British bank HBOS Plc fell on fears that Lloyds TSB Group Plc could renegotiate a deal to buy HBOS .
Dutch banking and insurance group Fortis and regional U.S. bank Wachovia succumbed on Monday .
Wall Street stocks rose as investors bet the bailout package would be approved by the U.S. Congress this week .
The dollar rose against the yen and oil rebounded .
European stocks recovered from earlier losses .
The White House said Bush had “ constructive ” talks with McCain , a Republican , and Obama , a Democrat , on Tuesday .
Both presidential candidates have urged their fellow members of Congress to pass the bailout package and called for the limit on bank deposit insurance to be increased to boost confidence in banks .

Sen. Harry Reid and Sen. Mitch McConnell , the top Democrat and Republican in the U.S. Senate , promised swift action .
Congress was not in session on Tuesday because of a Jewish holiday .
The Senate could take up bailout legislation as early as Wednesday .
The House is to return on Thursday .
Lawmakers held discussions with each other and Bush administration officials on Tuesday to explore options , including possible changes in the measure the House defeated .

They could revise the bill or bring it up for another House vote .
The next vote could occur in the Senate , where there has been more bipartisan support for the plan .
Monday ’s defeat in the House was driven by a collection of Republicans and Democrats -- many of whom are in tight re-election races -- who received angry calls and e-mails from constituents upset at the idea of bailing out Wall Street .

Fox : Anarchists planning to ' crash ' RNC convention David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Monday July 7 , 2008
Print This Email This Since last summer , an anarchist group calling itself the RNC Welcoming Committee has been advertising its intention to be present at the Republican National Convention in St. Paul , MN this September , even releasing a video showing black - clad figures cheerfully spreading the word .
However , when a leaked plan for moving delegates in and out of the convention center was posted at Indymedia.org last week and online posts suggested the anarchist group was planning to blockade major bridges and intersections , the local Fox News affilliate became concerned that " the protesters goal is to block delegate access leaving the hotels on the six bridges leading to St. Paul , as well as into and out of the Xcel Center . "
By Monday , Fox News was spreading this local coverage nationwide , telling their audience that anarchists " have plans to crash the Republican Convention " and featuring an interview on local community radio with three members of the RNC Welcoming Committee over the banner " anarchists plan to cut off the arena from entering delegates . "
" We 're not trying to influence the Republicans , " stated one anarchist in the radio interview .
" They already know that people are against the war .
People are against pollution and global warming and racism .
The Republicans do n't seem to care . "
" We do n't think the political elite will stop because we ask nicely , " explained another .
" And so we advocate a strategy of direct action -- in this case , not letting them hold the convention . "
Fox concluded ominously that " the RNC Welcoming Committee says property destruction is not part of their plans -- but they would n't rule it out either . "
At the time of writing , both rncwelcomingcommittee.org and nornc.org were inaccessible , returning the message , " This account has been suspended .
Either the domain has been overused , or the reseller ran out of resources . "
However , a MySpace page for the group lists blockades as part of its strategy and describes the overall goal as " Crash the Convention 
We didnt get an invitation , but were showing up anyway .
This party will be what we make of it .
...
Together , we can derail the purely ceremonial show of this repressive system and remake it with our own hands and according to our own visions . "
Much of the RNC Welcoming Committee 's self - presentation has been tongue - in - cheek , making it difficult to know the group 's actual intentions .
For example , after the St. Paul Police Department ordered 234 tasers this spring , the RNC - WC announced it was doing the same -- although " due to a unique corporate - anarchist confidentiality agreement , the exact number of tasers or documentable evidence of this new order will not be disclosed " -- but that " convention delegates and attendees should feel free to enjoy their five - star hotels , three - course meals , and ' gentlemans clubs ' without fear of protest or disruption .
After all , if they follow the law and dont start any illegal wars or anything , what should they have to worry about ? "

The Other China : Beyond the Olympic Spotlight in Earthquake - Stricken Sichuan As Olympics begin , citizens demand to know why quake felled so many schools .
SHIFANG , China , Aug. 10 , 2008  --
Far from the pageantry and competition of the Beijing Olympics , there remains a dramatically different scene in China : one of loss and recovery in earthquake - stricken Sichuan Province .
President Hu Jintao declared that " hosting a successful Olympics ...[ is ] now the top priority of the country . "
As the world focuses on the Olympics , villages around the city of Chengdu are still sifting through the rubble from the magnitude 7.9 earthquake on May 12 .
Early last week , the ground shook again in Sichuan , the epicenter of the May earthquake that killed at least 70,000 people .
This time , the tremor measured 4.3 on the Richter scale .
Three aftershocks followed last week .
Shifang , a small town in Sichuan Province , is a part of China that exists far beyond the Olympic spotlight .
On the way from Chengdu to Shifang , the roads were lined with stacks of bricks and wire , precious resources salvaged by townspeople still digging through the rubble three months later .
A tractor sits where houses once stood , ready to pull out what little they can save .
A woman carries a basket on her back to collect materials they can use to rebuild .
" Over here , " Chen Weijie said , pointing at a high pile of rubble .
" That 's where my home once was . "
As he sifts through the piles , Chen proudly wears a Beijing Olympics t- shirt .
For many Chinese , the Olympics symbolize a triumphant effort by the Chinese government to debut China on the world stage .
This is the same Chinese government that grief - stricken parents hope to hold responsible for the schools that collapsed , leveling 7,000 classrooms and killing thousands of children .
Anger still festers in Shifang .
" How could the schools have so easily crumbled ? " one father asked ABC News last week .
Local government leaders have repeatedly promised to get to the bottom of why nearly every school in the earthquake zone collapsed .
Parents continue to demand answers from the Chinese government about why the public buildings fell " like tofu . "
After the quake , many parents accused local officials of corruption and negligence when the schools were constructed .
As the months wear on , there is little evidence that the government will conduct a full investigation on the building construction .
Inspection of the rubble thus far has been cursory , families complained .
Bulldozers have already cleared away the debris of collapsed schools .
An Olympic Escape
Some have threatened to take their cases to the central government in Beijing , but that does n't stop them from supporting one of the government 's top priorities , the Beijing Olympics .
" I work six days a week , looking for bricks , " Chen Banfen told ABC News .
After she finishes searching the rubble , she returns home to temporary housing to watch the Olympics .
It is her escape .
Survivors gathered in temporary housing provided by the local government and non-governmental organizations to watch the final legs of the Olympic torch relay and qualification competitions .
On Friday , they raised their glasses , and toasted one another as they watched the opening ceremonies .
Communities in Sichuan lit candles laid out in the shape of the five Olympic rings , to show their support .
This Olympic vigil in Sichuan was a strange role reversal from May , when the rest of the country held candlelit vigils for earthquake victims and survivors .
A Different Kind of Team USA
With the world focused on results of Olympic competitions , over 1,200 miles west of Beijing , there is another American team that is focused on a completely different challenge .
Wisconsin native Dee Galuba , global emergency operations manager of MercyCorps , has set up a makeshift warehouse in Sichuan 's capital city , Chengdu , and dispenses hygiene kits for displaced families .
A team of aid workers and volunteers works tirelessly to fill the hygiene kits with supplies , delivering them to temporary schools .
Galuba says it is easier to dispense the kits to the children instead of to parents .
" It can be a humiliating thing to sit there and wait in line as a full - grown adult , so [ we ] give it to the kids , " Galuba said .
" You see these happy faces , these kids running out with the kits . "
The volunteers have been working for over three months now , hoping to make a difference in a place that will require years of reconstruction .
Galuba hopes the world will remember the children and their families of the earthquake in a time when so many lenses are focused elsewhere .

McCain Collects Social Security
James Joyner · · 22 comments
AP ’s David Lieb has unearthed a major scandal : John McCain , who paid into the Social Security system for decades , is collecting benefits even though he thinks it ’s a bad system .
Although Republican presidential candidate John McCain has called Social Security “ a disgrace , ” he still cashes his own retirement check every month .
“ I ’m receiving the benefits , the system is broken and , unfortunately , my children and grandchildren , according to the trustees of the Social Security system , will not have the same benefits the present retirees have , ” McCain told reporters Thursday on his campaign bus .
McCain ’s 2007 tax return shows Social Security benefits of $ 23,157 for the year , an average of $ 1,929.75 a month .
He said he started receiving the payments “ whenever I was eligible . ”
This bit is amusing , too :
People are not required to take Social Security payments , according to B.J. Jarrett , a spokesman with the Social Security Administration .
“ An individual does have the right to refuse his / her Social Security retirement benefit .
However , Social Security is an entitlement program and an individual would essentially be forfeiting a benefit based upon contributions during his / her working lifetime , ” Jarrett said .
I bet further digging would reveal that , although McCain opposes earmarks in principle , he nonetheless takes them for Arizona .
Further , while he decries the influence of money in politics , he nonetheless accepts campaign contributions .
AllahPundit is similarly unimpressed with the scandal , musing , “ I wonder how many left - wing papers ran this story today alongside paid ads placed by the sort of multinational corporations they claim to loathe . ”
What ’s more , so far as I ’m aware , McCain does n’t oppose Social Security at all .
He merely thinks the current funding system is broken .
Which , by the way , pretty much everyone else does , too .
Worse yet , he wants to , um , fix it .
Indeed , this story is so obviously stupid that the only rationale I can think for it going out on the AP wire is as a backdoor way of mentioning , once again , that John McCain is old .

Text messaging is a wonderful thing .
It allows all of us to avoid that awful nonsense of using your telephone to actually talk to people .
Texting lets us have conversations with people in situations where calling is impossible ( work , a loud bar , while your date is in the bathroom ) .
They are also a great way to augment your game with the opposite sex .
Flirting via text message is a sacred art , and gives guys the opportunity to make use of those smiley faces that in any other context would clearly be the gayest thing ever .
While text messages have tremendously improved the quality of my life , the downside is that too many idiots in the world have no clue about proper texting etiquette .
Our discussion today will involve the do ’s and don’ts of text messaging , so you can avoid being a huge tool that drives everyone insane .
Some Texting Do’s
It is totally acceptable , if not encouraged , to send text messages while you ’re at work .
It allows you to actually get some shit done while you ’re telling your friend how much you want to bang the IT girl ( true story ) .
For some reason I enjoy receiving text messages at work much more than while I ’m at home .
The key is to maintain a five minute rule between sending and receiving texts so as to maximize your job productivity .
When you ’re out at the bar with your friends , texting at least occasionally during the evening is actually an important part of maintaining your social status .
Your stock with potential bangs will boost as they will view you as a person with a lot of friends ( and one whose love is sought after by other girls ) .
Just do n’t go overboard with it …you want to look socially connected , not like Mr. Douchey iPhone Guy .
Use texting to maintain flirt contact with girls you are pursuing .
It ’s a great way to keep you fresh in their minds without being the psycho guy who calls the very next day ( and the day after that ) .
A corollary to this is the post - date text .
This is an essential part of proper courtship in this day and age , and is a perfect way to gauge how much the girl wants you .
The post - date text usually occurs immediately upon both parties returning home , when the alcohol mixed with that great line you ended the night with really starts to sink in .
She ’ll probably say something about having a great time that night , followed by some allusion to future sex if you have played your cards right .
Please text me if a quick clarification or confirmation of plans is necessary .
Do n’t waste my time by calling me twice in thirty minutes .
Girls do this all the time and it drives me nuts .
DEFINITELY text that booty call on the late night .
There ’s nothing like the offer to “ watch a movie ” at 2:30 in the morning , which both parties willingly agree to with the unspoken understanding that the proposed activity is a complete crock of shit .
Consequently , I ’ve watched the first ten minutes of Mr. Deeds approximately thirty - seven times ( I have no idea why this movie is my go - to for drunk hookups ) .
I ’m pretty sure that the late night booty call message is why texting was invented in the first place .
Some Texting Don’ts
For the love of god please stop texting throughout the entire movie that I paid six thousand dollars to go see .
Guess what , that little light that your stupid phone gives off every time you open your phone is incredibly distracting .
If someone calls you while you are in a movie , you are permitted to send ONE text message to say “ I ’m in a movie ” or something to that effect .
That ’s it , just one , ladies and gentlemen .
This is for the girls out there : if I ’m buying you dinner , put the god damn phone away .
Seriously .
There is nothing more irritating than when a girl texts throughout an entire evening of dinner and drinks .
The old “ never answer your phone during dinner ” rule has been around for decades and for the most part is still in effect .
Texting is no different , put the fucking phone away , you texting whore .
Never , EVER , ask a girl to hang out for the first time through a text message .
This is one of the few times when the efficiency of texting is overruled by the need to look awesome .
Nothing is more beta than this sophomoric move , and the girl will most certainly take notice of your lack of balls .
The first - hangout - request phone call is a power move that is crucial to closing the deal , so do n’t pass up the opportunity .
Guys : DO NOT use texting slang .
It ’s just embarrassing , and quite frankly makes you look like a total wiener .
Whenever I see a guy type “ C U L8R PLS TXT ME 2NITE ” to his girlfriend it makes me want to throw up all over his phone .
This carries the dual advantage of relieving my nausea as well as rendering the offender ’s phone completely useless , thus preventing any further damage to society at large .
Leave the texting abbreviations to the eleventeen year olds , please .
Do n’t carry on extensive text messaging conversations while in public .
Save the marathon text flirting / bullshitting sessions for when you ’re on your couch at home alone .
It ’s funny to watch how people that get wrapped up in these long texting bouts sit in public , crouched over their phones like Quasimodo , while real world interaction passes them by .
People who ca n’t be peeled away from their phone while in public have a weak constitution .
There is really no point to sending me a text that just says “ k. ” I always feel as if I was cheated out of ten cents when I receive one of those .
Even a simple “ sounds good ” is sufficient .
“ K ” is just retarded to me for some reason .
Hopefully by following this handy guide to texting etiquette , you can maximize the benefits of texting while minimizing the “ OMFG get a load of this guy ” syndrome .
I know this list is far from complete , however , so I turn it over to you guys .
What principles of texting etiquette did I miss , loyal readers ?
As long as we have had prisons , we have had prison escapes .
This is a list of the 10 most daring and amazing escapes from prison in history .
This adds to our collection of crime related lists , such as tips for escaping the cops , tips for committing the perfect crime , and prison survival tips .
10 Maze Prison Escape
In the biggest prison escape in British history , on 25 September 1983 in County Antrim , Northern Ireland , 38 Irish Republican Army ( IRA ) prisoners , who had been convicted of offenses including murder and causing explosions , escaped from H - Block 7 ( H7 ) of the prison .
One prison officer died of a heart attack as a result of the escape and twenty others were injured , including two who were shot with guns that had been smuggled into the prison .
HM Prison Maze was considered one of the most escape - proof prisons in Europe .
In addition to 15 - foot fences , each H - Block was encompassed by an 18 - foot concrete wall topped with barbed wire , and all gates on the complex were made of solid steel and electronically operated .
Shortly after 2:30 , the prisoners took control of the H - block holding the prison guards hostage at gunpoint .
Some of the prisoners took the guards clothing and car keys in order to help with their escape .
At 3:25 , a truck bringing food supplies arrived and the prisoners told the driver that he was going to help them escape .
They tied his foot to the clutch and told him where to drive .
At 3:50 the truck left the H - block , and soon after the prison , carrying all 38 men .
Over the next few days , 19 escapees were caught .
The remaining escapees were assisted by the IRA in finding hiding places .
Some of the group ended up in the USA but were later found and extradited .
Due to politics in Northern Ireland , none of the remaining escapees are being actively sought and some have been given amnesties .
Note the wires strung across the yard in the picture above – this is to prevent helicopters from landing due to another escape attempt at Maze Prison .

9 Alfred Hinds
“ Alfie ” Hinds was a British criminal and escape artist who , while serving a 12 year prison sentence for robbery , successfully broke out of three high security prisons .
Despite the dismissal of thirteen of his appeals to higher courts , he was eventually able to gain a pardon using his knowledge of the British legal system .
After being sentenced to 12 years in prison for a jewelry robbery , Hinds escaped from Nottingham prison by sneaking through the locked doors and over a 20 - foot prison wall for which he became known in the press as “ Houdini ” Hinds .
After 6 months he was found and arrested .
After his arrest , Hinds brought a lawsuit against authorities charging the prison commissioners with illegal arrest and successfully used the incident as a means to plan his next escape by having a padlock smuggled in to him while at the Law Courts .
Two guards escorted him to the toilet , but when they removed his handcuffs Alfie bundled the men into the cubicle and snapped the padlock onto screw eyes that his accomplices had earlier fixed to the door .
He escaped into the crowd on Fleet Street but was captured at an airport five hours later .
Hinds would make his third escape from Chelmsford Prison less than a year later .
While eluding Scotland Yard , Hinds continued to plead his innocence sending memorandums to British MPs and granting interviews and taped recordings to the press .
He would continue to appeal his arrest and , following a technicality in which prison escapes are not listed as misdemeanors within British law , his final appeal before the House of Lords in 1960 was denied after a three hour argument by Hinds before his return to serve 6 years in Parkhurst Prison .
Pictured above is Nottingham Prison – the first prison that Hinds escaped from .

8 The Texas Seven
The Texas 7 was a group of prisoners who escaped from the John Connally Unit near Kenedy , Texas on December 13 , 2000 .
They were apprehended January 21 - 23 , 2001 as a direct result of the television show America ’s Most Wanted .
On December 13 , 2000 , the seven carried out an elaborate scheme and escaped from the John B. Connally Unit , a maximum - security state prison near the South Texas town of Kenedy .
Using several well - planned ploys , the seven convicts overpowered and restrained nine civilian maintenance supervisors , four correctional officers and three uninvolved inmates at approximately 11:20 a.m .
The escape occurred during the slowest period of the day when there would be less surveillance of certain locations like the maintenance area — during lunch and at count time .
Most of these plans involved one of the offenders calling someone over , while another hit the unsuspecting person on the head from behind .
Once the victim was subdued , the offenders would remove some of his clothing , tie him up , gag him and place him in an electrical room behind a locked door .
Eleven prison workers and three uninvolved inmates were bound and gagged .
The attackers stole clothing , credit cards , and identification from their victims .
The group also impersonated prison officers on the phone and created false stories to ward off suspicion from authorities .
They eventually made their way to the prison maintenance pickup - truck which they used to escape from the prison grounds .
The remaining 5 living members of the group are all on death row awaiting death by lethal injection .
Of the other two , one committed suicide and one has already been executed .

7 Alfréd Wetzler
Wetzler was a Slovak Jew , and one of a very small number of Jews known to have escaped from the Auschwitz death camp during the Holocaust .
Wetzler is known for the report that he and his fellow escapee , Rudolf Vrba , compiled about the inner workings of the Auschwitz camp – a ground plan of the camp , construction details of the gas chambers , crematoriums and , most convincingly , a label from a canister of Zyklon gas .
The 32 - page Vrba-Wetzler report , as it became known , was the first detailed report about Auschwitz to reach the West that the Allies regarded as credible .
The evidence eventually led to the bombing of several government buildings in Hungary , killing Nazi officials who were instrumental in the railway deportations of Jews to Auschwitz .
The deportations halted , saving up to 120,000 Hungarian Jews .
Wetzler escaped with a fellow Jew named Rudolf Vrba .
With the help of the camp underground , at 2 p.m. on Friday , April 7 , 1944 — the eve of Passover — the two men climbed inside a hollowed - out hiding place in a wood pile that was being stored to build the “ Mexico ” section for the new arrivals .
It was outside Birkenau ’s barbed - wire inner perimeter , but inside an external perimeter the guards kept erected during the day .
The other prisoners placed boards around the hollowed - out area to hide the men , then sprinkled the area with pungent Russian tobacco soaked in gasoline to fool the guards ’ dogs .
The two remained in hiding for 4 nights – to avoid recapture .
On April 10 , wearing Dutch suits , overcoats , and boots they had taken from the camp , they made their way south , walking parallel to the So ? a river , heading for the Polish border with Slovakia 80 miles ( 133 km . ) away , guiding themselves using a page from a child ’s atlas that Vrba had found in the warehouse .

6 S?awomir Rawicz
Rawicz was a Polish soldier who was arrested by Soviet occupation troops after the German - Soviet invasion of Poland .
When the Soviet Union and Germany took over Poland , Rawicz returned to Pi?sk where NKVD arrested him on November 19 , 1939 .
He was taken to Moscow .
He was first sent to Kharkov for interrogation , and then after trial he was sent to the Lubyanka prison in Moscow .
He claims to have successfully resisted all attempts to torture a confession out of him in prison .
He was sentenced , ostensibly for spying , to 25 years of hard labor in a Siberian prison camp .
He was transported , alongside thousands of others , to Irkutsk and made to walk to Camp 303 , 650 km south of the Arctic Circle , to build the camp from the ground up .
On 9 April 1941 , Rawicz claimed that he and his six allies escaped in a middle of a blizzard .
They rushed to the south , avoiding towns in fear they would be betrayed , but apparently they were not actively pursued .
They also met an additional fugitive , Polish woman Krystyna .
Nine days later they crossed the Lena River .
They walked around Lake Baikal and crossed to Mongolia .
Fortunately , people they encountered were friendly and hospitable .
During the crossing of the Gobi desert , two of the group ( Krystyna and Makowski ) died .
Others had to eat snakes to survive .
Around October 1941 they claim to have reached Tibet .
Locals were friendly , especially when men said they were trying to reach Lhasa .
They crossed the Himalayas somehow in the middle of winter .
Another of the group died in his sleep in the cold and one fell into a crevasse and disappeared .
Rawicz claims the survivors reached India around March 1942 .

5 Escape From Alcatraz
In its 29 years of operation , there were 14 attempts to escape from Alcatraz prison involving 34 inmates .
Officially , every escape attempt failed , and most participants were either killed or quickly re-captured .
However , the participants in the 1937 and 1962 attempts , though presumed dead , disappeared without a trace , giving rise to popular theories that they were successful .
The most famous and intricate attempt to escape from Alcatraz ( June 11 , 1962 ) saw Frank Morris , and the Anglin brothers burrow out of their cells , climb to the top of the cell block , cut through bars to make it to the roof via an air vent .
From there they climbed down a drain pipe , over a chain link fence and then to the shore where they assembled a pontoon - type raft and then vanished .
The trio are believed to have drowned in the San Francisco Bay and are officially listed as missing and presumed drowned .
However , they may have made it and gone to a place where people did not know them .

4 Libby Prison Escape
The Libby Prison Escape was one of the most famous ( and successful ) prison breaks during the American Civil War .
Overnight between February 9 and 10 , 1864 , more than 100 imprisoned Union soldiers broke out of their prisoner of war building at Libby Prison in Richmond , Virginia .
Of the 109 escapees , 59 succeeded in reaching Union lines , 48 were recaptured , and 2 drowned in the nearby James River .
Libby Prison encompassed an entire city block in Richmond .
To the north lay Carey Street , connecting the prison area to the rest of the city .
On the south side ran the James River .
The prison itself stood three stories above ground with a basement exposed on the river side .
Living conditions were extremely bad ; the food , sometimes lacking altogether , was poor and sanitation practically nonexistent .
Thousands died there .
The prisoners managed to break in to the basement area known as “ rat hell ” which was no longer used due to rat infestations , and dig a tunnel .
After 17 days of digging , they succeeded in breaking through to a 50 - foot vacant lot on the eastern side of the prison , resurfacing beneath a tobacco shed inside the grounds of the nearby Kerr ’s Warehouse .
When Col .
Rose finally broke through to the other side , he told his men that the “ Underground Railroad to God ’s Country was open ! ”
The officers escaped the prison in groups of two and three on the night of February 9 , 1864 .
Once within the tobacco shed , the men collected inside the walled warehouse yard and simply strolled out the front gate .
The tunnel provided enough distance from the prison to stealthily subvert those jurisdictional lines and allow prisoners to slip into the dark streets unchallenged .

3 Pascal Payet
There can be no doubt that this man deserves a place on this list – he has escaped not once , but twice from high security prisons in France – each time via hijacked helicopter !
He also helped organize the escape of three other prisoners – again with a helicopter .
Payet was initially sentenced to a 30 year jail term for a murder committed during the robbery of a security van .
After his first escape ( in 2001 ) he was captured and given seven more years for his role in the 2003 escape .
He then escaped from Grasse prison using a helicopter that was hijacked by four masked men from Cannes - Mandelieu airport .
The helicopter landed some time later at Brignoles , 38 kilometres north - east of Toulon , France on the Mediterranean coast .
Payet and his accomplices then fled the scene and the pilot was released unharmed .
Payet was re-captured on September 21 , 2007 , in Mataró , Spain , about 18 miles northeast of Barcelona .
He had undergone cosmetic surgery , but was still identified by Spanish police .

2 The Great Escape
Stalag Luft III was a German Air Force prisoner - of - war camp during World War II that housed captured air force personnel .
In January 1943 , Roger Bushell led a plot for a major escape from the camp .
The plan was to dig three deep tunnels , codenamed “ Tom , ” “ Dick , ” and “ Harry . ”
Each of the tunnel entrances was carefully selected to ensure they were undetectable by the camp guards .
In order to keep the tunnels from being detected by the perimeter microphones , they were very deep — about 9 metres ( 30 ft ) below the surface .
The tunnels were very small , only two feet square ( about 0.37 m² ) , though larger chambers were dug to house the air pump , a workshop , and staging posts along each tunnel .
The sandy walls of the tunnels were shored up with pieces of wood scavenged from all over the camp .
As the tunnels grew longer , a number of technical innovations made the job easier and safer .
One important issue was ensuring that the person digging had enough oxygen to breathe and keep his lamps lit .
A pump was built to push fresh air along the ducting into the tunnels .
Later , electric lighting was installed and hooked into the camp ’s electrical grid .
The tunnellers also installed small rail car systems for moving sand more quickly , much like the systems used in old mining operations .
The rails were key to moving 130 tons of material in a five - month period ; they also reduced the time taken for tunnellers to reach the digging faces .
“ Harry ” was finally ready in March 1944 , but by that time the American prisoners , some of whom had worked extremely hard in all the effort to dig the tunnels , were moved to another compound .
The prisoners had to wait about a week for a moonless night so that they could leave under the cover of complete darkness .
Finally , on Friday , March 24 , the escape attempt began .
Unfortunately for the prisoners , the tunnel had come up short .
It had been planned that the tunnel would reach into a nearby forest , but the first man out emerged just short of the tree line .
Despite this , 76 men crawled through the tunnel to initial freedom , even through an air raid during which the camp ’s ( and the tunnel ’s ) electric lights were shut off .
Finally , at 5 AM on March 25 , the 77th man was seen emerging from the tunnel by one of the guards .
Out of the 76 men only 3 evaded capture .
Fifty men were killed and the rest were captured and sent back .

1 Colditz Escape
Colditz was one of the most famous German Army prisoner - of - war camps for officers in World War II .
The camp was located in Colditz Castle , situated on a cliff overlooking the town of Colditz in Saxony .
There were numerous successful attempts at escaping Colditz , but one in particular is the most interesting .
In one of the most ambitious escape attempts from Colditz , the idea of building a glider was dreamt up by two British pilots , Jack Best and Bill Goldfinch , who had been sent to Colditz after escaping from another POW camp .
The plan was to construct a two - man glider part by part .
The glider was assembled by Bill Goldfinch and Jack Best in the lower attic above the chapel , and was to be launched from the roof in order to fly across the river Mulde , which was about 200 feet ( 60 m ) below .
The officers who took part in the project built a false wall , to hide the secret space in the attic where they slowly built the glider out of stolen pieces of wood .
Since the Germans were accustomed to looking down for tunnels , not up for secret workshops , they felt rather safe from detection .
Hundreds of ribs had to be constructed , predominantly formed from bed slats , but also from every other piece of wood the POW ’s could surreptitiously obtain .
The wing spars were constructed from floor boards .
Control wires were made from electrical wiring in unused portions of the castle .
A glider expert , Lorne Welch , was asked to review the stress diagrams and calculations made by Goldfinch .
Although the Colditz Cock never flew in real life , a replica of the Colditz glider was built for the 2000 Channel 4 “ Escape from Colditz ” documentary , and was flown successfully by John Lee on its first attempt at RAF Odiham with Best and Goldfinch in tearful attendance .
While Best and Goldfinch did not escape Colditz ( the camp was relieved by the allies just as the glider was nearing completion ) , they certainly had the most interesting and innovative method for executing it .

The RNC , hoping against hope that Obama will get in some windsurfing on his vacation , is keeping close tabs on the Democrat as he enjoys some time off in Hawaii .
They just sent over this bulletin : " The Honolulu Star Bulletin reports Barack Obama ate popcorn and watched the 3:40 showing of the Dark Knight in theater 9 yesterday . "
Seeing a summer action flick and eating popcorn is hardly elitist , but wait , there is more .
Obama has said , the RNC hastens to note , that Batman and Spiderman are his favorite superheroes , citing their " inner turmoil . "
Ahh , there it is .
Real , red - blooded Americans , evidently , are only supposed to like superheroes because they have nifty outfits and beat up the bad guys .
To look beyond the surface or glean some larger meaning from the characters naturally implies Obama has the sort of egghead end effette approach to life that would leaad us to analyze our enemies instead of defeat them .
Or something like that .
It would be easier if he just went wind - surfing .

Advertisement German doctors have carried out a complete double arm transplant .
The patient was a 54 - year - old farmer who lost his limbs in an accident six years ago .
The donor is believed to be a teenager who had died shortly before the surgery .
Neither man 's name has been released by the Munich clinic .
The 15 - hour operation took place last week , and the patient is recovering well , though it could be two years before he can move his new hands .
Arm transplants have been carried out before - the first occurred in Austria in 2003 when a man received transplanted forearms and hands .
The patient with one of his new limbs
In this procedure , limbs were reattached just below the shoulder .
Reiner Gradinger , medical director at the Munich University Clinic where the operation involving 40 doctors , nurses and assistants took place over 15 hours last week , said : " The reattachment appears up to now to have proceeded optimally . "
Surgeon Edgar Biemer said the greatest challenge was establishing blood flow between the farmer 's body and muscles in the new arms because the muscles have a limited lifespan .
And he said : " We discussed with the patient that he would have to deal with the fact that his hands were from somebody else .
" But this was discussed before the first heart transplant , and in reality nobody really cared about that . "
Doctors are monitoring the patient closely to make sure his body does not reject the new limbs .
Long wait
The patient cannot move his new arms but doctors hope his network of nerves will expand at a pace of around one millimetre ( 0.04 inches ) per day .
How the farmer was before the operation Even if that happens , it could still be two years before the patient can manipulate his new hands .
Hans - Guenther Machens , director of hand and plastic surgery at the Klinikum rechts der Isar clinic , said : " The regeneration process will take a long time . "
UK transplant expert Nadey Hakim , head of the transplant unit at London 's Hammersmith Hospital , said the higher up an amputation on the arms , the easier it was to connect new limbs , as there were fewer nerves and only one bone to connect .
But he added : " It is going to be quite difficult to get any sensation .
The higher it is , the harder it is .
" Flexing and bending the arm is also going to be hard . "
" He is going to require intensive physiotherapy every day for many months . "

What are these ?
I know it 's terribly elitist to believe that a potential president might actually have a single coherent public statement on foreign policy before her selection as veep - candidate ; it 's unforgivably snooty to believe that someone who had no opinion on the surge except that it should be an exit plan is self - evidently unfit to be John McCain 's running mate ; I know that it's now hyper - lefty and condescending to believe that a candidate should actually care whether what she says is true or not .
But what does it say about a candidate whose sole alleged expertise is energy and whose sole experience is in Alaska ... that she cannot get a basic fact right about the only area where she is supposed to know anything ?
And then keeps repeating a lie about it ?
Remember how John McCain introduced her :
Gov. Sarah Palin " knows more about energy than probably anyone in the United States of America . " - Sept. 10
Just no more than a ten year old with access to Google .
We want to hear what you think about this article .
Submit a letter to the editor or write to letters@theatlantic.com .
Last spring , I wrote a little essay called " Digital Maoism " for the science debate Web site Edge.org , which is orchestrated by writer and literary agent John Brockman .
The essay quickly took on a life of its own , spawning an ongoing series of commentary both in print and online .
My central point in the original piece was that the current fad for aggregating the efforts of multitudes of people over the Internet is moving the Web in the wrong direction .
The subsequent debates have touched on a number of important ideas that I would like to follow up on here .
Part of my argument admittedly focuses on highly personal values , such as my concern that collective online creations like Wikipedia have made the Web less expressive by absorbing the efforts of hordes of volunteer authors into an overly regularized scheme .
I miss the challenging quirkiness of Web sites that have fallen into neglect since the rise of Wikipedia .
It 's a shame to see the Internet world increasingly diffracted by a single organizing principle , when the whole point of the Web for me is to experience the strangeness of other points of view .
( I find blogs and other recent online fads both overly structured and too transient to replace the odd , revelatory worldviews laid bare in the original generation of Web pages . )
Some people agree with me , some do n't , and others cannot even understand why I am making any point at all about this .
It 's a matter of taste and perspective .
Other parts of my argument are more easily framed as scientific , or at least empirical , questions .
An example is the problem of how to predict when the " wisdom of crowds " will work effectively .
The term is best known as the title of a book by James Surowiecki and is often introduced with the story of an ox in a marketplace .
In the story , a bunch of people all guess the animal 's weight , and the average of their guesses turns out to be generally more reliable than any one person 's estimate .
A common idea about why this works is that the mistakes various people make cancel each other out ; an additional , more important idea is that there 's at least a little bit of correctness in the logic and assumptions underlying many of the guesses , so they center around the right answer .
( This latter formulation emphasizes that individual intelligence is still at the core of the collective phenomenon . )
At any rate , the effect is repeatable and is widely held to be one of the foundations of both market economies and democracies .
People have tried to tap into this collective wisdom in a variety of ways in recent years .
There are experiments in using stock market–like systems , in which people bet on ideas to answer seemingly unanswerable questions , like when terrorist events will occur or when stem cell therapy will allow a person to grow new teeth .
There is also an enormous amount of energy being put into aggregating the judgments of Internet users to create content , as in the collectively generated link Web site Digg .
Unfortunately , crowd dynamics are not always reliable .
Markets have their tulip crazes , leading to bubbles and crashes , and crowds can turn into lynch mobs .
Institutions that rely on crowds usually develop mechanisms to prevent such pathologies .
Stock markets might adopt automatic trading shutoffs , for instance , which are triggered by overly abrupt shifts in price or trading volume .
Wikipedia has had to put restrictions on how people edit entries in order to soften the level of chaos and conflict over controversial items .
The Net has for the most part delivered happy surprises about human group potential .
For instance , the rise of the Web in the early 1990s took place without leaders , ideology , advertising , commerce , or anything else other than a positive sensibility shared by millions of people .
Who would have thought that was possible ?
It stands to reason , however , that the Net can also accentuate negative patterns of behavior or even bring about unforeseen social pathology .
Over the last century , new media technologies have often become prominent as components of massive outbreaks of organized violence .
For example , the Nazi regime was a major pioneer of television and cinematic propaganda .
After a generation or so , people seem to become less affected by the power of a new electronic medium .
Many people in the Muslim world have only recently gained access to satellite TV and the Internet ; I wonder if that has something to do with the current wave of violent radicalism .
I also worry about the next generation of kids around the world growing up with Internet - based technology that emphasizes aggregation , as is the current fad .
Will they be more likely to turn into a mob when they come of age ?
Since the Internet makes crowds more accessible , it would be beneficial to have a general and clear set of rules explaining when the wisdom of crowds is likely to produce meaningful results .
Surowiecki proposes four principles in his book ; in my essay , I came up with three .
His rules are framed from the perspective of the interior dynamics of the crowd .
For instance , he suggests there should be limits on the ability of members of the crowd to see how others are about to decide on a question , in order to preserve independence and avoid mob behavior .
My proposed rules are a little different from Surowiecki's in that they are framed more from the outside looking in at the crowd .
For example , I would argue that a crowd should n't be allowed to frame its own questions and that the answers should never be more complicated than a single number or a single multiple - choice answer .
I also propose that techniques usually associated with signal processing should be applied to crowds , like gradually changing how fast a crowd can act based on how it is performing .
Maybe if you combined our approaches you'd get the magic seven rules ; maybe those could be compressed into a smaller number .
Then again , maybe one or both of us are on the wrong track .
The problem is that there 's been inadequate testing of such ideas .
Numerous projects have looked at how to improve specific markets and other crowd - wisdom systems , but too few projects have framed the question in more general terms or tested general hypotheses about how the systems work .
What a rich area to study !
There is another potential pitfall of crowd wisdom : the ability of information technology to lock in cultural or behavioral patterns .
Suppose you do n't set the rules effectively in advance and the crowd acts in an ugly way .
If the connections within the crowd are mediated by digital technology , then an engineering challenge stands in the way of fixing the problem .
Internet - based designs like Wikipedia and Digg are enjoying a period of open possibility right now , but that wo n't last forever .
The Internet at present is analogous to that digital Eden of the early 1980s , when personal computers still seemed mercurial and infinitely mutable .
Layers of digital design can become locked in place because other layers come to depend on them .
The PC , for example , has become a standardized thing with windows , a mouse , a hard disk divided into files , and so on .
Our computers could have come out quite differently ; the Macintosh was originally conceived without files as we know them today , although it acquired them before it shipped .
Today , ideas like files and windows have become so entrenched that they might as well be elementary particles .
While those ideas are probably not terribly influential on human behavior , locked - in Internet - based designs could be decisively important .
That 's why there is such passion from all sides about the battles over things like digital rights management , digital privacy , and Net neutrality :
When life is digital , any battle might turn out to be the end of the war .
If a more restrictive outcome gets locked in , it becomes profoundly difficult to reverse .
We are spectacularly lucky that the people whose early experiments turned into the Internet conceived of an optimistic open design that happened to get locked in .
The legacy effect might eventually ossify aspects of the Net that are now fluid .
There is an astonishing and widespread denial about this process in some corners of the software world , particularly in the trendier domains of open source .
The situation might improve in the future , but that will require fundamental improvements in the way we do computer science .
I hope it happens .
In my professional life , it 's the problem that I work on the hardest .
I 'll talk more about that in a future column .
There is a third empirical problem to tackle , and it is the least comfortable .
To what degree is mob behavior an inborn element of human nature ?
There are competing clichés about human identity : that we naturally and inevitably form into competing packs or that we would refrain from doing so if only we had decent gang - free peer groups in our teens .
These theories can actually be tested .
The genetic aspects of behavior that have received the most attention ( under rubrics like sociobiology or evolutionary psychology ) have tended to focus on things like gender differences and mating strategies , but my guess is that clan orientation will turn out to be the most important area of study .
I hope that improved understanding of the problems I 've mentioned will come about before the Net can contribute to any large - scale outbreak of bad human behavior .
A better and more general model of when the wisdom of crowds functions and when it breaks down will help us avoid Web - based designs that elicit cruel or stupid mob behavior .
A better technical approach to avoiding the lock - in effect will help us correct mistakes along those lines if they occur .
And a clearer picture of the nastier side of our genetic legacy will help us design information systems to avoid triggering evil behavior .
We need such breakthroughs soon .
Based on the ever - growing influence of the Net , my guess is that we have about 10 years to seek out the answers .
TEHRAN ( Reuters ) - Iran ’s president called on Tuesday for developing nations to unite against what he said was bias by the U.N. Security Council , which the Islamic Republic accuses of siding with the West in a nuclear row .
Iran wants to broaden international support for what it says is a peaceful drive to use nuclear technology but which the United States and the West says is a bid to make atomic bombs .
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad told ministers from the Non- Aligned Movement ( NAM ) in Tehran that the Security Council and other world bodies were being manipulated by some world powers .
He accused the powers of trying to deny others peaceful nuclear energy while they themselves stockpiled atomic weapons .
“ The major powers are on a descending course .
The extent of their influence drops day by day .
They are approaching the end of their era , ” Ahmadinejad told the gathering .
NAM , now with 118 members plus observers , was set up in 1961 to group many newly independent nations which wanted to avoid being caught up in the Cold War between Moscow and Washington .
It has struggled to stay relevant since the Soviet Union fell .
The movement has previously voiced support for Iran ’s peaceful use of nuclear energy and backed Tehran ’s cooperation with the U.N. watchdog , the International Atomic Energy Agency .
A draft statement , obtained by Reuters , echoed this .
But diplomats working on the statement said it was “ watered down ” from a more strongly worded document initially proposed by Iran .
“ Any measure to change the world conditions and realize the joint interests of member states will not be possible except through effective efforts and collective cooperation of member states , ” Ahmadinejad said in his address .
He called for an “ arbitration council ” to mediate in disputes and a fund to back development in NAM .
He said the Security Council would never issue a resolution against the United States , Iran ’s arch - foe , as long as Washington , like four other big powers , had a permanent seat .
The permanent council members have veto powers .
“ WATERED DOWN ”
“ We only pray that Iran , together with the International Atomic Energy Agency , together with the ... big powers , sit down and resolve this matter amicably , ” Tanzanian Foreign Minister Bernard Membe told Reuters on the sidelines of the meeting .

Diplomats on working group drawing up a statement on Iran ’s atomic program said Iran had proposed that NAM describe U.N. sanctions imposed on Iran as political and that it call for their swift removal .
They said this point had been dropped .
“ It is very watered down , ” said one Asian diplomat .
“ The members do n’t speak with one voice on this issue . ”
Diplomats said those against Iran ’s initial draft included regional rival Saudi Arabia and Egypt , with which Iran does not have full ties .
The United Arab Emirates , which has a border dispute with Iran , was also against it as were some non-Arabs .

However , the draft included a call for all parties to resolve the dispute in talks “ without any preconditions ” , a point Iran often stresses , and said any attack on peaceful nuclear facilities would violate U.N. and international law .
United States and Israel have not ruled out military action if Iran ’s nuclear row cannot be resolved by diplomacy .
Six world powers -- the United States , Britain , France , Germany , Russia and China -- have offered Iran nuclear , trade and other incentives if its suspends uranium enrichment , a process that can have both civilian and military uses .
Iran has refused .
It has also , so far , not given any sign it is ready to freeze expansion of its nuclear work in return for a halt to steps to impose more U.N. sanctions , a proposal aimed at getting preliminary talks going before formal talks start .
Western powers on July 19 gave Iran two weeks to respond .
Russia , which takes a softer line , has opposed such deadlines .
Palin : McCain campaign 's end - run around media NEWS ANALYSIS GOP 's sheltering of vice presidential hopeful seen as damaging to candidate , voters

The McCain campaign is attempting to do something unheard of in the modern political era .
It is not just running against the mainstream media , it is running around it .
This strategy is not so much expressed in McCain campaign manager Steve Schmidt 's declaration last week that the New York Times is " 150 percent in the tank " for Democratic Sen .
Barack Obama or the media - bashing by several speakers at this month 's Republican National Convention .
It 's more about the GOP 's continued sheltering of its vice presidential nominee , Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin .
She has yet to hold a major press conference 32 days after McCain announced her as his running mate - and that 's not changing anytime soon .
McCain spokesman Michael Goldfarb said Palin will do at least one news conference before election day .
That could mean that the person who could potentially lead the free world will have done one national press conference before being sworn into office .
The Democratic vice presidential nominee , Joe Biden , has given more than 89 national and local interviews over roughly the same period of time .
Other than TV interviews with CBS anchor Katie Couric , ABC anchor Charlie Gibson and conservative Fox News commentator Sean Hannity , Palin has n't engaged the press .
The effort to shield her is so intense that when she met with foreign leaders in New York last week , the campaign initially would only allow photographers near her .
No favors
" I do n't think the campaign is doing her any favors by not letting her answer any questions , " said PBS political editor Judy Woodruff , who has covered politics for 30 years for CNN and PBS .
" If she 's elected vice president of the United States and were she to succeed to the presidency , she needs that interchange with journalists .
The American people have a right to know what does she know and how does she think . "
" The media needs to continue to say , every day , until she has a news conference , ' When is she going to have a news conference ?
Why is n't she having one ? '
I just find it astounding , " Woodruff said .
" I think the media has a responsibility to continue to point out that this is unlike any presidential or vice presidential candidate in memory .
She has been more bottled up . "
When television news outlets threatened not to run any images of her meeting with Afghan president Hamid Karzai on Tuesday unless reporters were allowed in as well , the campaign allowed CNN - which was providing the pool report for the event - inside .
Briefly .
According to the network , " CNN 's producer and other photographers were allowed in the room for just 29 seconds . "
Last week ,
The Chronicle began a " Free Sarah Palin " campaign on its Politics blog , documenting the continuing lack of access to the candidate .
The effort was echoed by CNN host Campbell Brown , who called on " the McCain campaign to stop treating Sarah Palin like she is a delicate flower that will wilt at any moment . "
" This woman is from Alaska , for crying out loud .
She is strong .
She is tough .
She is confident .
And you claim she is ready to be one heartbeat away from the presidency .
If that is the case , then end this chauvinistic treatment of her now .
Allow her to show her stuff , " Brown said .
" Free Sarah Palin . "
The real loser in this game of hide - the - candidate : voters .
Palin was not well - known outside of conservative circles before the campaign chose her .
Polls , including one taken by the Pew Research Center , taken over the past few days show that Palin 's approval rating has dropped since she was nominated .
" The lack of access is potentially damaging in the eyes of the voter , because they are trying to get to know the candidate , " said Paul Dimock , associate director of the nonpartisan Pew Research Center for People and the Press .
Palin is especially vulnerable because voters know McCain , Obama and Biden better , he said .
" The McCain campaign has discovered it has a major problem , " said Sally Jenkins , president of the Women 's Media Center .
" Increasingly , it has become clear that she does n't have a grasp of the issues .
If I were John McCain , I 'd be doing the same thing with her . "
No incentive
But Jenkins said the campaign does n't have an incentive to give the media more Palin face time .
" If there is anybody more despised than Congress , it 's the media . "
So what can the media do ?
Jenkins said they should n't have given in to the campaign 's demands last week during Palin 's New York visit .
" At some point , the media has to stop cooperating with the campaign . "
Friday , syndicated conservative columnist Kathleen Parker had seen enough of Palin - and called on her to withdraw .
" Palin 's recent interviews with Charles Gibson , Sean Hannity and now Katie Couric have all revealed an attractive , earnest , confident candidate .
Who Is Clearly Out Of Her League , " Parker wrote at the National Review Online .
" Palin filibusters .
She repeats words , filling space with deadwood .
Cut the verbiage and there 's not much content there , " Parker wrote .
" If BS were currency , Palin could bail out Wall Street herself . "
But other news executives say what the McCain campaign is doing is not that unusual .
" All politicians go through a stage where they want to minimize how much they are exposed to the media , " said Paul Friedman , vice president of news at CBS , the network that scored one of the three major Palin interviews .
He shrugged at what could be learned in a news conference that could n't in a one - on - one interview .
" I just do n't think it is that cosmic of an issue .
We 'll see more of the candidates soon .
Just wait for the debates . "
Google has been forced to abandon its ban on religious organisations placing anti-abortion ads on its site after it was sued by a pro-life charity .
Google settled out of court with The Christian Institute , a UK - based non-denominational charity , yesterday and will now allow religious groups to place factual and campaigning ads about abortion .
The new policy will apply world - wide with immediate effect .
The Christian Institute wanted to advertise with Google by paying so that when the word " abortion " was typed into the search engine , a link to a web page on its views would pop up on the right - hand side of the screen .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The link reading " UK abortion law - news and views on abortion from the Christian Institute " would enable users to click on it to access the institute 's website .
The institute had hoped to advertise its online articles on pro-life issues ahead of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Bill being debated in the House of Commons this summer .
However , Google refused to display the ad in March because its policy banned the advertising of sites that mixed " abortion and religion - related content " .
The Christian Institute started legal action against Google on the grounds that it was infringing the Equality Act 2006 by discriminating against Christian groups .
The charity argued that Google accepted ads for abortion clinics , secular pro-abortion sites and secularist sites which attack religion .
It demanded damages , costs and permission to display the ad .
A spokesman for the Christian Institute , Mike Judge , said that while the exact terms of the settlement were confidential , the charity was " absolutely delighted " at the outcome and to have its ad online yesterday .
" It is a victory for common sense , " he said .
" We just wanted to display some factual information in the run up to the Embryology Bill going through Parliament .
" Obviously it 's a controversial subject and we have conservative Christian views but we are never extreme in our language so we were very shocked to be blocked from advertising for use of inappropriate content .
I think this is a victory for all religious groups that will benefit many people in the future . "
A spokesman for Google said the case had prompted a review of its policy to ensure it was fair to all advertisers .
" The issue of abortion is an emotive subject and Google does not take a particular side .
Over the past few months we have been reviewing our abortion ads policy in order to make sure it was fair , up to date and consistent with local customs and practices .
Following the review we have decided to amend our policy , creating a level playing field and enabling religious associations to place ads on abortion in a factual way . "
A TV ad for Apple 's iPhone has been banned by the UK's advertising watchdog for misleading consumers after it over - hyped the internet capabilities of the smart phone .
The ad showed the internet navigation prowess of the iPhone , with images zooming in on a weather forecast for Cape Town and a map of how to get to Heathrow airport .
" You never know which part of the internet you 'll need ... which is why all the parts of the internet are on the iPhone , " ran a voiceover .
The Advertising Standards Authority received two complaints that the claim was misleading because the iPhone did not support Flash or Java , which are both integral to many web pages .
Apple said the aim of the ad was to highlight how the iPhone can offer access to all websites , while many other handsets only offer lower - level access to WAP versions of sites or those selected by service providers .
The US technology giant said that Safari , the web browser the iPhone uses , was built to open internet standards .
Flash and Java technology were not open source , said Apple , adding that it could not ensure compatibility with " every third - party technology in the marketplace " .
The company said none of the content in the ad was Java or Flash - based and that the line " all parts of the internet " meant website availability , " not every aspect of functionality " .
Advertising pre-vetting service Clearcast said the ad had been given the green light for broadcast after a " demonstration and the advertiser 's assurances " .
However , the Advertising Standards Authority said that claims made by Apple implied that " users would be able to access all websites and see them in their entirety " .
Because the ad had not explained the limitations of the iPhone , the ASA concluded that " the ad gave a misleading impression of the internet capabilities of the iPhone " .
The ASA ordered that the TV ad must not be broadcast again in the same form .

" I think business in general is filled with instances of paradox .
The most basic , obviously , is that the best way to maximize your profit is to make profit a secondary concern and focus primarily on your customer .
There are other instances too .
It is easiest to borrow money when you do n't need it .
A " good " strategy is actually defined in large part by your ability to execute it .
Selling is really less about convincing customers to buy your product and more about identifying the customers that naturally want it .
After thinking through all of this I am left the question embodied in the title of this post .
Is paradox the new paradigm ?
What I mean is , will future business success depend on the ability of managers and leaders to embrace paradox ?
Will they succeed by hold in their minds two contradictory ideas , each of which can be applied when necessary ?
I think so .
By embracing paradox , managers will lose the absolutist , half - truth thinking that ignores the context so pertinent to business decisions .
These seeming paradoxes often exist in the first place only because we try to apply business rules across all contexts . "
" The wiring on an aircraft is complicated .
To ﬁgure out where everything goes would take a long time .
But if you studied it for long enough , you could know with ( near ) certainty what each electrical circuit does and how to control it .
The system is ultimately knowable .
If understanding it is important , the effort to study it and make a detailed diagram of it would be worthwhile .
So complicated = not simple , but ultimately knowable .
Now , put a crew and passengers in that aircraft and try to ﬁgure out what will happen on the ﬂight .
Suddenly we go from complicated to complex .
You could study the lives of all these people for years , but you could never know all there is to know about how they will interact .
You could make some guesses , but you can never know for sure .
And the effort to study all the elements in more and more detail will never give you that certainty .
So complex = not simple and never fully knowable .
Just too many variables interact .
Managing humans will never be complicated .
It will always be complex .
So no book or diagram or expert is ever going to reveal the truth about managing people .
But do n’t panic .
We can manage people if ... "
" I have noticed something very strange about engaging in discussions ( and even disagreements ) with people .
The more you disagree with them , taking the other side in an argument , the more vehemently they push their original point of view .
However , if you do n't disagree , but restate their point in an exaggerated form , they often back down , or at least tone down their original statement . "
" Researchers asked some residents of an area to accept and display a small 3 - inch sign that said “ BE A SAFE DRIVER ” .
Almost all did .
Two weeks later , the researchers sent another representative around to ask both this group and another group of residents that had not received the first contact to allow a large billboard saying “ DRIVE CAREFULLY ” on their front lawns .
As part of the request , they were shown a picture of a nice house almost completely obscured by a very large , poorly lettered sign with that message .
Eighty - three percent of the residents who had not received the first request refused , but 76 % of those who had accepted the small sign agreed to placement of the large one ! "
Change is doing something different , but known in the current context .
Innovation is doing something different , but unknown in the specific context .
What do Rob May , Wayne Gretzky , David Maister , and a player to be named later in the post have in common ?
Read on !Rob wonders if Paradox Is The New Paradigm .
You should go read the whole thing ; there 's lots more cogent thought in Rob 's post .
agree with Rob 's condemnation of ignoring context when applying new concepts , but there 's more to the problem than that .
In my recent Mr. T post , I discussed the difference betweenandproblems .
In the book More Space , Johnnie Moore defines the two as follows : ( Yes , that 's a tease to get you to read the rest ! )
Henceforth here at Spooky Action , we will usedefinitions for the termsand .
They define adifference between types of problems and systems .
The difference is important because you can 'tcomplex systems .
It 's a mathematical impossibility .
The Conant - Ashby Theorem : " Every good regulator of a system must have a model of that system . " leads to the Law of Requisite Variety : " That the available control variety must be equal to or greater than the disturbance variety for control to be possible " , which is to say , that the control mechanism of a thing must be more complex than the thing being controlled .
To continue with Johnnie 's airplane metaphor , the autopilot system has to have greater control variety than the plane itself .
The analogy to business is that managers often want to see new initiatives aswhen they are in fact , and thus design complicated systems to manage the change .
Which usually fail miserably in very short order when they encounter a circumstance outside of the control model .
The problem with designing control mechanisms for organizational change management is that the system being controlled consists of theis the epitome of a complex system .
Of course , as Johnnie notes , if we abandon the idea ofcomplex systems and focus on intelligentlythem , we 'll have greater success .
One man who understood this well was Air Force Col .
John Boyd , the father of the Observe - Orient - Decide - Act ( OODA ) loop .
His essay , Destruction and Creation weaves together Godel 's Incompletess Theorem , Heisenberg 's Indeterminacy Principle , and the Second Law of Thermodynamics ( tendency to entropy ) to show that the only way to deal with complex system is one of constant observation and reaction to that system .
A diagram of the OODA loop looks like this :
The first step , observation , comprises collection of data .
For us people , that comes through our senses .
The second step , orientation , involves analyzing the observed data and .
The diagram 's model of orientation is oversimplified , but the concept of needing to synthesize the new data into all of our existing models is a key one .
The third step , decision making , includes forming alternative courses of action and then selecting one or more to act upon , which leads to the final step ... Acting , in which we do something and then go back to step one to observe resulting changes .
With lots of feedback and feed forward .
Hopefully you 're not sitting there thinking " Um...okay ... so what ? " , because we can do all kinds of fun things with this model .
Boyd did all kinds of fun things byhis opponents ' OODA loops .
There 's an old saying that " no battle plan survives first contact with the enemy " .
Once engaged , everyone involved , from lowly private to five - star general , is running their own OODA loop .
There are lots of ways toOODA loops .
You could use stealth technology to disrupt your opponent 's observation capabilities , or you could use terrain to restrict your opponent 's ability to act .
What Boyd taught was that an inferior force could triumph by " getting inside " its enemy 's OODA loop ; youyour opponent 's orientation capabilities .
Well - disciplined armies have well - instilled standard tactics and orientation / decision models to go with them .
Traditionally , the lower level the unit the simpler the model - with orders to escalate decision - making to the next level of command whenever a situation outside the model is encountered .
Of course , this escalation has a time and communcation cost , so if you can keep changing the situation faster than the enemy can orient , you effectively cut off their ability to act in a coherent manner .
Cognitive dissonance leads to panic and chaos and surrender .
Too bad this is the effect many management initiatives have on the employees !
Getting inside OODA loops works in all walks of life : " A good hockey player plays where the puck is , a great hockey player plays where the puck is going to be " .
Wayne GretzkyWant to try disrupting someone 's OODA loop yourself ?
Try Maister ' Exaggeration Ploy
Try it .
It works !
Of course , you do n't want to abuse other people 's OODA loops , but people have been doing it for centuries .
Several years ago Robert Cialdini wrote a fascinating book entitled " Influence : The Psychology of Persuasion " .
You need to read this book .
Cialdini spent time infiltrating different groups of swindlers , peddlers , and con artists to see if they used a common set of principles to unduly influence people .
He found that they use six .
He then discusses experiments testing these principles that are truly shocking .
In one What 's funniest about the book is that people reading it can invariably recall times when they themselves fell prey to the same ploys .
Many of the models we use to orient ourselves in the world are hard - wired , such as Cialdini 's principles and 400 other Human Universals , but many others ( as indicated in Boyd 's diagram ) are cultural or results of previous experiences .
We all have our own unique collections of models , or as Charlie Munger more eloquently called it : a lattice of models .
Who is Charlie Munger ?
He 's Warren Buffett 's partner and alter ego .
Years ago he coined the term " lattice of models " to describe how superior investment decisions came from applying principles created in other areas , such as the hard sciences .
It 's hard to argue with his results ; he 's made billions with the approach .
I think this approach applies generally to innovation .
Fouro recently asked me to define the difference between change and innovation for our upcoming book .
Since I had OODA on the brain , I posited this :
If my competitors are all using some " rest practice " , and I decide to implement it , that 's change .
If I decide to start an " OilChangeMobile " service for third - shift workers , because all the oil change shop are closed during their lunch breaks , that 's innovating ( it might be a good innovation or a bad one , but it 's more than just change ) .
Does that seem like an insightful distinction ?
Back to Rob 's " Paradox is the New Paradigm " .
Paradox will always be the paradigm for innovators , the people willing to do the extra work in observing their circumstances and orienting themselves using the fullest context .
But there will always be a large crowd that for expediency 's sake will not do the extra work , and thus there will always be a ready market for consultants selling the " next big thing " .
