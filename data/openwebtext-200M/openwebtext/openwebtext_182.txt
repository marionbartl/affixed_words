Women should keep out of the hot sun throughout pregnancy , according to experts .
The warning , from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists , comes amid predictions that Britain will see sweltering temperatures this summer .
It said the advice was particularly relevant to those in early pregnancy as babies develop most rapidly in the first three months after conception .
It also said that pregnant women are more sensitive to high temperatures , which can make them feel unwell .
Several studies have suggested that babies can be affected by heat during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy .
A study published in the British Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology in 2005 found that exposure to high temperatures in the first three months could lead to babies being born with a slightly lower birth weight .
Such babies are prone to a low IQ and learning disabilities .
They are also more likely to exhibit behavioural problems at school .
The researchers , from the University of Bristol , concluded that an " increasing occurrence of temperature extremes - in particular heatwaves - could have important public health implications " .
A spokesman for the royal college said yesterday : " Women in their first stages of pregnancy in the summer should be aware of the health risk surrounding increases in temperature .
" Pregnant women should stay out of the sun , wear loose clothing , keep well hydrated and eat healthy food little and often . "
Sue Jacob , from the Royal College of Midwives , said getting hot causes the mother 's blood vessels to contract as she tries to cool herself down - reducing the amount of nutrients that pass through into the foetus .
She added : " There is a tendency in Britain to rush out whenever the weather is nice but people should be aware of the hidden dangers too .
" Women should also take care during late pregnancy .
High temperatures have been shown to lead to premature labour and an increased rate of miscarriage . "
The college stressed that women should not panic but said they should take steps to protect themselves and their unborn babies .
These included dressing appropriately in hot weather by wearing a hat and light , loose clothes made from a natural fibre such as cotton .
Pregnant women should also stay in the shade between 11 am and 3 pm when the sun is at its hottest .
To cope with a heatwave , expectant mothers are also advised to eat more light meals , such as salads , and plenty of fruit and vegetables .
They should also avoid strenuous exercise which can raise the body temperature even further .
Light to moderate exercise is okay .
Mothers - to - be should also avoid tea , coffee and alcohol , which can all increase the risk of dehydration .
The college said signs of heat exhaustion to look out for included increased body temperature , tiredness , light - headedness , and a dry mouth and throat .
Cleveland Democratic Rep. Dennis Kucinich was the only member of Congress on Monday night to vote against a symbolic resolution to recognize September 11 as a day of remembrance , extend sympathies to those who lost their lives and their families and honor emergency workers and the U.S. armed forces .
Kucinich issued a press release before the vote , criticizing the resolution as " incomplete , " and saying that Congress needs to " wake up to the truth and exercise its obligation under the Constitution to save our nation from being destroyed from the lies that took us into Iraq , the lies that keep us there , the lies that are being used to set the stage for war against Iran and the lies that have undermined our basic civil liberties here at home . "
" The September 11 resolution that Congress considers today should have made reference to those matters , " he continued .
" It does not , so I can not support it . "
Kucinich 's presidential campaign sent an e-mail this morning to supporters titled " Remembering 9/11 " that urged America to " regain the moral high ground in our efforts to recover from 9/11 . "
" We need to call those who used 9/11 to take us into war against Iraq to an accounting under the U.S. Constitution , U.S. law and international law , " Kucinich said in the e-mail .
Yesterday , the U.S. officer in charge of military operations in Iraq , Gen. David Petraeus , testified before the House Armed Services and Foreign Affairs committees .
Kucinich says Petraeus attempted to mislead Congress , however , and the Cleveland congressman issued a press release that demanded withdrawal of all U.S. troops .
Kucinich was taking heat from right - wing bloggers this morning after distribution of a Syrian television interview in which he blasts U.S. foreign policy .
On a trip to the Middle East earlier this month , Kucinich visited camps for Iraqi refugees in Syria , and met with the presidents of Syria and Lebanon .
He told the Associated Press that he did n't visit Iraq because " I do n't want to bless that occupation with my presence . "
In an interview conducted after Kucinich returned from the trip , MSNBC commentator Tucker Carlson asked Kucinich whether he was " uncomfortable " attacking his own country in the presence of one of its sworn enemies , and whether he recognized Syria might use his visit for propaganda purposes .
" I do n't embrace any nation 's foreign policy wholesale , " Kucinich replied .
" But I do want to see for myself .
The president of Iraq did not ask me to go see the refugees .
I asked to see the refugees . "
An e-mail that Kucinich sent his presidential supporters about the trip said Kucinich and his wife " traveled to a troubled , dangerous region of the world to meet with heads of state and other political leaders to find ways to solve the problems , mitigate the dangers , and find common ground for diplomatic cooperation - and PEACE . "
" While the other leading candidates for the Presidency were spending the Labor Day weekend campaigning at picnics , barbeques , state and county fairs and parading in front of the cameras , YOUR candidate , Dennis Kucinich , without fanfare , was quietly traveling throughout the troubled Middle East in search of real - world solutions to monumental global challenges , " the e-mail began .
Kucinich will be visiting North Dakota and Hawaii later this week , newspapers in those states report .
Kucinich was one of the few Democratic presidential candidates that was n't invited to Iowa Democratic Sen .
Tom Harkin 's yearly steak fry this weekend , and it's not because he 's a vegan .
Harkin's aides told the New York Times that Kucinich and former Alaska Sen .
Mike Gravel were n't invited " because neither has established an active campaign organization in Iowa . "
I Am So Funny
My brief and wondrous career at The Daily Show consisted of making jokes about the Amish and trying to get Jon Stewart to love me .
David Belisle
" And here 's your desk ! "
Stephanie , the twentysomething office manager at The Daily Show , is gesturing toward the desk in the corner — a desk that is clearly someone else's .
There is a sweater slung over the back of the chair with long dark hairs stuck to the collar .
There are pictures of dark - haired people in front of Cape Cod–style houses .
And there are stacks of scripts that say " Attn : Dark - haired Girl . "
" But this is somebody else 's desk , right ? " I ask .
" Well , technically , it kind of is .
But she may not be coming back .
But she may be . "
" How about if I just sit next to the desk — I 'll just use it if I need a hard surface . "
Stephanie considers this for a moment and then makes an executive decision .
" No !
I want you to go ahead and sit here .
All the way .
Go ahead , scoot your chair all the way in .
But if you do see a woman who looks like this " — she picks up a photo of dark - haired people hugging golden retrievers and points to the woman on the end , the only one without a golden retriever to hug — " then maybe just go ahead and get up and go sit over there . "
She gestures toward a stained and abandoned office chair in the corner of the room , facing the wall .
It 's a slightly less glamorous beginning than I had imagined , but that does n't matter because getting the job on The Daily Show is the most incredible thing that has ever happened to me .
I will never know another unhappy day .
Finally , after all the years of striving , I can relax .
No more living like a girl - baby born to a Chinese family , having to prove that I am worth something .
( " Please do n't drown me in the river .
I may not be strong and I may not be smart , but hand me that noodle and I 'll make a joke with it .
Please , let me live !
Let me live ! " )
I am going to be allowed to live .
And not only that , my worth will be well - established .
Gone are the days of my telling every gross personal detail about herpes scares and porn- addicted boyfriends peeing in plants .
I can now just sit quietly .
Like the pretty girls do .
( And the depressed girls . )
Everything is going to change .
Stephanie whips around to continue her welcoming .
" Okay ?
So , first day !
Exciting !
Are you excited ? "
" Yeah .
I am , " I say , making my way toward my corner .
" So is this how you find out you 're fired here ?
You just come in to work and someone else is at your desk ?
I think I 'm just going to stand the whole time I 'm working here . "
Stephanie suddenly looks sad .
" I 'm sorry I 'm not laughing — it just takes a lot to make me laugh .
It has to be like , hilarious , to make me laugh .
I 'm sure you 're really funny , but I 'd just be careful with the ' trying to be funny ' thing .
Everyone has a really low tolerance for that around here .
So , anyway , welcome ! "
With that , Stephanie leaves the room .
I wish I had not said that thing about being fired .
Am I trying to " cut through the bullshit " on day one ?
Next I 'll be asking why no black people work here .
One thing 's for certain : I do n't want to sit at that desk .
Except to find clues as to why this desaparecido girl may or may not be coming back .
I need to know what not to do .
First , do n't have dark hair , I got that .
There must be other clues — evidence of certain herbs or supplements she had been taking , or journal entries that start with , " Said no to anal — Jon mad again . "
Getting your dream job and then being let go — what a nightmare .
And apparently when you 're let go here it 's just sort of " implied . "
( " Hmmm , that 's weird .
No paycheck for you again . " )
Well , she 's OUT and I am IN !
So let 's get back to the party that started three days ago , when I found out I got the job .
You know what would be nice right about now ?
Another piece of celebration coffee cake , then maybe a gift basket .
The phone rings — it 's my manager .
" Hey , ya big fat famous noodle — how is the first day ?
We have to go celebrate tonight with cosmos and sushi . "
I love my manager 's wild streak , but offer a gentle suggestion : " If you want , we can wait to celebrate when you 're not eight months pregnant . "
" Oh please ! " she says .
" I 'm a European mom .
I 'm sitting in the sauna stoned out of my mind , getting ready to shoot a porno !
Ha ha ha !!!
So how is it ?
Tell me , tell me , tell me ! "
Someone knocks on the door .
" Oh fuck , someone 's at the door , " I say , looking for something to duck underneath .
" It 's probably Jon Stewart .
Get it !
Get it ! " my manager shouts .
It 's Stephanie .
The bottom part of her face ( from her adorable nose on down ) is smiling and happy — full of hope .
But the top half , particularly the " windows into her soul , " did n't get the memo and is exuding " something has gone horribly wrong . "
" Hey , they 're gonna use you on the show tonight ! " she says with the happy section of her head .
Then the phone rings .
" NO ! " Stephanie yells at the phone .
And for a moment her face comes together , then snaps right back .
" Sorry — exciting first day , huh ?
Yeah , um , you can go ahead and get that . "
It must be my manager calling back — probably hoping Jon is in the room and that maybe I 'll put him on and when they hit it off she can have a quick fling before her baby is born .
Personally , I would never ask for a fling .
" Soul mate " is more my secret hope .
After watching tape after tape of The Daily Show to prepare myself for the job ( I 'd never seen the show before I was hired , cable being as mystical and magical as health insurance ) , I had to agree with all the men , women , and stalkers : Jon is a charming , humble , political genius of a man .
Trying to be ironic and witty , I pick up the phone with a mock reporter voice :
" This is Lauren Weedman , new correspondent on The Daily Show .
Can I help you ? "
Long pause .
Long , long pause .
" Oh ... hi .
I was just calling to get my messages .
Who is this ? "
It 's 4:00 p.m.— rehearsal time — and I can't find the studio .
This morning , Stephanie had told me something something something , turn right , then left .
But every right turn runs me into a bagel buffet or cold - cereal kitchenette and every left turn takes me into someone 's secret mini Butterfingers stash or a bowl of brownies .
The building is like a giant feedbag .
I 'm really lost .
It 's 4:05 .
Shit .
I 'm going to have to go back up to my office and start again .
Why do n't I just ask someone where it is ?
Why am I suddenly shy ?
I see a guy coming out of the writers ' room by himself — he seems safe .
" Hello , " I call out .
" You can just say 'hi . '
You do n't have to be ironic about it , " he says and walks away .
I finally find the studio on my own .
Even though I 'm late , I take a brief moment to savor this momentous occasion .
I am about to walk into The Daily Show studio for the first time .
Pausing to reflect , I grab a mini Snickers from the bowl in the hallway and cram it into my mouth .
This is my first time meeting Jon— dear god , I hope I do n't fuck this up .
Somebody should probably warn him that sometimes I 'm not funny , and now I 'm being paid to be funny .
Which suddenly seems like an intense amount of pressure .
I 'm going to end up like John Belushi or Chris Farley by the end of the week .
Minus the legend part .
Just bloated with drugs and alcohol and mini Snickers .
But I 'm not always funny .
Sometimes I 'm tired .
That 's kind of funny , I think .
I 'm gonna say that when I walk into the studio .
Upon opening the studio door , I find a circle of men throwing around a Nerf football , one of whom is Jon Stewart .
Nobody even turns his head when I walk in .
Maybe I should start crying .
No , I 'll save that for my second season .
As soon as I see Jon , I want to tell him my story about my boyfriend peeing in the houseplant and show him the tuft of hair by my ankle that I always miss when I 'm shaving .
I remind myself :
You 're an oak tree — your roots run deep and your skin is barky — just be rooted and present .
Remember , like grizzly bears , these guys are more scared of you than you are of them .
It 's a comedy show — have fun !
Yukka , yukka , banana peel , whoa !
Come on !
We 're all just folks — folks are folks — we live , we die , we rot .
Jon Stewart is just a man — he's just a man — and you 've had so many men before , in so many ways — he 's just one more .
Oh my god , it 's a song lyric from Jesus Christ Superstar — I 've turned Jon Stewart into Jesus .
Right as I 'm about to belt out the alto line , " What 's the buzz , tell me what 's a - happening ! " the men spot me and stop throwing the ball .
I run in ( holding my breasts since I 'm not wearing a jog bra ) as if I were late for the game .
I squeeze myself into the circle , throw my hands above my head , and scream , " I 'm open !
I 'm open ! "
And I mean it .
Open to new friends , new experiences , new anything .
But the game comes to a complete stop .
That 's when I notice that Jon has the ball .
( It 's not until later that I realize he always has the ball . )
He greets me with a worried " Hi , Lauren .
How 're ya doing ? "
" I 'm just ... dealing with all the ... sexual ... tension . " ( Pause . )
" You know ... fine .
I 'm fine . "
" Good .
It 's good to see you .
We 'll be starting rehearsal in about 20 minutes , " he says with a look on his face that is not amused surprised , as I 'd initially interpreted , but fear .
The first time I 'm on the show , I 'm assigned a bit where I 'm an entertainment expert talking about which of the Backstreet Boys is the gay one , which is the really gay one , and which is the really , really gay one .
In the studio , you do one rough run-through , where you 're bad and you flub your words and then squeegee the sweat off your eyebrows and do it again .
The first one is a stumble - through , and it is petrifying .
Since I had originally auditioned for the executive producer , rather than for Jon , it is also the first time that the star of the show is seeing me " act like a reporter . "
I complete the first run-through and immediately begin an inner mantra like a screaming army sergeant : " YOU'RE OKAY !
YOU'RE OKAY !
THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME — GIVE YOURSELF A BREAK ! "
Then I feel the ground rumbling .
A herd of comedy writers is making its way toward me and soon I 'm surrounded by urgent suggestions .
One writer steps out in front of the mob only to be shoved out of the way by someone even more desperate to save his joke from the new girl .
" Lauren !
Okay ... how can I explain this — "
" Just tell her what you want . "
" Okay , you 're an expert .
Meaning you know what you 're talking about .
Have you ever seen Stone Phillips ? "
" Do n't confuse her .
Maybe she does n't understand exactly what the joke is .
Underline it in the script ! "
" She does n't understand .
Let me try .
Hey , Lauren !
Whassup !
You look great !
Pretty hair ! "
" We do n't have this kind of time .
We need to give it to a Steve ! "
At which point the entire studio erupts in a chant : " Steve ! Steve ! Steve ! "
I join in .
" STEVE ! STEVE ! STEVE ! "
After learning that both Steves are on vacation , we do one more run-through before the actual taping .
It is even worse than the first one because suddenly I can't remember how to keep my eyeballs from shaking .
I decide the best thing to do is to suck my cheeks in , nod a lot , and look angry yet insecure .
The " just be yourself " technique .
This seems to give the writing staff the comfort of knowing " that 's as good as she 's going to get , " and they leave me alone during the actual taping .
The next morning , the executive producer asks me , " Where 'd you go after the show ?
Jon wanted to congratulate you , but you just disappeared .
I think he was worried you were upset . "
Normally I wait to make sure everyone is looking at me before I storm out of a building in tears , but this time I 'd forgotten to check over my shoulder .
And Jon had noticed .
Oh my god .
I love him .
" You are my new boyfriend , " I say , sticking my head into Jon 's office .
He looks surprised to see me .
He 's on the phone with Wolf Blitzer .
At least , I assume it 's Wolf Blitzer because he says , " I 'll talk to you later , Wolf , " and hangs up .
I notice Jon's Emmy is on a shelf , still wrapped in plastic .
" Look how modest you are , Jon , " I say .
" You have n't even unwrapped your Emmy . "
Jon brings the conversation back under his control .
" Hey , great job on the show last night , " he says .
" Welcome .
I did n't see you after the show , so I wanted to make sure you were feeling okay . "
" Thank you .
I appreciate that , " I reply .
And that should be the moment I leave , but I do n't .
" I just love that you do n't have a special cabinet built for your awards .
Everyone I know with a bowling trophy has special spotlights installed — giant arrows on the wall pointing to it .
Naked women dancing around it .
That 's what you should get . "
Jon looks confused , but he continues to keep his concern focused .
" Well , Lauren .
We 're glad to have you here .
I just wanted to tell you that after the taping . "
" You know what happened after the show ? "
Jon glances at the clock on the wall and takes a breath .
But I am oblivious to his " I do n't have time ; I 've reached out to you , now please let me get some work done " signals .
" I walked out of the studio and immediately started sobbing . "
He makes sad eyes that say , " Oh , no ! " and then looks at his phone .
Probably praying for Kofi Annan or Carrot Top to call him .
I continue .
" It 's just intense .
I 've never been on national television before , and the stakes were so high .
I had to get out of the building and let all the stress out .
I went in the alley to have a private breakdown , but ended up sobbing in front of the doors where the audience exits .
So suddenly the doors fly open : ' Hey , there 's the new girl !
Great job !' and I 'm trying to stop crying — "
I finally stop myself because I realize Jon has a " that 's a sad story " look frozen on his face , but his eyes are darting from the phone to the clock to the door .
The phone , the clock , the door .
The phone , the clock , the door .
I start to laugh and hope he 'll join me .
But somehow he does n't see the humor in a new hire telling him that she may or may not be stable .
We very formally end our conversation with some " welcome agains " and " I'm exciteds " and " thank yous . "
The journey to my office is always exhausting .
Every time I pass an open office door , I stick my head in and try to say something funny .
I try to convince myself that I 'm just saying hi .
Getting to know the people of The Daily Show .
By the end of the first week , it 's turned into a bizarre dance routine .
Step , step , look right , " Okay , guys — hands outta your pants ! "
Step , step , look left , " Man , crack cocaine makes you sweat a lot , look at you ! "
Step , step , look right , " For a fat person , you 're looking very thin today . "
Ball change and repeat .
If the person responds or laughs , I take that as an invitation to come on in and ask him or her for advice .
I want to know what the women before me have done .
And why everyone keeps saying , " It 's sooo hard to keep women here . "
But people just nod and smile at me and reveal nothing .
Which may have to do with the fact that they 're " working . "
One month later , I 'm back in the executive producer 's office .
" Okay , I do n't want to freak you out , " she is saying .
" I want to help you .
Here 's the deal : You need to get Jon to like you . "
" I was n't aware that he did n't , " I respond , in an unemotional , I - could - care - less - about - this - job , it 's - a - walk - in - the - park tone .
She continues : " Somehow he 's getting the impression that you could care less about the job .
He feels like you 're treating this whole thing like it 's a walk in the park .
Like you could take it or leave it .
And we all like you , but we need him to like you , too , so — "
Just then someone opens her office door .
It 's Jon , sticking his head in .
The executive producer 's voice goes up a few octaves .
" Hey , Jon , come on in !
I was just talking to Lauren about how excited we are to have her as a part of the show .
Just telling her to try to relax and have fun . "
Jon nods his head and very politely says , " Yeah .
Good .
Listen , can I talk to you when you 're done with Lauren ? "
I jump to my feet , put my hands on my hips , pinch my nipples , and say , " I just want to please you .
Do I please you , Jon ? Do I ? "
Jon looks at the executive producer and seems like he 's about to say something .
Since he does n't laugh , I figure I 'd better start dancing like Shirley MacLaine — as fast as I can .
" Jon !
I think that my nervousness — trying to act like this is n't the biggest thing that 's ever happened to me — is backfiring .
It 's like when I first started dating my husband , I tried to act like I was used to sexy , gorgeous men .
Which in my mind meant acting very cool and underwhelmed .
I 'm so worried about you licking me — what is wrong with me ?
— I mean liking me — "
" Is she serious ? " Jon asks the executive producer .
She tells him that I 'm kidding .
She speaks for me a few more times before I say , doing my best deaf - person imitation and using sign language , " Tell Jon I like his shirt . "
The executive producer bursts out laughing .
" Oh my god ! " she exclaims .
" Girlfriend , you 've got to get us all what you 're on !
Oh my god !
Okay , Jon , I 'll be in your office in a minute . "
She continues to laugh until Jon closes the door behind him .
The instant it clicks shut , she leaps toward me , grabs my arm , and starts shaking me .
" You have got to calm down ! " she says .
" Stop auditioning for the job ! Relax ! "
Standing in front of the bulletin board in the hallway , I scan all the sign - up sheets for softball games and trips to Vegas and free tickets to standup shows to see if Jon 's name is anywhere .
One of the other on - air correspondents walks by and I ask him if Jon ever plays softball and he laughs in my face .
He recovers and decides to share the secret to his success on the show .
" You need to stop treating Jon like a peer , " he says .
" He 's not your peer .
Just lay low until they want to use you on the show .
Do n't ask for too much feedback .
You 're just calling attention to yourself .
And do n't sign up for anything on this board .
On - camera people do n't do that . "
A producer on his way to pick up his antidepressants stops and joins in .
" And do n't laugh so much .
I did n't laugh at anything for the first year I worked here .
So when I finally did , it really meant something . "
I 'm in the studio for rehearsal .
I should be practicing my lines , but instead I 'm practicing not laughing .
Starting with not laughing at my own jokes ( which , for me , embarrassingly , is incredibly difficult ) .
As soon as Jon walks in , everyone quiets down and gets focused .
" Do n't spin around in the chair , " the stage manager whispers to me , trying to help .
" Just sit still . "
Jon has brought his new puppy , which is jumping all over the crew .
" Sorry about my puppy , you guys , he 's going through a licking stage , " he says .
" I wish my husband had one of those ! " I exclaim , careful not to burst out laughing .
The studio falls silent and then , in the Jewish tradition of ripping one 's clothing to signify " you are dead to me , " the studio is full of the sound of collars being torn .
I 've only been on the show for six months and I 've been banished from sitting next to Jon in the studio .
" You 're too jumpy ; you make him nervous , " I 'm told .
They have me work almost exclusively in the field , finding mildly retarded people who do n't have cable so they 'll never know how much the show makes fun of them .
Sometimes I enjoy myself .
Dripping wax on my breasts at an Amish candle - making studio for a " Wild on Amish Country " piece is memorable .
Not for my parents , but I enjoy it .
Interviewing a tobacco lobbyist whose wife and child had just left him and moved out the day before is less fun .
Mocking is one of my favorite pastimes , but this is rough .
He makes the entire crew lunch and plays with his dog on camera , which we ask him to do because he looks so ridiculous doing it .
He rolls around on the ground with snorty abandon .
In the van , driving away , I feel like a bully .
The guy is a tobacco lobbyist , for god 's sake — he deserves to have his eyeballs colored in red and horns drawn on his head .
So why do I feel like I 've just gone up to the fattest girl in high school ( which could have been me , though technically I was the 12th fattest , but was heavily girdled ) and told her that the cool kids wanted her to come to a movie with us ?
And did it in such a way that she took a chance and joined us at the movie .
But of course we'd only asked her so we could mock the shit out of her .
And it would n't be until the next day at school ( or the " air date " ) , when we'd be reporting how she ate nachos with her chubby fingers , that she 'd realize she 'd been set up .
You'd think after so many years of having my metaphorical lunch money stolen , I 'd be pleased to finally get cast in the role of bully with health insurance .
But I was n't .
I missed jumping up and down in my chair next to Jon .
Like most workplace dramas , my situation came to a head , as it were , with the Giant Black Cock ( GBC ) incident .
There are no sexual - harassment lawsuits in comedy .
Maybe because there are so few women around to get offended .
( " Did he mean my pubic hair ?
Hey ! " )
And " just kidding " works in every situation .
So when the first thing that greets me on my computer screen one morning is a picture of a white blond chirpy ( WBC ) enjoying a GBC , I know exactly how this day is going to go .
My job is to march around the office trying to find out who did it and pretending I 'm going to press charges .
( Since there are no black people working on The Daily Show I do n't have to worry about someone saying , " It 's not mine . " )
By the end of the day , there is only one person whom I have not yet asked about the GBC .
And I find that person conveniently trapped in his makeup chair , right before the show .
" Jon , was it you who downloaded the giant black cock onto my computer ? " I ask .
Jon looks truly shocked .
This is the same guy who sat around making jokes with the writers about grandmas falling on young men's dicks , and now he 's looking at me like I 've taken a shit in my hand and offered it to the pope .
" What are you talking about , Lauren ? "
The makeup lady looks like she is about to cry .
" I came in to work and there was a picture of this giant black cock on my computer , and normally it's my mom who sends me those pictures , but — "
He stands up and thanks the makeup lady and walks out .
The makeup lady , who has been working with Jon since he was on MTV , says , " I think you need to go and have a heart - to - heart with him .
He thinks you 're making fun of him or something .
He can't tell that you 're kidding , I think .
I 've known him a long time and I just think he does n't get your kidding .
I would go right now and talk to him .
Like how you talk to me .
Like how you talk to everyone but him .
Just as yourself . "
I know she 's right .
This has gone on for too long .
I knock on the door of the green room .
BAM BAM BAM .
People respond to truth .
I want to tell him my truth .
BAM BAM BAM .
The Lord has sent me .
Open up .
When Jon finally says , " Come in , " I walk into the room to find him surrounded by all his people .
Every single one of the eight important people in the room looks at me as if I have a bomb strapped to my torso .
" Jon , " I say , certain of my mission .
" I want to talk to you for minute .
Could you come out in the hallway , please ? "
Jon does n't smile or try to smile or act patient .
He is done with that shit .
He says , " What ?
Out there ? "
He actually starts to stand up , and then hangs in midair above his chair as he changes his mind .
" No , I 'm not going out there .
What do you want ? "
I dive in .
" Jon , every time we have an inter-action I hear the next day that I 've upset you .
And I do n't know what it is .
No matter what I do , I just make it worse and worse .
And I do n't mean to .
I honestly keep thinking that I 'm being myself but somehow — "
Jon stops me .
" Lauren , you strike me as a very obsessive person .
You need to calm down .
I do n't know what you 're talking about .
I do n't think about you or our interactions as much as you seem to . "
And I shut up , because I get it .
My muscles unclench .
My heart rate slows and I get it .
It 's like I 've been running after Jon for a year , asking , " Does this shirt smell ?
Does it ?
Tell me , tell me ! "
And now he 's told me , quite honestly .
It 's liberating .
I feel free and ready to start doing some actual work .
Enjoying this new sense of relaxation and ease , looking forward to how well I 'll finally sleep tonight , I calmly turn around and begin to close the door behind me .
But before the door has completely shut , I stick my head back in .
" You mean you do n't think about me on the weekends ? " I say .
" I think about you .... "
Three weeks later , I call in to retrieve my voice mail and a strange woman answers my phone .
" Oh ... hi , " I say , after a long pause .
A long , long pause .
" I was just calling to get my messages .
Who is this ? "
One day at work , I find Mary , the production assistant , at her desk and in the middle of a visual gag — a scathing commentary on the office - wide obsession with personal water bottles .
She has taken one of the giant plastic jugs that usually supplies the water cooler and has written in large letters on the side , " MARY'S WATER BOTTLE . "
It 's casually placed on her desk , taking up the entire surface , as she tries to get her work done around it .
As I walk by , she grabs it and hoists it up to her mouth using both arms .
Two hours later , when we 're both done laughing , she asks me if I 've heard about the big announcement :
We 're going to the Emmys .
By the time I reach my office I 've gone from " I do n't really think about shallow things like award shows " to looking for babies to step on to get my name on the list of confirmed guests .
Between my normal work activities of wandering around searching for new snack options and finding new people to listen to me explain how hard it is to be married to a bartender , I notice that nobody is acting excited about going to the Emmys , but everyone is — without a doubt — going .
A few days after 9/11 , there had been a staff meeting to talk about how much time it would take before we could be funny again .
The state of shock in the room made it hard to get the discussion going , so in the meantime we were all instructed to try and find stories that involved soft and comforting things , like Amish people .
And they had to be local Amish people , not Amish people who required an airplane trip to get to .
Even the word " airplane " made our stomachs plop into our laps .
Nobody wanted to take the subway — much less fly — ever again .
We all decided that for the rest of our lives we would do like Loretta Lynn and the morbidly obese do : wrap a fried biscuit and a stick of butter in a plastic bag and take the bus .
There were no circum - stances that could ever justify taking what was now a nightmarish mode of transportation .
Nobody was flying .
Ever . Again .
Unless it was to the National Television Academy 's 53rd Annual Primetime Emmy Awards .
The intercom system blasts an announcement through the building : " All staff needs to stop by Mary 's desk to get your Emmy tickets and limo assignments .
And Lauren Weedman , please report to the executive producer 's office right now . "
As the gods of television broadcasting would have it , my contract is up for renewal the same day the limo assignments are being made for the Emmys .
When I walk into the executive producer 's office , she has a look on her face that says , " Well , I tried . "
She offers me a freelance contract and a hit of pot .
I accept both and give her a big hug .
Ask her how her son is doing .
Where she got her shirt .
How much weight has she lost .
Did she end up getting that cabin ?
Can I get one more hug ?
Next thing I know , I 'm outside her office door , thinking that was a good meeting .
Now I 'll have more time to do other projects , plus I 'm still on the show .
It 's kind of perfect .
The first person I run into after the meeting is my good friend and field producer Carrie .
She 's my " What do you want me to do — lie to you ? " friend .
She 's let me know that one of the issues that got in the way of my success on the show was that , though talented , I just was n't as cute as the other female reporters .
Carrie clarified this by explaining , " I 'm not saying that I do n't think you 're cute .
I 'm just talking about guys , the fans of the show , the American People and all the Comedy Central executives . "
She was painfully honest , and I have to admit , I trusted her .
( Or I hated myself — tough call . )
" They offered me a freelance contract , " I say and start to clap my hands to help get the applause going .
" That means you 're fired , " Carrie says , with not a hint of emotion in her voice .
Unless exhaustion counts as an emotion .
" But why would n't they just tell me I 'm fired ? "
" They do n't want to hurt your feelings .
I 'll go tell everyone we 're going out to have a ' Lauren 's been canned ' drink after work . "
It occurs to me that perhaps , as is often the case with Carrie , she 's just doing what they 'd taught her in preschool — to share whatever she had a lot of , whether it be Jolly Ranchers or bitterness .
Maybe she does n't really know whether I 'm fired .
She just wants to keep me down so she can look cheerful in comparison to someone who may have just been fired .
The next three random people I pass on the way back to my desk tell me the same thing .
" That means you 're fired .
They just do n't want to be mean . "
The fourth person I pass is Mitch , a full - time comedy writer whose contract was also up for renewal .
I know because he was called in to the office directly after me .
He tells me they offered him a freelance contract , too .
And he 's smiling .
So you see , maybe it 's not what Carrie says .
And all those other people .
Maybe it 's exactly how it sounds .
" Yeah , freelance .
So what do you think ? " I ask him .
" No fucking way , " Mitch says .
" That 's a joke .
I just quit as soon as she offered it .
I 'm not stupid .
I would never accept a deal like that . "
After work , the few employees who are n't whooping it up at Mitch 's " I told them to fuck themselves " party sit at a corner table for my " Sorry you got canned " party .
Carrie tactfully asks the four other employees who 've shown up if I 'll be allowed to go the Emmys now that I 'm not a full - time employee .
" They already invited me !
They can't uninvite me ! "
I say .
" Yes they can ! " the entire bar answers in unison .

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CONTACT : media@dcaclu.org
WASHINGTON - Today the American Civil Liberties Union and other privacy groups met with FBI Director Robert Mueller to discuss the FBI 's new guidelines for internal controls concerning its use of National Security Letters ( NSLs ) .
In March , the Department of Justice Inspector General ( IG ) issued a report detailing significant abuse of the FBI 's NSL powers .
The FBI originally downplayed the extent of the abuse reported by the IG , alleging the number of cases selected for review in the IG audit did not constitute a representative sample .
However , the FBI 's own audit revealed more than a thousand additional abuses using a sample of just ten percent of its national security investigations .
The FBI has held a series of meetings to inform the civil rights and privacy community about its response to these revelations , but internal guidelines are clearly not enough to prevent this kind of abuse .
The following may be attributed to Caroline Fredrickson , Director of the ACLU Washington Legislative Office :
" Though we appreciate Director Mueller 's continued outreach , these reforms are ' too little , too late ' and we remain skeptical that any internal FBI regulation of NSL use will correct the problem .
For more than three years the FBI 's unchecked use of its NSL powers resulted in thousands of violations of law and policy .
FBI leadership was either unaware of these abuses or was informed of problems and did nothing to prevent them .
Either way , it 's clear that the bureau requires outside oversight and a legislative solution is required .
" Unchecked authority will inevitably lead to abuse .
The FBI , frankly , should never have been given this broad authority in the first place .
When both the IG 's report and the bureau 's own internal investigation turn up rampant abuses , it 's painfully clear there needs to be an independent check on this power .
It is naive to think those who break the rules should make the rules .
Congress should begin imposing oversight and mandating judicial review of NSL use . "

But her friend did not seem very interested in her discovery , she said .
More time passed , and one day she removed the painting from the wall and examined the back .
There she saw several stickers — one from the Perls Gallery in Manhattan , now closed ; another from the Musée d’Art Moderne de la Ville in Paris , where it had been exhibited in 1974 ; and a third from the Richard Feigen Gallery in Manhattan .
She called the Feigen gallery and told someone there about all the information on the labels .
Days later , she said , the gallery called back to say it had no record of the painting .
A year or so after that , she said , she told another friend about the painting .
“ He showed me a Sotheby ’s catalog where a Tamayo had sold for $ 500,000 , ” she recalled .
He also went to the library and came back with a pile of books on the artist .
One — a 1974 monograph of his work by Emily Genauer — had her painting on the cover .
“ I was stunned , ” Ms. Gibson said .
She made an appointment to do more research at the Frick Art Reference Library , at the Frick Collection on East 70th Street .
A librarian there directed her to the nearby Mary - Anne Martin gallery , which specializes in Latin American art .
She walked three blocks to the gallery , where she says she was told by someone that it was a “ famously stolen ” painting .
“ I was in a state of shock , ” she said .
Realizing that she might have something very valuable , Ms. Gibson built a false wall in her closet to conceal the painting , carefully wrapping it in old shower curtains .
After Googling the artist ’s name , she discovered an image of “ Three People ” at the “ Antiques Roadshow ” Web site in reference to the “ Missing Masterpieces ” segment .

Like other computer scientists who have studied Diebold voting machines , we were surprised at the apparent carelessness of Diebold ’s security design .
It can be hard to convey this to nonexperts , because the examples are technical .
To security practitioners , the use of a fixed , unchangeable encryption key and the blind acceptance of every software update offered on removable storage are rookie mistakes ; but nonexperts have trouble appreciating this .
Here is an example that anybody , expert or not , can appreciate :
The access panel door on a Diebold AccuVote - TS voting machine – the door that protects the memory card that stores the votes , and is the main barrier to the injection of a virus – can be opened with a standard key that is widely available on the Internet .
On Wednesday we did a live demo for our Princeton Computer Science colleagues of the vote - stealing software described in our paper and video .
Afterward , Chris Tengi , a technical staff member , asked to look at the key that came with the voting machine .
He noticed an alphanumeric code printed on the key , and remarked that he had a key at home with the same code on it .
The next day he brought in his key and sure enough it opened the voting machine .
This seemed like a freakish coincidence – until we learned how common these keys are .
Chris ’s key was left over from a previous job , maybe fifteen years ago .
He said the key had opened either a file cabinet or the access panel on an old VAX computer .
A little research revealed that the exact same key is used widely in office furniture , electronic equipment , jukeboxes , and hotel minibars .
It ’s a standard part , and like most standard parts it ’s easily purchased on the Internet .
We bought several keys from an office furniture key shop – they open the voting machine too .
We ordered another key on eBay from a jukebox supply shop .
The keys can be purchased from many online merchants .
Using such a standard key does n’t provide much security , but it does allow Diebold to assert that their design uses a lock and key .
Experts will recognize the same problem in Diebold ’s use of encryption – they can say they use encryption , but they use it in a way that neutralizes its security benefits .
The bad guys do n’t care whether you use encryption ; they care whether they can read and modify your data .
They do n’t care whether your door has a lock on it ; they care whether they can get it open .
The checkbox approach to security works in press releases , but it does n’t work in the field .
Update ( Oct. 28 ) : Several people have asked whether this entry is a joke .
Unfortunately , it is not a joke .
Secret Service shot at car of agent said protecting Ahmadinejad
The US Secret Service is investigating why one of its agents shot at the car of an agent said to be protecting Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
Secret Service spokesman Eric Zahren confirmed that the agency 's internal affairs unit had been tasked to probe why an agent engaged in an " accidental discharge " into the floor of the man said protecting Ahmadinejad , according to ABC News '
The Blotter .
" The spokesman would not confirm the type of gun used to shoot the automobile , " ABC 's Justin Rood reports .
" The car was parked in a " staging area , " Zahren said .
He noted that there were no " principals " near the site of the shooting -- security - speak for the individuals under Secret Service protection . "
Two security officials told the network that the agent was protecting Ahmadinejad .
In April , the network reported on another " accidental shooting . "
Two agents were shot after the accidental discharge of a firearm -- one shot in the leg , another suffering shrapnel wounds to the face .
At the time , President Bush was attending the Virginia Tech convocation ceremony .

Real Estate Foreclosures in Top States
It had to happen eventually .
With Republican Congressman Ron Paul of Texas scoring big in the fundraising derby , the in - the - knowsters are finally paying attention .
Today 's report from Rasmussen shows that in a head - to - head race with Hillary Clinton , Paul trails by 10 % , which puts him in the same statistical ballpark as other potential Republican nominees in the Hillary sweepstakes .
Interestingly , against Barrack Obama he trails by 17 % , suggesting that if Clinton is the Democratic nominee , Paul draws some of Obama 's anti-war vote , but what 's even more interesting is to watch the pundits take their shots at him
First , there 's Rasmussen themselves saying of Congressman Paul :
“ Ron Paul has passionate supporters and a lot of campaign money , but just 17 % think he has any chance of winning the general election if nominated .
Only 4 % believe he would be Very Likely to win it all … .
“ Among all voters , 46 % think Giuliani has a chance to win if nominated , 43 % say McCain has a shot and 40 % say the same about Thompson .
Thirty - two percent ( 32 % ) say Romney could win , 22 % see Huckabee as at least a somewhat likely victor and 12 % think Paul could possibly win if nominated . ”
You gotta love pollsters .
Rasmussen is saying that 17 % think he has any chance of winning the election , then two paragraphs later they say that 12 % think he could win if nominated .
So let me get this straight , Rasmussen : you 're saying that after the Republican nominee is determined , Ron Paul 's chance of winning slips from 17 % down to 12 % ???
Then there 's Fox 's Sean Hannity claiming that his own network 's straw poll that Ron Paul won hands down does n't mean anything , that it 's “ Just for fun . ”
I 'm certainly glad to hear Mr. Hannity is finally having some fun , since he 's far too emotionally unstable most of the time .
Over at townhall.com there 's Phil Harris claiming that , “ Ron Paul and others believe we should simply duck and cover . ” National Ledger 's Jim Roberts is declaring , “ This weekend [ Paul ] was likely just passed by Mike Huckabee . ”
This followed by one day an article by National Ledger 's Tim Morgan saying :
“ The ' Libertarian Leaning ' candidate was hit in the face with a bit of that [ idea he can't win ] recently when he was included in a poll by Zogby poll that asked , ' Whom would you NEVER vote for for President of the U.S. ? '
“ The man that is often referred to by supporters of the head of the Ron Paul revolution grabbed forty - seven percent in that poll .
That means that almost half of the country would not vote for Paul under any circumstances . ”
MSNBC reported about Sunday night 's debate :
“ But at last night 's GOP debate , something happened for the very first time : A candidate — Ron Paul — drew boos “ What Paul said that produced those boos is nothing new for the anti-war , libertarian Texas congressman .
' I think the American people , if we as a party realize this and understand it … the people in America want the [ Iraq ] war over with .
They 're sick and tired of it , and they want our troops to come home . '
“ While many in the audience were n't happy with Paul 's comments , those Republicans represent a minority of Americans — which highlights a looming general election problem for the GOP . ”
Then there 's the news that redstate.com , a pro-war Republican website , has declared that Paul supporters are n't welcome at their website anymore .
Leon H. Wolf , a redstate.com editor , posted a notice saying :
“ Effective immediately , new users may * not * shill for Ron Paul in any way shape , form or fashion .
Not in comments , not in diaries , nada .
If your account is less than 6 months old , you can talk about something else , you can participate in the other threads and be your zany libertarian self all you want , but you cannot pimp Ron Paul .
Those with accounts more than six months old may proceed as normal . ”
But the best part was Wolf 's reason why he was instituting the ban :
“ We are a bunch of fascists and we 're upset that you 've discovered where we keep the black helicopters , so we 're silencing you in an attempt to keep you from warning the rest of your brethren so we can round you all up and send you to re-education camps all at once ”
Well , that 's certainly refreshing honesty .
Leon 's philosophical brother at redstate.com , Mark Kilmer seconded the motion saying :
“ I no longer think Ron Paul should be included in any serious discussion of the Republican Party or its Presidential candidate .
( I 've recommended Leon 's diary , which you may count as a co-signature . )
Ron Paul has ceased to be that amiable figure , the eccentric insisting that government derives its mandate only from the consent of the governed .
“ It 's the surrender bit , completely incompatible with what I had thought of Ron Paul ; it is , however , a good way to drag confused Code Pinkers and pseudo - libertarians into the cash - donating aisle with the Red Light special . ”
For those who do n't regularly drink red Koolaid , what Kilmer means is that he does n't like the fact that Paul is opposed to our presence in Iraq and wants to pull the troops out .
In short , what Kilmer , Wolf , and others at redstate.com are saying is that any discussion of pulling troops out of Iraq is off the table and should never be discussed .
The significance of their banning Paul and his commentary is n't that they 're opposed to Paul ( no surprise there ) but rather that they now feel threatened by his participation in the Republican primaries , because Paul represents what to them is an unthinkable threat … the idea that the Republican Party could conceivably nominate a candidate who opposes neo -con thinking .
The fact is that threat is intolerable to them , which is why they 're paying so much lipservice to the idea that Paul is unelectable .
Wolf did state that , “ Those who have * earned * our respect by contributing usefully for a substantial period of time will be listened to with appropriate respect . ”
I 'd like to take a moment to invite Wolf , Kilmer , and those redstaters over to our site if they really want to respectfully discuss the issues .
Unlike redstate.com , our website is open to everyone : libertarians , liberals , conservatives ( including neo- conservatives ) , statists , and centrists .
Of course , I do n't expect any of them to participate here , but it does n't hurt to ask .
In all likelihood , they really do n't want to debate .
They just want the 2008 campaign to be little more than preaching to their choir , particularly where Iraq is concerned .
Frankly , I do n't think they have the guts for a real debate .
But getting back to my main point , which is this .
All of this attention on Ron Paul is due to the fact that he has astonished everyone with his ability to raise money .
So it really does n't matter whether the attention is positive or negative …or even blacklisting ( in redstate. com 's case ) .
What matters is that a tiny trickle of commentary on Ron Paul from outside the reaches of his loyal followers is starting to flow , and in the long run that can only help his campaign .
Truly , for a long - shot candidate like Ron Paul there is no such thing as bad publicity at this stage of his campaign .
So many foods , so little time .
It 's a challenge I face every week , deciding where and what to eat .
Recently , British food writer Anna Longmore compiled a list in Arena Magazine of the 50 foods you should try before you die .
Guess that narrows it down .
But Longmore did n't eat any of the items on her list .
Not the elk heart , duck embryo or crispy pig 's ear .
Deliciousness must be vouched for .
Here 's my list , shorter but fully endorsed .
These are must - eats : foods that will please your palate , expand your mind and gratify your soul .
They are not chancy mouthfuls to gross out your friends .
( Although I 've eaten my share of those , from insects to fish sperm to snake . )
Most are readily found in our restaurants and food shops .
So dig in , the clock is ticking .
Kobe beef sashimi
If you 've only had Kobe beef as a burger , then you 're missing the point .
The point is fat .
The richly marbled flesh is more white than red – in Japan , the grading goes from 1 to 12 ; our top - grade Prime would rate a 5 – and cooking melts the fat away .
Try it raw , shaved into paper - thin slices , and surrender to the texture .
Scallop roe
Oyster bars sometimes serve scallops on the half - shell .
Pounce .
When raw , their briny sweetness is intensified .
The fat , orange comma of coral attached – as hermaphrodites , both sexes contain roe – is even better , like caviar but more delicate .
Langós
This Hungarian snack of deep - fried dough could 've resulted from a one - night stand between a beavertail and a pizza crust .
At its best , it is a pebbled golden disc , both crunchy and puffed , brushed with crushed garlic and consumed with icy beer .
Sadly , good langós is hard to find out of its native land ; if you come across one , please let me know .
Pick - your - own produce
Consider yourself lucky if you 've eaten a sun-warm tomato straight from the vine .
Cherries , apricots or blueberries you 've plucked taste a hundred times better than their supermarket cousins .
Le Riopelle de l'Isle
A triple - crème Quebec cheese with a blooming white rind like brie and a creamy paste of gentle funkiness .
Like butter gone wild .
Horse
Sweeter , leaner and redder than beef .
Eating horse is traditional in other countries and legal in ours .
Do n't be squeamish .
Try it at La Palette , Coca and other omnivorous restaurants .
Street food
Throw caution , and hygiene , to the wind .
Truffles
Trained pigs and dogs root out these astoundingly fragrant tubers in European forests .
Fresh black truffle shavings elevate any dish to heaven .
White truffle oil does in a pinch .
Salsify
A rare root vegetable with mild flavour and an elegant , tapering form .
The late Café Brussel glazed tender salsify batons with cream and lemon .
Worth seeking out .
Bone marrow
Wobbly , greasy and incomparably rich .
A bistro staple .
Scoop out the centre of boiled or roasted beef bones yield and spread the marrow on toast ; sprinkle with fleur de sel .
Osso bucco also yields delicious marrow .
Bitter greens
Wake the taste buds with a dandelion salad or steamed rapini .
Or do like the Greeks and tuck into a plate of cold horta , wilted bitter greens tricked out with lemon and garlic .
Most refreshing .
Anything cooked over a wood fire .
Real balsamic vinegar
Forget the $ 5 supermarket kind .
That 's just wine vinegar coloured with caramel .
Real balsamic is made only in Modena and Reggio Emilia , where it is aged at least three years in wooden barrels for complexity .
Treat yourself to a bottle marked " tradizionale , " which pours out like dark , tangy syrup and can be eaten with a spoon .
Real whipped cream
I 'll always have a soft spot for Reddi- Whip , especially when squirted directly into the mouth while standing in front of the open fridge door .
But real whipped cream , the soft peaks lightly sweetened and kissed by vanilla ?
No contest .
Sweetened condensed milk
Eat a spoonful straight from the can .
Betcha can't stop at one .
Afternoon tea
There 's something enormously civilizing about a pot of loose - leaf Darjeeling , a plate of cucumber sandwiches ( crustless , of course ) and a pair of warm currant scones slathered with Devon cream .
Wide - brimmed hat and gloves optional .
Foie gras
Mired in ethical controversy – Chicago banned it from restaurants last year owing to concerns about animal cruelty – the fattened livers of force - fed duck and geese are singularly delicious ; they make an unbelievably silky terrine .
Eat it here while it 's still legal .
Dr. Konigsberg , of the rival team , said they had their own analysis of their own b-quark measurements underway .
He compared the rumor to a game of telephone that “ starts one way , ends up the other . ”
Dr. Dorigo said , “ Right now there is nothing to build a story around . ”
Things could heat up again at conferences this summer in Karlsruhe , Germany , and Daegu , South Korea , where particle physics results are traditionally presented — or never .
The official silence did not stop speculation .
If it is a Higgs , theorists say , it is probably not the one prescribed by the Standard Model , which would not be produced plentifully enough to be seen yet .
The leading alternative is that it would be one of five Higgs bosons predicted by a theory called supersymmetry , which theorists have been yearning for as the next step toward a more all - embracing , unified theory of nature .
One bonus of supersymmetry is that it predicts the existence of more , yet undiscovered elementary particles , one of which might be the mysterious dark matter that binds galaxies together in the universe .
All this would fall into the lap of the Large Hadron Collider scientists , if it exists , which is one reason the CERN physicists will be happy no matter what the outcome .
But if that is the case , the Tevatron should have already seen it , physicists said .
“ If it ’s real , it ’s quite a weird object , ” said Dr. Lykken , who had been discussing possible theoretical models with his Higgs - savvy colleagues just in case the anomaly does not go away .
It would be hard to reconcile this result with all the data already collected by Fermilab and the L.E.P. at the European laboratory , he explained .
“ I do n’t know if we pinned down nature , or if nature has pinned us down , but there are many corners you ca n’t get into anymore , ” Dr. Lykken said .
Dr. Weinberg , who acknowledged his rooting interest in the Higgs discovery , as the particle is at the center of Nobel Prize work , said he had heard the sighting rumor but did not know what to make of it .
“ I ’m more patient now , ” he said .
“ Hey , you ’re in IT , right , ” a frantic fellow in a maintenance jumpsuit asked , barging right into G.R.G. ’s cramped little office .
G.R.G. shifted his eyes away from the project he was working on – some database for physics students and professors – and began to formulate an affirmative answer .
Before he could even complete the word “ yes , ” the Maintenance Guy jumped in , “ ’ cause , we have a serious problem . ”
The Maintenance Guy went on to explain that he was receiving increasingly severe temperature alarms from the Server Room .
First 86 °F , then 93°F , then 97°F , and – just then – 103 °F .
He figured that the dedicated air conditioning unit had died .
Normally , that would n’t be a problem , but he had no way to get in to fix it .
The Server Room – which housed all of the university ’s critical research , financial , and operational servers – was locked .
This was n’t the first time that someone had come to G.R.G. asking to get in the Server Room .
While the maintenance folks have access to a Master Key that can unlock any door in the building , the Server Room is the only door that does not have a keyhole .
You see , years ago the IT Headmaster decided that it was far too insecure to protect their Server Room with a simple key .
After all , keys could be duplicated and locks could be picked , and their Server Room had to remain completely secure .
A locksmith was brought in to install one of those “ push four button ” locks on the door , and the code would be a well - kept secret .
In fact , only the IT Headmaster and his two most trusted minions knew the code , and since G.R.G. had only been an employee for four years , he was not a member of that small circle .
There was little G.R.G. could do to help the poor Maintenance Guy , let alone the rapidly overheating servers .
He called up the IT Headmaster .
No answer .
He called up Minion # 1 .
No answer , either .
He called up Minion # 2 . Still , no answer .
And all the while , the temperature climbed to 118 °F and one of the key research servers went down .
It was n’t looking good .
G.R.G. knew that had little chance of tracking down the IT Headmaster and his minions ; though their office was a short , four - mile drive away , they could be in any one of the campus ’s hundred or so buildings .
He had to think of something else , and think of it fast .
He sprung up from his chair and hurried down the hall with Maintenance Guy towards the Server Room .
Perhaps they could find an alternative way in .
Going through the drop ceiling was n’t an option ; the walls went up past the ceiling tiles .
Busting down the door did n’t seem too feasible ; it seemed far too solid and no worth risking a dislocated shoulder or a broken foot .
The old credit - card - in - the - door - jamb trick was a no - go , too ; apparently , lock manufacturers had closed that loophole long ago and Hollywood just had n’t caught up yet .
Their only other option was to figure out the code by looking at the wear patterns on the different numbers .
And as it turned out , that did n’t work out so well , either .
But then G.R.G. noticed something very interesting .
Actually , he could n’t believe he had n’t noticed it before .
When the locksmith had installed the push - button lock , he removed the key lock by simply pulling out the replacement lock cylinder .
Here was a big gaping hole on the door knob where a key would normally go .
G.R.G pulled out his trusty BIC pen , jiggled it around in the hole a bit , and – click – the lock spring opened and the door knob could be turned .
He opened up the door and was greeted by a blast of hot air and a room full of beeping servers .
As the maintenance guy went in and did his thing , G.R.G. thought to himself , all the servers , all the research grants , I could take them , they ’d be mine , mine , mine !
Or , of course , anyone else who had walked past the server room armed with a BIC pen in the past few years .
Story continues in the sequel , Securing The Server Room , Part II .

As of September 2018 , Paul Manafort , who served at one time as President Trump 's campaign chairman , has been found guilty on eight counts of tax and bank fraud .
In a separate trial , he will be prosecuted for money laundering .
The money laundering charges have to do with a scheme that follows a tried and true method for rinsing the dirt off your treasure .
Manafort is alleged to have garnered millions from the former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych .
Rather than declare these earnings to the IRS and turn over the taxes due , Manafort is said to have placed them in offshore accounts and then used them to buy expensive real estate in the U.S .
Once he owned the properties , prosecutors say he then used them as collateral to take out millions of dollars in loans from U.S. banks .
Since the money was in the form of loans rather than income , he was n't obliged to pay taxes on it .
The old real estate bait - and - switch is a classic mode of cleaning up cash .
Money laundering is an ancient felonious practice and Manafort is hardly the first political figure to get himself mixed up in it .

That 's in the neighborhood of 2 to 5 percent of the entire planet 's GDP !
The rise of global financial markets makes money laundering easier than ever — countries with bank - secrecy laws are directly connected to countries with bank - reporting laws , making it possible to anonymously deposit " dirty " money in one country and then have it transferred to any other country for use .
Money laundering , at its simplest , is the act of making money that comes from Source A look like it comes from Source B .
In practice , criminals are trying to disguise the origins of money obtained through illegal activities so it looks like it was obtained from legal sources .
Otherwise , they can't use the money because it would connect them to the criminal activity , and law - enforcement officials would seize it .
Money laundering happens in almost every country in the world , and a single scheme typically involves transferring money through several countries in order to obscure its origins .
In this article , we 'll learn exactly what money laundering is and why it 's necessary , who launders money and how they do it and what steps the authorities are taking to try to foil money - laundering operations .
There are a lot of books out there on personal finance topics , with more getting published each year .
Many of them are quite good — for the most part , you wo n’t go wrong picking up a personal finance book from the bookstore or the library or Amazon ( provided you avoid ones with outlandish claims , like quadrupling your wealth in a year or becoming a millionaire very quickly ) .
Over the years , though , a handful of personal finance books have really stood head and shoulders above the rest .
These books do a spectacular job of addressing specific personal finance topics .
These books remain in print and many often see regular revisions to keep some specifics updated , but the core information in each of these books is rock solid and timeless .
10 personal finance books you should read to jumpstart your financial education
1 . Best overall for personal finance : Your Money or Your Life by Joe Dominguez and Vicki Robin
An early edition of this book was the book that turned my financial life around .
It happened to be one of a handful that I grabbed at the library when I was completely lost in terms of my financial life and it was heavily responsible for turning my financial situation around .
Your Money or Your Life ‘s premise is that when you work , you are effectively exchanging some portion of your life for every dollar that you make .
Then , when you spend that dollar on something that does n’t provide deep or lasting meaning , you ’re essentially wasting your life .
You ’ve traded your time and energy for something that did n’t provide equal or greater value in return .
That core idea has a lot of implications , and Your Money or Your Life walks through them carefully through concepts like the fulfillment curve and the crossover point .
For me , perhaps the most effective point was the discussion of the idea of your true hourly wage .
Your true hourly wage refers to the amount of money you actually earn per hour of time invested in your work .
You add in all of the extra hours you give to work doing things like commuting , doing work outside of your work hours , communicating , travel and unwinding , then you also subtract out all of the money that your work bleeds from you for things like work clothes , work lunches and commuting expenses .
When you use those “ true ” amounts — the actual portion of your salary that you keep after work expenses are taken out divided by the total number of hours you actually devote to tasks due to work — to calculate your true hourly wage , it can be shocking , and it really recasts how much of your life you ’re trading for the things you buy .
The book ’s core advice is to become much more careful and thoughtful about how you spend money , recasting it in terms of the lasting value you get out of each dollar you spend , and it not only makes a powerful case for that perspective , it gives you a ton of tools for rebuilding your financial life with that idea at the center of it .
Pick up Your Money or Your Life from Amazon , or find it at your local library .
2 . Best for budgeting : You Need a Budget by Jesse Mecham
My preferred piece of personal finance software is You Need a Budget .
It does a really nice job of helping you make a clear financial picture of your life , categorizing your expenses and creating a spending plan that really makes sense .
Part of why the software works so well is that it ’s designed around a clear budgeting philosophy , perhaps best summarized as “ give every dollar a job . ”
The book ou Need a Budget , written by YNAB ’s founder Jesse Mecham , spells out that philosophy in detail and explains how to apply it to your own life without requiring the software in any way .
In my eyes , it ’s the best basic book on budgeting out there .
So , what is that “ give every dollar a job ” idea all about ?
The idea is really simple : whenever your paycheck arrives , you assign every dollar added to your bank account some kind of job .
In other words , you decide upfront how every dollar in your paycheck is going to be spent .
For example , $ 500 of it might go to the rent , $ 200 might go to the car payment and $ 100 of it might go toward eating out .
You get the idea .
Then , you just go ahead and take action on a lot of those .
Make that car payment .
Make that rent payment .
Get them out of the way .
The rest of the money goes to the things you ’ve designated for them .
Mecham ’s book expands on this core idea , which is the foundation of a real living budget that actually works for you .
Pick up You Need a Budget from Amazon or your local library .
3 . Best for people with debt : The Total Money Makeover by Dave Ramsey
If there is a single book that you need to read if you ’re struggling with overwhelming debt , it ’s The Total Money Makeover by Dave Ramsey .
It addresses the issue of personal debt better than any other book on the market .
The core idea behind The Total Money Makeover is that you should assemble a “ debt snowball ” — Ramsey ’s term for a debt repayment plan — and pay it off as rapidly as possible , progressing rapidly toward debt freedom as an ultimate goal .
The plan that Ramsey offers is very simple to follow ; Ramsey definitely follows a “ keep it simple , stupid ” attitude throughout the book .
Ramsey takes the perspective of a “ tough coach ” in this book , which may or may not be to everyone ’s liking .
There is a lot of strong encouragement and inspirational stories for making positive steps toward repaying debt , but there is also a lot of strong “ get to work ” talk to motivate as well .
If you value motivation and are struggling with debt , this book is basically perfect for you .
Pick it up from Amazon or your local library .
4 . Best for personal financial success : The Millionaire Next Door by Thomas Stanley and William Danko
The Millionaire Next Door is a discussion of a detailed survey of actual millionaires conducted by the two authors over a number of years .
The survey draws a number of very interesting conclusions about people who manage to accumulate wealth in their lifetimes , and it ’s not what people typically expect when they think “ millionaire . ”
The book concludes that people who are effective at building personal wealth do n’t live flashy lifestyles ; they accumulate wealth by being careful with their spending .
The consistent theme of this book is that the most effective route to building financial stability is by , yes , having a job that pays well or a business of your own , but coupling that with being quite frugal .
In fact , the book goes so far as to argue that abundant spending and a flashy lifestyle are often indicators of little actual wealth outside of the exorbitantly rich .
The authors walk through all kinds of conclusions from their survey , studying how people who build solid personal wealth parent their children , conduct their marriages and buy homes .
The survey data is surprisingly consistent in terms of some key traits in each of those areas .
If you want a window into the traits and commonalities amongst people who are actually successful at building lasting personal wealth so that they can become financially independent , this book is a very valuable read .

5 . Best for changing spending habits : Atomic Habits by James Clear
For most of us , one of the biggest challenges to turning our financial picture around is changing our spending habits and routines .
As humans , we ’re creatures of habit — we have certain ways of doing things , we stick with them and we change them less often than we think .
Two books really changed my thinking about habits .
The one I want to focus on here is Atomic Habits by James Clear , which focuses on the singular principle that if you want to change your habits , you focus by changing the smallest possible habit , making that change permanent and building from there .
In other words , if you want to start changing your spending habits , focus on changing one very discrete habit that you do .
For example , if you stop for a coffee at the coffee shop every morning , just change that one habit to making coffee at home each morning and focus on making that your new habit .
Atomic Habits is full of strategies for making that singular shift happen , and then that singular shift gives you a blueprint and a foundation to make other changes happen .
Just start with and focus on one singular small habit and let the rest follow from there .
Remember I mentioned two books ?
The one that ’s not listed here — Triggers by Marshall Goldsmith — is a wonderful book , but is a bit less straightforward for getting started .
It ’s more of an “ advanced take ” on how to handle changing your behaviors , not the individual actions that you take .
I strongly recommend it as a follow - up to Atomic Habits .
Pick up Atomic Habits from Amazon or your local library .
6 . Best for savings and retiring investments : The Automatic Millionaire by David Bach
One principle I ’ve come to really believe in , particularly in the last few years , is that lasting financial success is largely automated .
If you ’re relying on yourself to constantly make the right financial decision over and over , it ’ll probably fall apart because , even with the best of intentions , you ’ll make a lot of wrong choices that undermine your progress .
Success is found when the right financial decision is essentially locked in place for you or made so easy that it ’s the obvious choice .
That ’s the core concept behind The Automatic Millionaire .
The idea that the book offers is that you should automate as many of your financial choices as possible so that you ’re much less likely to make major financial mistakes in the heat of the moment .
For example , let ’s say you get paid on the first day of each month and the money always shows up in your checking account by the fifth day .
You might then set up a bunch of financial moves to automatically happen on the 7th or 8th — a contribution to your emergency fund , your mortgage payment , your bills automatically paid , a contribution to your Roth IRA , money transferred into an account for groceries and household supplies and money transferred somewhere for “ fun money ” use .
The goal is to take those decisions out of your hands and make them happen without further thought or having to take action .
They just occur .
That way , you never second guess your decision to make smart financial moves .
You just need to make that decision once and carry it through by setting everything up .

7 . Best for investment beginners : The Bogleheads ’ Guide to Investing by Taylor Larimore , Mel Lindauer , and Michael LeBoeuf
If there is a single volume on investing that I would recommend everyone to read , particularly when they ’re starting out , it ’s this one .
What sets The Bogleheads ’ Guide to Investing apart is that it not only explains the basics of investing , it also spells out in very clear terms a sensible and easy to follow investing philosophy .
The core idea behind the book is that you ’re not a seasoned investor and you ’re not going to devote large sums of time to studying investing ; you want to understand what ’s going on , but you do n’t aim to be a professional investor .
Rather , you just want to get good returns without having to pay a money manager and run minimal risk of losing your shirt .
The investing philosophy that this book describes is indexing .
It ’s the idea that the best way for most people who are n’t professional investors to invest is to buy tiny slivers of everything and ride the market average .
The book identifies many ways to do that easily through buying low - cost index funds , which exist to do that very thing — buying little bits of everything at once .
Pick it up from Amazon or your local library .
8 . Best for learning more about stocks : A Random Walk Down Wall Street by Burton J. Malkiel
This is the single most worthwhile book for a person to read if they want to gain a basic understanding of how the stock market works .
While it ’s not a particularly strong guide on how to invest , it is very good at making the fundamentals of the stock market clear to everyone .
The core idea of the book is that for the average person , the stock market is effectively unpredictable .
The prices of stocks go up and down based on reactions to new information , which are somewhat predictable , but the release of that information is n’t predictable at all for most people .
You ca n’t guess what the stock market will do tomorrow any more than you can guess what the headlines tomorrow will be , and any reasonable knowledge about those headlines has already been incorporated into the current value of stocks .
So , what can an average person do ?
Malkiel ’s suggestions are pretty strongly in line with the suggestions from the previous book : buy index funds .
The difference here is that , while a detailed review of The Bogleheads ’ Guide to Investing gets deep into the how , A Random Walk Down Wall Street gets deep into the why .
Pick it up from Amazon or your local library .
9 . Best for teaching finance to kids : Raising Financially Fit Kids by Joline Godfrey
As a father of three , I know as well as anyone the sheer number of challenges that raising children to be self - sufficient independent adults puts on the shoulders of parents .
Raising your child to have the skills necessary to succeed in the modern world is tricky , and finances are a particularly tricky area .
Hands down , Raising Financially Fit Kids by Joline Godfrey is the best book on teaching your kids about money .
What really makes this book click is that it focuses on the developmental needs of children at each age in their growth and offers strategies for teaching personal finance ideas that are in line with that developmental level .
It leans really heavily into the practical , offering specific things to do with your kids at each level so that they understand the value of money , the value of saving and how to be ready to manage their own financial life .
I ’ve been using the ideas in this book for years in raising my own children and the biggest thing I ’ve noticed is that all of my kids are prodigious savers .
They all see the big picture and are constantly willing to delay gratification when they have a big goal in mind .
That ’s a skill I really wish I had at their age because it would have helped my own financial journey so much .
I attribute much of that to the ideas I ’ve used from Raising Financially Fit Kids .

10 : Best for retiring early : Early Retirement Extreme by Jacob Lund Fisker
What if you have a laser focus on retiring as early as possible , escaping the rat race of constant work and spending the rest of your life devoted to other goals with the money you earned during your years of work ?
Early Retirement Extreme is a powerful philosophical and practical guide to that approach .
Early Retirement Extreme ‘s main idea is that almost every decision you make in life can be filtered through the lens of how many years you want to spend working for someone else at tasks you do n’t choose .
Every lifestyle upgrade you choose adds to the time spent working for others and takes away from the time you spend on your own .
In the author ’s hands , this becomes an overarching life philosophy .
He offers a lot of encouragement for readers to adopt a jack - of - all - trades approach to life , where they develop a wide array of skills such that they ’re prepared to handle whatever life might throw at them should they retire .
Having a wide variety of skills also means that you ’re less likely to have to pay others for services now ( as you ’re saving for early retirement ) and later ( when you ’re actually in early retirement ) , enabling you to save more now and also be able to retire faster .
Fisker applies that mindset to all kinds of things in the later chapters , like choosing a place to live , how to exercise , entertainment choices and career decisions .
It ’s a powerful , thought - provoking book .
Pick up Early Retirement Extreme from Amazon or your local library .

AsusTek Computer Inc. ( known to most motherboard enthusiasts simply as ASUS ) , has announced its intention to split into three separate corporate holdings in order to maximize competitive performance and minimize potential conflicts of interest .
As things currently stand , it 's possible for a company that competes with the AsusTek brand to actually contract with AsusTek to build equipment , and several customers have expressed unhappiness over this arrangement .
Asus ' branded business will retain the Asus name , the PC - related manufacturing segment will be known as Unihan Technology Corp. , and the casing , module , and non-PC contract manufacturing segment will be named Pegatron Technology Corp .
This type of dramatic spinoff is not without precedent : Acer Inc. , was originally a single , unified company that spun segments of itself off into a contract manufacturing arm ( Wistron ) and a mobile phone and monitor business ( BenQ ) .
Although investors were originally worried that Wistron might fail to compete effectively for Acer orders , the company has since captured business from Microsoft 's Xbox 360 .
AsusTek 's coming spinoff is also well - positioned ; Sony currently taps AsusTek for the PlayStation 3 .
Of the three new companies set to debut by January of 2009 , Pegatron is expected to have the largest revenue share , at approximately NT$ 300 billion to NT$ 350 billion .
The future AsusTek - branded business should account for ~ NT $ 250 billion , and the Unihan segment is expected to see revenue of NT $ 150 billion .
Combined revenue for all three companies should reach NT $ 800 billion , compared to NT $ 560 billion in 2006 .
After the separation , AsusTek leadership intends to focus on contract manufacturing , with the stated goal of becoming the world 's top manufacturing provider .
As part of that plan , AsusTek is considering opening facilities in Brazil , Vietnam , and India .
Total company revenues through May were at NT$ 319.1 billion , up 99.7 percent year - over - year .
STUNG by harsh publicity about fat kids and threatened with lawsuits , the nation ’s three largest beverage companies finally got some love last year when they voluntarily agreed to remove sugary drinks from schools .
In the place of soda and sugar - laden beverages , Coca - Cola , PepsiCo and Cadbury Schweppes agreed that only water , low - fat milk and 100 percent juice would be offered in elementary and middle schools .
In high schools , sports drinks , light juices and diet drinks would also be allowed .
The announcement was brokered by the Alliance for a Healthier Generation , a collaboration of the American Heart Association and the William J. Clinton Foundation , and it was widely praised .
Former President Bill Clinton , who attended the press conference , called the decision “ courageous . ”
“ Shrewd ” was probably a better word .
The truth is that full - calorie soda would have been forced out of schools eventually , either by litigation or legislation .
And the beverage companies were lucky to get sports drinks in the deal since many nutritionists believe there is no reason for kids to be drinking them unless they are vigorously exercising .
But that was n’t the end of it .
After the deal was signed and the editorials written , the beverage makers sought a change .
Under the original terms of the agreement , only sports drinks and light juices with no more than 66 calories per eight ounces were allowed to be sold in high schools .
But because of a quietly executed amendment in late April , “ other drinks ” with no more than 66 calories per eight ounces are now allowed .

When he leaves his tidy apartment in an ocean - side city somewhere in America , Aaron turns on the radio to a light rock station .
“ For the cat , ” he explains , “ so she wo n’t get lonely . ”
He ’s short and balding and dressed mostly in black , and right before I turn on the recorder , he asks me for the dozenth time to guarantee that I wo n’t reveal his name or anything else that might identify him .
“ I do n’t want to be a target for gay activists , ” he says as we head out into the misty day .
“ Harassment like that I just do n’t need . ”
Aaron sets a much brisker pace down the boardwalk than you would expect of a doughy 51 - year - old , and once convinced I ’ll respect his anonymity , he turns out to be voluble .
Over the crash of the waves , he spares no details as he describes how much he hated the fact that he was gay , how the last thing in the world he wanted to do was act on his desire to have sex with another man .
“ I ’m going to be perfectly blatant about it , ” he says .
“ I ’m not going to have anal intercourse or give or receive any BJs either , okay ? ”
He managed to maintain his celibacy through college and into adulthood .
But when , in the late 1980s , he found himself so “ insanely jealous ” of his roommate ’s girlfriend that he had to move out , he knew the time had come to do something .
One of the few people who knew that Aaron was gay showed him an article in Newsweek about a group offering “ reparative therapy ” — psychological treatment for people who want to become “ ex - gay . ”
“ It turns out that I did n’t have the faintest idea what love was , ” he says .
That ’s not all he did n’t know .
He also did n’t know that his same - sex attraction , far from being inborn and inescapable , was a thirst for the love that he had not received from his father , a cold and distant man prone to angry outbursts , coupled with a fear of women kindled by his intrusive and overbearing mother , all of which added up to a man who wanted to have sex with other men just so he could get some male attention .
He did n’t understand any of this , he tells me , until he found a reparative therapist whom he consulted by phone for nearly 10 years , attended weekend workshops , and learned how to “ be a man . ”
Aaron interrupts himself to eye a woman in shorts jogging by .
“ Sometimes there are very good - looking women at this boardwalk , ” he says .
“ Especially when they ’re not bundled up . ”
He remembers when he started noticing women ’s bodies , a few years into his therapy .
“ The first thing I noticed was their legs .
The curve of their legs . ”
He ’s dated women , had sex with them even , although “ I was pretty awkward , ” he says .
“ It just did n’t work . ”
Aaron has a theory about this : “ I never used my body in a sexual way .
I think the men who actually act it out have a greater success in terms of being sexual with women than the men who did n’t act it out . ”
Not surprisingly , he ’s never had a long - term relationship , and he ’s pessimistic about his prospects .
“ I ca n’t make that jump from having this attraction to doing something about it . ”
But , he adds , it ’s wrong to think “ if you do n’t make it with women , then you have n’t changed . ”
The important thing is that “ now I like myself .
I ’m not emotionally shut down .
I ’m comfortable in my own body .
I do n’t have to be drawn to men anymore .
I ’m content at this point to lead an asexual life , which is what I ’ve done for most of my life anyway . ”
He adds , “ I ’m a very detached person . ”
It ’s raining a little now .
We stop walking so I can tuck the microphone under the flap of Aaron ’s shirt pocket , and I feel him recoil as I fiddle with his button .
I ’m remembering his little cubicle of an apartment , its unlived - in feel , and thinking that he may be the sort of guy who just does n’t like anyone getting too close , but it ’s also possible that therapy has taught him to submerge his desire so deep that he ’s lost his motive for intimacy .
That ’s the usual interpretation of reparative therapy — that to the extent that it does anything , it leads people to repress rather than change their natural inclinations , that its claims to change sexual orientation are an outright fraud perpetrated by the religious right on people who have internalized the homophobia of American society , personalized the political in such a way as to reject their own sexuality and stunt their love lives .
But Aaron scoffs at these notions , insisting that his wish to go straight had nothing to do with right - wing religion or politics — he ’s a nonobservant Jew and a lifelong Democrat who volunteered for George McGovern , has a career in public service , and thinks George Bush is a war criminal .
It was n’t a matter of ignorance — he has an advanced degree — and it really was n’t a psychopathological thing — he rejects the idea that he ’s ever suffered from internalized homophobia .
He just did n’t want to be gay , and , like millions of Americans dissatisfied with their lives , he sought professional help and reinvented himself .
Self - reconstruction is what people in my profession ( I am a practicing psychotherapist ) specialize in , but when it comes to someone like Aaron , most of us draw the line .
All the major psychotherapy guilds have barred their members from researching or practicing reparative therapy on the grounds that it is inherently unethical to treat something that is not a disease , that it contributes to oppression by pathologizing homosexuality , and that it is dangerous to patients whose self - esteem can only suffer when they try to change something about themselves that they ca n’t ( and should n’t have to ) change .
Aaron knows this , of course , which is why he’s at great pains to prove he ’s not pulling a Ted Haggard .
For if he ’s not a poseur , then he is a walking challenge to the political and scientific consensus that has emerged over the last century and a half : that sexual orientation is inborn and immutable , that efforts to change it are bound to fail , and that discrimination against gay people is therefore unjust .
But as crucial as this consensus has been to the struggle for gay rights , it may not be as sound as some might wish .
While scientists have found intriguing biological differences between gay and straight people , the evidence so far stops well short of proving that we are born with a sexual orientation that we will have for life .
Even more important , some research shows that sexual orientation is more fluid than we have come to think , that people , especially women , can and do move across customary sexual orientation boundaries , that there are ex-straights as well as ex-gays .
Much of this research has stayed below the radar of the culture warriors , but reparative therapists are hoping to use it to enter the scientific mainstream and advocate for what they call the right of self - determination in matters of sexual orientation .
If they are successful , gay activists may soon find themselves scrambling to make sense of a new scientific and political landscape .
In 1838 , a 20 - year - old Hungarian killed himself and left a suicide note for Karl Benkert , a 14 - year - old bookseller ’s apprentice in Budapest whom he had befriended .
In it he explained that he had been cleaned out by a blackmailer who was now threatening to expose his homosexuality , and that he could n’t face either the shame or the potential legal trouble that would follow .
Benkert , who eventually became a writer , moved to Vienna , and changed his name to Karoly Maria Kertbeny , later said that the tragedy left him with “ an instinctive drive to take issue with every injustice . ”
And in 1869 , a particularly resonant injustice occurred : A penal code proposed for Prussia included an anti-sodomy law much like the one that had given his friend ’s extortionist his leverage .
Kertbeny published a pamphlet in protest , writing that the state ’s attempt to control consensual sex between men was a violation of the fundamental rights of man .
Nature , he argued , had divided the human race into four sexual types : “ monosexuals , ” who masturbated , “ heterogenits , ” who had sex with animals , “ heterosexuals , ” who coupled with the opposite sex , and “ homosexuals , ” who preferred people of the same sex .
Kertbeny could n’t have known that of all his literary output , these latter two words would be his only lasting legacy .
But while homosexual conduct had occurred throughout history , the idea that it reflected fundamental differences between people , that gay people were a sexual subspecies , was a new one .
Kertbeny was n’t alone in creating a sexual taxonomy .
Another anti-sodomy - law opponent , lawyer Karl Heinrich Ulrichs , proposed that homosexual men , or “ Uranians , ” as he called them ( and he openly considered himself a Uranian , while Kertbeny was coy about his preferences ) , were actually a third sex , their attraction to other men a manifestation of the female soul residing in their male bodies .
Whatever the theoretical differences between Ulrichs and Kertbeny , they agreed on one crucial point : that sexual behavior was the expression of an identity into which we were born , a natural variation of the human .
In keeping with the post - Enlightenment notion that we are morally culpable only for what we are free to choose , homosexuals were not to be condemned or restricted by the state .
Indeed , this was Kertbeny and Ulrichs ’ purpose : Sexual orientation , as we have come to call this biological essence , was invented in order to secure freedom for gay people .
But replacing morality with biology , and the scrutiny of church and state with the observations of science , invited a different kind of condemnation .
By the end of the 19th century , homosexuality was increasingly the province of psychiatrists like Magnus Hirschfeld , a gay Jewish Berliner .
Hirschfeld was an outspoken opponent of anti-sodomy laws and championed tolerance of gay people , but he also believed that homosexuality was a pathological state , a congenital deformity of the brain that may have been the result of a parental “ degeneracy ” that nature intended to eliminate by making the defective population unlikely to reproduce .
Even Sigmund Freud , who thought people were “ polymorphously perverse ” by nature and urged tolerance for homosexuality , believed heterosexuality was essential to maturity and psychological health .
Freud was pessimistic that homosexuality could be treated , but doctors abhor an illness without a cure , and the 20th century saw therapists inflict the best of modern psychiatric practice on gay people , which included , in addition to interminable psychoanalysis and unproven medications , treatments that used electric shock to associate pain with same - sex attraction .
These therapies were largely unsuccessful , and , particularly after the Stonewall riots of 1969 — the clash between police and gays that initiated the modern gay rights movement — patients and psychiatrists alike started questioning whether homosexuality should be considered a mental illness at all .
Gay activists , some of them psychiatrists , disrupted the annual meeting of the American Psychiatric Association for three years in a row , until in 1973 a deal was brokered .
The apa would delete homosexuality from its Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ( dsm ) immediately , and furthermore it would add a new disease : sexual orientation disorder , in which a patient ca n’t accept his or her sexual identity .
The culprit in sod was an oppressive society , and the cure for sod was to help the gay patient overcome oppression and accept who he or she really was .
( sod has since been removed from the dsm . )
The apa cited various scientific papers in making its decision , but many members were convinced that the move was a dangerous corruption of science by politics .
“ If groups of people march and raise enough hell , they can change anything in time , ” one psychiatrist worried .
“ Will schizophrenia be next ? ”
And their impression was confirmed when the final decision was made not in a laboratory but at the ballot box , where the membership voted by a six - point margin to authorize the apa to delete the diagnosis of homosexuality .
It may be the first time in history that a disease was eliminated by the stroke of a pen .
It was certainly the first time that psychiatrists determined that the cause of a mental illness was an intolerant society .
And it was a crucial moment for gay people , at once getting the psychiatrists out of their bedrooms and giving the weight of science to Kertbeny and Ulrichs ’ claim that homosexuality was an identity , like race or national origin , that deserved protection .
three decades later , at least one group is still raising hell about the deletion : the National Association for the Research and Therapy of Homosexuality ( narth ) , an organization founded by Charles Socarides , a psychiatrist who led the opposition to the 1973 apa vote .
“ They will wipe the floor with us , ” Socarides ( who died in 2005 ) once said , “ but we will wear our wounds as badges of courage , ” and at narth ‘s November 2006 national meeting in Orlando , Socarides ’ firebrand rhetoric is still in the air .
You hear it when Joe and Marian Allen take to the lectern to tell us how God has called them to “ give testimony ” about their gay son who was murdered by his lover , a tragedy that they manage to twist into a cautionary tale about what happens when a “ struggler ” is told by a “ well - meaning therapist ” that he was “ born gay ” and ca n’t change it .
Or when a minion of James Dobson ’s Focus on the Family cheerfully explains the Gay Agenda to me : “ It ’s doing whatever you want , whenever you want , with whoever you want , wherever you want . ”
“ Well , just for the sake of argument , ” I ask , “ what ’s wrong with that ? ”
“ I ’m sure the people who follow that agenda believe what they believe , but they do n’t realize that they ’re pawns in a great cosmic battle , that they are perpetrating a lie . ”
“ Pawns of ? … ”
“ Satan , ” he informs me , “ is the author of lies , chaos , and confusion . ”
But the men of narth ( nearly all the 75 attendees are white men ) are n’t spewing nearly as much hellfire and brimstone as I expected .
They do seem to hug a lot — many reparative therapists are ex-gay themselves , and , someone explains , part of being ex-gay is learning to be same - sex affectionate without being same - sex sexual — and maybe some of those hugs last a little too long , but it ’s mostly like every other convention : bad coffee , worse Danish , dry - as - dust lectures .
narth ‘s president - elect , A. Dean Byrd , a psychologist and professor at University of Utah Medical School , methodically lays out his case that sexual orientation is malleable in his daylong seminar on how to treat unwanted same - sex attraction .
If narth ‘s strategy is to seek a place at the table by demonstrating its scientific seriousness , Byrd ’s modulated approach , tedious as it may be , is just what the doctor ordered .
Sometimes he ’s puckish — as when he says , “ When it comes to homosexuality , I ’m pro-choice ” — a comment sure to get a rise out of a crowd well versed in the other moral disaster of 1973 — and sometimes glib ( “ the proper answer to the nature / nurture question is yes ” ) , but mostly he ’s just workmanlike as he reviews the research — much of it , he is delighted to point out , conducted by the “ activists themselves . ”
He cites a study from Denmark — the first place that legalized civil unions and perhaps , he says , the most gay - friendly place in the world — in which gay people turned out to have mental illness at a higher rate than straights , which proves , he says , that an intolerant society is not the culprit when gay people suffer .
He describes studies that show that the identical twin brother of a gay man has only a 50 percent chance of being gay himself , which may be twice the rate among fraternal twins , but still , he argues , far from the 100 percent you would expect if sexual orientation is purely genetic .
He even shows us video of one of his treatment sessions , and gives a plausible - sounding assessment of the prospects for patients of reparative therapists — that one - third of them will become heterosexual , one - third will remain gay , and one - third will move a few notches along the Kinsey scale , enough to leave the lifestyle and limit their unwanted feelings and behavior .
Byrd , like everyone else here , is very excited about an article that appeared in Archives of Sexual Behavior in 2003 .
It was a small study — 200 subjects — but it concluded that gay people could indeed change their sexual orientation , that the change was not merely religiously motivated repression or politically motivated bluster but rather some fundamental shift in desire .
The researcher concluded that even the people who showed little benefit from reparative therapy did n’t seem to be harmed by it , and that much more research needed to be done .
The study was full of caveats and received withering criticism from scientists who claimed that it relied on a skewed sample — mostly people handpicked by reparative therapists like Byrd — but it had passed peer review , and , even more importantly , it had been conducted by none other than Robert Spitzer , the same psychiatrist who had brokered the deal that deleted homosexuality from the dsm .
Spitzer also called for an end to the ban on research into reparative therapy , and one psychologist who has taken him up on that call is welcomed in Orlando like a conquering hero .
Elan Karten is an unassuming young man who wears a yarmulke and recently got a doctorate from Fordham after writing a dissertation on ex-gay men .
Karten only got the go - ahead for his study by positioning it as an inquiry into the type of people who seek reparative therapy rather than as an exploration of its efficacy .
He did manage to sneak in some of that research as well , and reached conclusions similar to Spitzer ’s — though peer reviewers objecting that it revives the notion that homosexuality is a mental illness have thus far prevented Karten , an academic unknown , from publishing his work .
By Saturday morning , gay activists have begun to gather outside the hotel to protest narth .
We are instructed not to respond to them ( “ Sing a hymn or pray instead ” ) as they put on duck outfits , hoist their signs ( Stop Ducking the Truth ; narth Is Goofy ) , make quacking noises , and yell “ Shame ! ” in our general direction .
Byrd looks out the door , shakes his head , and laughs when a man behind him says , “ Quack , quack ?
They ’re the queer ducks . ”
I wait until the foyer is empty before I head out to talk to Wayne Besen , a tall man in a polo shirt , who is pulling the props and costumes out of his car trunk .
He runs Truth Wins Out , an organization devoted to debunking the research of the ex-gay movement .
He minces no words about Spitzer ’s research — ” one of the most poorly constructed studies in the history of science , a travesty ” — and he calls reparative therapy “ intelligent design for gay people . ”
Besen thinks the stakes of the scientific battle are impossible to overstate .
“ Americans are not cruel .
If they think that being gay is inborn and ca n’t be changed , they are going to be very sympathetic to full equality for gay people , ” he says .
“ We win this argument , the gay rights struggle would be done . ”
Besen is sure that science is on the verge of giving gay people their slam dunk .
After all , he says , study after study shows that homosexuality is biological in origin .
In the last 15 years , researchers have discovered differences in brain anatomy between gay and straight men— and found that the 6 percent of rams that have sex exclusively with other rams ( just one of hundreds of species in which homosexual behavior has been observed ) have a similar neuroanatomical difference ; identified a gene sequence on the X chromosome that is common to many gay men ; traced genealogies to show that homosexuality runs in families , on the maternal side ; proved that a man ’s likelihood of being gay increases with the number of older brothers he has , which scientists attribute to changes in intrauterine chemistry ; and learned how to use magnetic resonance imaging to detect sexual orientation by watching the brain ’s response to pornography .
Findings in the field of anthropometrics have yielded intriguing results :
Gay men ’s index fingers , for instance , are more likely than straight men’s to be equal in length to their ring fingers ; gay men have larger penises than straight men .
These findings all seem to support Besen ’s contention that being gay is essentially biological and should remain beyond the reach of law , morals , or medicine .
But some activists are more reluctant than Besen to rely on this line of reasoning .
“ One thing I find troubling within the gay community is a lot of people feel if they can make that claim strongly enough that ’s going to give them equal rights , ” Sean Cahill , former director of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force Policy Institute , told me .
“ But I do n’t think it really matters , ” he says , pointing out that believing that sexual orientation is biological does n’t cause one to support gay rights .
Indeed , many social scientists think that the beliefs are merely correlated , that people who hold one tend to hold the other .
Some gay rights lawyers point out that whatever biology ’s role in sexual orientation , it should not be legally paramount .
The Supreme Court has ruled that the immutability of a group ’s identifying characteristics is one of the criteria that entitle it to heightened protection from discrimination ( and some cases establishing gay rights were decided in part on those grounds ) , but , according to Suzanne Goldberg , director of the Sexuality and Gender Law Clinic at Columbia Law School , there ’s a far more fundamental reason for courts to protect gay people .
“ Sexual orientation does not bear on a person ’s ability to contribute to society , ” she notes .
“ We do n’t need the science to make that point . ” Jon Davidson , legal director of Lambda Legal , agrees , adding that if courts are going to ask about immutability , they should n’t focus on biology .
Instead they should focus on how sexual orientation is so deeply woven into a person ’s identity that it is inseparable from who they are .
In this respect , Davidson says , sexual orientation is like another core aspect of identity that is clearly not biological in origin : religion .
“ It does n’t matter whether you were born that way , it came later , or you chose , ” he says .
“ We do n’t think it ’s okay to discriminate against people based on their religion .
We think people have a right to believe whatever they want .
So why do we think that about religion and not about who we love ? ”
Cahill — who says he does n’t think he was born gay — points out that even if it is crucial for public support , essentialism has a dark side : the remedicalization of homosexuality , this time as a biological condition that can be treated .
Michael Bailey , a Northwestern University psychologist who has conducted some of the key studies of the genetics of sexual orientation , infuriated the gay and lesbian community with a paper arguing that , should prenatal markers of homosexuality be identified , parents ought to have the right to abort potentially gay fetuses .
“ It ’s reminiscent of eugenicist theories , ” Cahill tells me .
“ If it ’s seen as an undesirable trait , it could lead in some creepy directions . ”
These could include not only abortion , but also gene therapy or modulating uterine hormone levels to prevent the birth of a gay child .
Psychology professor Lisa Diamond may have the best reason of all for activists to shy away from arguing that homosexuality is inborn and immutable :
It ’s not exactly true .
She does n’t dispute the findings that show a biological role in sexual orientation , but she thinks far too much is made of them .
“ The notion that if something is biological , it is fixed — no biologist on the planet would make that sort of assumption , ” she told me from her office at the University of Utah .
Not only that , she says , but the research — which is conducted almost exclusively on men— hinges on a very narrow definition of sexual orientation : “ It ’s what makes your dick go up .
I think most women would disagree with that definition , ” she says , not only because it obviously excludes them , but because sexual orientation is much more complex than observable aspects of sexuality .
“ An erection is an erection , ” she says , “ but we have almost no information about what is actually going on in terms of the subjective experience of desire . ”
Diamond has spent the last 12 years doing her part to fill in this gap by following a group of 79 women who originally described themselves as nonheterosexual , and she ’s found that sexual orientation is much more fluid than activists like Besen believe .
“ Contrary to this notion that gay people struggle with their identity in childhood and early adolescence , then come out and ride off into the sunset , ” she says , “ the more time goes on , the more variability comes out .
Women change their identities and find their attractions changing . ”
In the first year of her study , 43 percent of her subjects identified themselves as lesbian , 30 percent as bisexual , and 27 percent as unlabeled .
By year 10 , those percentages had changed significantly : 30 percent said they were lesbian , 29 percent said they were bisexual , 22 percent would n’t label themselves , and 7 percent said they were now straight ( the remaining 12 percent had left the study ) .
Across the entire group , Diamond found that only 58 percent of her subjects ’ sexual partners were women ; in year eight , even the women who identified as lesbians reported that between 10 and 20 percent of their sexual partners were men .
Diamond concludes that the categorization of women into gay , straight , and bisexual misses an important fact : that they move back and forth among these categories , and that the fluidity that allows them to do so is as crucial a variable in sexual development as their orientation .
Diamond cautions that it ’s important not to confuse plasticity — the capacity for sexual orientation to change — with choice — the ability to change it at will .
“ Trying to change your attractions does n’t work very well , but you can change the structure of your social life , and that might lead to changes in the feelings you experience . ”
This is a time - honored way of handling unwanted sexual feelings , she points out .
“ Jane Austen made a career out of this : People fall in love with a person of the wrong social class .
What do you do ?
You get yourself out of those situations . ”
For the women in Diamond ’s study who tell her , “ ‘ I hate straight society , I do n’t want to be straight , ' ” Austen ’s solution is an effective treatment for unwanted other - sex attraction .
“ If you ’re around women all the time and you are never around men , you are probably going to be more attracted to women , ” she says .
Such women sometimes end up falling in love with women , and their sexual feelings follow .
And it can work the other way , Diamond says : Women who identify themselves as gay or bisexual sometimes find themselves , to their own surprise , in love with men with whom they then become sexual partners .
Indeed , she says , “ love has no sexual orientation . ”
Which is n’t all that different from what they say at narth — that people like Aaron who hate the gay lifestyle and do n’t want to be gay should leave the gay bars , do regular guy things with men , and put themselves in the company of women for romance .
And indeed the narth ites know all about Diamond ’s work .
“ We know that straight people become gays and lesbians , ” narth ‘s outgoing president Joseph Nicolosi told the group gathered in Orlando .
“ So it seems totally reasonable that some gay and lesbian people would become straight .
The issue is whether therapy changes sexual orientation .
People grow and change as a result of life experiences , especially personal relationships .
Why then ca n’t the experience of therapy and the relationship with the therapist also effect change ? ”
Diamond calls this interpretation a “ misuse ” of her research — ” the fluidity I ’ve observed does not mean that reparative therapy works ” — but what is really being misused , she says , is science .
“ We live in a culture where people disagree vehemently about whether or not sexual minorities deserve equal rights , ” she told me .
“ People cling to this idea that science can provide the answers , and I do n’t think it can .
I think in some ways it ’s dangerous for the lesbian and gay community to use biology as a proxy for that debate . ”
aaron does n’t put it this way , but he thinks of himself as a member of a sexual minority — not forced into the closet by an oppressive society , but living under the restrictive view that sexual orientation is a biological category , something we are born with and that is impossible to change .
When I tell him about some of what I saw at narth — like when Nicolosi , recalling one of his antagonists at the apa convention , said , “ I knew that she was a lesbian — I do n’t know why ; she was wearing a muscle shirt ” — Aaron does n’t defend the organization .
He knows that narth does n’t like gay people much ( he ’s attended one of their meetings ) .
But he ’s more concerned with a different kind of intolerance .
“ Not all homosexual men want to lead a gay lifestyle .
Gay activists should n’t be threatened by that .
I mean , here I am , as a liberal , telling gay people to accept diversity . ”
narth spares no opportunity to claim that it is a victim of political correctness , silenced by a science that gay activists hijacked in 1973 and have exploited ever since .
It ’s a page right out of James Dobson ’s playbook , but narth is right on at least one count :
The complexity of sexual orientation surpasses the certainties of biology .
To the extent that the struggle for gay rights rests on a scientific foundation , narth ‘s strategy is bound to pay off .
Gay activists will then be left to build on other sources of public sympathy , none of which has the appeal of science .
After all , if sexual identity is more like religion than race , a matter of affiliation rather than birth , fluid rather than fixed , then finding a different basis for popular support — as well as for legislative and judicial protection — means confronting directly something Americans are perpetually confused about : the nature and boundaries of pleasure .
narth is perfectly positioned to exploit this confusion by arguing that sexual orientation can be influenced by environmental conditions , and that certain courses are less healthy than others .
That ’s how narth ites justify their opposition to extending marriage and adoption rights to gay people : not because they abhor homosexuality , but because a gay - friendly world is one in which it is hard for gay people to recognize that they are suffering from a medical illness .
Of course , in deploying medical language to serve its strategic interests , narth is only following the lead of Kertbeny and Hirschfeld , the original gay activists , and their modern counterparts who , despite minimizing the importance of biology , resort to scientific rhetoric when it suits their purposes .
“ People ca n’t try to shut down a part of who they are , ” says Sean Cahill .
“ I do n’t think it ’s healthy for people to change how their body and mind and heart work . ”
But medicine , which is what we rely on to tell us what is “ healthy , ” will always seek to change the way people ’s bodies and minds and hearts work ; yesterday ’s immutable state of nature is tomorrow ’s disease to be cured .
Medical science can only take its cues from the society whose curiosities it satisfies and whose confusions it investigates .
It can never do the heavy political lifting required to tell us whether one way of living our lives is better than another .
This is exactly why Kertbeny originated the notion of a biologically based sexual orientation , and , to the extent that society is more tolerant of homosexuality now than it was 150 years ago , that idea has been a success .
But the ex-gay movement may be the signal that this invention has begun to outlive its usefulness , that sexuality , profoundly mysterious and irrational , will not be contained by our categories , that it is time to find reasons other than medical science to insist that people ought to be able to love whom they love .

Mr Harper said Canada has a " real , growing " Arctic presence
Prime Minister Stephen Harper made the announcement during a tour of Canada 's northern territories .
It comes as a Danish mission prepares to sail to the North Pole to map the seabed under the ice .
Last week , a Russian expedition planted the country 's flag on the floor of the Arctic Ocean under the North Pole .
' Use it or lose it '
Mr Harper said a cold - weather army training base would be set up at Resolute Bay and an existing port at a former mine at Nanisivik would be refurbished to supply Arctic patrol vessels .
He said the facilities would bolster Canada 's claims to disputed portions of the Arctic .
" Canada 's new government understands that the first principle of Arctic sovereignty is use it or lose it , " Mr Harper said from Resolute , a small Inuit community about 600 km ( 372 miles ) south of the North Pole .
" Today 's announcements tell the world that Canada has real , growing , long - term presence in the Arctic . "
Polar missions
Melting polar ice has led to competing claims over access to Arctic resources , including the Northwest Passage , a shipping channel between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans currently blocked by ice during the winter months .
The Arctic Ocean is believed to be rich in oil and gas reserves
Danish North Pole mission
Mr Harper announced plans last month to build six naval vessels to patrol the passage .
Canada , Russia , Denmark , Norway and the United States also have competing claims to the seabed below the North Pole , an area containing as much as 25 % of the world 's undiscovered oil and gas according to a US study .
The area is not currently regarded as part of any single country 's territory and is governed instead by complex international agreements .
Last week a Russian expedition sent a mini-submarine to the ocean floor four kilometres ( 2.5 miles ) below the North Pole to further Moscow 's claim to the Arctic .
HAVE YOUR SAY
The North Pole like the South should be a de-militarised area , with no - one able to claim the territory
George Hinton , Twickenham , UK
Send us your comments
On Sunday , Denmark is sending a month - long expedition to the North Pole to study the same underwater ridge to see if it is connected to Greenland , a Danish territory .
The Danish team plans to collect data to map the seabed under the ice .
Sen .
Webb went on the offensive today and denounced the Lieberman / Kyl amendment as warmongering and a big fat , wet kiss to the " William the Bloody " Kristol wing of the GOP --- including the star of the Neocons : Dick Cheney .
Lieberman is setting the stage with all his Iran amendments that have the sole purpose of bringing the US into war with Iran .
This must be defeated and I implore the Democratic Party to vote this down .
A big shout out to Jim Webb for standing up against this amendment .
Call your Reps ...( We have a " Contact Congress " box on the lower right hand column )

Webb :
We are about to vote on something that may fundamentally change the way that the United States views the Iranian military , and we have n't had one hearing .
This is not the way to make foreign policy .
It 's not the way to declare war , although this cleverly worded sense of the Congress could be interpreted that way .
Those who regret their vote five years ago to authorize military action in Iraq should think hard before supporting this approach , because in my view , it has the same potential to do harm where many are seeking to do good .
The constant turmoil that these sorts of proposals and actions are bringing to the region is counterproductive .
They are regrettable substitute for a failure of diplomacy by this Administration .
I do not believe that any serious student of foreign policy could support this amendment as it now exists .
This proposal is Dick Cheney 's fondest pipe dream .
It 's not a prescription for success .
At best , it 's a deliberate attempt to divert attention from a failed diplomatic policy .
At worst , it could be read as a back door method of gaining congressional validation for action with one hearing or without serious debate .

What is time ?
The question is as hard to answer as whether or not time travel will ever be possible .
Traveling Through Time
by Clifford Pickover
What is time ?
Is time travel possible ?
For centuries , these questions have intrigued mystics , philosophers , and scientists .
Much of ancient Greek philosophy was concerned with understanding the concept of eternity , and the subject of time is central to all the world 's religions and cultures .
Can the flow of time be stopped ?
Certainly some mystics thought so .
Angelus Silesius , a sixth - century philosopher and poet , thought the flow of time could be suspended by mental powers :
Time is of your own making ;
its clock ticks in your head .
The moment you stop thought
time too stops dead .
The line between science and mysticism sometimes grows thin .
Today physicists would agree that time is one of the strangest properties of our universe .
In fact , there is a story circulating among scientists of an immigrant to America who has lost his watch .
He walks up to a man on a New York street and asks , " Please , Sir , what is time ? "
The scientist replies , " I 'm sorry , you 'll have to ask a philosopher .
I 'm just a physicist . "
Most cultures have a grammar with past and future tenses , and also demarcations like seconds and minutes , and yesterday and tomorrow .
Yet we can not say exactly what time is .
Although the study of time became scientific during the time of Galileo and Newton , a comprehensive explanation was given only in this century by Einstein , who declared , in effect , time is simply what a clock reads .
The clock can be the rotation of a planet , sand falling in an hourglass , a heartbeat , or vibrations of a cesium atom .
A typical grandfather clock follows the simple Newtonian law that states that the velocity of a body not subject to external forces remains constant .
This means that clock hands travel equal distances in equal times .
While this kind of clock is useful for everyday life , modern science finds that time can be warped in various ways , like clay in the hands of a cosmic sculptor .
The first science - fiction story about time travel appeared in the 1880s .
Science - fiction authors have had various uses for time machines , including dinosaur hunting , tourism , visits to one 's ancestors , and animal collecting .
Ever since the time of H.G. Wells ' famous novel The Time Machine ( 1895 ) , people have grown increasingly intrigued by the idea of traveling through time .
( I was lucky enough to have chats with H.G. Wells ' grandson , who told me that his grandfather 's book has never been out of print , which is rare for a book a century old . )
In the book , the protagonist uses a " black and polished brass " time machine to gain mechanical control over time as well as return to the present to bring back his story and assess the consequences of the present on the future .
Wells was a graduate of the Imperial College of Science and Technology , and scientific language permeates his discussions .
Many believe Wells ' book to be the first story about a time machine , but seven years before 22 - year - old Wells wrote the first version of The Time Machine , Edward Page Mitchell , an editor of the New York Sun , published " The Clock That Went Backward . "
One of the earliest methods for fictional time travel did n't involve a machine ; the main character in Washington Irving 's " Rip van Winkle " ( 1819 ) simply fell asleep for decades .
King Arthur 's daughter Gweneth slept for 500 years under Merlin 's spell .
Ancient legends of time distortion are , in fact , quite common .
One of the most poetic descriptions of time travel occurs in a popular medieval legend describing a monk entranced for a minute by the song of a magical bird .
When the bird stops singing , the monk discovers that several hundred years have passed .
Another example is the Moslem legend of Muhammad carried by a mare into heaven .
After a long visit , the prophet returns to Earth just in time to catch a jar of water the horse had kicked over before starting its ascent .
Time travel is possible Today , we know that time travel need not be confined to myths , science fiction , Hollywood movies , or even speculation by theoretical physicists .
Time travel is possible .
For example , an object traveling at high speeds ages more slowly than a stationary object .
This means that if you were to travel into outer space and return , moving close to light speed , you could travel thousands of years into the Earth 's future .
Newton 's most important contribution to science was his mathematical definition of how motion changes with time .
He showed that the force causing apples to fall is the same force that drives planetary motions and produces tides .
However , Newton was puzzled by the fact that gravity seemed to operate instantaneously at a distance .
He admitted he could only describe it without understanding how it worked .
Not until Einstein 's general theory of relativity was gravity changed from a " force " to the movement of matter along the shortest space in a curved spacetime .
The Sun bends spacetime , and spacetime tells planets how to move .
For Newton , both space and time were absolute .
Space was a fixed , infinite , unmoving metric against which absolute motions could be measured .
Newton also believed the universe was pervaded by a single absolute time that could be symbolized by an imaginary clock off somewhere in space .
Einstein changed all this with his relativity theories , and once wrote , " Newton , forgive me . "
Albert Einstein , whose theories of relativity changed our understanding of time and space , once wrote " Newton , forgive me . "
Einstein 's first major contribution to the study of time occurred when he revolutionized physics with his " special theory of relativity " by showing how time changes with motion .
Today , scientists do not see problems of time or motion as " absolute " with a single correct answer .
Because time is relative to the speed one is traveling at , there can never be a clock at the center of the universe to which everyone can set their watches .
Your entire life is the blink of an eye to an alien traveling close to the speed of light .
Today , Newtonian mechanics have become a special case within Einstein 's theory of relativity .
Einstein 's relativity will eventually become a subset of a new science more comprehensive in its description of the fabric of our universe .
( The word " relativity " derives from the fact that the appearance of the world depends on our state of motion ; it is " relative . " )
We are a moment in astronomic time , a transient guest of the Earth .
Our wet , wrinkled brains do not allow us to comprehend many mysteries of time and space .
Our brains evolved to make us run from saber - toothed cats on the American savanna , to hunt deer , and to efficiently scavenge from the kills of large carnivores .
Despite our mental limitations , we have come remarkably far .
We have managed to pull back the cosmic curtains a crack to let in the light .
Questions raised by physicists , from Newton to Kurt Gödel to Einstein to Stephen Hawking , are among the most profound we can ask .
Is time real ?
Does it flow in one direction only ?
Does it have a beginning or an end ?
What is eternity ?
None of these questions can be answered to scientists ' satisfaction .
Yet the mere asking of these questions stretches our minds , and the continual search for answers provides useful insights along the way .

We all know what " bad words " are .
Unlike most other language rules , we learn about swearwords and how to use them without any real study or classroom instruction .
Even very young children know which words are naughty , although they do n't always know exactly what those words mean .
But swearwords are n't quite as simple as they seem .
They 're paradoxical -- saying them is taboo in nearly every culture , but instead of avoiding them as with other taboos , people use them .
Most associate swearing with being angry or frustrated , but people swear for a number of reasons and in a variety of situations .
Swearing also serves multiple purposes in social interactions .
Not only that , your brain treats swear words differently than it treats other words .
A Note On Geography and Swearing in Other Languages
Most research on swearing printed in English discusses swearing in English .
Although every culture has its own swearwords , the statistics in this article primarily come from research involving English - speaking people in the United States and Great Britain .
Research related to swearing and the brain , however , should apply to speakers of any language .
People learning a new language often learn its swearwords first or learn and use swearwords from a variety of languages .
Anyone who learns through immersion rather than in a classroom tends to use more swearwords and colloquialisms .
People who speak more than one language often use swearwords from different languages , but feel that the words from their primary language have the most emotional impact .
For this reason , some multilingual speakers will switch to a second language to express taboo subjects .
In this article , we 'll explore what makes words into swearwords , why most Americans use them and how society responds to swearing .
We 'll also look at one of its most fascinating aspects -- the way it affects your brain .
Virtually every language in every culture in the world has its own unique swearwords .
Even different dialects of the same language can have different expletives .
The very first languages probably included swearwords , but since writing evolved after speaking did , there 's no record of who said the first swearword or what that word was .
Because of the taboos surrounding it , written language histories also include few records of the origins of swearing .
Even today , many dictionaries do n't include profanity , and comparatively few studies have examined swearing .
Most researchers agree that swearing came from early forms of word magic .
Studies of modern , non-literate cultures suggest that swearwords came from the belief that spoken words have power .
Some cultures , especially ones that have not developed a written language , believe that spoken words can curse or bless people or can otherwise affect the world .
This leads to the idea that some words are either very good or very bad .
While spoken swearwords from different languages do n't sound alike , they generally fall into one of two categories .
Most of the time , they are either deistic ( related to religion ) or visceral ( related to the human body and its functions ) .
Some expletives also relate to a person 's ancestry or parentage .
While some linguists classify racial slurs and epithets as swearwords , others place them in a separate category .
So the words themselves are similar , but in different cultures people swear at different times and in different contexts .
In the Western , English - speaking world , people from every race , class and level of education swear .
In America , 72 percent of men and 58 percent of women swear in public .
The same is true for 74 percent of 18 to 34 year olds and 48 percent of people who are over age 55 [ ref ] .
Numerous language researchers report that men swear more than women , but studies that focus on women 's use of language theorize that women 's swearing is simply more context specific .
So why do so many people swear ?
We 'll look at how swearing works in relationships and social interactions next .

FORT LAUDERDALE , Fla. , Aug. 15 — The uproar began last month , when Mayor Jim Naugle said that installing a single - occupancy restroom on a local beach could deter “ homosexual activity . ”
Mr. Naugle , a six - term mayor in this city that draws legions of gay tourists and residents , went on to tell a local newspaper that he preferred the word “ homosexual ” to “ gay ” because he believed many gay people were “ unhappy . ”
Soon after , he criticized a plan to house a private gay book collection in a public library because it contained pornography .
Outraged local residents called for his resignation , started a “ Flush Naugle ” campaign and organized a protest rally that brought hundreds to City Hall in late July , a time of year when South Florida usually verges on comatose .
That day , Mr. Naugle announced that he would issue an apology .
And he did — to “ the children and parents of our community , ” for not being aware of “ how serious the problem was of the sexual activity that ’s taking place in bathrooms and public places and parks . ”
He questioned whether Broward County should continue telling tourists to “ come on down , ” citing 2004 statistics that found it led the nation in new AIDS cases .
From tonight 's Special Comment :
... Mr. Bush , you have hidden behind the General 's skirts , and today you have hidden behind the skirts of ' the last question ' at a news conference , to indicate once again that your presidency has been about the tilted playing field , about no rules for your party in terms of character assassination and changing the fabric of our nation , and no right for your opponents or critics to as much as respond .
That , Sir , is not only unAmerican -- it is dictatorial .
And in pimping General David Petraeus , Sir , in violation of everything this country has been assiduously and vigilantly against for 220 years , you have tried to blur the gleaming radioactive line between the military and the political , and to portray your party as the one associated with the military , and your opponents as the ones somehow antithetical to it .
You did it again today , Sir , and you need to know how history will judge the line you just crossed .
Interview with Investigative Journalist Seymour Hersh ' The President Has Accepted Ethnic Cleansing '
Investigative journalist Seymour Hersh has consistently led the way in telling the story of what 's really going on in Iraq and Iran .
SPIEGEL ONLINE spoke to him about America 's Hitler , Bush 's Vietnam , and how the US press failed the First Amendment .
But for now , things look much better than before .
American advisers told us that many of the corrupt and sectarian Iraqi commanders who once infested the force have been removed .
The American high command assesses that more than three - quarters of the Iraqi Army battalion commanders in Baghdad are now reliable partners ( at least for as long as American forces remain in Iraq ) .

In addition , far more Iraqi units are well integrated in terms of ethnicity and religion .
The Iraqi Army ’s highly effective Third Infantry Division started out as overwhelmingly Kurdish in 2005 .
Today , it is 45 percent Shiite , 28 percent Kurdish , and 27 percent Sunni Arab .
In the past , few Iraqi units could do more than provide a few “ jundis ” ( soldiers ) to put a thin Iraqi face on largely American operations .
Today , in only a few sectors did we find American commanders complaining that their Iraqi formations were useless — something that was the rule , not the exception , on a previous trip to Iraq in late 2005 .
The additional American military formations brought in as part of the surge , General Petraeus ’s determination to hold areas until they are truly secure before redeploying units , and the increasing competence of the Iraqis has had another critical effect : no more whack - a- mole , with insurgents popping back up after the Americans leave .
In war , sometimes it ’s important to pick the right adversary , and in Iraq we seem to have done so .
A major factor in the sudden change in American fortunes has been the outpouring of popular animus against Al Qaeda and other Salafist groups , as well as ( to a lesser extent ) against Moktada al - Sadr ’s Mahdi Army .
These groups have tried to impose Shariah law , brutalized average Iraqis to keep them in line , killed important local leaders and seized young women to marry off to their loyalists .
The result has been that in the last six months Iraqis have begun to turn on the extremists and turn to the Americans for security and help .
The most important and best - known example of this is in Anbar Province , which in less than six months has gone from the worst part of Iraq to the best ( outside the Kurdish areas ) .
Today the Sunni sheiks there are close to crippling Al Qaeda and its Salafist allies .
Just a few months ago , American marines were fighting for every yard of Ramadi ; last week we strolled down its streets without body armor .
Another surprise was how well the coalition ’s new Embedded Provincial Reconstruction Teams are working .
Wherever we found a fully staffed team , we also found local Iraqi leaders and businessmen cooperating with it to revive the local economy and build new political structures .
Although much more needs to be done to create jobs , a new emphasis on microloans and small - scale projects was having some success where the previous aid programs often built white elephants .
No immunity deal was offered to Blackwater USA guards for their statements regarding a shootout in Iraq last month that left 17 Iraqi civilians dead , a senior State Department official told CNN Tuesday .
The senior State Department official , who spoke on condition of anonymity because of a lack of authorization to speak on the matter , said the department 's Diplomatic Security branch does not have the right or ability to offer any kind of immunity and did not do anything that would inhibit prosecutors if charges are to be pursued .
Monday , State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said whatever arrangements were made were not sanctioned by the senior management of the State Department .
Another spokesman said the working level Diplomatic Security officials in Iraq followed the procedures they had to follow and their actions would need to have been cleared by Washington .
The spokesman added that Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice is not informed of every detail of every action taken .
The decision on whether to prosecute the guards involved in the shooting is in the hands of the Justice Department now because the FBI has taken over the investigation .
So , to recap : the people who offered Blackwater immunity did n't have the authority to do so , Condi Rice does not know what her people in Iraq are doing , and the most corrupt DoJ in the history of the United States gets to decide how if Blackwater will be prosecuted .
UPDATE : CNN has updated the original article to state the following :
However , some kind of limited immunity was apparently offered by State Department investigators when they questioned the Blackwater personnel apparently involved in the shootings , the officials said .
CNN previously reported the guards were promised their statements would not be used against them in a criminal prosecution as long as the statements were true .
...
Monday , the officials speaking on the matter said that even if some kind of limited immunity deal were made , it would not mean that charges would never be brought against those involved in the shooting .
( hattip to PatsBard )
UPDATE 2 : Lots of interesting thoughts in the comments on how this could play out in court .
Two comments in particular stood out as potential precedents employed by Blackwater attorneys :
Second Lieutenant Christopher M. Cooke , a missile launch officer , was charged with passing classified information to the Soviets over a six - month period from 1980 - 81 .
The prosecution was based in part on information he provided after being promised immunity .
As it happened , the official who promised Cooke immunity was not authorized by law to grant him that protection ; but the appellate courts nonetheless enforced the " deal " and Cooke walked .
I would be very surprised if -- assuming there was actually a promise of immunity , and the Blackwater employees relied on it when providing information -- a conviction could stand .

... Ollie North was convicted of multiple felonies , but they were overturned on questions of admissibility of evidence .
North 's congressional testimony was immunized .
The prosecutor created a strong case based on the testimony of other witnesses , but during the appeal , all the witnesses started claiming that they could n't be certain that their testimony was n't influenced by the publicity about North 's testimony .
The Blackwater people will now claim that they thought they had immunity , so using anything they said would violate the 5th amendment , since they were tricked into testifying against themselves .
They 'll say the same about every lead that might have depended on the original testimony .
The Justice Department now says it will do a new investigation , but perhaps they will " accidentally " mess up and somehow taint the case by " accidentally " relying on the original " immunized " testimony .
So sorry , they will say .
We did our best , but it seems that the Blackwater people are now legally untouchable because we made some " mistakes " .

FOXNews reporter Courtney Keely reports from Baghdad that the surge is working .
Really , it is .
Do n't pay attention to the fact that she 's in a Baghdad market surrounded by MORE security than John McCain and every Iraqi she speaks to tells her about the death and destruction all around them .
I mean , c'mon , do n't let the reality of the situation get in the way of a good cheerleading segment for Bush 's policies .
Another file - sharing defendant who says she has never installed or used file - sharing software is fighting back against the RIAA , accusing the music industry of waging war in the US court system to " shore up the American recording industry 's failing business model . "
The action this time is in the US District Court for South Carolina , which is where Catherine Njuguna was sued by the RIAA for allegedly sharing tracks such as " Teenage Dirt Bag , " " She F***** Hates Me , " " That N*****'s Crazy , " and " F*** You Softly " via KaZaA .
According to a motion she recently filed , her explanations that she was in Oklahoma City on the day the RIAA 's investigators reportedly discovered the shared music on KaZaA and that she only listened to contemporary Christian music fell on deaf ears at the industry 's Settlement Support Center .
In addition , the SSC turned down her requests to have her PC inspected for evidence of infringement , and the RIAA ultimately sued her after she refused to give into its settlement demands .
After the lawsuit was filed , Njuguna said she boxed up the PC reportedly used for infringement and purchased a new one .
She then filed a series of counterclaims to the RIAA 's lawsuit in an attempt to have the lawsuit dismissed and her name cleared .
One of those accuses the record labels of failing to negotiate in good faith .
" The Plaintiffs / SSC have not honored their obligation and duty to negotiate in good faith and in a fair manner , " argues Njugana .
" They have advised an unrepresented client regarding her legal rights , sometimes incorrectly , and misled the Defendant in order to force her into a settlement that is a pure contract of adhesion , with unconscionable terms , at a cost that is extraordinarily excessive considering alleged loss of the Plaintiffs . "
In its motion to dismiss Njugana 's counterclaims , the RIAA argues that it owes no duty to negotiate in good faith to the defendant .
Njugana also accuses the RIAA of engaging in deceptive and unfair trade practices , arguing that the record labels have demonstrated repeated behavior that has an " adverse effect on the public interest . "
She also cites former RIAA defendant Tanya Andersen 's lawsuit ( which seeks class - action status ) as evidence that , unless the courts step in at some point , the RIAA will continue its campaign .
If , like a handful of other former defendants , Njugana is exonerated by the courts , the RIAA could be looking at another malicious prosecution lawsuit like the one filed by Andersen .
Yesterday , the RIAA asked an Oregon judge to dismiss Andersen 's lawsuit , arguing that her accusations that the industry group violated state racketeering laws depend on " sweeping , conclusory statements about alleged attempts to coerce or extort money from her . "
A new robot from Carnegie Mellon called Scarab is aiming for the moon .
This rover will contain a special drill for taking meter long samples .
In order to facilitate this the rover must weigh enough to apply sufficient downward thrust .
It is estimated that the robot must weigh at least 550 pounds .
Another challenge that Scarab will face is that it must operate on the dark side of the moon and cannot use solar power .
To help conserve power this baby crawls along at only 4 inches per second .
The project leader William “ Red ” Whittaker has also announced he is getting a group together for the Google LUNAR X PRIZE .
Red is a very busy guy and also has a team competing in the DARPA Urban Challenge this year .

Supporters of abstinence - only education said it should remain an option .
“ We ’ve seen a lot of attacks on this program , ” said Leslee Unruh , the president of the National Abstinence Clearinghouse , based in South Dakota .
“ A lot of kids that are abstaining are made to feel as if they are from a Victorian age and they are not with the ‘ Sex and the City ’ crowd . ”
Dr. Daines ’s announcement came the same day that the New York Civil Liberties Union , which opposes abstinence - only education , released a report detailing the number of such programs in the state .
The report stated that roughly half of the groups teaching abstinence in the state were religious groups and that the state had done almost nothing to monitor them .
Dr. Daines said that existing state programs include discussion of abstinence .
But he said the state made the decision based on evidence that the abstinence - only program did little to prevent teen pregnancies .
He said he also objected to the program ’s “ narrow ideological view , which is not the direction we want to go in for sexual health . ”
He said the state should encourage the teaching of the use of condoms and include discussions of abstinence .
Congress is expected to take up funding for abstinence - only education at the end of the month .
California , Connecticut , New Jersey and Rhode Island are among the states that have rejected such money .
According to the civil liberties union report , New York was second only to Texas in the amount of money it received for abstinence education .
The federal government also gives roughly $ 6 million directly to community groups in New York for such programs , according to the report .
Despite those incidents , the chapter appears to have been home to a diverse community over the years , partly because it has attracted brainy women , including many science and math majors , as well as talented disabled women , without focusing as exclusively as some sororities on potential recruits ’ sex appeal , former sorority members said .
Image Elizabeth Haneline , who was among those evicted , said ,  The Greek system hasnt changed at all , but instead of racism , its image now . 

“ I had a sister I could go to a bar with if I had boy problems , ” said Erin Swisshelm , a junior biochemistry major who withdrew from the sorority in October .
“ I had a sister I could talk about religion with .
I had a sister I could be nerdy about science with .
That ’s why I liked Delta Zeta , because I had all these amazing women around me . ”
But over the years DePauw students had attached a negative stereotype to the chapter , as evidenced by the survey that Pam Propsom , a psychology professor , conducts each year in her class .
That image had hurt recruitment , and the national officers had repeatedly warned the chapter that unless its membership increased , the chapter could close .
At the start of the fall term the national office was especially determined to raise recruitment because 2009 is the 100th anniversary of the DePauw chapter ’s founding .
In September , Ms. Menges and Kathi Heatherly , a national vice president of the sorority , visited the chapter to announce a reorganization plan they said would include an interview with each woman about her commitment .
The women were urged to look their best for the interviews .
The tone left four women so unsettled that they withdrew from the chapter almost immediately .
Robin Lamkin , a junior who is an editor at The DePauw and was one of the 23 women evicted , said many of her sisters bought new outfits and modeled them for each other before the interviews .
Many women declared their willingness to recruit diligently , Ms. Lamkin said .
A few days after the interviews , national representatives took over the house to hold a recruiting event .
They asked most members to stay upstairs in their rooms .
To welcome freshmen downstairs , they assembled a team that included several of the women eventually asked to stay in the sorority , along with some slender women invited from the sorority ’s chapter at Indiana University , Ms. Holloway said .
“ They had these unassuming freshman girls downstairs with these plastic women from Indiana University , and 25 of my sisters hiding upstairs , ” she said .
“ It was so fake , so completely dehumanized .
I said , ‘ This calls for a little joke . ’ ”
ASUNCION ( Reuters ) - Paraguayan farmers are hoping to cash in on a low - calorie sweetener being made by the Coca - Cola Co. from a native plant long prized by indigenous people in the poor South American country .
A farmer holds a crop of Stevia in Asuncion July 24 , 2007 .
Stevia , a shrub whose extracts are up to 300 - times sweeter than sugar but without the calories , has been the sweetener of choice among Paraguay 's Guarani Indians for centuries .

Stevia , a shrub whose extracts are up to 300 - times sweeter than sugar but without the calories , has been the sweetener of choice among Paraguay ’s Guarani Indians for centuries .
Coca - Cola announced in May it would team up with U.S. - based agricultural company Cargill Inc. to produce a stevia - based sweetener , and Paraguay ’s farmers hope demand for stevia will increase even though it is not approved as a food additive in the United States or the European Union .
“ Little by little , the world ’s realizing this product has benefits and can revolutionize the food industry , ” said Juan Carlos Fischer , the head of the Paraguay Stevia Chamber , a trade group representing producers .
The Paraguayan government said recently it had offered Coca - Cola an arrangement to be a leading stevia provider and opened up a $ 2 million credit line to producers to encourage farmers to increase production .
Officials say they want to expand stevia plantations from the current 3,200 acres to 123,500 acres
by 2014 .
“ This is going to have a tremendous impact on our agricultural sector because it ’s going to create jobs , ” said Industry and Commerce Minister Jose Maria Ibanez .
“ SWEET HERB ”
Slideshow ( 2 images )
As some low - calorie and diet drinks face criticism for contributing to obesity , Coca - Cola plans to use its new stevia - based sweetener called Rebiana in soft drinks marketed to health - conscious consumers initially in Asian and South American markets .
Most non -diet soft drinks in the United States are sweetened with high - fructose corn syrup , a cheap alternative to cane sugar .
Both are frequently blamed for adding inches to waistlines .
Lower - calorie sodas are made with artificial sweeteners like saccharin , aspartame and sucralose -- the last two more commonly known as NutraSweet and Splenda .
Stevia must win regulatory approval in the United States and the European Union , where it can be used as a dietary supplement but not as an additive in food and beverages .
Still , Paraguayan producers are hopeful Coca - Cola ’s involvement will signal its eventual approval .
Stevia has long been available in several South American and Asian countries .
Although native to Paraguay , China is the world ’s biggest producer of the herb .
The shrub became known to Europeans in 1899 when Swiss biologist Moises Bertoni discovered it in the Paraguayan forest .
Long before that , the Guaranis used it , calling stevia “ the sweet herb . ”
Some Paraguayan scientists say stevia has shown medical benefits including aiding in diabetes treatment .
Faced with possible Chinese competition , farmers say weather conditions in Paraguay enable it to have nearly five harvests a year , compared to two in China .
But some warn the country must move quickly to help farmers move from small production capacities to something more efficient and export - oriented .
“ We ’ve got real potential , but we ’ve got work to do , ” said farmer Ruben Sanbrai .
Living In A Small House : Does Size Matter ?
The joys of living in a small home .
For many people I know , a big house to call their own sure sounds like the ultimate dream .
Think of all that wonderful space and room and potential to do whatever you want in that space .
But there are obvious downsides to having a huge house : number one on the list is the maintenance cost .
Granted , you may be able to afford your house and even the ongoing property taxes you need to pay each year — but what a lot of homeowners forget are those pesky maintenance and repair costs that they would be committed to paying , month in and month out .
The painful truth is that these costs are proportional to the size of your house , a fact which many would be homeowners do n’t realize or simply choose to ignore during a hot real estate market .
This is what caught a lot of people unawares during the last real estate downtrend and which may have contributed to many a foreclosure : many homeowners grossly underestimated the expenses involved in maintaining a home .
So it ’s refreshing to know that in this age of “ bigger is better ” , there are people who have decided to reside in smaller spaces than larger homes , even though they had a choice in this regard .
Those who insist on such terms are usually folks who live on their own or have really small families — maybe counting themselves , and a couple of goldfish .
Living this way can also be due to pure necessity for some apartment dwellers or mobile home owners .
No problem , as there have been some keenly creative ways to counteract the shortcomings of such a set up .
Not only that , but HGTV shows that are devoted to small spaces have been the rage .
Believe it or not , these houses are the chosen castles of some intrepid folk .
I say this because I look at such a choice as going against the grain in a big way during a time when lifestyles and budgets have increased to accommodate super sized appetites for all things material .
Typical size of such a small dwelling : 50 to 750 square feet .
Typical price to build : $ 15,000 – $ 35,000 .
Regardless of what makes someone choose to live in tighter quarters , there are benefits to doing so .
Some people have shared their personal stories as to what makes them go this route .
Let ’s review the pluses .
The Benefits Of Living In A Smaller Home
Here are the benefits of owning a more modest house .
# 1 It could actually improve your health .
How so ?
It forces you to want to leave your place more often , which will lead you to be more active .
The home simply becomes a functional place for rest and temporary relaxation .
The lack of amenities or other conveniences may sound like a disadvantage , but there ’s that silver lining : it will force you to change your lifestyle and will encourage you to move more than you would otherwise .
A small house encourages you to live a less sedentary lifestyle .
Who has time to crib about cramped quarters when there ’s a whole lot of the outdoors you can enjoy ?
# 2 Some of these houses are mobile .
Many folks with such homes can tow them around at will .
Now if they function like an RV , I wonder why such homeowners just do n’t own RVs instead ?
# 3 You automatically live more simply .
The simple life has become attractive to many people who have decided to eschew the complexities and burdens of a life revolving around material things .
This ’ll change you , for sure .
With less space to work with , you ’ll have to live with less , and in so doing , you become less attached to things .
There ’s a certain freedom that comes with making a commitment to go down this path .
You ’ll live a simpler life because you ’ll have less room for stuff .
# 4 It ’s cheaper .
One obvious ramification is that a really tiny house will command a much smaller amount to build .
There ’s a company called the Tumbleweed Tiny House Co. that addresses this unique home building niche .
Costs for such houses can range from $ 15,000 to $ 30,000 , depending on size and amenities provided .
And do n’t look now but a restroom and functional kitchen are considered amenities in such homes .
But wait !
The real estate crash has caused such a collapse in home prices that standard housing may now be available at unbelievable prices in certain parts of the country .
So cheap housing does not necessarily have to mean small or mobile , any longer .
# 5 It involves less maintenance and upkeep .
Here are other obvious consequences of having less space : you ’ll worry less about your stuff breaking down ; you wo n’t have to work as hard to keep things clean and functional , and you ’ll require fewer services to keep things going .
Ergo , you ’ll cut your housing costs significantly !
And you ’ll worry less and expend less effort maintaining your home .
Just imagine how much you ’d save on your home ’s upkeep and insurance requirements once you downsize !
In some cases , you wo n’t even need insurance .
You can ask yourself : do you really need all that stuff ?
If the answer is no — and you promise that you wo n’t hyperventilate if you let go of your video game collection — then maybe you should check out this alternative way of living .
For some , living small is living well .
You may want to see for yourself just how well it works for this one guy !
I found this video of one happy resident who ’s managed to squeeze himself comfortably into 96 square feet of space :
From the video : “ Excess is not necessarily a luxury , it ’s really a burden — it ’s a liability .
People are living in 4,000 and 6,000 square foot debtors ’ prisons , and they spend 30 years , sometimes more , paying for more stuff and space than they really need . ”
96 square feet may be a little extreme , but it shows us that with a little resourcefulness , even living this way is possible !
With all the good news on small homes and simple living , there ’s even support for this movement through a community called The Small House Society , “ a group that advocates downsizing homes and living in concert with the environment . ”
In Conclusion
Of course , this type of lifestyle will suit only a small percentage of intrepid homeowners .
And now that home prices have taken a tumble , the real estate market presents us with even more reasonable options .
But are there homeowners out there who are ready to buck the trend and who are willing to move into smaller homes ?
We certainly all want to find the home of our dreams , and for some , that dream house is one you wo n’t expect !
Does size matter ?
Would you be willing to live in a small house ?

Want to build wealth but do n’t really know where to start ?
If you knew where and how to start , would anything else be holding you back ?
What about fear or lack of money ?
For many people who want to build wealth , not having a lot of money upfront is often the biggest obstacle .
When you ’re living paycheck to paycheck , it ’s difficult to squeeze out extra money to build a nest egg or invest in your future .
When you focus all your time , energy , and money on the now , it ’s almost impossible to do anything to make your future better .
Building wealth is still very important , and you should n’t let lack of funds deter you from reaching financial stability and preparing for financial independence .
Here ’s what you can start doing if you want to build wealth but have a low budget .
Live Below Your Means
This is probably the most important thing you can do to build wealth .
When you live below your means and spend less than you earn , there will always be something left over each month .
It ’s a guaranteed way to make sure you have extra money to save and invest for the future .
However , it ’s easier said than done .
If you find that you ’re spending more than you earn , you need to create a realistic budget you can stick to .
Lower some expenses to make sure you have some extra cash flow .
For me , this means keeping my cost of living low .
I prefer to keep my housing expenses at way under 30 % of my income , I drive a used car , eat at home most nights , shop for sales and discounts , and compare rates to make sure I ’m getting the best deal .
If you find that living below your means is difficult , that means it ’s time to increase your means and earn some extra money .
Imagine what you might be able to do if you could make an extra $ 500 per month .
It could open you up to a world of opportunity when it comes to building wealth .
Use Time When It ’s On Your Side
If you ’re trying to build long - term wealth , time ( not money ) is going to be your best friend .
You need time to allow interest to compound on your investments .
You also need time to save up money for that real estate purchase .
When you start taking action earlier , you have a better chance of building wealth even if you do n’t have a lot of money to contribute .
Consider opening an online brokerage account with a robo - advisor like Betterment to start investing .
I started with just $ 100 / month which is an amount I think most people can afford if they watch their other expenses .
You can also use apps like Acorns to invest spare change or Stash to start investing with as little as $ 5 / week .
If you can contribute to a 401 ( k ) , agree to have your employer deduct something from your paycheck to put in your account even if it ’s not as much as you wanted to contribute .
Again , the key is to start working on your plan now while time is on your side and not when time has already passed you by .
Set Up a Scalable Extra Income Source
The great thing about not having a ton of money is the opportunity to start making more .
Today , there are so many options to make money flexibly thanks to the internet .
There ’s almost no reason why people should n’t be able to make some extra cash on the side .
If you ’re looking to use your side hustle income to build long - term wealth , the trick is you ’ll need to establish a scalable source of income .
While side hustles like driving for Uber or Instacart , babysitting , or even walking dogs are nice , you have to continue working in order to make money .
If you want to make more , you need to contribute more hours of your time plus more energy .
With a scalable income source like a small business , you can grow your income without having to grow your commitment as well .
For example , consider doing something to make money where you can eventually outsource and get a team to help you .
As long as paying for help does n’t exceed the money your bringing in , it could be worth it and allow your small business to grow .
Plus , with the right kind of help , you can continue earning money without your direct involvement .
This allows you to create and manage multiple streams of income necessary for wealth building .
The average millionaire has 7 streams of income .
This would n’t be possible without the ability to scale .
Become Debt Free
Debt can have a lot to do with your inability to be able to build wealth .
Debt is so common in our society , and many people believe they must get into debt in order to fund their lifestyle because they do n’t have the money to do so .
A vicious cycle of debt is created afterward and it ’s hard to escape .
The truth is , most people who think they ’re broke probably would n’t feel that way if they did n’t have debt .
All those little payments add up each month so when you start getting rid of them , you ’ll free up more of your income .
Think about it .
That $ 400 / month car loan is $ 4,800 / year .
If you bought a car in cash , you could pocket that money instead .
The same goes with student loans .
While it made sense to stick with my low monthly payment of $ 140 / month , I decided to pay off my student loans early and saved thousands of dollars in the process .
Be remaining debt free , you ’ll start to find the money to build wealth in your budget so long as you do a combination of the steps mentioned above .
Building wealth is not just for the rich .
If you ’re able to live below your means , start early , avoid debt , and diversify your income , you can do it just like anyone else .
What are you doing to build wealth right now ?
The minimum age to buy cigarettes would be raised to 18
MSPs unanimously backed a change in the law following a short parliamentary debate .
The move attracted cross-party support and will also take place in England and Wales from 1 October .
However , concerns have been raised that extra resources would not be made available in time for the imposition of the law .
Health Minister Shona Robison told members that a person who started smoking at the age of 15 was three - times more likely to die from its effects than someone taking up the habit in their 20s .
The legal age for buying cigarettes was set prior to World War II , long before the health threats posed by tobacco were recognised .
Ms Robison said that more must be done to combat smoking despite a series of measures such as the ban on smoking in enclosed public places .
But the Liberal Democrats questioned the effectiveness of the move as only 11 prosecutions have been successful against shops selling tobacco to children under 16 .
The Tories said councils must have more resources to make the new age limit effective .
Did you ever hit a wall and think the story was n't going to work ?
Or did it take any turns you did n't expect ?
Sounds like you kept unfolding one thing into another .
Barlett :
That 's basically the way we work at it .
Sometimes it takes a little longer than other times .
You just keep unraveling .
This was clearly going to be a story from day one .
Steele :
If the Pentagon had not come through with [ the NorthStar ] contract , there might 've been a complication , but when it finally arrived , and we did some initial checks on NorthStar , we knew then that we had something .
We did n't know what it was , but our instincts right away told us that this one was going to be good .
Particularly since their mailing address was in the Bahamas .
Did you just plug that address into Google ?
Barlett :
Well , we do n't like to talk about the secret methods of our investigations [ laughter ] .
Our high - tech methods .
That 's the kind of thing that just destroys all the mystique .
Steele :
One of the things that just absolutely amazed us when we got the contract for NorthStar Consultants was that they blacked out all kinds of pertinent data — part of the phone number , the name of the officer who signed the contract , whatever his operating address was — but they left on the contract this post - office box in Nassau , which turns out to be a focal point of an awful lot of offshore tax activity .
Was this ineptitude ?
It just boggles the mind why they just did not redact that .
But they did n't .
And that was key toward unraveling an awful lot of the story .
Barlett :
As it turned out , the post - office box — during the same period it was set up for the company that ultimately was supposed to track money in Iraq — was also used for one of the largest stock swindles in history .
Over $ 200 million disappeared .
And this is at the same time the company was being set up that would eventually get the Iraqi contract .
Steele :
When we first got the contract , the last four digits of [ NorthStar 's ] phone number were redacted , so when you plugged in the area code and the first three digits , you could figure out that this was somewhere in north San Diego or the La Jolla area .
It occurred to us to do the same thing with the post - office box .
The fact that anything at all turned up just amazed us .
We try so many things just to see what 's there , and that 's just part of the process .
And lo and behold , there were several hits on that post - office box , and one of them showed up this company , Lions Gate Management , which was [ run by ] this fellow Patrick Thomson , who , we found out later , actually set NorthStar up for [ Thomas ]
Howell , the guy who actually ran NorthStar .
Or " had " NorthStar would be a better term — it 's not much of a company .
The two of you have been an investigative team for a long time now .
How have the Internet and other technologies helped you to investigate stories like this ?
Steele :
The post - office box is the best example .
Technically you could find that , but in reality you could n't , because how would you know to look at a court case somewhere that would show that post - office box ?
The Internet was tremendously powerful and influential in helping us get to the heart of this thing .
In the case of the post - office box , there was probably no other way to get it .
Barlett :
There 's a flip side to this .
In this case the Internet was helpful , but you can also see and envision cases in which the Internet wo n't do you any good .
There 's a growing tendency to destroy court files .
Under the old system , the record of a case was entered in ledgers , and it was basically impossible to destroy any evidence that the case existed .
That 's not true with the Internet .
Now , with the flick of a switch , a case can disappear — and it does .
So it cuts both ways .
The following apology was printed in the Guardian 's Corrections and clarifications column , Saturday February 10 2007
In the report below we quoted environmentalists alleging that the British cruise liner MV Discovery was responsible for a rat , litter and graffiti found on the Galapagos islands after the liner 's first visit last April .
We have subsequently received letters from both the Galapagos National Park and The Darwin Foundation advising us that these allegations were incorrect .
We now accept that the rat was observed before the Discovery 's arrival and that a report by the Galapagos National Park Service did not link graffiti and litter with the Discovery .
Voyages of Discovery would also like to make clear that passengers actually helped collect litter they found on the island .
Apologies to MV Discovery and its passengers .
Not since Hamelin has the discovery of a rat provoked so much alarm .
It was only a single creature , but it had no business being on the island of Santa Fe in the isolated Galápagos archipelago , where conservationists now strive to keep foreign wildlife at bay as effectively as hundreds of miles of open ocean did for millions of years .
The rat is alleged to have arrived on the MV Discovery , a giant British cruise liner that visited the islands in April .
Today , the ship is due to return to the Galápagos , and arriving with it are 460 paying passengers , protests and a campaign to protect the islands from such mass tourism .
Voyages of Discovery , the cruise company , promises visitors to the islands : " The enigmas , secrets and charms of this spectacular and rich landscape are , like a dream , an unequalled adventure just waiting to be discovered . "
But to environmental campaigners , the ship 's arrival is a nightmare .
Conservationists on the Galápagos have also found swarms of foreign insects on the islands since the liner 's last visit and fear its return today could introduce more alien species that might further disrupt the sensitive eco-systems .
The Discovery , the first large cruise ship to have visited the islands , is scheduled to return again this April and twice each year thereafter .
Permits recently granted by the Ecuadorian government - the islands are owned by the South American country - could see one cruise ship stop there a month .
Leonor Stjepic , director of the Galápagos Conservation Trust , warned that such an acceleration in visitor numbers would overwhelm efforts to keep out pests and disease .
" The more people that come , the greater the risk of invasive species and the less effective the quarantine system is going to be .
With the best will in the world it 's virtually impossible to search a boat that size thoroughly .
Just sheer numbers means it 's much easier for something to slip through .
And if we can't protect the Galápagos then what does it say about the other natural spaces in the world ?
" The Galápagos are not suitable for this kind of mass tourism .
We 're not being elitist : the islands just do n't have the infrastructure for that number of people .
We 're not anti-tourism , but it 's got to be high - value , low - volume tourism . "
Before the Discovery 's stopover , almost all visitors to the islands flew direct from the mainland .
" This cruise ship has travelled all the way down the coast of South America and could bring all sorts of things with it , " Ms Stjepic said .
As well as the rat , and the insects , environmentalists say the Discovery 's previous visit left the islands covered in litter , dropped by wealthy tourists who " have no idea where they are or the impact their visit may have " .
Graffiti was scrawled at the visitor centre and one passenger reportedly asked where the local Starbucks was .
The study of the impact of the liner 's first visit was carried out by the local Charles Darwin Foundation and the Galápagos National Park Service .
As well as the foreign wildlife , it found that sales for local businesses increased by 5 % , a third of what was expected .
Infrastructure was overwhelmed , they said , and local tour operators , who take visitors around the different islands , were forced to land large boats on fragile shorelines because elderly cruise passengers were unable to scramble in and out of rubber dinghies .
However , David Yellow , managing director of Voyages of Discovery , said the campaigners were " speaking from ignorance " .
He said the firm operated under strict restrictions and carried out an in - depth environmental impact study before it was granted a licence to operate in the Galápagos .
" We are experienced at operating in environmentally sensitive areas and we know what to do .
All our people [ passengers ] are given a lecture before they go ashore and we know they adhere to it . "
The Discovery anchored at the island of San Cristobal during its stay , he said , a good 25 miles from Santa Fe where the rat was found .
Mr Yellow said there was no proof that the graffiti and litter were left by Discovery tourists .
" Local people create litter .
They are not as sensitive to the environment as the people we take there .
There are local people who smoke a cigarette and throw it into the street . "
Drawn by the unique wildlife and mystique , annual visitors to the archipelago have soared from about 40,000 in the late 1980s to more than 100,000 now .

Wounded Iraq veteran dares Rush , ' Call me phony soldier to my face ' Jason Rhyne
Published : Tuesday October 2 , 2007
Save This Page
Print This Email This VoteVets.org , a political group made up of veterans from US military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan , is launching an ad campaign which accuses conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh of insulting combat troops .
The ad is a response to Limbaugh 's use of the phrase " phony soldiers " on the air last week , a term he used following a caller 's complaint that the press never talks to " real soldiers , " instead speaking to troops critical of the war in Iraq that " come up out of the blue and spout to the media . "
According to a press release from the veterans group , the ad " takes on Rush Limbaugh for his contention that those who served in Iraq , but oppose the Bush administration 's failed policies , are ' phony soldiers . "
" More and more troops and veterans of Iraq believe George Bush 's military policy has been a disaster ... I am one of them , " says wounded Iraq veteran Brian McGough in the TV spot .
" Rush Limbaugh called vets like me ' phony soldiers ' for telling the truth about Iraq . "
" Rush , the shrapnel I took to my head was real , " he continues .
" My traumatic brain injury was real .
And , my belief that we are on the wrong course in Iraq is real .
Until you have the guts to call me a ' phony solider ' to my face , stop telling lies about my service . "
The $ 60,000 ad buy will air on Fox News and CNN .
A radio version will run during the Rush Limbaugh Show in the D.C. and Palm Beach , Florida markets .
Democratic leaders have also been vocal of their criticisms of the Limbaugh remark .
Democratic National Committee Chair Howard Dean has demanded an apology from Limbaugh , saying the remarks were " un-American , have no place in the public discourse , and show just how far he 'll go to defend President Bush 's failed policy in Iraq . "
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid echoed that call yesterday from the Senate floor , saying " Rush Limbaugh took it upon himself to attack the courage and character of those fighting and dying for him and for all of us ... Rush Limbaugh owes the men and women of our armed forces an apology . "
Limbaugh , however , maintains that the remark has misinterpreted , saying he was referring only to a specific veteran , Jesse MacBeth , who fabricated stories about serving in Iraq , where he said he had witnessed war crimes .
Context of the Limbaugh remark follows below : # Caller : I 'm one of the few that joined the Army to serve my country , I 'm proud to say , not for the money or anything like that .
What I would like to retort to is that , what these people do n't understand , is if we pull out of Iraq right now , which is not possible because of all the stuff that 's over there , it would take us at least a year to pull everything back out of Iraq , then Iraq itself would collapse and we'd have to go right back over there within a year or so .
Limbaugh :
There 's a lot more than that that they do n't understand .
The next guy that calls here I 'm going to ask them , " What is the imperative of pulling out ?
What 's in it for the United States to pull out ? "
I do n't think they have an answer for that other than , " When 's he going to bring the troops home ?
Keep the troops safe , " whatever .
Caller : Yeah .
Limbaugh :
It 's not possible intellectually to follow these people .
Caller :
No , it 's not .
And what 's really funny is they never talk to real soldiers .
They pull these soldiers that come up out of the blue and spout to the media .
Limbaugh : The phony soldiers .
Caller : Phony soldiers .
If you talk to any real soldier and they 're proud to serve , they want to be over in Iraq , they understand their sacrifice and they 're willing to sacrifice for the country .
A complete transcript is available at Limbaugh 's website .

Phoenix Motorcars , based in Ontario , California , has created a line of electric vehicles squarely aimed at utility services that maintain a automotive fleet for their employees in the field .
When will the vehicles be ready ?
In a few short months .
The SUT ( Sport Utility Truck ) model will be released to select commercial customers in late 2007 , and will be ready for full deployment in 2008 .
By using the off - board charger , the vehicle can be recharged to 95 % capacity in , while a 220v on - board charger will recharge the battery in 6 hours .
Actual consumer models will be available in late 2008 .
If you are interested as I am , you can sign up for their waiting list here
A quick list of specs :
Zero emission

All in good time …
One thing I ’ve noticed is that electric cars ( with exception to the Chevy Volt ) normally are very unattractive .
While yes , I do n’t mind being a geek , I want to be stylish too !
These vehicles actually look pretty normal and are more attractive than half of what most American manufactures have put out in the last 20 years .
This headline made my heart sink :
Hit Iran where it hurts Democratic presidential hopeful takes a get - tough stance against tyrant of Tehran By BARACK OBAMA Americans need to come together to confront the challenge posed by Iran .
Yet the Bush administration and an anonymous senator are blocking a bill with bipartisan support that would ratchet up the pressure on the Iranian regime .
It 's time for this obstructionism to stop .
The decision to wage a misguided war in Iraq has substantially strengthened Iran , which now poses the greatest strategic challenge to U.S. interests in the Middle East in a generation .
Iran supports violent groups and sectarian politics in Iraq , fuels terror and extremism across the Middle East and continues to make progress on its nuclear program in defiance of the international community .
Meanwhile , Iran 's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has declared that Israel must be " wiped off the map . "
Hook , line and sinker .
He bought the whole thing .
Please , other than the increasingly hysterical rhetoric of the Bush White House ( that is eerily similar -- if not outright identical -- to the 2001 - 2002 rhetoric against Saddam Hussein ) , why would Barack Obama believe that Iran is such a threat ?
Given the past seven years , should Bush 's say so truly carry that much credibility ?
In fairness to Obama , much of his op - ed is actually very critical of the Bush administration for their lack of diplomacy , but it hardly matters , because by accepting the Bush framing of a looming crisis against Iran , he 's given all the right wing pundits the ammo of saying , " Even that liberal Obama thinks we have to take out Ahmadinejad ! "
He even justifies the threat by citing Ahmadinejad 's words against Israel , although , unfortunately , he relies on the Bush administration 's translation of Farsi , which as we 've seen before , only has a glancing relationship with reality .
This is not to single out Obama either ; all of the top tier candidates have tried to earn their " I 'm not a wimpy Democrat but a strong leader " bona fides with tough talk against Iran .
But this kind of talk is incredibly irresponsible and we -- as the progressive community -- MUST be clear with the Democratic contenders who are seeking our support that if they think the occupation in Iraq is going bad , any military actions against Iran would be like Iraq on steroids .
We 've already seen how much damage a president with no understanding of the geo-political or cultural circumstances of an area can do .
We simply cannot afford another one .
THE world 's oil producers are wasting more than $ 50 billion a year of natural gas by burning it off in flares — and adding significantly to the world 's greenhouse gas emissions in the process .
A study commissioned by the World Bank and carried out by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration estimates that , based on satellite photos , 170 billion cubic metres of natural gas went up in oil producers ' flares last year .
The bank said the amount was equivalent to 27 per cent of the entire US consumption of natural gas , and 5.5 per cent of global gas output .
Had it been sold in the US at 2006 prices , it would have been worth $ US40 billion ( $ A53 billion at 2006 exchange rates ) .
The Shin Bet ( Israel Security Agency ) may have been involved in the hijacking of an Air France plane in 1976 by Palestinian terrorists , according to newly declassified British government documents released Friday .
Some 100 passengers were held by hijackers at Entebbe airport in Uganda during an eight - day ordeal that concluded when General Staff Reconnaissance Unit ( Sayeret Matkal ) troops stormed the building where the captives were held .
Twenty - four people died in the shoot - out , including three hostages , 20 Ugandans and the commander of the rescue team , Yoni Netanyahu , brother of current opposition head Binyamin Netanyahu ( Likud ) .
The hijackers , from the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine ( PFLP ) and the German Baader - Meinhof gang , demanded the release of Palestinian prisoners .
But according to the newly released documents , the Shin Bet and the PFLP are alleged to have teamed up in an " unholy alliance " in an attempt to change foreign policy in the Middle East .
The allegation appeared in a document written by official DH Colvin at the British embassy in Paris , quoting a contact at the Euro - Arab Parliamentary Association , as the crisis unfolded .
" According to his information , the hijack was the work of the PFLP , with help from the Israeli Secret Service , the Shin Bet , " he wrote .
" The operation was designed to torpedo the PLO 's ( Palestine Liberation Organization ) standing in France and to prevent what they see as a growing rapprochement between the PLO and the Americans .
" Their nightmare is that ... one will witness the imposition in the Middle East of a Pax Americana , which will be to the advantage of the PLO ( who will gain international respectability and perhaps the right to establish a state on evacuated territories ) and to the disadvantage of the Refusal Front ( who will be squeezed right out in any overall peace settlement and will lose their raison d'etre ) and Israel who will be forced to evacuate occupied territory .
Hence the unholy alliance of the hijacking . "
The document also suggested that then Ugandan president Idi Amin may have been collaborating with the hijackers .
The document was released by the National Archives in London .
Shimon Peres , who was defense minister at the time of the hijacking and Entebbe rescue , said over the weekend that the claims were so outrageously baseless that they did not merit comment .
Wow !
I did n’t expect the spanish inquisition getting on the front - page of programming .reddit.com
( I did n’t even submit my post to the site ) and sparkling such a lively discussion there .
I would just reply there , but I somehow feel it ’s better to leave a more “ permanent ” record — even if for my own future reference — of my thoughts on the issues raised .
Vintermann ’s interpretation of my point was this :
The issue for me is that from the syntax , you could believe greet = do {
putStr ( " You 're " ++ getLine ++" years old !
" ) ;
putStr ( " Congratulations !
" ) ;
}
was valid haskell , which it is n’t
This is specially true since <- as destructive update / assignment is used in many pseudocode languages in introductory books — particularly Knuth ’s TAOCP , as well as some languages ( like The Other Language I Use , GNU R ) .
Ricercar adds
( … ) [ M] onads are not limited to one interpretation , whereas “ do notation ” is strongly tied to the imperative interpretation .
This is much like “ Lawyer Language ” that is confusing precisely because it looks somewhat like natural language , when it really is n’t .
Well , yes , I could n’t agree more .
Maybe I ’m unconsciously selecting the favorable comments — the one that further illustrate my point .
But let ’s examine pjdelport ’s reply :
That ’s hardly fair ; programming language constructs do n’t carry the same expectation of consistency that natural languages do .
Both their syntax and semantics are wildly variable and arbitrarily incompatible , for even the most common things .
There ’s two problems with this remark .
In first place , ambiguity in natural language is in fact expected and discounted — often large chunks of natural language are confirmation requests and clarifications — while programming languages are mostly expected to be “ logical ” and consistent .
In second place , that head in Beta means an iterator while in Haskell it means a cons-list “ destructor ” just means languages are different — much like in english “ cola ” evokes “ soda ” and in portuguese it means “ glue ” .
The problem here , as stated by ricercar , is that do - notation is by design an analogy to imperative ( I should rather say , destructive - update sequential - evaluation ) programming , and yet the analogy breaks the moment you step out of the IO monad — for example , working with Parsec .
Maybe the key distinction being missed here is the one between an analogy and an abstraction ; this is particularly clear since this thread chunk is already in reply to a comment where pjdelport remarks that failed assumption breakage is structural to programming language abstractions , which they just are n’t .
( Ever seen assumption breakage about closures ? )
Monads are an abstraction , and do - notation is just syntactic sugar — that is , an analogy , or a “ little story ” .
There ’s a “ little story ” to be told on abstraction versus analogy here .
In probability , we ’re often working with “ events ” that are sets and ennumerable intersections and unions of sets ( that is , with elements of an event algebra ) .
When two events are disjoint — i.e. when they can’t happen together , and their intersection is empty — the operator “ + ” is often used as union notation instead of the standard U - cup .
This is for clarity , but preserves compatibility with the fact that the probability of the disjoint union ( “ sum ” ) of two events is the sum of the probabilities of each event , as per the Kolmogorov axioms .
( I ’m thinking now that it should break for complementary sets of zero Lebesgue measure , but probably I do n’t remember the technical details anymore ) .
That is , P ( A+B ) =P ( A ) + P( B )
On the other hand , some authors omit the logical “ and ” ( or the inverted - U cup for intersection ) when talking about joint events and just concatenate event symbols to express this as in symbolic multiplication notation .
The problem is that we can only say that P ( AB ) = P ( A ) P( B ) when A and B are independent events — a property that can no longer be clearly expressed in set notation , and is often axiomatized , with “ independence ” being defined in terms of that equation .
In other words , when for “ event sum ” it seemed we were constructing an “ event algebra ” that would be entirely parallell to the arithmetic algebra over the probabilities of the events , the introduction of “ event multiplication ” shows that this notation is a leaky analogy , not an abstraction that ’d allow for computation being done on the events and translated to probability at the very last moment .
Statistical theory later allows for such “ separation of concerns ” , but alas , it ’s not as simple as carrying notation over .
Other subthreads carried on over this analogy - vs- abstraction theme in one way or another .
Cale emphasizes the plural nature of monads :
There ’s also no one - true - way of thinking about monads .
My Monads as Containers article describes another way to look at things , which works sometimes better for things like List , Maybe , various Tree monads , and even Reader , and eventually with more computation - like monads ( State , IO ) if you stretch your brain enough .
I love Monads as Containers — it ’s an analogy ( that is , it ’s mental syntactic sugar ! ) without the semblance of an abstraction of the big -T Truth .
It ’s also great as an intermediate step to understanding monads since it answers the “ ontological ” question ( what are the goddamn monads ? ) that popped up in my head without the snobjerk answer that monads are endofunctors on the category of types .
It also hints ( although this is much better explained in his recent , badly - titled yet great The Monad Laws ) to how monads are implemented in “ plain Haskell ” : a “ box thing ” like a particular monad has to be a particular type and something abstracting away the structure of certain box - things has to be a type - class .
The monads - as - containers view also manages not to be a leaky analogy , even though at the cost of being overly general .
All syntactic sugar is an analogy , at some point ; for example , square brackets for cons-lists emphasizes that ( a ) all elements of a list must be of the same type , ( b ) the structure of a cons- list is rather non-hierarchical ( certainly not a tree ) , ( c ) cons-lists can be empty or have just one element , and one - element lists are still not the same as elements by themselves and ( d ) cons-lists are containers .
Conversely , it ’s not hard to think of syntactic sugar for Cale ’s monads - as - containers analogy , though its overly - general nature would maybe lead to false analogy combination via false sylogism ( flowerpots are containers , monads are containers , therefore flowerpots are monads ! ) .
The bottom line to abstraction - analogy analysis is that analogies are very personal — a mapping between an outer world of hard technical facts and an inner world of squishy intuitive thoughts — and mandated analogies require a fine balancing act ( not too general , not too specific ) that ’s often very hard to do .
In basic calculus the derivative - as - angle analogy is often used , and the “ fit ” is nearly perfect because there ’s hard results that guarantee it ; integral - as - area already starts to leak because of negative - valued regions of the domain ( which means it ’s not general enough as an analogy ) .
Moreover , this pair of analogies does n’t yield the basic result of the field ( the fundamental theorem of calculus ) , and working directly with them forever means losing out big time , which is why limits have to be taught to every student , and moreover why the analogies are presented as firmly - specified theoretical results so that flowerpots - are - monads analogy mismatch does n’t go around running amok .
The flip side to what seems until now a definitive condemnation of do - notation for being a leaky analogy is that analogy is not the only role of syntactic sugar , and more importantly not the role people people think of when engaging in syntax - based programming language religious wars .
Do-notation does in fact enable the programmer to write monadic functions that would not otherwise ( due to mental stack overflow ) be factible to write .
The fact that it ’s all we have for the time being does not mean ( a ) it ’s already good enough and there ’s no place to improve upon it and ( b ) it ’s a good idea to mention it on page 3 of every tutorial way before polymorphic types and type classes are even mentioned .
If basic IO must be mentioned ( so compileable programs can be produced ) , please just define
mangle f = getContents >>= putStr . f
and vaguely mention that the outside world flows through putStr . f .
Hey , maybe there ’s a monads as aqueducts analogy waiting to be born there !
I ’d like to once again thank all the fine folks participating in this discussion for their input and for provoking the new ( for my brain ) thoughts I ’m trying to document here .
NEW YORK ( Hollywood Reporter ) - Online encyclopedia Wikipedia has added about 20 million unique monthly visitors in the past year , making it the top online news and information destination , according to Nielsen / / NetRatings .
In May , Wikipedia had 46.8 million unique visitors , up 72 percent from June 2006 , NetRatings said .
Wikipedia also has finished on top of the news and information category every month this year -- ranking ahead of Landmark Communications ’
Weather Channel site by an increasing margin -- topping out with a disparity of about 10 million visitors in May .
The site , operated by the nonprofit group Wikimedia Foundation Inc. , is user - run with thousands of editors and administrators constantly making edits , starting new pages and correcting mistakes .
Although this open - access format often is mentioned as a negative because pages are subject to misinformation and online vandalism , it also is its greatest strength , especially when a major news story breaks and the pages can be updated almost in real - time .
“ It ’s the seminal collaborative online resource , ” said Nielsen BuzzMetrics vice president marketing Max Kalehoff , who has researched the site .
“ It ’s like a living amoeba .
It ’s constantly growing . ”
Recently , though , the collaborative nature of the site placed it at the center of a controversy surrounding the Chris Benoit murder - suicide .
The World Wrestling Entertainment star ’s page was updated with information -- originating from a user with an IP address registered in Stamford , Conn. , the corporate home of the WWE -- regarding his wife Nancy ’s death 14 hours before authorities discovered the bodies in the Benoit ’s Georgia home June 25 .
An anonymous poster , who said he was from Stamford but not affiliated with the WWE , later wrote a Wikinews item where he revealed that he posted the information after “ reading rumors and speculation about this matter online . ”
It turned out to be an “ incredible coincidence , ” he wrote .
The site also was a hub of information about April ’s Virginia Tech shootings , and its page on Apple ’s much - hyped iPhone was updated regularly .
Kalehoff said that the July 7 , 2005 , London bombings and the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami also were traffic drivers to the site .

My goodness .
Don and Tim Wildmon are really running out of ideas .
This is the latest knickers - in - a - twist action alert —
Have you patronized blasphemy lately ?
— shaming Hollywood , of all places , for “ using God ’s name as a cuss word . ”
Is n’t Hollywood already a den of sin and deviance ?
Why is the AFA wasting bandwidth with this idiotic appeal :
Did you know that there was a time when the entertainment industry was bound by a code that forbade them from using any blasphemy in a movie ?
The “ Hays Code ” stated : Pointed profanity –this includes the words “ God , ” “ Lord , ” “ Jesus , ” “ Christ ” ( unless used reverently ) , “ H*ll , ” “ S.O.B. , ” “ d*mn , ” or every other profane or vulgar expression , however used –is forbidden .
Hollywood is no longer restricted by the code .
Many of today ’s movies do n’t simply blaspheme the name of Jesus .
They go one further .
For example , the award - winning Blow , directed by Ted Demme , is a typical R - rated film .
The name of Jesus Christ is blasphemed eleven times in the movie .
Three of those times , for some reason , the “ F ” word is used in the middle of His name .
So , how can you ( as one person ) , make a difference and influence the powerful Goliath of the entertainment industry ?
The answer is in your own hands .
In 2005 , roughly $ 8.8 billion was spent on movie tickets in the U.S.
How much of $ 8.8 billion do you think came from those who call themselves Christians ?
According to The Barna Group , it was a massive $ 6.94 billion .
Over 70 % of the box office intake comes from people of faith .
With more than 170 million professing Christians in America , we have a powerful sling that can hit Hollywood between the eyes and leave a deep impression on its money - making mind .
They are causing an entire generation to hate Christianity , and to use the name of Jesus Christ to express disgust .
On the AFA web page for the alert , there ’s a hilarious video where an interviewer asks people if they would go to see a movie where the Lord ’s name is taken in vain , and almost everyone said they would , proving to the AFA that Americans – even “ Christians ” — have had their minds polluted by the devil - loving moviemakers out there .
Don and Tim also ask if you want to find out if you ’re heaven or hell - bound , asking readers if they want to take a test to determine whether you are a good person .
Also , take a look at an amusing list of Blaspheming Movies , including : The Invasion , Rush Hour 3 , Bratz : The Movie , The Bourne Ultimatum , The Simpsons Movie , Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix , Transformers and Fantastic Four : Rise of the Silver Surfer .

Do you pretend you are the Hero of Time in your sleep ?
Are you the biggest Zelda fan on the block ?
Well , take a gander at what this Zelda fan owns ...
When we read that Paul Hantschel , one of our forum users , owns a real - life replica of the famous Master Sword from the Legend of Zelda series , we could n’t just leave well enough alone .
So we contacted Paul and asked for some details on his little artifact .
Mr. Hantschel emailed blacksmith Rob Miller of Castle Keep , located in Scotland , with the initial concept and original artwork .
Around a week later , Rob responded and requested detailed dimensions for every aspect of Link ’s Master Sword .
After a ten - month wait period and a £ 1,800 transaction ( around $ 3,300 ) , Rob began work on the sword of legends .
The blacksmith provided updates of his progress during the one - and - a - half - month forging process .
With them he included photographs of the sword , which Paul has graciously shared with PGC :
That ’s one great sword , if you ask us !
Paul agrees .
“ Now I 've just got to go to my local gravestone peddler and get a Pedestal of Time made up ! ”
I think this is a really solid idea .
I wish we had something like this when I was in .
The elbow pads alone are a great innovation and cannot be overlooked if you have ever had to low / high crawl through any kind of grit .
Also the anti-bac fabric is an interesting idea .
While I 'm fortunate enough to never have been shot , from what I understand a great deal of the infection risk comes from bits of clothing that the round carries into the wound along with the shrapnel its ' self .
So maybe the fabric actually helps prevent sepsis .
Great idea !
Does anyone know if this stuff , like the BDU uniform that was around for the past few decades has issues with regular washing ?
The uniform I was issued was supposed to possess anti-IR properties , but those traits supposedly vanished if the uniform was washed in a conventional washing machine .
Scientists hacking a smallpox - like virus into doing battle with cancer have given a new weapon to their microscopic warrior .
Researchers at Stanford University and Jennerex Biotherapeutics have tweaked the cancer - killing vaccinia virus JX - 963 so that it also stimulates the body to generate cancer - fighting white blood cells .
The company intends to take the virus into clinical trials based on a promising animal study .
" This is a very powerful and potent approach , " said Dr. Antonio Chiocca , a professor at Ohio State University and a specialist in oncological neurosurgery , who was not involved in the study .
" You can think of each of these viruses as a new drug . "
Cancer - fighting viruses are the latest attempt to harness viruses ' infectious powers for therapeutic treatments .
Modified viruses have been used in experimental gene therapies to " fix " faulty inherited genetic code .
Gene therapy has generated much hype but little clinical success .
Scientists claim to have made recent progress targeting cancer cells with modded cold , herpes and smallpox viruses .
These viruses infect and kill cancer cells while leaving healthy cells alone .
A different Jennerex virus , JX - 594 , is already entering Phase II clinical trials for the treatment of liver tumors .
In a study appearing Thursday in the Journal of Clinical Investigation , the researchers report that the new JX - 963 treatment resulted in the suppression of colon tumors in the rabbits on which it was tested .
" The results are very encouraging , " said Dr. Stephen Thorne , a co-author of the study and professor of surgical oncology at the University of Pittsburgh .
" I would envisage clinical trials starting next year . "
Thorne is a Jennerex consultant .
Until now , virus therapies have had limited success targeting and killing all the cancer cells in the body , and not just some .
With the new JX - 963 therapy , the virus does n't have to do the work alone – it elicits the body 's own defenses to mop up cancer cells .
The chemical that the virus secretes , granulocyte - macrophage colony - stimulating factor , or GM - CSF , is a protein that stimulates the production of white blood cells .
The scientists must be careful , however , not to overstimulate the immune system so that it kills the virus before it has a chance to attack the cancer .
" You have to make sure you give the virus enough time to do its job , " said Chiocca .
Paradoxically , the answer might lie in temporarily suppressing the immune system with drugs to allow the virus to spread rapidly .
Then , after the virus has destroyed most of the tumor , GM - CSF stimulates an elevated immune system response .
The obvious risk of using viruses to attack cancer cells is that the virus might mutate into a deadly form .
Since a death in a clinical trial in 1999 , gene - therapy research has been on the back burner .
Similar problems in the field of cancer - killing viruses could halt research .
Chiocca downplayed the risk from viruses that target humans , like the one used by the Stanford researchers .
He said that most people already have been exposed to the smallpox , cold and herpes vaccines , so our immune systems are unlikely to be compromised by any of their forms .
However , there are more risks when researchers use viruses that attack other species .
There are a small number of preclinical trials using viruses that do n’t target humans , Chiocca said .
" You worry about injecting a bird virus into humans , which could potentially become adapted to the human population and create a supervirus , " he said .
Krugman :
In Bush 's world , only the little people make sacrifices RAW STORY
Published : Friday July 6 , 2007 Print This Email
This " On this Fourth of July , President Bush compared the Iraq war to the Revolutionary War and called for ' more patience , more courage and more sacrifice , ' " writes Paul Krugman in his column published in the New York Times Friday .
" Unfortunately , it seems that nobody asked the obvious question : ' What sacrifices have you and your friends made , Mr. President ? ' "
Krugman adds , " On second thought , there would be no point in asking that question .
In Bush 's world , only the little people make sacrifices . "
Excerpts from Krugman 's op - ed : # You see , the Iraq war , although Bush insists that it is part of a Global War on Terror ( TRADEMARK ) , a fight to the death between good and evil , is not like America 's other great wars -- wars in which the wealthy shared the financial burden through higher taxes and many members of the elite fought for their country .
This time around , Bush celebrated Mission Accomplished by cutting tax rates on dividends and capital gains , while handing out huge no -bid contracts to politically connected corporations .
And in the four years since , as the insurgency he initially taunted with the cry of " Bring them on " has claimed the lives of thousands of Americans and left thousands more grievously wounded , the children of the elite -- especially the Republican elite -- have been conspicuously absent from the battlefield .
The Bushies , it seems , like starting fights , but they do not believe in paying any of the cost of those fights or bearing any of the risks .
Above all , they do not believe that they or their friends should face any personal or professional penalties for trivial sins like distorting intelligence to get America into an unnecessary war , or totally botching that war 's execution .

The customers do n’t care about the technology August 24th , 2007
It ’s been about three months since Sun has announced JavaFX “ family of products ” at JavaOne .
Based on the original work by Chris Oliver , it has been picked up by the powers - to - decide , fed into the relentless PR machine and since then touted as the next big thing on the desktop .
It certainly has the technical potential with all the engineers working on it ( more on that later ) .
And the aspirations are most surely lofty , positioning JavaFX against Flash , Flex , Apollo and SilverLight .
My main concern is with the name .
Why does it have to have “ Java ” in it ?
The end customer does n’t care how the application is written .
He cares that it ’s easy to install .
He cares that it starts fast .
He cares that it runs fast .
He cares that it does n’t crash on him .
He cares that it does n’t lose his data .
He cares that it does what it is supposed to be doing .
Let ’s look at the competition .
Does anybody outside the development teams of the respective products know what language are Flex , Apollo and SilverLight written ?
I guess some mix of C with other languages .
Do i care when i see a nice Flex / Flash site ?
Of course not .
Do you ever hear Adobe talking about “ bringing the full power of language X to the desktop ” ?
What do users know about the full power of this language ?
Or , to be more precise , what do they care ?
As long as it ’s a one - click user - friendly installer , immediate startup time , and no crashing , they do n’t care at all .
Another rule that JavaFX is blatantly violating is the “ underpromise and overdeliver ” .
No designer - friendly content authoring tools , buggy IDE plugins , excruciatingly slow runtime and constantly changing language definition .
Of course , these are all coming ( or at least promised to come ) , but promises are just words .
While the competition is smart enough to talk about features after they are implemented , Sun ’s marketing machine is effectively ruining any chance that JavaFX had to compete by selling promises .
The developers are , of course , eager to download the bits and play with them .
Quick frustration and “ i hope it would be better ” ensue .
Does that remind you of anything ?
Swing still carries the burden of perceived as slow , buggy and odd - looking , even after all the effort that went into it in Tiger and Mustang .
NetBeans has long ago lost the “ war ” to Eclipse and the attempts of catching up in the latest 6.0 version are not going to change that .
If Sun wanted JavaFX to follow the same perception patterns , it most surely succeeded .
What can be done ?
First of all , a major shakeup in the PR / marketing department .
Talk about things that are done , not about the things that you ’re going to do .
The later might work when you ’re working on a product that does n’t have any competition ( brand new market place ) , but doing this in a saturated market with very experienced players will quickly backfire and you will carry the burden of bad reputation for a very long time .
Second , do n’t focus on the technology behind the product .
Rebrand it and lose the word “ Java ” .
And while you ’re at it , lose the “ FX ” as well .
Third , stabilize the language , squeeze every bit of performance out of it and create a comprehensive suite of tools .
All this before you make any public announcement ( look at Apple if you need to ) .
When creating the tools , have graphic designers on your team .
Learn from Microsoft that had a professional designer as a part of Blend team .
If you want to compete against Adobe and Microsoft , do not let the developers design content authoring tools .
And by the way , while we ’re at it , do n’t rename your stock ticker as well .
( CNN ) -- Picture this : A giant penguin with a long , peculiar beak , lounging in the warm sun .
The giant penguin Icadyptes salasi , right , and Perudyptes devriesi , left , are shown with a modern penguin .
It could be a promotion for the next animated Hollywood movie .
But this big bird is the real thing , its recently discovered fossils providing researchers with several scientific oddities .
Not only are the birds extra large by modern standards , they thrived in one of the warmest periods in the past 65 million years .
" We have this ingrained notion of a penguin on an iceberg in a cool sea .
But for most of their long history , penguins were in situations of no ice , with maybe crocodiles near them , " said Julia Clarke , assistant professor of marine , earth and atmospheric sciences at North Carolina State University in Raleigh , North Carolina .
Clarke , who studies the biodiversity of living birds , and colleagues in Peru and Argentina have described two species of extinct penguins that lived tens of millions of years ago .
It was during a time when Earth was a lot warmer than it is today .
The fossils were found in Peru in 2005 .
The larger of the two new species , Icadyptes salasi , lived about 36 million years ago on the southern coast of Peru .
The skull that was discovered includes an intriguing beak that is almost a foot long .
" The texturing on the bone of the beak is unlike any living penguin , " said Clarke .
The bird likely had more developed jaw muscles than current penguins , and probably ate large prey , including fish .
The climate of the earth at that time was far different from the icy polar regions and the toastier , tropical middle section we inhabit today .
" The global average temperature was much higher than at present , " said Clarke .
" And there was relatively little difference between the temperatures at the poles and the equator , " she said .
The Earth 's first polar icecaps developed about 34 million years ago , after these two penguin species became extinct .
The other newly discovered species , Perudyptes devriesi , is even older , inhabiting the planet 42 million years ago .
It resembled one of the largest contemporary penguin species , the King penguin , standing two and a half to three feet tall .
Its fossils show that its wings may have looked a little different from the very specialized " paddles " that the wings have become today .
Clarke emphasized that because some penguins on the lower branches of the birds ' family tree lived well in warmer temperatures , it would be a colossal mistake to believe that penguins now living could simply adapt to the changes brought about by global warming .
" What happened over millions and millions of years cannot usefully inform us about what may happen over just the next 1,000 years , " she said .
" The data from these new fossil species cannot be used to argue that warming would n't negatively impact living penguins . "
These penguin fossils may change understanding of just how and where these flightless birds evolved .
Until now , researchers theorized that penguins evolved in high latitudes in New Zealand and Antarctica , eventually moving to warmer areas nearer the equator about ten million years ago .
That would have been 24 million years after the transition from very warm temperatures in the Paleocene and Eocene eras to major planetary cooling and the appearance of permanent North and South Poles .
So what does a vertebrate paleontologist think about all the attention penguins are now getting with pop culture hits like " March of the Penguins " and " Happy Feet " ?
" Anytime people are motivated to engage and become emotionally connected to the natural world is a good thing for conservation concerns , " said Clarke .
The research is published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
It was funded by the National Geographic Society , and the National Science Foundation Office of International Science and Engineering .

Bill Would Require Accountability on Robo- Calls
The 2002 law that makes federal candidates take responsibility for TV and radio ads could extend to the Internet and pre-recorded telephone calls , if Rep. David E. Price , D - N.C. , and Rep. Mike Castle , R - Del. , have their way .
They recently introduced a bill that would extend the requirements set in " Stand By Your Ad " for candidates and groups that launch ads on the Internet or over e-mail .
It 's their second attempt ; a similar bill they introduced two years ago went nowhere after it went to the House Administration Committee under former Rep. Robert W. Ney , R - Ohio .
Advertisement
The Responsible Campaign Communications
Act would also require anyone using pre-recorded telephone calls ( " robo - calls " ) to state upfront who they are .
Currently robo-calling candidates who do identify themselves can do so late in the call usually after the person they 've called has hung up .
Castle said that the need for an extension of the law spoke for itself .
He said the sharp rise in Internet ads and robo-calls over the past couple of election cycles demonstrates why they should be subject to the same laws as traditional advertising .
He said the bill was not intended to curb negative advertising .
" It would be nice if campaign ads were more positive , " he added .
" But I 'm not trying to restrict campaign communication . "
Former Federal Election Commissioner Bradley A. Smith disagreed .
He also disagreed with the premise of Stand By Your Ad in general .
Reformers , he explained , want to make it harder to run ads or to dictate what form they could take .
The verbal tagline is redundant , he argued , when ads also have to disclose the sponsor 's name in writing .
Furthermore , the tagline takes up precious time better spent on the candidate 's message ; as an example , he cited Patrick Henry 's famous " Give me liberty or give me death " as the perfect fit for a four - second slot .
John Brabender , a national Republican media consultant who has created ads for Rick Santorum and Jim Gerlach , shares Smith 's concerns about requiring a tagline on television and radio ads .
But he said he has no problem with the new bill .
While television stations have to monitor their ad content , there is no similar check for the new advertising methods , he said .
Price 's spokesman , Paul Cox , said that the new Democratic leadership would likely be more sympathetic to the legislation , because so many Democratic candidates were targeted by robo - calls in last fall 's election .
One of them was Heath Shuler , a freshman Democratic representative from North Carolina who has co-sponsored the bill .
His spokesman , Andrew Whelan , said the National Republican Campaign Committee unleashed a robo - call campaign against Shuler that began with " Hi , I 'm calling to share with you some information on Heath Shuler . "
They then continued to provide a negative message about the candidate .
What distinguished the calls , he said , was that they came to cell phones and land lines alike at all hours of the night .
People who believed the Shuler campaign had made the calls asked to be taken off its call list .
Julie Shutley , a spokeswoman for the NRCC , did not say whether such campaigns had been effective or whether they'd be used again .
" We are a long way from making the decisions about what specific political tactics to use in 2008 , " she said .
" Over the next few months we will be taking a look at what has and has n't worked in the past .
In the end , we will take advantage of every tool and resource available to us to help win back the majority . "
Castle said he had heard Republican colleagues complaining about similar robo - call " dirty tricks , " but he could not remember which races were targeted .
He said their use by partisans on both sides of the aisle showed the need for greater accountability .
When it comes to making a great nation , labor and workforce issues must take center stage–otherwise , the most any country can hope for is mediocrity .
France and America , two great nations , have much to say about how their people work , and both are pushing to make things better .
I witnessed this up - close recently , during a 16 - day tour of France from Normandy to Nice .
Though it was vacation , I could n’t help but do some informal investigating and compare workplace issues in the States to those in the Fifth Republic .
There are obvious differences –France ’s 35 - hour week and generous vacation time versus America ’s intense work ethic and typical two weeks of vacation .
Each country has die - hard supporters who believe the other country ’s approach is wrong .
I disagree .
In important ways , America and France have it right regarding their workforces .
But neither is perfect , and they could learn a lot from each other .
A New Regime
Much is being made of France ’s new President Nicolas Sarkozy and his emphasis on–among other things –hard work ; some say he is vying to make France more like America .
He appointed as finance minister Christine Lagarde , the first woman to lead the U.S. law firm Baker & McKenzie .
Her nickname is “ the American . ”
Do You Know What You 're Worth ?
GET A FREE PAY REPORT
According to a recent New York Times op - ed on Lagarde :
Lagarde ’s goal , she says , is to slash France ’s chronically highly unemployment — now about 8 percent — to 5 percent by 2012 and increase the proportion of the total population in jobs to 70 percent from 63 percent .
Rehabilitating work is central to this ambition .
Tax cuts , the termination of unemployment benefits for those refusing two valid job offers , later retirement , incentives for those working more than 35 hours , a slashing of the bureaucracy associated with job - seeking and improved professional training are among measures enacted or envisaged .
Legislation to reverse the 35 - hour week is possible .
” I think we have to go around it , ” Lagarde says of the law .
” To demonstrate that it ’s not a holy principle and it can be modified , varied , mitigated and possibly reversed . ”
A CBS News story from 2005 notes :
France is still one of the world ’s five largest economies .
When the French work , their productivity per hour is among the highest in the world , even better than in the United States .
Problem is , French workers are on the job an average of 300 hours less per year than their American counterparts , so French economic growth lags far behind the United States .
France ’s leadership may be borrowing some ideas from the United States .
They ’ll likely tailor the concepts to fit the country – I do n’t think , as some have suggested , Sarkozy and his administration are looking to turn France into America .
That ’s an absurd notion , not to mention impossible .
A friend who has lived in France for many years sums up the difference between the countries this way : America is a society that thrives on risk ;
France is a risk - averse society .
If France were to boost its risk - tolerance a bit , perhaps it would be pleasantly surprised .
Working to Live
America also can be schooled in some lessons from France , especially about work - life balance and vacation .
According to a Business 2.0 article , “ U.S. employees are taking less time off than ever :
Not only is the average number of annual vacation days granted to them a mere 12.4 – less than that of the average medieval peasant – but more than a third of us do n’t even use all of our allotted time off . ”
People I talked to in France mentioned how they relish their seven or eight weeks of vacation every year , and how much it adds to their quality of life .
The CBS story explains :
The French are so passionate about their vacations , they put pleasure before profit .
As tourists throng the streets and summer temperatures hit their peak , Paris ’ most popular ice - cream parlor is closed for a whole six weeks .
It ’s the kind of business bonanza that would be seized upon by Americans , but the French do n’t seem to care .
“ The big difference is money , the place of money in your life , ” says [ Stephane ] Marchand [ a senior economics editor at the French newspaper , Le Figaro ] .
I do n’t suspect the average American vacation will expand to seven weeks anytime soon .
But I do think that , amid all the conversations about work - life balance and flexibility , we should take a cue from France .
Their quality of life is higher than ours largely because they work to live , while many Americans live to work .
It ’s great to love your work and deliver more than 100 percent while you work .
But humans are wired to step away from the fray and enjoy the roses –that ’s true for the French and the Americans .
Embracing Each Other ’s Strengths
I ’ve heard many Americans espouse dislike for France –without ever having traveled there .
Likewise , I ’ve been on the receiving end of some unsavory remarks and treatment in France .
Spewing such nastiness is silly .
America and France should be open to exchanging ideas about work , and to learning more about each other –especially when we encounter one another in our homelands .
That does n’t mean all Americans will suddenly love everything about the French , or vice versa .
But we can be wise enough to tap into each other ’s strengths , appreciate them , and use them to our advantage .
Air Force secretary announces provisional Cyber Command
9/19/2007 - WASHINGTON
( AFPN ) --
The secretary of the Air Force announced the Air Force is officially standing up a provisional Cyberspace Command during his address at the Air Force 60th anniversary celebration Sept. 18 at the Pentagon .
Secretary Michael W. Wynne said the provisional command , called AFCYBER ( P ) , will be located at Barksdale Air Force Base , La .
This is another step in the Air Force 's move to develop an operational command for cyberspace .
The size and location of the final major command has not been determined .
" While a number of basing locations for a permanent command staff are being considered and evaluated , no final decisions have been made , " said Maj .
Gen. Charles V. Ickes II , the special assistant to the deputy chief of staff for operations , plans and requirements .
The Air Force will place a major general , yet to be named , in charge of the interim command .
" While Lt. Gen . ( Robert J. " Bob " ) Elder ( the 8th Air Force commander ) and 8th Air Force will continue to focus on day - to - day operations , the commander of AFCYBER ( P ) will prepare the way for the eventual standup of a full major command that will be responsible for organizing , training and equipping forces to conduct sustained global operations in and through cyberspace , fully integrated with air and space operations , " General Ickes said .
Personnel will be temporarily attached to the provisional major command until a permanent command is activated , he said .
General Ickes stressed that although the headquarters will be at Barksdale AFB , no unit moves are planned at this point .
In December 2005 , the Air Force mission statement was amended to include cyberspace as an operational domain along with air and space .
In November 2006 , the secretary announced 8th Air Force as the lead command for cyberspace .

The End of National Currency is the most astonishing thing that I have read since Zbigniew Brzezinski ’s appearance before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee earlier this year .
Foreign Affairs is the most important and influential journal of International Relations in the world .
It is the mechanism by which the Council on Foreign Relations disseminates the game plan to people in polite circles .
CFR ’s positions on core issues represent the raw building blocks for most of the gibberish spewed by the corporate media and the maniac fascist policies of the “ developed world . ”
Publications like the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal are dumbed down versions of Foreign Affairs that are published daily .
Television news is the same thing , but dumbed down again .
Foreign Affairs is also where politicians from several countries look to determine what ’s safe to say , which policies are doable and what needs to be done .
A degree in International Relations is largely a certification of a student ’s ability to internalize CFR jargon and concepts .
Got the picture ?
Now , what did the most important and influential journal of International Relations in the world just say about the U.S. Dollar and the global economy ?
In summary : The U.S. dollar is an “ absurdity ” and the only way to stave off a global disaster is for most countries to join one of three global currencies , based loosely on : the dollar , the euro and a pan Asian currency .
I encourage everyone to read The End of National Currency in its entirety , but I ’ll quote some of the more remarkable parts below :
The dollar ’s privileged status as today ’s global money is not heaven - bestowed .
The dollar is ultimately just another money supported only by faith that others will willingly accept it in the future in return for the same sort of valuable things it bought in the past .
This puts a great burden on the institutions of the U.S. government to validate that faith .
And those institutions , unfortunately , are failing to shoulder that burden .
Reckless U.S. fiscal policy is undermining the dollar ’s position even as the currency ’s role as a global money is expanding .
Four decades ago , the renowned French economist Jacques Rueff , writing just a few years before the collapse of the Bretton Woods dollar - based gold - exchange standard , argued that the system “ attains such a degree of absurdity that no human brain having the power to reason can defend it . ”
The precariousness of the dollar ’s position today is similar .
The United States can run a chronic balance - of - payments deficit and never feel the effects .
Dollars sent abroad immediately come home in the form of loans , as dollars are of no use abroad .
“ If I had an agreement with my tailor that whatever money I pay him he returns to me the very same day as a loan , ” Rueff explained by way of analogy , “ I would have no objection at all to ordering more suits from him . ”
With the U.S. current account deficit running at an enormous 6.6 percent of GDP ( about $ 2 billion a day must be imported to sustain it ) , the United States is in the fortunate position of the suit buyer with a Chinese tailor who instantaneously returns his payments in the form of loans — generally , in the U.S. case , as purchases of U.S. Treasury bonds .
The current account deficit is partially fueled by the budget deficit ( a dollar more of the latter yields about 20 - 50 cents more of the former ) , which will soar in the next decade in the absence of reforms to curtail federal “ entitlement ” spending on medical care and retirement benefits for a longer - living population .
The United States — and , indeed , its Chinese tailor — must therefore be concerned with the sustainability of what Rueff called an “ absurdity . ”
In the absence of long - term fiscal prudence , the United States risks undermining the faith foreigners have placed in its management of the dollar — that is , their belief that the U.S. government can continue to sustain low inflation without having to resort to growth - crushing interest - rate hikes as a means of ensuring continued high capital inflows …
At the turn of the twentieth century — the height of the gold standard —
Simmel commented , “ Although money with no intrinsic value would be the best means of exchange in an ideal social order , until that point is reached the most satisfactory form of money may be that which is bound to a material substance . ”
Today , with money no longer bound to any material substance , it is worth asking whether the world even approximates the “ ideal social order ” that could sustain a fiat dollar as the foundation of the global financial system .
There is no way effectively to insure against the unwinding of global imbalances should China , with over a trillion dollars of reserves , and other countries with dollar - rich central banks come to fear the unbearable lightness of their holdings .
Ordo ab chao .
The CFR created this mess to begin with .
Its fingerprints are on every policy , politician and corporation involved with the funneling of wealth up to the top of the pyramid .
Now what ?
What do we do now , as we find ourselves gazing into oblivion , into the chaos that They created ?
Seek order with fewer national currencies , my son .
Trust us .
We ’ve gotten you this far .
We have almost reached the promised land of a global federal government , with a single currency , with no dissent , no war , no crime , no hunger and no disease and …
But before we can move to the single currency , we need to move to three :
A future pan-Asian currency , managed according to the same principle of targeting low and stable inflation , would represent the most promising way for China to fully liberalize its financial and capital markets without fear of damaging renminbi speculation ( the Chinese economy is only the size of California ’s and Florida ’s combined ) .
Most of the world ’s smaller and poorer countries would clearly be best off unilaterally adopting the dollar or the euro , which would enable their safe and rapid integration into global financial markets .
Latin American countries should dollarize ; eastern European countries and Turkey , euroize .
Broadly speaking , this prescription follows from relative trade flows , but there are exceptions ; Argentina , for example , does more eurozone than U.S. trade , but Argentines think and save in dollars .
But wait , there ’s one more thing :
Gold .
This following paragraph is so weird , I had to read it several times .
I still do n’t know what to make of it :
So what about gold ?
A revived gold standard is out of the question .
In the nineteenth century , governments spent less than ten percent of national income in a given year .
Today , they routinely spend half or more , and so they would never subordinate spending to the stringent requirements of sustaining a commodity - based monetary system .
But private gold banks already exist , allowing account holders to make international payments in the form of shares in actual gold bars .
Although clearly a niche business at present , gold banking has grown dramatically in recent years , in tandem with the dollar ’s decline .
A new gold - based international monetary system surely sounds far - fetched .
But so , in 1900 , did a monetary system without gold .
Modern technology makes a revival of gold money , through private gold banks , possible even without government support .
Woh .
Hold on a second .
On the one hand , “ A revived gold standard is out of the question , ” but on the other hand , “ private gold banks already exist , allowing account holders to make international payments in the form of shares in actual gold bars .
Although clearly a niche business at present , gold banking has grown dramatically in recent years , in tandem with the dollar ’s decline .
A new gold - based international monetary system surely sounds far - fetched .
But so , in 1900 , did a monetary system without gold .
Modern technology makes a revival of gold money , through private gold banks , possible even without government support . ”
So , we ’re going to have a few “ absurd ” fiat currencies and private gold banks that will be used to make international payments in the form of shares of actual gold bars ?
Did the CFR just transmit a veiled and obscure tipoff to the wealthy people who read their rag ?
Or is it something else …
I do n’t know what to make of it .
That paragraph is such a non sequitur in the article that it practically slaps you right out of your chair as you read the thing .
Steil points out that rape and plunder ( Globalization ) ca n’t happen with currencies that are tied to things .
So …
Why mention private gold banks that can facilitate international payments ?
It gets weirder .
This article was published within days of the U.S. Government ’s shut down of eGold , the oldest private electronic gold bank .
On the same day that the indictments came out against eGold , Brinks , a U.S. firm that provides bullion vaulting services , dropped BullionVault as a client .
BullionVault allows individuals to easily and efficiently move their fiat currencies into physical gold , but it does not allow payments to other parties .
[ I am a satisfied client of BullionVault , by the way . ]
Are factions of the Elite in open conflict ?
Do some of them want access to these gold services , while others , mainly U.S. dollar interested parties inside the U.S. , view those same services as a threat ?
Is Steil warning governments to shut down these services , lest individuals abandon their “ absurd ” fiat currencies ?
I do n’t know what ’s going on here , but I ’d really like to find out .

A new case study of a stroke patient suggests that adults ' brains might be just as " plastic , " or capable of creating new neural pathways , as those of children .
Past research has established the remarkable capacity of young brains to change or adapt to deficits by creating new signaling routes , a phenomenon called plasticity .
However , whether adult brains have that same capacity has remained controversial .
Results from a new study , published in the Sept. 5 online edition of the Journal of Neuroscience , suggest at least in one patient , the visual center of an adult brain can reorganize itself neurally to overcome damaged pathways and result in changes ( and possibly improvements ) in visual perception .
Stroke patient
Daniel Dilks , now a postdoctoral associate at the McGovern Institute for Brain Research at MIT , and his colleagues studied the brain of a stroke patient , referred to as BL .
Dilks completed the work while a graduate student at Johns Hopkins University .
BL 's stroke had damaged the fibers that transmit information from the eyes to the primary visual cortex , which is a region in the grey matter in the back of the brain .
The cortex itself remained intact .
The damage cut off communication between the upper left visual field and the corresponding region in the visual cortex , creating a blind area in that upper left visual field .
( A visual field refers to the area that can be seen when that eye is directed forward and includes the peripheral vision . )
Distorted images
BL had reported that things " looked distorted " in the area just below the blind spot .
The researchers hypothesized the distortions resulted from reorganization in the deprived cortex .
To test their idea , the neuroscientists had BL focus on a center dot while images of objects , such as square shapes , appeared in various parts of the visual field .
When the square popped up in the blind area , BL saw nothing .
When the square appeared just below the blind area , BL perceived the square as a rectangle stretching upward into the blind area .
Likewise , the patient saw triangles as " pencil - like , " and circles as " cigar - like . "
Brain scans using fMRI showed the visually deprived cortex ( upper left visual field ) was responding to information coming from the lower left visual field — something that would not occur in a " normal " adult brain .
That ability to " redirect " sight signals is a hallmark of plasticity , the authors say , and could explain the visual distortions .
" We discovered that it took on new functional properties , and BL sees differently as a consequence of that cortical reorganization , " Dilks said .
Plastic proof
The new finding adds weight to suggestions made by other research about the ability of adult brains to morph .
This year , neuroscientists reported the adult mice could grow new neurons , a finding they said could have implications for the treatment of human neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's .
A similar finding was reported a couple of years ago in mice .
In 2005 , a brain - scan study of human adults with macular degeneration showed evidence of plasticity in the visual regions of their brains .
However , similar studies have somewhat tempered these positive results , one in which brain scans failed to find evidence for brain changes in patients with macular degeneration .
Why has the U.S. Navy increased its Internet defense force from 200 sailors , to 15,000 , in the past three years ?
Mainly fear .
The navy is now spending nearly a billion dollars a year to defend its computers from attack .
The navy has 760,000 active duty , reserve and civilian computer users , operating at 300 bases in sixteen countries .
Every major warship has networks , and aircraft are being equipped with communications and computer gear that enables them to form networks in the sky , and with army units on the ground , and air force warplanes .
All of this stuff in increasingly being infiltrated by spies and vandals .
The U.S. Department of Defense has noted the increasing number of hackers trying , and succeeding , to get into military networks .
This sort of thing has been going on since the 1980s , when a gang of West German hackers , hired by the Soviet secret police ( KGB ) were caught inside Department of Defense networks , stealing classified data .
But in the last few years , the hacker activity has accelerated .
Currently , Department of Defense networks get probed six million times a day .
Since last year there has been a 46 percent increase in attacks on Department of Defense web sites .
There has been 28 percent more email based attacks .
These are increasingly targeted at specific types of military users , or even individuals .
There were more than twice as many attempts to insert viruses , worms and Trojan horse software on military systems .
The attackers are looking for information , or secret control of , or at least access , to military systems .
Some of the attacks have been massive and well organized .
There have been at least four of these major attacks in the last year , hitting targets like the National Defense University , the Naval War College and Fort Hood .
Each of these cost $ 20 - 30 million to clean up after .
The Department of Defense has 11 million Internet users , five million PCs and 12,000 networks , and is the largest Internet user on the planet .
All the services are scrambling to get their Cyber War defenses strengthened .
The U.S. Air Force is trying to establish itself as the primary Cyber War organization in the Department of Defense .
To that end , it is advocating more offensive Cyber War .
Apparently there has already been some offensive operations , but no one is giving out any details about when , how , and who the target ( s ) was .
The army and air force have been seeking better weapons from commercial firms , which is how knowledge of the offensive weapons got out .
AT&T has rolled out new Terms of Service for its DSL service that leave plenty of room for interpretation .
From our reading of it , in concert with several others , what we see is a ToS that attempts to give AT&T the right to disconnect its own customers who criticize the company on blogs or in other online settings .
In section 5 of its legal ToS , AT&T stipulates the following :
AT&T may immediately terminate or suspend all or a portion of your Service , any Member ID , electronic mail address , IP address , Universal Resource Locator or domain name used by you , without notice , for conduct that AT&T believes ( a ) violates the Acceptable Use Policy ; ( b ) constitutes a violation of any law , regulation or tariff ( including , without limitation , copyright and intellectual property laws ) or a violation of these TOS , or any applicable policies or guidelines , or ( c ) tends to damage the name or reputation of AT&T , or its parents , affiliates and subsidiaries .
Translation : " conduct " that AT&T " believes " " tends to damage " its name , or the name of its partners , can get you booted off the service .
Note the use of " tends to damage " : the language of the contract does not require any proof of any actual damage .
The story , which surfaced at the venerable Slashdot , has many people outraged and is being discussed as a prime example of why net neutrality is needed .
I think that puts the cart before the horse , however .
Here 's why .
There 's nothing which guarantees that what AT&T is doing here is either legal or what the company intends .
This would n't be the first time that poorly thought - out legal language made it into a contract used by a major corporation .
Why are we thinking it 's an oversight ?
Simple : we believe that AT&T is n't misguided enough to expect to be able to squash First Amendment rights with a ToS contract without losing both face and their cozy legal status .
As an Internet service provider , AT&T itself is protected from lawsuits relating to the distribution of illegal materials online because they are excused from having to monitor and police their own networks from such activity .
They are also protected against what their users say and do online .
For instance , if I 'm an AT&T customer and I posted damaging comments about Vodafone using AT&T 's service , Vodafone can't go after AT&T just because they 're my ( fictional ) ISP .
Yet if AT&T begins to monitor and police its own network to protect its own corporate identity , the company will be setting itself up for lawsuits from parties looking for the same protections as AT&T grants itself .
In this way , AT&T has to tread reasonably .
Even more important , should AT&T ever attempt to exercise this contractual " right , " it will do far more harm to its " name " than the user (s ) in question could have ever done ... if what 's shut down is just a regular user expressing typical criticism of a corporation .
The backlash would be intense , to say the least .
We 've requested clarification of the issue , but we'd also like to note that AT&T also reserves the right to disconnect users with " insecure " computers , and we 've not heard of this happening , either .
It may be nothing more than a toothless scare tactic , or it may be focused on something more insidious than mere criticism of the company .
As it is currently worded , however , plenty of AT&T customers are concerned , if my inbox is any estimation .
Everything we have been told about the Olympic legacy turns out to be bunkum .
The games are supposed to encourage us to play sport ; they are meant to produce resounding economic benefits and help the poor .
It 's all untrue .
As the evictions in London begin , a new report shows that the only certain Olympic legacy is a transfer of wealth from the poor to the rich .
Both Lord Coe and Tessa Jowell , the sports secretary , like the boosters for every city to have bid for the Olympics , have claimed that the games will lever us off our sofas and turn us into a nation of athletes .
But Jowell knows this is nonsense .
In 2002 her department published a report which found that " hosting events is not an effective , value - for - money method of achieving ... a sustained increase in mass participation " .
One study suggests that the Olympics might even reduce our physical activity : we stay indoors watching them on TV , rather than kicking a ball around outside .
And this is before we consider the effects of draining the national lottery : Sport England will lose £ 100m .
The government 's favourite thinktanks , Demos and the Institute for Public Policy Research , examined the claim that the Olympics produce a lasting economic boom .
They found that " there is no guaranteed beneficial legacy from hosting an Olympic games ... and there is little evidence that past games have delivered benefits to those people and places most in need " .
Tessa Jowell must be aware of this as well - she wrote the forward to the report .
A paper published by the London assembly last month found that " long - term unemployed and workless communities were largely unaffected [ by better job prospects ] by the staging of the games in each of the four previous host cities " .
Far more damning is a study released last week by the Centre on Housing Rights and Evictions .
In every city it examined , the Olympic games - accidentally or deliberately - have become a catalyst for mass evictions and impoverishment .
Since the 1988 Olympics in Seoul , more than 2 million people have been driven from their homes to make way for the Olympics .
The games have become a licence for land grabs .
The 1988 games are widely seen as a great success .
But they were used by the military dictatorship ( which had ceded power in 1987 ) as an opportunity to turn Seoul from a vernacular city owned by many people into a corporate city owned by the elite - 720,000 people were thrown out of their homes ; people who tried to resist were beaten by thugs and imprisoned ; tenants were evicted without notice and left to freeze ( some survived by digging caves into a motorway embankment ) ; street vendors were banned ; homeless people , those with mental health problems , alcoholics and beggars were rounded up and put into a prison camp .
The world saw nothing of this : just a glossy new city full of glossy new people .
Barcelona 's Olympics , in 1992 , are cited as a model to which all succeeding Olympic cities should aspire .
But , though much less destructive than Seoul 's , they were also used to cleanse the city .
Roma communities were evicted and dispersed .
The council produced a plan to " clean the streets of beggars , prostitutes , street sellers and swindlers " and " annoying passers - by " .
Some 400 poor and homeless people were subjected to " control and supervision " .
Between 1986 and 1992 house prices rose by 240 % as the Olympic districts were gentrified , while the public housing stock fell by 76 % .
There was no consultation before the building began - the games were too urgent and important .
Around 59,000 people were driven out of the city by rising prices .
Even before the 1996 Olympics , Atlanta was one of the most segregated cities in the US .
But the games gave the clique of white developers who ran them the excuse to engineer a new ethnic cleansing programme .
Without any democratic process they demolished large housing projects ( whose inhabitants were mostly African - American ) and replaced them with shiny middle - class homes ; about 30,000 families were evicted .
They issued " quality of life ordinances " , which criminalised people who begged or slept rough .
The police were given pre-printed arrest citations bearing the words " African - American , Male , Homeless " : they just had to fill in the name , charge and date .
In the year before the games they arrested 9,000 homeless people .
Many were locked up without trial until the games were over ; others were harassed until they left the city .
By the time the athletes arrived , downtown Atlanta had been cleared for the white middle classes .
In 2002 , there was much less persecution of the poor , but the economic legacy was still regressive : house prices in Sydney doubled between 1996 and 2003 .
No provision was made for social housing in the Olympic village , and there were mass evictions from boarding houses and rented homes , which the authorities did nothing to stop .
The old pattern resumed in Athens , where the Olympics were used as an excuse to evict 2,700 Roma , even from places where no developments were planned .
In Beijing 1.25 million people have already been displaced to make way for the games , and another quarter of a million are due to be evicted .
Like the people of Seoul , they have been threatened and beaten if they resist .
Housing activists have been imprisoned .
One man , Ye Guozhu , is currently serving four years for " disturbing social order " , and has reportedly been suspended by his arms from the ceiling of his cell and tortured with electric batons .
Beggars , vagrants and hawkers have been rounded up and sentenced to " re-education through labour " .
The authorities are planning to hospitalise mentally ill people so that visitors wo n't have to see them .
London is about to establish its credentials as a true Olympic city by evicting Gypsies and Travellers from Clays Lane in Newham and Waterden Crescent in Hackney : 430 people will be thrown out of the Clays Lane housing co-op and a 100 - year - old allotment will be destroyed to make way for a concrete path that will be used for four weeks .
Nine thousand new homes will be built for the games , but far more will be lost to the poor through booming prices , which are rising much faster around the Olympic site than elsewhere in London .
The buy - to - let vultures have already landed .
The International Olympic Committee raises no objection to any of this .
It lays down rigid criteria for cities hosting the games , but these do not include housing rights .
How could they ?
City authorities want to run the games for two reasons : to enhance their prestige and to permit them to carry out schemes that would never otherwise be approved .
Democratic processes can be truncated , compulsory purchase orders slapped down , homes and amenities cleared .
The Olympic bulldozer clears all objections out of the way .
There can be no debate , no exceptions , no modifications .
Everything must go .
None of this is an argument against the Olympic games .
It is an argument against moving them every four years .
Let them stay in a city where the damage has already been done .
And let it be anywhere but here .

That 's right .
Eleven zeros .
New estimates out this week by the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office place the cost of the Iraq occupation through 2017 at 2.4 TRILLION dollars , or put another way , $ 8,000 for every man , woman and child in the US .
And that does not include the interest on the foreign loans being used to finance it so that the top 1 % can still enjoy their tax cuts .
Remember Wolfowitz claiming that the war would pay for itself ?
HA !
The House Budget Committee held a hearing today to discuss the growing costs of this occupation .
Get this : the Republicans on the committee did n't even bother to show up .
Rep. Doggett from The Gavel :
Rep. Doggett : " I assume , by Mr. Ryan being here , that every member of this panel , including every Republican member on that side of the aisle where all the seats are vacant , received notice about this hearing about the cost of war in Iraq ? "
Chairman Spratt : " I 'm sure they did . "
Rep. Doggett : " And when was this notice of the hearing sent out ? " Chairman Spratt : " Seven days ago , as required by the rules . "
The Gavel also provides these comparables :
$ 2.4 trillion is enough to :
· Provide every college freshman in the country with a free , four year education at a private college or university
· Provide health care coverage to every American for one year
· Pay off 26 % of our current national debt
And the Republicans want to tell us they 're the Party of Fiscal Responsibility ?
What are they smoking ?

When he was 21 , a prominent drug policy reformer recalls , he climbed a cliff overlooking Mount McKinley National Park after taking LSD .
“ God came to me and commanded me to acknowledge Him as the ruler of the universe , ” he says , “ and He was as powerful and as real as any appearance of God is to anybody .
I got down on my knees and thanked God for revealing Himself to me .
That was a completely authentic , real spiritual experience . ”
But it is not the sort of experience that would be protected by the Religious Freedom Restoration Act .
Lacking a formal organization or a recognized religious tradition , individual spiritual seekers cannot gain the status accorded to members of Uniao do Vegetal or the Native American Church .
Yet it seems clear that many independent psychedelic users are seeking experiences that are fundamentally similar to those of legally privileged peyote and ayahuasca users .
In an often - cited 1962 experiment , Walter Pahnke , a physician and minister who was working toward a Ph.D. in religion and society from Harvard , investigated the spiritual potential of psilocybin , the main psychoactive ingredient in “ magic mushrooms . ”
Pahnke ’s academic adviser was the Harvard psychologist Timothy Leary , who at the time was conducting psilocybin research in which he eschewed standard scientific methods and took the drug along with his subjects , who included graduate students — loose practices that would eventually get him thrown out of the university .
Pahnke ’s approach was notably more rigorous .
He gave either psilocybin or nicotinic acid ( a placebo with noticeable physical effects ) to 20 Protestant divinity students who were participating in a Good Friday service at Boston University ’s Marsh Chapel .
“ All of a sudden , ” one of the subjects who took psilocybin later recalled , “ I felt sort of drawn out into infinity , and all of a sudden I had lost touch with my mind .
I felt that I was caught up in the vastness of Creation .
… The meditation was going on all during this time , and [ the minister ] would say things about Jesus and you would have this overwhelming feeling of Jesus .
… It was like you totally penetrated what was being said and it penetrated you . ”
Based on written descriptions , questionnaires , and interviews , Pahnke assessed the extent to which the subjects and the controls had mystical experiences .
He used eight criteria : a sense of unity , a transcendence of time and space , a sense of sacredness , a sense the experience is objectively real , a deeply felt positive mood , ineffability , paradoxicality , and transience .
He also asked about lingering positive effects .
Pahnke reported that “ eight out of ten of the experimental subjects experienced at least seven out of the nine categories .
None of the control group , when each individual was compared to his matched partner , had a score which was higher . ”
In every category , the average score of the students who took psilocybin was much higher than the average score of the students who took the placebo .
A quarter century after the Good Friday Experiment , the psychedelic researcher Rick Doblin managed to get seven of the subjects and nine of the controls to fill out questionnaires again .
Their scores and the gaps between them were remarkably similar .
In the open -ended part of the questionnaire , Doblin reported , “ experimental subjects wrote that the experience helped them resolve career decisions , recognize the arbitrariness of ego boundaries , increase their depth of faith , increase their appreciation of eternal life , deepen their sense of the meaning of Christ , and heighten their sense of joy and beauty . ”
While the Good Friday Experiment was conducted in a conventional religious environment , a 2006 study by researchers at Johns Hopkins suggests the setting was not crucial .
The researchers recruited 30 subjects who had never used psychedelics but who reported “ regular participation in religious or spiritual activities . ”
The subjects were randomly chosen to receive either psilocybin or Ritalin , a stimulant with a similar duration and effect on mood .
During individual eight - hour sessions , they were encouraged to close their eyes , listen to classical music , and “ direct their attention inward . ”
At a second session two months later , the two groups were switched .
While a few of the volunteers had bad trips after taking psilocybin ( as did some of the divinity students in Pahnke ’s study ) , questionnaires the subjects filled out indicated that for most it was a very positive experience .
Six out of 10 subjects met the criteria for a “ complete mystical experience ” after taking psilocybin , compared to about one out of 10 after taking Ritalin .
Four - fifths said the psilocybin session improved their sense of well - being or life satisfaction “ moderately ” or “ very much , ” compared to one - fifth who said the same of the Ritalin session .
Two - thirds of the volunteers considered the psilocybin session among the top five most meaningful experiences of their lives , a rating less than one in 10 gave the Ritalin session .
“ The Good Friday Experiment was all people together in a recognized church service , ” notes Doblin .
“ The Johns Hopkins study is people [ using the ] same drug , but not in a religious context , in a scientific context .
And yet , my God , they ’re having these spiritual experiences on an individual basis without a leader , without a group , without a religion . ”
This is scary stuff , if you work for the Drug Enforcement Administration .
To avoid a flood of religious freedom claims from a host of do - it - yourself faiths , drug warriors have to restrict the definition of religion so it does not include this sort of spiritual exploration , and the courts are happy to help .
“ If these two cases came before the same court , I would put my money on the one that looks more like a religion , ” says Richard Glen Boire , a senior fellow at the Center for Cognitive Liberty & Ethics .
“ The religious drug cases that might [ succeed ] are those that look exactly like a [ conventional ] religion in every way , except the sacrament is not a host but is one of these psychoactives .
That ’s not the way the law is supposed to be , but that ’s the way that it is now . ” [ [ This article first appeared in the June 2007 issue of Reason Magazine ] ]
Darl McBride has the unenviable reputation as the man who tried to milk Linux .
As CEO and president of SCO Group , McBride has spent the last few years trying to collect billions in licensing fees from companies using the Linux operating system , earning the wrath of the world 's open - source geeks .
For scores of programmers , here was a lawyered - up copyright troll trying to shake down Linux – the free , open - source operating system built by idealistic hackers working for the common good .
But McBride insists he 's just misunderstood .
In 1995 , SCO ( then known as Caldera Systems ) bought the Unix operating system from Novell for $ 149 million , but who owned the copyrights was n't clear , and years of litigation ensued .
While the case ground through the courts , SCO tried to collect licensing fees from some 1,500 corporate Linux users , claiming that portions of Linux are based on Unix , and thus violated SCO 's copyrights .
But on Aug. 10th , a Utah district court judge ruled that SCO did not own Unix copyrights outright .
The ruling potentially puts SCO on the hook for $ 25 million in licensing fees to Novell – and it undermines another pending lawsuit against IBM , which claims $ 1 billion damages against Big Blue for " devaluing " Unix .
Despite the ruling , McBride says he 's not giving up .
SCO appealed the Utah decision last week .
Meanwhile , McBride has watched his Utah technology concern 's stock plummet to less than 70 cents , after rising to nearly $ 30 a share in 2000 .
In a sit - down interview with Wired News , McBride insisted investors were wrong to abandon the company after the ruling .
He explained that SCO is branching out into the mobility business with the upcoming launch of Shout Postcard – an ad- driven , mobile video service that McBride thinks will be financially " gi-normous . "
One thing is pretty likely – Linux fanatics , who hate SCO , probably wo n't line up for the service .
__Wired News : __You 're vilified in the open - source community .
__McBride : __I 've noticed .
__WN : __People are calling you a troll .
What do you say to people who say that you are an open - source terrorist ?
__McBride : __It 's the negative image our enemies have tried to create around the company and around me as an individual .
__WN : __You knew you'd be vilified ?
__McBride : __In this particular case we 're talking about , I joined the company , and we had problems with our intellectual property ....
I said we should protect our rights ....
The former CEO said , if you do that , you will be vilified by the Linux community .
The Linux community will attack you .
You will be hated .
Do n't go down that path .
Well that 's not a reason to not step up and defend your property .
That 's not a reason to stand back and say , " I 'm not going to fight . "
We got attacked , vilified and we got branded as pariahs .
When you pay 149 million dollars for a property , do you have the right to defend it or not ?
I think it 's a matter of principle .
I think anybody in their right mind who was in my position would have done the same thing if they had half a backbone .
__WN : __What does it say that your stock is under a dollar ?
__Darl McBride : __When the ruling came down from the Utah court , our stock lost 75 percent of its value .
So it obviously tells you there are a lot of people who are following this case and assigning value to what happens , to what is coming out of the court rulings .
We 're obviously very disappointed and , in fact , highly surprised at the ruling .
__WN : __A contract is a contract .
It seems phenomenal that there 's a dispute over who owns the rights to Unix , something that 's worth a lot of money .
__McBride : __That 's one of the points that we made , and that 's why we are surprised that this thing is not going in front of a jury .
We have in the asset - purchase agreement this contradictory language ....
Under " included assets " it says : " SCO hereby purchases all right , title and interest in the Unix operating system , including all versions of Unix . "
OK , that sounds pretty solid .
That sounds like you got all the rights there .
Then in the " excluded assets " it says , " excluding copyrights and patents . "
Well , that 's the thing that never made sense .
So when I first hired on ( at ) the company , we had intellectual property attorneys look at that , and they said , " This makes no sense . "
You can't buy software without the copyright .
It 's like buying a book without the words .
It does n't make any sense at all ....
Now , I 'm not an attorney .
But my understanding is that summary judgment rules say that if each side has a legitimate story , that it should go to a jury .
To me we have more than a legitimate story .
We think we have the winning story .
__WN : __And the story is …
__McBride : __We own the rights and copyrights of the Unix operating system , supported by nine witnesses .
They have one person who was n't even at the negotiating table who said , " I took the copyrights off before we closed the deal . "
__WN : __I assume you want another day in court ?
__McBride : __We 'll fight this on appeal no matter how long it takes ....
The second thing that is more problematic for Linux customers in general , not just Novell customers , is on page 66 of the opinion , the judge basically says copyrights of Unix up to 1995 are owned by Novell .
( But ) any of the copyrights developed by SCO after 1995 are owned by SCO .
The significance of that is if you go take a snapshot of code that is out there today , a substantial portion of it has been developed post - 1995 , either in terms of new code , redeveloped code , or code that did n't even exist .
__WN : __So why did investors run ?
__McBride : __Most investors have never read the opinion .
They 've read the conclusion .
If that 's all you read , you would probably run too .
Even as employees , the first hours this was out , it was amazing how big of a deal it was , how damaging it was to us .
It was n't until we stepped back a little bit and took a deep breath and said , " OK , let 's plow through this opinion , " and started looking , that we realized :
Hey , wait a second , we have non-compete ( issues ) still on the table ; we have Project Monterey still on the table against IBM ; we still have copyrights against Linux users for post - 1995 work .
WN : So how 's business been since this ruling ?
__McBride : __This has zero to do with our open - server business .
That has nothing to do with these fights .
That 's 70 percent of our revenue .
And finally , it has nothing to do with our new mobility products we are working on .
All of our product business is really unaffected by this ruling , other than the noises in our market places .
When historians finally take stock , Vermont may look like the mouse that roared – the tiny state that brought the nation 's mighty auto industry to heel by requiring cars that emit fewer greenhouse gases .
This is one scenario that could unfold following a federal judge 's ruling Wednesday , which upheld a Vermont law patterned after California 's mandate that the carbon - dioxide emissions of cars sold in the state must be slashed 30 percent by 2016 .
The judge 's finding – that federal fuel - economy laws are not in conflict with state emissions laws – is particularly significant , coming on the heels of a US Supreme Court decision in April .
That ruling found that the Environmental Protection Agency has the authority to regulate greenhouse - gas emissions , legal experts say .
On the one hand , Wednesday 's decision strengthens the hand of states that want to take action against global warming .
But in the longer term , the impact from the ruling could lead to one nationwide standard , which is already expected by many .
In addition to the 12 states with California - style laws on the books , another six are close to acting .
The ruling this week could start dominoes falling by :
• Prompting the US EPA to grant California a waiver from the Clean Air Act allowing it , along with Vermont and the 10 other states with identical laws , to begin enforcing greenhouse - gas requirements for cars sold within their borders .
• Causing six additional states – Arizona , Florida , New Mexico , Utah , Illinois , and Minnesota – to proceed with their own similar emissions requirements .
Altogether , the 18 states that have such laws – or are leaning toward them – make up about half the US auto market .
• Spurring Congress to reconsider the new fuel - efficiency standards it is currently weighing , which are not as demanding as Vermont's , and mandate a tougher federal requirement that would also reduce greenhouse - gas emissions .
• Causing federal judges in two similar cases brought by the auto industry – one in California , the other in Rhode Island – to dismiss those cases if they determine the industry has had its day in court and further proceedings would be redundant , according to environmental lawyers .
The efforts by the 12 states with laws in place could cut emissions by 100 million tons annually .
By comparison , however , US cars and light trucks emit 1.5 billion tons annually .
Still , this would be " the most significant step so far " on vehicle emissions and pave the way for broader action , says Michelle Robinson , director of the clean vehicle program at the Union of Concerned Scientists , a Washington environmental group not party to the lawsuit .
Environmental groups , who joined Vermont as defendants in the current case , have been exultant .
" This extremely important ruling makes clear that the US EPA and states acting under the Clean Air Act do have the power to set more stringent emissions limits on cars and can also regulate greenhouse gases , " says attorney Matt Pawa , who represented the Natural Resources Defense Council , the Sierra Club , and Environmental Defense .
Following the three - week trial , it was quite clear that US district judge William Sessions found less than convincing the arguments of auto - industry experts , who testified that the industry lacks the technology to make such vehicles and cannot afford to do so .
The companies , he wrote , " have not carried their burden to show that compliance with the regulation is not feasible ; nor have they demonstrated that it will limit consumer choice , create economic hardship for the automobile industry , cause significant job loss or undermine safety . "
Auto - industry officials sounded a defiant note and promised to use what influence they could to try to block the EPA waiver to California , as well as potentially launch a court appeal .
Concerning EPA 's key decision on whether to grant the waiver requested by California , Dave McCurdy , president and CEO of the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers , said in a statement that " the Alliance remains committed to working with policy makers to make certain that the EPA 's judgment is based on credible , sound scientific data as to what policies truly impact California , its citizens and global climate concerns . "
Yet some analysts see a familiar pattern being played out in which state mandates could be followed by federal requirements – which happened with the adoption of seat belts , air bags , and higher mileage standards .
" We 've got a similar dynamic here to what was happening in the 1990s with states leading with strict standards on tailpipe emissions of nitrous oxide and other pollutants – and the EPA and federal government finally following , " Ms. Robinson says .
The practical impact of the ruling could be more - efficient vehicles as soon as the 2009 model year , Mr. Pawa predicts – based on the idea that the industry could not afford to wait and see what Congress does .
But veteran auto - industry analysts are n't so sure .
" You can wish for 100 miles per gallon or 200 m.p.g. , but that does n't mean you can make it happen , " says David Cole , chairman of the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor , Mich .
Others , however , say the ruling makes such arguments moot .
" The court is looking carefully at the industry 's argument that this will bankrupt us and drive us to ruin , " says Steve Hinchman , an attorney for the Conservation Law Foundation .
" The judge found the so - called obstacles to be overstated and that the industry has the financial resources .
It 's ironic because this is a step that 's going to help the US auto industry .
They should fire their lawyers and promote their engineers . "
Sun 's homegrown operating system , Solaris , followed Darwin down the open - source path a few years ago , and since then , Apple 's demonstrated some interest in adopting some of the code from that other Unix-ish OS .
For example , Apple has already publicly announced that the performance tool dtrace will be borrowed from Solaris and make an appearance as Xray in the Xcode developer 's tools when 10.5 is released .
It has been a poorly kept secret that Solaris 's file system , ZFS , will be joining dtrace once 10.5 is released .
ZFS has a number of features that would make it quite appealing for power users , such as the ability to take advantage of new disks as they are added to the system without having to rearrange partitions or destroy data .
Our own John Siracusa also has pointed out that ZFS makes for a better fit than HFS in terms of adding slick features like Time Machine .
Still , all signs pointed to ZFS appearing as an optional file system in Leopard , much like UFS and case - sensitive HFS do now .
After all , you do n't make major changes like swapping the default file system without giving users some time to adjust .
Or do you ?
Sun 's CEO , Jonathan Schwartz , seems to be saying that Apple does .
In a presentation that was supposed to be all about the introduction of new RAID hardware by Sun , Schwartz dropped some words that are now being parsed as carefully as the Talmud .
He indicated that ZFS , the file system that enabled Sun 's hardware , would be named as " the " filesystem in Leopard at WWDC .
So , does " the " mean the primary system , or are we still back where we were prior to Schwartz pulling a premature specification , with ZFS being an option ?
There are a number of reasons to lean either way .
In the anti column , ZFS would obviate the effort Apple put into getting Time Machine to work under HFS , and it would complicate data exchange for anyone who works in an environment that uses mixed versions of the MacOS .
On the plus side , ZFS already handles metadata in a way that might allow Apple to shoehorn much of what they already use HFS for into the new file system .
Suspiciously , a project to add case - insensitivity to ZFS has recently been fast - tracked by Sun .
The opinion here at Ars is that the disruption of a new file system and the late start ZFS had in Leopard ( rumor had it that ZFS partitioning did n't even work in recent seeds ) makes the probability of it becoming the default remote .
At the same time , the added months between the planned WWDC seed and the public release at least makes the possibility plausible , if not likely .
Ars has contacted Sun to ask for clarification , but has not yet received a response .
We hope to get ahold of Schwartz before Jobs does .

A dinosaur skeleton found 24 years ago near Choteau has finally been identified as a new species that links North American dinosaurs with Asian dinosaurs .
The dinosaur would have weighed 30 to 40 pounds , walked on two feet and stood about three feet tall .
The fossil came from sediment that 's about 80 million years old .
A paper on the finding was published in September 's issue of the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology , co-author Jack Horner said Friday after returning from Mongolia where he and his crew found 80 dinosaurs in a week .
Horner is curator of paleontology at Montana State University 's Museum of the Rockies .
The paper 's lead author was Brenda Chinnery , a former postdoctoral researcher with Horner .
Horner said he found the nearly - complete skeleton in 1983 , but it was located in extremely hard rock and took a long time to prepare .
He also had to wait about two decades before he found an expert who could identify it .
That expert was Chinnery , who specializes in horned dinosaurs .
Chinnery had worked for one of Horner 's colleagues at Johns Hopkins University and then came to MSU .
She left MSU about two years ago and is now a paleontologist at the University of Texas .
" I knew it was probably a new dinosaur , but it took someone that really knew what they were doing to be able to describe it , " Horner said .
The dinosaur fossil has been stored in the Museum of the Rockies since its discovery , but it will be displayed this winter , Horner said .
The skeleton has a reddish tinge because some of the original bone was replaced by jasper .
It dates to the early part of the Late Cretaceous Period .
The dinosaur , nicknamed Cera , was named Cerasinops hodgskissi after landowner Wilson Hodgskiss .
who gave him permission to collect the skeleton for the Museum of the Rockies , Horner said .
The fossil was found about five miles south of Choteau , in a different area than the famed Egg Mountain site .
The C. hodgskissi is such a simple specimen that it's hard to describe in terms of distinguishing characteristics , Horner said .
Tests , however , showed that it represents a very primitive species that shares characteristics of Neo-ceratopsian dinosaurs in North America and Asia .
Ceratopsian dinosaurs have horns , but these do not .
Horner said he was looking at even more primitive dinosaurs on his recent trip to Mongolia .
His team collected more than 80 skeletons , with 70 of them coming from one site .
Last year , they collected 67 skeletons at the same site .
The Mongolian project is a joint research project between MSU and Mongolia 's Science and Technology University .
Cupertino , CA – If you want to see the iPhone at an Apple store , be sure to bring some cash .
Large crowds flocking to see the iPhone and next generation iPods have forced Apple to begin charging a $ 5 entrance fee for Apple stores .
Many analysts anticipated the move , and expect a positive response from customers .
" Part of the move was to limit crowds to keep the stores safe , but also we wanted to keep the right kind of people in the stores , " said vice president of retail outlets , Vince Sciopiano .
" By ' right kind of people ' I mean true Apple customers with money , willing to pay just to look at our newest wares . "
While Apple Geniuses patrol inside the store , Apple " Muscleheads " will guard the window displays and entrances .
For the $ 5 fee , customers will get an Apple button which will allow them entrance into the store and is used to track the customer 's movements .
Sciopiano noted that the $ 5 fee could be applied to purchases on that visit Related News MP3 Player Showdown : iPod Vs. Zune Success of Apple Music Store Proves Apple Users Will Overpay for Anything Next - Generation iPods Will Have No User Interface Controls Customer reaction at a pilot project at the Apple Store in Canoga Park , California was positive .

Not everyone was pleased though .
Kyle Martin said , " Five dollars to just walk into the store ?
It 's like they want to be elite snobs or something . "
When told of the criticism , Sciopiano said , " That 's exactly the case . "
Apple shares were up on the news .

Oslo has always appeared to be a model European city : shiny , happy people lapping up modern and classical art in its spick - and - span functionalist city centre , and a bounty of fjords , lakes and forests within minutes of the city centre .
Except , that is , for one major irritant : it 's also the most expensive city in the world , according to the Economist - for the second year running .
The local authorities have responded to the bombshell by launching the cheesily named , but devilishly useful Streetwise Guide ( free from the Use It offices on Møllergata 3 or free PDF download at use - it.no ) .
With over 60 pages of cheap eats , free tours , and insider tips , I was armed and curious .
Of course , you have to get there first , but this bit was easy - ish .
I picked up one of those mercurial 1p each - way Ryanair fares ( £ 20 after tax ) and pitched up in Oslo .
Or what I thought was Oslo . Oslo ( Torp ) - as the website denotes - is a bit like saying London ( Birmingham ) .
But the one - hour - and - 40 - minute bus journey to Oslo proper was a real teaser .
The bus snaked the outline of shimmering lakes , cut through pine forests and over hills before , rather abruptly , arriving in the centre of town .
Getting your natural fix in Oslo is an inexpensive piece of cake ( a sponge , perhaps ? )
Streetwise pointed me to the Vippentangen port , a 20 - minute walk south of the city centre .
From here , the number 93 commuter ferry slips out into the inner Oslo fjord , and within seconds you feel miles from anywhere .
A full circuit on the ferry takes 40 minutes , with the option of stopping off at path - lined islands smothered in lush greenery and dotted with waterfront pastel cottages .
If you 're feeling adventurous , on the island of Langoyene you can pitch a tent for free .
Best of all , ferry travel in Oslo is included within the price of a £ 5 City Pass , available at subway stations .
After my tour of the fjord , I headed over to Vigeland park in the northeast of the city , where hundreds of youngsters and families were laid out around barbecues in the sunshine .
The backdrop was dozens of Rodin - esque sculptures of couples captured in elaborate clinches by Gustav Vigeland , one of Oslo 's most celebrated artists .
The Nkr10 ( 80 p ) disposable barbecues are a national institution , as are half a dozen morr - local cured sausages - at roughly the same price .
As the sun set over the park , the crowds failed to subside ; merely switching their consumption from eating to drinking .
I realised I was witnessing another Norwegian institution - summertime alfresco vorspeil , which roughly translates as " warm - up party " ( pinched from the German word for foreplay ) and entails guzzling as many of your own beers as you can before hitting the bars , where a pint costs a spine - tingling £ 4.50 .
If you do n't fancy doing it all yourself , the Streetwise guide has an entire section dedicated to cheap eats - a godsend in a city where two courses in a mid-range downtown restaurant will set you back over £ 50 .
I opted for a curry in Grønland , Oslo 's Brick Lane , where low rents have pulled in a largely immigrant population ( mostly Pakistanis - Grønland is sometimes referred to as " Little Karachi " ) , and more recently the gifted - but - broke arterati and a proliferation of trendy bars .
The grotty weather on my last day forced me indoors , but Streetwise 's gallery tips were just as reliable .
In the space of two hours , I was in the presence of two " classics " without paying a penny .
The Nasjonalgalleriet ( Universitetsgaten 13 , nasjonalmuseet.no ) houses one of the original series of Edvard Munch 's The Scream .
At the other end of Karl Johans Gate , central Oslo 's main artery , the Astrup Fearnley Museet For Moderne Kunst ( Dronningensgate 4 , af - moma.no ) , I gazed , a little confused , upon a modern classic , Damien Hirst 's Mother and Child Divided - two cows split in half and suspended in cellulose .
So , if you arm yourself appropriately , Oslo really is n't anything to be afraid of .
The damage ?
I spent just over £ 160 all in .
Note to the Economist : put that in your equation and smoke it .

Conservatives wary of Bush's AG pick Nick Juliano
Published : Monday September 17 , 2007
Print This Email This
In selecting a former federal judge who has broken with the administration in the past as his nominee to replace Attorney General Alberto Gonzales , President Bush seems to be trying to avoid a bruising confirmation hearing with a Democratic Senate , although his choice has rankled some conservatives .
Bush announced Monday morning that he was nominating Michael Mukasey as his next pick for attorney general .
Gonzales 's last day on the job was Friday .
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid issued tempered praise of Mukasey immediately after the announcement , although he cautioned the Senate should not " rush to judgement . "
 Im glad President Bush listened to Congress and put aside his plan to replace Alberto Gonzales with another partisan Administration insider .
Judge Mukasey has strong professional credentials and a reputation for independence , " Reid ( D - NV ) said in a prepared statement .
" A man who spent 18 years on the federal bench surely understands the importance of checks and balances and knows how to say no to the President when he oversteps the Constitution . "
Mukasey ruled against the White House in the case of Jose Padilla , an American citizen who Bush declared an enemy combatant , in declaring that Padilla needed to be allowed to consult with a lawyer .
A former Justice Department official , Mukasey said the department faces " vastly different " challenges than it did when he was an assistant US attorney 35 years ago .
Mukasey also serves as a legal adviser to presidential candidate Rudy Giuliani , and he was the judge who administered Giuliani 's oath of office when he was elected New York Mayor in 1993 , according to the New York Daily News .
In accepting the nomination at the White House , Mukasey invoked the " solemn anniversary " of the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks as a reminder of the new national security environment the United States finds itself in .
" Thirty - five years ago , our foreign adversaries saw widespread devastation as a deterrent .
Today , our fanatical enemies see it as a divine fulfillment , " Mukasey said .
" But the task of helping to protect our security , which the Justice Department shares with the rest of the government , is not the only task before us .
The Justice Department must also protect ... the rights and liberties that define us as a nation . "
Mukasey has been praised prominent Democratic Sen. Charles Schumer of New York , who previously put forward Mukasey 's name as a possibility to replace Gonzales in an appearance on NBC's Meet the Press in March .
" The White House has a real chance to clear the air , to restore faith that the rule of law will come first and politics second in the Justice Department , not the other way around , if they nominate somebody who , by their reputation and career , shows that they put rule of law first , a person like a Michael Mukasey , " Schumer said .
" These are conservative Republicans , but they put the rule of law first .
And I hope that 's what the White House will do . "
Sen. Patrick Leahy , who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee , indicated that Mukasey would be confirmed , although he held out final judgement until the nominee appears for confrimation hearings .
 The next Attorney General needs to be someone who can begin the process of restoring the Department of Justice to its proper mission , " Leahy ( D - VT ) in a news release .
" I am hopeful that once we obtain the information we need and we have had the opportunity to consider the nomination , we will be able to make progress in this regard .
Although Mukasey seems likely to be confirmed by the Senate , his nomination has rankled some right - wing groups who are wary that he is not a stalwart conservative .
" His federal judicial record has been at times hostile to the issues that we care and have concern about , like abortion , " Brian Burch , president of the Catholic - based advocacy group Fidelis told the Associated Press .
Developing ...
Using virtual reality goggles to mix up the sensory signals reaching the brain , scientists have induced out - of - body - like experiences in healthy people , suggesting a scientific explanation for a phenomenon often thought to be a figment of the imagination .
The sight of their bodies located somewhere else -- thanks to the goggles -- plus the feel of their real bodies being touched simultaneously made volunteers sense that they had moved outside of their physical bodies , according to a pair of studies in the 24 August 2007 issue of the journal Science .
A disconnect between the brain circuits that process both these types of sensory information may thus be responsible for some out - of - body experiences , the researchers say .
Out - of - body experiences , which generally involve the feeling of disembodiment and seeing one ’s own body from a location outside the body , can occur in part through drug use , epileptic seizures and other types of brain disturbances .
By projecting a person ’s awareness into a virtual body , the techniques used in these studies may be useful for training people to do delicate “ teleoperating ” tasks , such as performing surgeries remotely .
The findings may also remove some of the stigma that patients with neurological disorders may feel about having these experiences , which are frequently attributed to an active imagination or some sort of paranormal phenomenon .
The studies also help solve the age - old question of how we perceive our own bodies .
“ I ’m interested in why we feel that our selves are inside our bodies -- why we have an ‘ in - body experience , ’ if you like .
This has been discussed for centuries in philosophy , but it ’s hard to tackle experimentally , ” said Science Brevium author Henrik Ehrsson of University College London , in London , and the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm .
Both Ehrsson and another research team , led by Olaf Blanke of the Ecole Polytechique Fédérale de Lausanne ( EPFL ) and the University Hospital in Geneva , Switzerland , used video cameras and virtual reality goggles to show volunteers images of their own bodies from the perspective of someone behind them .
The researchers also touched the volunteers ’ bodies , both physically and virtually .
The volunteers in Ehrsson ’s study viewed images recorded by the cameras through their headsets .
In Blanke and colleagues ’ study , the video was converted into holograph - like computer simulations .
Ehrsson had the volunteers watch a plastic rod moving toward a location just below the cameras while their real chests were simultaneously touched in the corresponding spot .
Questionnaire responses afterwards indicated that the volunteers felt they were located back where the cameras were placed , watching a dummy or a body that belonged to someone else .
“ This experiment suggests that the first - person visual perspective is critically important for the in - body experience .
In other words , we feel that our self is located where the eyes are , ” Ehrsson said .
Ehrsson also had the volunteers watch a hammer swing down to a point below the camera , as though it were going to “ hurt ” an unseen portion of the virtual body .
Measurements of skin conductance , which reflects emotional responses such as fear , indicated that the volunteers sensed their “ selves ” had left their physical bodies and moved to the virtual bodies .
Blanke ’s team used a similar setup to create out - of - body - like experiences ( which they cautioned lacked some aspects of full - blown out - of - body experiences ) .
After the virtual reality exercise , a researcher would blindfold the volunteers and guide them backward .
When the volunteers were asked to return to their original position , they tended to drift toward where they had seen their virtual bodies standing .
Both studies conclude that “ multisensory conflict ” is a key mechanism underlying out - of - body experiences .
“ Brain dysfunctions that interfere with interpreting sensory signals may be responsible for some clinical cases of out - of - body experiences , ” Ehrsson said .
“ Though , whether all out - of - body experiences arise from the same causes is still an open question . ”
Bodily self - consciousness may also involve a cognitive dimension – the ability to distinguish between one ’s own body and other objects – in addition to sensory signals , Blanke and his coauthors propose .
Supporting this idea , Blanke ’s team reports that when the volunteers viewed a human - sized block instead of an image of a human body , they successfully returned to their original standing place , indicating that no out - of - body - like illusion had occurred .
“ Full - body consciousness seems to require not just the ‘ bottom up ’ process of correlating sensory information but also the ‘ top down ’ knowledge about human bodies , ” Blanke said .
Some of the out - of - body experiences that have previously eluded scientific explanation may be related to distorted “ full - body perception , ” according to Blanke .
Virtual reality systems may provide further answers .
“ We have decades of intense research on visual perception , but not very much yet on body perception .
But that may change , now virtual reality offers a way to manipulate full body perception more systematically and probe out - of - body experiences and bodily self consciousness in a new way , ” Blanke said .

Chemists have developed a spray that can instantly identify bomb - makers .
The main ingredient turns red when it comes in contact with a common improvised explosive .
Soldiers or police can wipe the skin of a terrorism suspect with a sterile cloth ; wet it with the detector chemical ; then watch for a blood - like hue .
Urea nitrate is an easy - to - make explosive that has claimed over one hundred lives during terrorist attacks in Israel .
Noah Shachtman recently mentioned that he saw the nefarious substance in an Iraqi - made IED .
In a recent post at Danger Room , he said , " To get ahead of insurgents , coalition forces have to figure out who 's really building and planting the bombs . "
For these reasons , a quick and dirty way to catch terrorists red - handed will be tremendously useful .
In the September issue of the Journal of Forensic Sciences , Joseph Almog and his team at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem explained how their bomb - detecting chemical works .
Trained in organic chemistry , Almog has a long history of inventing color - changing test fluids for law - enforcement .
The former brigadier general assisted Shmuel Kraus and Baruch Glattstein with the development of Ferrotrace , a chemical that turns dark - violet when sprayed on hands that have recently held a pistol or grenade .
He has also invented an agent that reveals hidden fingerprints and a kit that can identify a wide variety of explosives .
In order to improve upon their newest product , Almog and his team needed to understand exactly how it changes color .
To do that , they took a picture of the indicator chemical as it interacted with urea nitrate .
Creating a picture of individual molecules is not easy .
The researchers grew crystals from the red dye and then carefully inserted one of them into an x-ray diffraction machine ( not the same as a medical x- ray ) .
This created a blurry , 3 - D image that the scientists sharpened by using a sophisticated computer program as a sort - of digital lens – bringing it into focus .
With this new insight , and a forensic chemistry program founded by Almog , the Hebrew University may be a wellspring of bomb - detection technology for years to come .

Why Do Retirees Buy Such Big Houses , and Other Riddles From The Economic Naturalist
The Cornell economics professor Robert Frank ( not to be confused with the excellent Wall Street Journal writer Robert Frank , or the great photographer Robert Frank ) begins a semester by asking his students to ask and answer a real - world economics question in 500 words or less .
He has now compiled these essays in a book called The Economic Naturalist .
It is a great deal of fun , and interesting .
Below are some excerpts , including the illustrations by Mick Stevens .
If you ’re wondering what Frank ’s students get out of the book — besides , presumably , a good grade — you should know that Frank credits each student and is donating half the book ’s royalties to the John S. Knight Institute for Writing in the Disciplines at Cornell .
Why do people buy bigger houses when they retire and their children are gone ?
A plausible conjecture is that a large house close to grown children ’s homes may lure the grandchildren to visit more often .
With divorce and remarriage more common than in decades past , many children today have six or more grandparents , if the parents of stepparents are included .
The demand for visits with grandchildren has thus increased , but the supply of visits has not .

To deter theft , owners of restaurants and other retail establishments require cashiers to reconcile the total amount of cash collected during their shift with the total volume of sales rung up at their register …
One way cashiers can circumvent this control is by neglecting to ring up a proportion of their transactions …
Thus if a cashier failed to ring up a customer ’s $ 20 meal , he or she could pocket the $ 20 without creating an accounting discrepancy …
By offering a complimentary meal to anyone who fails to receive a receipt , owners provide an economic incentive for customers to monitor cashiers for free .
Why does milk come in rectangular containers , while soft drinks come in round cans ?
One possibility is that because soft drinks are often consumed directly from the container , the extra cost of storing cylindrical containers is justified because they fit more comfortably in the hand …
But even if most people drank milk straight from the carton , the cost - benefit principle suggests that it would be unlikely to be sold in cylindrical containers …
Most soft drinks in supermarkets are stored in open shelves , which are cheap to buy and have no operating costs .
Milk is exclusively stored in refrigerated cabinets , which are both expensive to purchase and costly to operate .
Why does Apple charge $ 150 more for black laptops than for equally - configured white ones ?
Apple ’s pricing decision was no doubt influenced by its experience after introducing a black version of its popular iPod in the fall of 2005 .
Although it was priced the same as the company ’s traditional white iPod and technically identical to it , demand for black units quickly depleted the company ’s inventories , even as white ones remained in stock .
Because the black version was new , it stood out , causing many more buyers to order it …
By the time it introduced its new MacBook models in the spring of 2006 … it charged more for the black machines simply because it could .
Why are gas tanks built into different sides of cars ?
In the United States and other countries in which motorists drive on the right side of the road , it is easier to turn right than to turn left …
A majority of drivers will thus buy gas at stations they can enter by turning right .
Suppose gas tanks were always on the driver ’s side …
During crowded hours , all spots on the right sides of pumps would be filled even while most spots on the left … remained empty .

Enthusiasts for the catastrophe that is the Iraq war may be hard to come by these days , but Afghanistan is another matter .
The invasion and occupation that opened George Bush 's war on terror are still championed by powerful voices in the occupying states as - in the words of the New York Times this week - " the good war " that can still be won .
While speculation intensifies about British withdrawal from Basra , there 's no such talk about a retreat from Kabul or Kandahar .
On the contrary , the plan is to increase British troop numbers from the current 7,000 , and ministers , commanders and officials have been hammering home the message all summer that Britain is in Afghanistan , as the foreign secretary , David Miliband , insisted , for the long haul .
" We should be thinking in terms of decades , " the British ambassador , Sir Sherard Cowper - Coles , declared ; Brigadier John Lorimer , British commander in Helmand province , thought the military occupation might last more than Northern Ireland 's 38 years ; and the defence secretary , Des Browne , last week confirmed that the government had made a " long - term commitment " to stay in Afghanistan to prevent it reverting to a terrorist training ground .
Even allowing for the Brown government 's need for political cover if it is indeed to run down its forces in Iraq , that all amounts to a pretty clear policy of indefinite occupation - one on which it has not thought necessary to consult the British people , let alone the Afghans .
All this follows the escalation of Britain 's involvement in Afghanistan last year , when Browne 's predecessor , John Reid , sent thousands of extra troops to the south to " help reconstruction " , hoping they would be a able to leave " without firing a single shot " .
Two million rounds of ammunition later , what was supposed to be a peacekeeping mission is now an all - out war against a resurgent Taliban that has become an umbrella for Pashtun nationalists , jihadists and all those determined to fight foreign occupation .
British casualties have risen sharply - seven have been killed in the past month - along with those of other western forces , while the public at home is increasingly fed a media diet of Kiplingesque deeds of derring - do by " our boys " on the front line .
And in a telling echo of the claims that have punctuated each phase of the Iraq disaster , Browne last week said he detected a " turning point " in the British campaign to " bring stability " to Afghanistan .
For Afghans , six years after they were supposed to have been liberated , life is getting worse .
As the International Committee of the Red Cross reported two months ago , the humanitarian situation is deteriorating and civilians are suffering " horribly " from growing insecurity and violence in an increasingly dirty war .
The fighting in the south has driven 80,000 from their homes , and the civilian casualty rate has doubled over the past year : more than 200 were killed by US and other Nato troops in June alone - far more than are estimated to have been killed in Taliban attacks .
The savagery of indiscriminate US aerial bombardments provoked violent demonstrations and is widely seen as having increased support for the Taliban 's armed campaign .
Given the manifest failure of the occupation to bring either peace or development to Afghanistan , it 's not immediately obvious why it 's still considered by some to be a good war - though a majority of Britons , Canadians , Italians and Germans , it should be said , want their troops withdrawn .
Partly it must be the fact that the original invasion was launched in response to the 9/11 attacks - which turned out to have been at least partly coordinated from al - Qaida 's Afghan camps - and had some measure of UN acquiescence ( even if the relevant resolutions did n't actually mention Afghanistan ) .
Added to that is the oppressive and obscurantist record of the Taliban regime and the elite fear that military failure will fatally undermine the projection of western power in future .
But by intervening on one side of an ethnically charged civil war to overthrow the Taliban - rather than , say , targeting special forces against al - Qaida - the US and its allies ended up exchanging warlords for theocrats and turning most of the country into a collection of lawless and brutal fiefdoms .
Instead of al - Qaida terror networks being rooted out , they were allowed to migrate to the borderlands , Pakistan and Iraq ; Osama bin Laden , whose capture was the first aim of the war , escaped ; and the limited expansion of women's and girls ' freedoms in Kabul and a few other urban areas was offset by an eruption of rape and violence against women .
Western politicians like to describe the Afghan government as democratically elected , when in fact the elections were marked by large - scale fraud and intimidation in polls that gave regional warlords pride of place , while political parties were not allowed to take part .
In real life , occupied Afghanistan is , as the UN warned last year , a failed state , which now produces 90 % of the world 's opium and where corruption and insecurity have sunk reconstruction .
Of course there was a time , in the 1970s and 1980s , when girls were encouraged to go to school and university in Afghanistan , women accounted for almost half the country 's teachers and civil servants and the government redistributed land to the rural poor .
But the US spent billions of dollars to destroy it in a cold war coup de grace and laid the foundations for the jihadist Frankenstein of al - Qaida in the process .
Gordon Brown now claims Afghanistan is " the frontline against terrorism " .
In reality , the key to the al - Qaida threat lies in Pakistan and Saudi Arabia and the dictatorial regimes the west sponsors there , while its support is fuelled by the occupations of Iraq , Afghanistan and the Palestinian territories .
Britain is now fighting its fourth war in Afghanistan in 170 years , and might have learned by now that you cannot impose a government from outside against a people 's will .
Earlier this summer the Afghan senate called for a date to be set for the withdrawal of foreign troops and negotiations with the Taliban , as did the Pakistani foreign minister , Khurshid Kasuri , this month .
There will be no peace or stability in Afghanistan while foreign troops remain , and a wider settlement will surely have to include the Taliban and regional powers such as Iran and Pakistan .
Unfortunately , politics dictates that a great deal more blood is likely to be shed on both sides before that comes to be accepted .

Seven men claiming to be wine - growers issued the demand
Video threat clip
The group 's name is the Crav , which stands for nothing more threatening than the Union for Viticultural Action in the Languedoc region in the south .
The Crav 's deadline to the government runs out this weekend , which marks exactly 100 years since wine - makers in the region led their last revolt .
That ended with the French army shooting dead six demonstrators .
No wine - maker will publicly admit to being part of Crav but many sympathise with their demands , if not with their methods .
Driven to despair
Trimming the vines in the 17 hectares of vineyard which used to support his family , wine - grower Francois Thiebaud is in despair because of plummeting wine prices .
Some [ growers ] have even killed themselves because they could n't feed their families on the money they earn
Francois Thiebaud
Languedoc wine - grower
He says that he and many other wine - makers in this region are now fighting for survival :
" We 're working at a loss , " he tells me .
" We 've lost between 40 and 50 % of our income because of falling prices and the big cut taken by the middle - men .
" I can only afford to carry on working in the vineyards because my wife has another job .
" And some wine - makers have to claim social security benefits , because they earn so little that they can't feed their families .
" Some have even killed themselves because they could n't feed their families on the money they earn . "
Such frustration has now boiled over into the threats of violence by the Crav , made in a video message sent to France 's new President , Nicolas Sarkozy .
Shots fired
In the video - shot in a secret location late at night - seven wine - makers , their faces hidden by black balaclavas , read out the spine - chilling warning that " blood will flow " if Nicolas Sarkozy does not act fast to raise the price of wine .
Foreign wine has been targeted in attacks by Crav
The group has proved that it is prepared to use violence to achieve its aims .
Already , several local supermarkets selling foreign wines have been attacked with small explosive devices , with others graffitied with the Crav 's initials .
The group has also shot at and hijacked at least one lorry containing wine from abroad - and the fear is that the attacks could escalate unless the government responds to the group 's demands , which it so far has not .
Jean - Francois Picquemal runs one of the supermarkets that was graffitied , even though he says it only sells wine from the area .
" There 've been similar attacks throughout the region , and this was one of the nicer ones , " he says .
" I think the wine - makers are upset with the middle - men who do n't pay them enough for their wine .
" But at least this was only graffiti - it was n't too bad .
I think all this might get worse .
" I know a lot of wine makers , I 'm from this region , and it's a very difficult situation for them . "
The new ' Resistance '
France 3 television journalist Emilien Jubineau was taken in the darkest hours of the night to a remote location to witness the Crav 's threatening video message being made .
France 's famed wine industry is feeling pressure from foreign producers
He believes the group is in deadly earnest .
" It 's not that they 're necessarily dangerous people but these wine makers are extremely angry - they 're desperate , " he believes .
" The Crav may have done things that people might condemn but they 've been very careful not to injure anyone so far .
" Their attacks have sent a very strong signal : what they want is for the government to talk to them about a real solution . "
Sympathy with the cause
The solution Brussels has put forward is for producers to grub up 200,000 hectares of wine - much of it in the Languedoc - because the region is producing much more wine than it can sell in a fiercely competitive global market .
Wine - makers in the region are not being heard so they feel they have to speak louder
Jean - Marc Ribet
quality wine - producer
But the Crav say they will fight that idea every step of the way - just as the French Resistance in the south once fought the Nazis .
And even wine - makers not involved with the group say they share many of its frustrations , even if they do not agree with the threat of violence .
Jean - Marc Ribet of Chateau de la Vernede , which produces high - quality wine mainly for the export market , says supermarkets and restaurants are making huge profits at wine - producers ' expense , often buying wine at one euro ( £ 0.67 ; $ 1.33 ) a litre and selling it on for 15 euros a litre .
" Normally , the Crav would not exist if people were being heard , but wine - makers in the region are not being heard so they feel they have to speak louder so that the government listens . "
Tony Blair rails against the shameless parading of the 15 captured Brits with his usual vigor , but what really takes the air out of his rhetoric is the alacrity with which the detainees have turned against their own government .
Itâ€™s been less than a full week since they were taken into custody , and already the woman , Faye Turney , has written three letters , two of them overtly critical of the British government and its foreign policy .
Both Ms. Turney and Nathan Summers have gone on television , admitted to being in Iranian waters when apprehended , and apologized profusely to the Iranian people .
They donâ€™t appear to have been coerced , although , of course , their very presence in Iran is hardly voluntary : no doubt theyâ€™ll be judged victims of the “ Stockholm syndrome ” upon their return .
Blair avers that the Iranians “ arenâ€™t fooling anyone ” with this exhibition of prisoners , and their clearly staged “ confessions , ” and yet one has to wonder why these frontline sailors turned so quickly .
Itâ€™s embarrassing .
No signs of torture , no glassy - eyed stare , no Morse code eyebrow movements signifying extreme distress , all perfectly calm and even natural :
“ I ask the representatives of the House of Commons , after the government have promised that this type of incident would not happen again , why have they let this occur , and why has the government not been questioned over this ?
Is n’t it time for us to start withdrawing our forces from Iraq and let them determine their own future ? ”
That doesnâ€™t sound at all like the stilted propaganda spiels coerced out of prisoners during , say , the Vietnam war .
It sounds like an ordinary disgusted British citizen who blames her own government , rather than her captors , for her present predicament .
“ Why has the government not been questioned over this ? ” — indeed .
In yet another letter recently released , Ms. Turney declared : “ I ’m writing to you as a British serviceperson who has been sent to Iraq , sacrificed due to the intervening policies of the Bush and Blair government . ”
The accusatory nationalist undertone , implying not too subtly that Blair is Bushâ€™s poodle , is unmistakable and , under the circumstances , astonishing .
Next we hear of Ms. Turney , sheâ€™ll be running for Parliament alongside George Galloway on the “ Respect ” ticket , and booked solid for a speaking tour of America .
I donâ€™t mean to be disdainful of either of these two , whose predicament I can only imagine , but I think their behavior says something about the tenuous hold the official ideology has over our own centurions .
One has to assume that the views of this bunch are , while expressed under duress , at least to some extent , a ) sincere — how else to explain Ms. Turney ’s eloquence ? — and , b ) fairly representative .
If so , one has to wonder how long before their loyalty to the War Party is exhausted .
The “ coalition ” hasnâ€™t even attacked Iran yet , and already the troops are rebelling .
Can we look forward to a full - scale mutiny if and when it comes to war ?

I doubt I will ever forget the moment when I saw the White House destroyed by aliens .
Though it was more than a decade ago , the images remain fixed in my mind : the enormous spaceship hanging silently in the air , the blue - green ray shining straight down from its center , and one of our great national monuments flying apart in millions of tiny bits .
Maybe you saw it , too — in the 1996 movie Independence Day .
And like me , you probably have not the slightest confusion over whether this event actually happened .
With today ’s technology , seeing is not believing any more .
At the movies we regularly invert the beatitude of John 20:29 : Blessed are those who can see the most amazing things in the most exquisite detail and still not believe them after they leave the theater .
Another fake image I will never forget appeared on the website of California congressional candidate Howard Kaloogian in March 2006 .
It is a photo of a peaceful and ordinary urban street scene , which Kaloogian claimed to have taken during a recent trip to Iraq .
The photo was captioned “ Downtown Baghdad ” and was presented as evidence that Iraq was actually much calmer and safer than mainstream American news coverage made it seem .
A blogger on the liberal web site Daily Kos raised doubts that the photo was really of Baghdad , but the Kos community quickly realized that there was only one way to make that case convincing :
They had to find the place where the picture was really taken .
With many eyeballs staring at the photo , many bloggers trading clues , and Google ’s ability to search for images , they had their answer by the next morning :
The scene was from a suburb of Istanbul , Turkey .
A tourist photo from wowturkey .com showed the same buildings with the same billboards — and the sign over a public transit station .
Kaloogian , who said using the photo was a “ stupid mistake , ” lost the Republican primary .
This story points to another way that technology has changed life in the twenty - first century :
The Internet allows many amateurs to pool their efforts and produce results that rival ( and sometimes surpass ) what a professional organization can achieve .
Wikipedia and the Linux operating system are the most famous such efforts , but there are many others — some ongoing projects with organization charts and other collaborations as ad hoc as the people who came together to investigate the Kaloogian photo .
My college roommate recently told me about his participation in Project Gutenberg , which is making books available on the Internet after the copyrights expire .
The process begins by scanning a book page - by - page and running the images through an optical character recognition ( OCR ) program .
But OCR is still not accurate enough to produce a consistently high - quality text , so human proofreaders are needed .
In the twentieth century that proofreading would have been a full - time job for an entire bureau , and since there is no money to pay them the whole idea would have run aground right there .
Instead , countless volunteers download single pages from the Internet , proofread them , and upload them back to the Gutenberg site .
After you get up to speed , you can proofread a page anytime you have ten minutes free .
Even if that ’s all you do , your tiny contribution will combine with the tiny contributions of others to produce something of real value .
It would be fun to speculate about how such projects may change the world , but I wonder how participating in such projects will change us .
A new medium makes new experiences possible , and new experiences can change people and societies profoundly .
Look what happened with the printing press .
Before Gutenberg invented movable type in the 1450s , proclamations were read to you on the public square .
Sermons were preached at you in church .
But when you could hold competing pamphlets in your own hands and read them by candlelight at your own table , you became the judge and overseer of the debate .
What voice you heard next was up to you , and if you needed to hear a point repeated , you read it again .
The printing press gave any literate person the direct experience of being the sovereign of his or her own mind .
Whatever opinions people read and considered , the simple experience of reading them plowed the ground for those who would preach individual liberty in both politics and religion .
Printing presses did not overthrow kings and disestablish bishops by themselves , but they tilted the playing field in that direction .
Television tilted it a different way .
After the yes / no decision to watch , a TV viewer is passive .
Rather than experiences of mastery , TV offers us vicarious relationships .
Larger - than - life celebrities come into our living rooms , and it is hard to shake the illusion that we know them personally .
In so many ways , they seem closer to us than our co-workers , our parishioners , and perhaps even our friends and families .
Television has made our leaders so familiar that we now judge politicians less by their policies and skills than by how it will feel to have them in our homes .
In the Age of Television , picking a president is like picking a housemate .
Liberal religion in the West was born with the printing press and has not fared well in the Age of Television .
Unitarian Universalist congregations have almost the same number of members now that they had collectively after the Unitarian and Universalist denominations merged in 1961 — and that makes us a relative success story .
Membership in most mainline Protestant denominations peaked sometime in the 1960s and has fallen considerably since then .
In both numbers and influence , liberal religion in America is a shadow of its former self .
So what should we expect from the Age of the Internet ?
Are the experiences the Internet creates better suited to liberal religion than the vicarious relationships of television ?
I think they are .
The simplest thing to predict is that the Internet will end the passivity , apathy , and sense of helplessness that is so typical of the TV era .
In some ways we are already seeing a change :
The number of people contributing to political campaigns , for example , is way up .
Rather than shrugging helplessly at the ability of the rich to buy political representation , more and more individuals are balancing that power with smaller contributions of their own .
It ’s not hard to imagine why .
The Internet has given many people ( like my proofreading friend ) the direct experience described in hymn # 157 of Singing the Living Tradition :
And by union , what we will
Can be accomplished still ;
Drops of water turn a mill ,
Singly none , singly none .
Participation will likely increase across the board , because on the Internet even the smallest participation has an effect .
When you talk back to your television no one hears .
But when you comment on a blog , people respond .
Your questions get answered — maybe by the individual blogger , but more likely by the larger commenting community .
You are given references , reminded of similar incidents to the one under discussion , linked to background articles .
Your arguments get challenged , refuted , and then maybe picked up and fixed by someone else .
Even if you do n’t have an airtight case , even if you have n’t checked all the details , your point may be worth making .
Someone else may take the baton from you and carry it a little farther .
And then someone else and someone else .
Drops of water turn a mill .
My fonder hope for the Internet is that it will do for religion what the printing press did for science .
Publication meant that the process of science — its experiments and its data — could become public , and not just its conclusions .
The scientific community moved beyond the individual gentleman in his laboratory and became a truly communal intelligence .
It was fine if no individual understood everything ; no one had to .
The scientific community as a whole understood .
To my knowledge , no religious Internet community has yet achieved the critical mass necessary to make a similar leap .
But the larger political blogs are beginning to .
You can spend a great deal of time on either a liberal blog like Daily Kos or a conservative one like Redstate without realizing who the original blogger is .
The commenting community is the star , not the founder .
In the Television Age , politics is dominated by ideology .
Small packages of ideas come down from on high and are endlessly repeated in sound bites .
But while the political blogs certainly have their share of ideology and repetition , something else is happening too : Ideologies are being tested against the everyday experiences of thousands , and a new kind of understanding is emerging from below .
Where this understanding will take us , I can not guess .
Eventually , I hope to see something similar happen in religion .
Theologies will not come down from the academy or the pulpit , but will bubble up from countless ordinary people comparing notes on their personal experiences and their efforts to live the best lives they can .
Imagine the base communities of liberation theology or the covenant groups of small group ministry enlarged and multiplied by a thousand .
What might they create ?
The spiritual understanding that emerges will be too large to fit into any individual human mind .
As in science , you will be able to master any segment of it you like , but the whole will always be too much for you .
And like science , it will not be a set of disembodied abstractions , but rather work its insights all the way down into the nitty - gritty of everyday life .
In a world where seeing is not believing , and the individual is ever more easily fooled , the emergence of such trusted theological communities can hardly happen fast enough .

A University of Tennessee student is attempting to quash an RIAA subpoena issued as part of the music industry 's war against on - campus file - sharing .
Doe # 28 is taking a different tack than other defendants have , arguing that providing the information sought by the RIAA would violate his right to privacy under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act .
So far , Virgin Records America v. Does 1-33 has followed the same route as most of the other John Doe cases filed by the RIAA .
The judge presiding over the case has followed the example of the vast majority of the other 25,000 + file - sharing cases , approving the RIAA 's request for ex parte discovery ( discovery done without the knowledge of the other party ) .
Under the judge 's order , Does 1- 33 have 15 days from the time they are served with the subpoena and judge 's order to file an objection , and so far Doe # 28 appears to be the only defendant fighting the subpoena , according to the Knoxville News .
An examination of the case history on the US Party / Case Index shows that three of the other Does have been dropped from the case , an indication that the RIAA has the information it needs to file new lawsuits against named individuals .
Doe # 28 's argument is that the information sought by the RIAA — name , current and permanent addresses , phone numbers , e-mail addresses , and MAC address — is part of his educational records .
Since neither Doe # 28 nor his parents have waived that right , the RIAA should not be given the information , argues the defendant 's motion to quash the subpoena .
At most , the plaintiffs should be provided with Doe 's name and current address , according to Doe # 28 .
Providing more information would put the defendant and his parents in the position of " being subjected to unwarranted telephone calls and unsolicited mail , which is unreasonable . "
No one likes getting unwarranted phone calls and unsolicited mail , but a desire to avoid letters and phone calls is rarely sufficient grounds to quash a subpoena .
Invoking the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act is unlikely to help either .
Although schools must have written permission from students or their parents to release education records , there are a handful of exceptions , one of which is " to comply with a judicial order or lawfully issued subpoena . "
Although it looks as though the RIAA is likely to get the information it seeks from the University of Tennessee , its legal fight against on - campus file - sharing has not gone so smoothly .
A federal judge in Virginia blocked the RIAA 's attempts to conduct ex parte discovery in a lawsuit against seven William & Mary students , while another judge in New Mexico gave 16 University of New Mexico students a chance to respond to the John Doe lawsuit filed against them .
Here 's the situation : Harriet Miers has bugged out on her subpoena and will refuse , at the president 's order , to even appear before the House Judiciary Committee as required tomorrow .
The response from Conyers and subcommittee chair Linda Sanchez :
A refusal to appear before the Subcommittee tomorrow could subject Ms. Miers to contempt proceedings , including but not limited to proceedings under 2 U.S.C. § 194 and under the inherent contempt authority of the House of Representatives .
Good to see inherent contempt being contemplated .
To this point , it has been a mystery whether the relevant authorities at the committees have been aware of that option .
We 've always assumed they were at least aware , but they 've played their cards close enough to the vest that nobody was ever 100 % sure .
Well , now we know .
And we probably owe a debt of gratitude for it to Congressman Brad Miller , for passing on to Rep .
Sanchez his discoveries about and knowledge of the precedents for inherent contempt back in March , after encountering his own difficulties with " administration " stonewalling of his investigative subcommittee of the Science and Technology panel .
Our previous discussions of contempt of Congress procedures have allowed us to hash out the shortcomings of statutory contempt and the high - stakes game of inherent contempt .
Chief among the statutory procedure 's shortcomings : it depends for its enforcement on the non-partisan cooperation of the U.S. Attorney .
And if we were guaranteed that , we would n't be here subpoenaing everybody , now would we ?
Now , in light of the Scooter Libby pardon ( and that 's what it is , or at least what it will be ) , we have to consider another possible shortcoming : that statutory contempt of Congress may be pardonable by the president .
There was a time , of course , where such a pardon would have been considered so outrageous , and so utterly beyond the pale , that raising the concern would have gotten you laughed off The Hill .
But no longer .
After all , we just saw Bush issue exactly the type of pardon that James Madison himself once said :
[ I ] f the President be connected , in any suspicious manner , with any person , and there be grounds [ to ] believe he will shelter him , the House of Representatives can impeach him ; they can remove him if found guilty ...
That , in turn , has led many to wonder whether inherent contempt is pardonable .
The answer is : I do n't know .
But here 's my thinking on it .
The presidential pardon power extends to all " offences against the United States . "
I do n't know what you 'd call inherent contempt , but if there 's any argument to be made that it is n't a federal crime , you might have an argument that the presidential pardon power is ineffective against it .
The Congressional Research Service says ( PDF ) the purpose of the imprisonment ( or other sanction ) under inherent contempt may be either punitive or coercive -- i.e , a non-compliant witness can be sentenced to a specific term as punishment for non-compliance , or he may be held indefinitely ( or at least until the adjournment sine die of the house that sentences him ) in order to coerce compliance .
That sets up a rough parallel to ordinary , judicial contempt of court sentences .
There 's criminal contempt , which is a specific punishment for bad behavior , and there 's civil contempt , which is designed to enforce compliance with specific court orders .
Criminal contempt carries a sentence for a set term , but civil contempt can be indefinite , and lasts until the contemnor agrees to comply with the judicial order in question .
If you draw a parallel between the two types of judicially ordered contempt of court and the two different reasons and sentences that can be passed under inherent contempt of Congress , it becomes pretty easy to argue that someone sentenced under inherent contempt and imprisoned in order to coerce compliance is being held on charges analogous to a civil charge -- and therefore arguably not subject to pardon .
State lawmakers across the country are adopting broad changes to criminal justice procedures as a response to the exoneration of more than 200 convicts through the use of DNA evidence .
All but eight states now give inmates varying degrees of access to DNA evidence that might not have been available at the time of their convictions .
Many states are also overhauling the way witnesses identify suspects , crime labs handle evidence and informants are used .
At least six states have created commissions to expedite cases of those wrongfully convicted or to consider changes to criminal justice procedures .
One of them , the California Commission on the Fair Administration of Justice , will hold a hearing this month on remedies for people who have been wrongfully convicted .
Laws in several states , including Illinois , New Jersey and North Carolina , have bipartisan backing , with many Democrats supportive on civil rights grounds and Republicans generally hoping that tighter procedures will lead to fewer challenges of convictions .
Ed shows how to stretch your paycheck by negotiating better deals for goods and services .
As featured in Smart Money magazine and on Fox News .
The typical American consumer has been reluctant to challenge that retail icon , the list price .
When I urge participants in my Negotiation Boot Camp® seminars to bargain for goods and services , you 'd think I was asking them to commit a felony .
" You ca n't negotiate set prices . "
" People will think I 'm cheap . "
" That 's not ethical . "
While it is acceptable to haggle with car dealers , the prevailing wisdom is that the same approach will not work in a department store or with your accountant .
In fact , a certain car manufacturer has advertised that they have only one price so you wo n't have to be bothered with the unpleasant task of negotiating .
Is n't that thoughtful of them ?
Well , guess what , now that the economy has gone south on us , these rigid attitudes about wheeling and dealing are loosening up .
The notion that you can stretch your paycheck by negotiating better purchases is enjoying wider acceptance .
My suggestions for making deals were featured recently in Smart Money magazine , and Fox News followed me around with hidden cameras for an entire day as I bargained for consumer products , furniture , hotel rooms , and clothing .
The following tips sum up my approach to getting the best deal for your money :
1 . Before you negotiate , do your homework .
Read up on the dealer 's cost for the car you want to buy .
Comparison shop to see what different stores are asking for the same piece of furniture or for similar items .
Ask your friends what their dentist charges for a porcelain crown .
Do research to determine which products are hot and which are not ; the best deals can be made on those that are less in demand .
2 . Lower the seller 's expectations by asking for concessions .
The only way to get a better deal is to ask for one .
Challenge everything they say .
The more assertive you are in pursuing a better deal , the more they will be inclined to cave in and offer concessions .
Remember that the seller is under pressure to make the sale .
Especially in a down economy , sellers are desperate to find new business .
In many stores , the salespeople are actually instructed to give a discount if the customer merely asks for one .
3 . Try the Flinch .
" What !
You want how much for that refrigerator ?
Are you crazy ? "
Flinching is a good way to find out if the seller 's expectations are low .
It may turn out that the salesperson shares your view that the price is excessive .
When you flinch , he may respond with a discount .
4. Tell a Sob Story .
" I like your sofa , but I do n't have enough money in my budget .
I did n't plan to spend so much . "
This is not a lie .
You have a right to set your own budget .
It is the seller 's choice either to meet that budget or to test your resolve by holding firm on price .
The Sob Story is your way of testing how much they want to make a sale .
5. Execute the Squeeze .
" I like your hotel , but I can get a better room rate elsewhere . "
This is also called the power of competition .
Many sellers will do somersaults in order to match or beat competitive offers .
Simply mentioning the competition will often lower the seller 's expectations .
6. Nibble a little .
" If I buy this dress , will you throw in a pair of shoes ? "
The seller may not be able to discount the dress , but they can sweeten the deal by throwing in other items for free or at a reduced cost .
7 . Buy in quantity .
" What discount will you give me if I buy three suits instead of just one ? "
Most sellers are accustomed to giving quantity discounts .
If you can , get your friend to buy a couple of suits at the same time .
8 . Do n't limit your bargaining to price .
Deals can also be made for non-price items such as better terms ( a discount for paying cash ; postponed billing ) , waiving the delivery charge , and warranty ( including the extended warranty in the purchase price ) .
9 . Be patient and persistent .
If they say no , do n't give up .
Sometimes the best deal will come only after you have devoted some time to the quest , which convinces the buyer that you are serious .
A friend of mine spends four hours or more when he buys a new car .
He wears them down .
10 .
Be prepared to walk away .
I call this Brodow 's Law : Your willingness to walk out and either buy somewhere else or buy an alternative product is your greatest asset in any bargaining situation .
You must behave as though you do n't need to buy it .
Many great deals occur when you return the second or third time .
11 . Wait for the seller 's big sale or slow season .
Many clothing , appliance , and furniture stores substantially slash prices at least once a year , usually after January 1 .
When buying a car , consider visiting the dealer on a rainy day at the end of the month .
Or buy at the end of the model year , after next year 's models have been introduced .
12 . Ask for their advice .
If you politely ask the salesperson for suggestions on how you can do better , she may surprise you with ideas you never thought of , such as how the store has given concessions in the past , or the dates of an upcoming sale .
Even if she does n't have the authority to deal , her ideas can help you to bargain with the manager .
13 . Go to a higher level .
If the salesperson can't or wo n't give you the deal you want , ask to see the manager or owner .
Higher ups are more likely to bargain because they have more authority , they do n't have time to haggle , and they are more inclined to look at big picture issues such as customer good will and , " How many of these items do we need to move ? "
Also , the amount of your requested discount may seem less significant to a manager , who is looking at overall sales figures , than to the salesperson , who is focused on her commission .
14 . Find a way for the seller to save face .
They may be reluctant to give you a discount because then they can't refuse to do the same for the next customer .
They need to maintain the integrity of their pricing structure .
You can give them a way out by accepting a product with a defect , or by choosing the floor model , last year 's model , or a repossession .
Any good reason you can suggest , such as a Sob Story or the Squeeze , can help them to justify making an exception .
15 . Be funny .
The use of humor can lighten up the atmosphere , weaken the seller 's defenses , and make it easier for you to assume a tough bargaining position without alienating the salesperson .
One of my favorite gambits is to ask , " Do you give veteran 's discounts ? "
It usually gets a laugh or a chuckle , often followed by a discount .
Remember : None of these techniques will work unless you convince yourself that it is okay to negotiate .
When you bargain for goods and services , you are participating in one of the oldest human activities .
The people who founded this country were traders who wheeled and dealed all the time , and in most other parts of the world , bargaining is a respected art form that is enjoyed by both buyer and seller .
Although it wo n't work every time , bargaining is usually successful often enough to make it worthwhile and a whole lot of fun .
The bottom line is that if you do n't negotiate , you are unnecessarily leaving much of your hard - earned money on the table .
If you do n't ask , you do n't get .
Good luck !
Andrew Waggoner
The colonization of silence is complete .
Its progress was so gradual that even those who watched it with alarm have only now begun to take stock of the losses .
Reflection , discernment , a sustainable sense of tranquility , of knowing where and how to find oneself — these are only the most obvious casualties of marauding noise ’s march to the sea .
Much more insidious has been the loss of music itself .
But wait , this ca n’t be : Music is everywhere ; we have more of it , available in more forms , more often , than at any time in human history .
I can go to the web and find O King of Berio , Baksimba dances from Uganda , something really obscure like Why Are we Born ( not to have a good time ) of the young Buck Owens , even Pat Boone ’s version of Tutti Frutti ; I can find all of the same at the mall .
Surely this is a good thing .
I can find renewal of spirit in Sur Incises of Boulez or stand aghast at the toxic grandiloquence of Franz Schmidt ’s Book of the Seven Seals .
Music is everywhere .
Long live it .
Just give me five minutes without it ; that ’s all I ask , perhaps all I ’ll need to bring it back into being for myself .
Imprisoned by it as I am now , assaulted in every store , elevator , voice - mail system , passing car , neighbor ’s home , by it and its consequent immolation in the noise of the quotidian , it is lost to me as anything other than a kind of psychic rape , a forced intimacy with sonic partners not of my choosing .
When music is everywhere , it is nowhere ; when everything is music , nothing is .
Silence is as crucial to the musical experience as any of its sounding parameters , and not merely as a kind of acoustical “ negative space . ”
Silence births , nurtures , and eventually takes back the musical utterance ; it shapes both the formation of its textures and the arc of its progress through time .
And , of course , since silence — unless one is in an anechoic chamber — is never wholly silent , its presence , its expression , allows us to distinguish between sounds that are and are not music .
Thus is not -music given entry into music ;
Cage aside , the sounds in the hall , in the street , in the club , are not music , though they become part of the shared discourse that is ; they are the fragments of conversation overheard but not comprehended by speakers of a different language , passionately engaged in their own dialogue amidst the whirl of an alien culture .
Thus is music ’s wonderful strangeness amplified by a silence that is always trying to tell us something .
Exactly what it tells us can be very precise , at least in musical terms .
A few examples :
The spaces that enfold the last phrases of Webern ’s Three Orchestral Songs of 1913 - 14 open a door for us into an understanding of “ O neige Dich , O komme wieder , Du grüst und segnest … ” ( O incline to us , O come back … You greet and bless \
The breath of evening takes away the light \I see your dear face no more ) that most of us cannot access through a reading of the text alone .
We are drawn into a time - sense that seems to pull us across an event horizon , where things seem both very big and very small .
Thus , with the solo whispering of “ Du grüst und segnest , ” the surrounding silence amplifies the softness of Du , the sibilance of segnest ; the intimacy of this direct entreaty is made almost overpowering , embarrassing even , by the varied acoustical richness of each syllable .
“ You greet and bless ” becomes a sacred utterance of hushed sensuality that transforms the “ Mother of grace ” whose “ dear face [ we ] see no more ” into a departed lover .
In Webern ’s Variations Op. 30 something wonderfully different happens .
At the work ’s outset , individual attacks are set off from each other by the silences that separate them .
Our sense of the attacks , their lengths and intensities , is determined by the lengths of the silences .
As we move through the piece and individual attacks are layered with others of varying durations , finally yielding extended lines , our apprehension of shape is fueled by the recollection of past silences in our present , echoic memory , on that level of consciousness where past remains present ; we continue to experience silence through the welter of polyphony , a silence of varying degrees , each given its own feeling - tone by the different sounds that eventually overtake it .
This form - giving potentiality of silence , that is to say the active memory of silence as an agent in the musical discourse , is so important in Webern ’s music as to be generalized as a basic principle .
This can be said of much other music as well , of course , really of all musics on some level .
But what was a tacit understanding for most composers before Webern became for him a core expressive value .
Thus we can say that without a silence within which to develop , and in which the listener is deeply immersed , Webern ’s music only half - exists at best .
This is true also of Morton Feldman , in whose late works a different — but no less dynamic — sense of silence is at play .
In For Samuel Beckett , to take just one example , a massive texture unfolds slowly , almost imperceptibly , with columns of sound fanning out inch by sonic inch , their relationships to each other constantly changing through a gradual process of temporal displacement .
The effect at first could be described as prismatic , with shafts of light intermittently piercing the slow turning of these huge shapes .
Further on , however , it begins to feel as if the texture is breathing , with dynamic swells resulting naturally from the juxtaposition of different timbres .
Listen further still and we now find silences parting the texture and defining the large - scale motion of the piece .
In constructive terms these silences are the result of ever - widening spaces created by the gradual slowing of the canons that run from the work ’s beginning to its end .
The affective sense , however , is just the opposite :
It is silence that drives the work ’s pulmonary rhythm ; silence asserts itself with greater and greater confidence , with a stronger sense of self , until it clears away the texture and is left with only itself , only its own perfect wholeness .
For those who love Feldman ’s music and are able to stay with it to the end the effect is tonic , serving to endow one ’s own cluttered life with a sense of space .
What do Webern and Feldman have to tell us about our lives and our time ?
Do they speak directly to the experience of life in a century of clanging metal and unabated trivia ?
Or does their work simply tell us about them ?
For Webern it seems to have been the composing - out of a singular view of art as the willful emanation of nature , the incarnation in pure , formal sentience of the structural purity of the cosmos , that constellated his unique sense of the delicate and the hushed .
Feldman ’s view was equally rich and evocative , colored as it was by his friendship with Cage , though expressed in more workaday terms ( he once remarked that like a tailor , he was a craftsman , committed to quality of detail ; “ the suit fits better ” he said . ) .
On a personal level one could conclude that Webern , a small , modest , and introspective man was born to write small , quiet music .
How then to explain Feldman ?
Big , garrulous , fun , brilliant , obscene , he seemed to present a persona that defied connection with his art .
Whatever their sources in the personal histories and genetics of their composers , the musics of Webern and Feldman ( and countless others from recent years ) make possible for us a relationship to silence , and the room it gives us , that would seem otherwise impossible in a deafening age .
The properties in their musics that accomplish this are not unique to them , of course , any more than the perception that the world is getting louder is unique to us as moderns .
These are both matters of degree .
It is probable that in two hundred years — if we are still in a position have this discussion — the level and din of information exchange , aural , digital , and ( who knows ) psychic , may make our current age seem a veritable Walden .
That does n’t mean we do n’t have a problem .
For us to be able to enter the world that music creates for us , we need a silence within which to listen .
It will be said in response that in many cultures music is not presented as an object of veneration within a temple of adoring quietude , but rather as part of the rush and tumult of everyday life ; thus we should not need the expectant hush of the concert hall ourselves in order to go into our music .
These are valid points that do challenge the clear subject / object separation that classical music traditions have tended to enforce .
In many world societies , however , there are still spaces — if only interior , or metaphorical , or temporal — set aside for contemplation , for noiseless recalibration of the soul , and in contemporary American culture there are almost none .
Our social rituals are constrained by the incessant soundtrack imposed in our public spaces , and our places of worship , by and large , have given themselves over to a muzak - based sense of liturgy that tells us at every step of the way what to feel and with what intensity .
Many of us , turning away from both mainline - and mega-church , have sought peace in new - age bookstores , but these , even with their palmists and meditation rooms , surround their patrons with a noxious haze of synthesizers , pennywhistles , and Inuit drums .
But beyond shopping , what primary experience are we having here ?
Are we listeners seeking an archetype of beauty or seekers listening for the godhead ?
It turns out we are neither — though we may have been duped into one or the other conviction .
We are simply consumers .
The hope is that , like dairy cattle , we will become more productive if encouraged in our purchases by this kind of marginal musical discourse .
This , of course , is the common denominator in all the examples above , and it extends beyond the ritual into the political .
If we frequent any number of the hipper clothing chains we will find ourselves buoyed by emo or hip - hop beats that serve to wash away the sense of complicity we feel in supporting a sweatshop economy ; the music is telling us that we belong here , that we ’re different , we ’re aware , we ’re not the problem .
We ’re down with all the world ’s peoples , with the losers and dreamers , with the left and the right .
We ’re down with EVERYONE ; we do n’t want any trouble , we just want to buy a pair of cargo pants .
Once again , the absence of silence makes it impossible for us to decode the onslaught before we ’ve succumbed to it .
And this is not just a function of capitalism .
It ’s worse .
We find ourselves as a culture unable to assuage our loneliness except through the ceaseless accompaniment of our everyday actions .
In such a world buying a book or a shirt is not merely to acquire a thing , to fill a need ; it is , rather , to participate in the forced scripting of our lives according to commercial archetypes that tell us , through the imaginary film score by which we buy , eat , make love , crap , worship , and , eventually , die , not who we are but who we wish we were , who the music tells us we want to be .
Even our sense of time becomes hopelessly distorted , as we float through our lives according to the dreamlike spans of musical phrases rather than the waking rhythms of clock - time .
Thus our capacity to be present for our lives , for our work especially , is compromised by a time - sense that is artificially constructed along unconscious models in order to give perspective on the conscious experience of time ’s passing , not to replace that experience entirely .
In losing silence , and the corresponding potential for musical discernment that silence engenders , we lose ourselves , our native sense of our motion through life .
This , perhaps , is what Ligeti had in mind in the fourth movement of his Piano Concerto , where silence eventually succombs to madness .
As in all of Ligeti ’s music , spaces in the work , both textural and temporal , are gradually filled in through a dizzied layering of canon and pitch - cycle .
In most of his later works , however , there is always space through which to “ view ” the process ; the greatest premium is placed on clarity of both gesture and phrase trajectory ( such is the case with the other four movements of the Concerto ) .
In the fourth movement of this work , however , early silences of anywhere from six to eight beats are gradually compressed , until by the movement ’s climax silence has been obliterated through an orchestral canon of nine parts , which eventually spins itself into nothingness .
Ligeti provides no program , but the effect is that of any number of daily contemporary situations wherein sound is deafening but sense is absent .
Sense may seem to return , of course , the moment we strap into our iPods .
The “ personal music system ” makes available to us conditions that are near - anechoic .
Crowned with headphones , we plunge into a total aural void , within which the silences of Webern , Feldman , Ligeti , Haydn , Ravi Shankar , or a templeful of Tibetan monks become real and rich for us once again .
This would seem the ultimate solution to our problem , the most perfect means of apprehending music ’s symbiosis with silence , until we consider two discomfiting realities : in voluntarily wearing headphones we are agreeing to the taming , by actual , physical sound , of our own interior landscapes , and we agree to go the process alone , for no one can reach us when we are plugged - in in this way .
In this state , we become slaves to a jealous god who seeks to rob us of our deepest capacities for expression and relationship .
For the silences of Webern , of Feldman , Haydn , Beethoven , Miles Davis , and Jimi Hendrix were conceived of as shared fields of sonic space .
It is only now that they are being parceled off and sold , one by one , to individual buyers .
The unanimous hush that fell with Hendrix ’ final , plaintive , nightmarish phrases in the live new year ’s eve 1970 recording of Machine Gun , has now receded into the ether ; the sense of wonder it inspired has long since been replaced with a knowing sense of style , an aesthetic shorthand of narrowing signification .
This is fundamental to the transformation of any art , of course , and is not necessarily a terrible thing .
What is pernicious here , pernicious simply because of the ease and semi-conscious assent with which it is happening , is that the common sense of “ Oh my God ” that greets the best work of any artist is now more likely to occur as a singular , individual event , outside the frame of any human relationship .
The hush that Hendrix inspired , the result of genuine stylistic , technical , and expressive transcendence acted out in the real presence of an engaged community , has little to no counterpart in today ’s media culture .
Instead we are offered unlimited choice in our listening , unlimited as to what , where , when , and in what format , but alone , all alone , outside any cultural frame other than that of the marketplace .
Thus is the communal experience , the sharing , of music made a solitary enterprise ; thus is the antidote for the poison of unwanted sound made an instrument of isolation and estrangement ; thus are thoughts which once sounded only in the imagination drenched in a shower of tones ; thus is music rendered impotent to the point of non-existence ; thus is the colonization of silence complete .
What then to do ?
On the level of culture , my hunch is that with the implosion of the CD industry and the ( probably coincident ) resurgence of so many different kinds of live performance , serving so many different constituencies , we will , not as one mass but rather as a linked set of smaller musical communities , find our way back to a shared musical life .
Indeed this is already happening , in every genre of contemporary music , at least in cities and in virtual communities defined by specific musical tastes .
What it will mean for the society as a whole , however , for the exurbs , the strip malls , the churches , even the edge of the wilderness ( where canned music is increasingly common ) is difficult to say ; no definitive answer is on the horizon .
One thing is certain :
No luddite sensibility will save us ; we ’ve come too far , too fast .
Even as I write this angry missive I , like every other musician I know , am striving to hear through the noise and find what is essential in it , what speaks uniquely of my and my neighborhood ’s experience and to sing of that in my music .
To hate the media is to hate ourselves : we all want the big medicine in the magic box to touch us , to dazzle us , to heal us .
We know that ultimately it can’t , but we simply do n’t know how or when to stop , we ’re children eating Skittles ; our mouths are full and we just want more .
To pretend otherwise is , I think , poignant at best .
But , at some point , stop we must .
For now perhaps the best we can do as individuals is try not to be complicit in the occupation of our lives by music made noise .
We do n’t have to listen to music all the time ; we still have some , though not much , degree of choice when it comes to the quantity and quality of sound we experience in our everyday world .
Exercising that choice wisely , with an ear for the complexity of the aural environment and the need for space within it , will constitute a big first step toward righting the imbalance .
In the meantime , the problem of silence remains .

When Aleksander Kucharski arrived in Britain from Poland , he expected he would get a first - class education .
He was accepted at a Roman Catholic state school which boasts one of the best academic records in the country and is recognised by Ofsted as outstanding .
But after two years he is so disillusioned that he has gone home to his old school , saying his British classmates were interested only in shopping and partying .
Scroll down for more ...
" I was treading water within the British education system , " said 16 - year - old Aleksander .
" The boys were childish , they did n't read papers and were n't interested in anything .
" And the girls only talked about shopping and what they were going to do on Friday night .
" In Poland you have to know the names of all countries , even the rivers .
But in England hardly anyone could place Kenya or Poland on the map .
The teachers did n't test knowledge , only effort . "
Aleksander started at St Thomas More High School in North Shields , North Tyneside , after his parents , who are both doctors , came to England .
In June he informed his mother Anja , a psychiatrist , and father Robert , a medical consultant , that he was returning home to continue his schooling .
While they remained here , Aleksander went back to Lodz in Poland , where he has moved in with his grandmother and enrolled at III Liceum Ogolnoksztalcace , a state school .
Although he received glowing praise from his Tyneside teachers , Aleksander claims he was being held back by other pupils , whom he accused of having no interest in learning new things .
He said : " Here in Lodz I go to debates , I talk about films and I try to persuade people not to use plastic bags .
During the elections here we posted flyers for my neighbour who was out campaigning .
" But in Newcastle no one cared about globalisation , the greenhouse effect , the EU , war or politics .
" Maybe it 's because they get everything on a plate , because there was no communism there and there 's no real poverty , they do n't need to worry about their future .
" In Poland parents tell their children about financial problems .
But in Britain I think they do n't have them or they tried to hide them , to buy their children everything . "
Aleksander said that before he left Poland he was an average student .
" In Poland , I only ever got average marks in maths , yet in the UK teachers said I was a genius , " he claimed yesterday .
" After a year I was top of the class in everything , and that includes English . "
The excellent facilities at St Thomas More failed to improve educational standards there , he said .
" They would give me a list of terms and definitions .
The teacher told us to put them into pairs and colour them the right colour - like at primary school . "
Last night , the deputy head of his school in Lodz , Agata Jagielska , said : " We know that Polish pupils are better at acquiring facts and knowledge .
" Perhaps because we are poorer and we do n't have such great facilities in Poland , pupils are more motivated to seek out possibilities for themselves . "
St Thomas
More is one of the best performing schools in the country .
A total of 1,700 students aged between 11 and 18 attend the school which was established in 1988 following amalgamation and has won several national awards for excellence .
A spokesman for North Tyneside Council said : " Every child and parent has the right to choose the education they wish .
" We are disappointed that this pupil has decided to move away .
" Only weeks ago St Thomas More was recognised by Ofsted as being an outstanding school with 82 per cent of students achieving five or more A * - C grades .
Among those , 16 came out with nine or more A * - A grades . "
Telegram.com — Massachusetts Democrats yesterday joined a growing chorus of Democrats across the country who have called for the impeachments of President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney .
The 2,500 delegates to the party ’s state convention approved the impeachment resolution by a nearly unanimous voice vote .
The original motion , based on legislation filed by U.S. Rep. Dennis J. Kucinich , D - Ohio , singled out Mr. Cheney .
In a close vote , party faithful added Mr. Bush ’s name before taking their definitive vote for impeachment .
State party Chairman John Walsh said the vote reflects the frustration Democrats have experienced over the Bush administration ’s refusal to end the U.S. occupation of Iraq .
Mr. Walsh singled out congressional Democrats , particular .

MUMBAI ( Reuters ) -
An exclusive magazine for prostitutes is offering a snapshot of life in some of India ’s biggest brothels , reporting the murky world of pimps and violent customers and showcasing the dreams and talents of sex workers .
Sex workers stand on a roadside pavement for soliciting customers in a red light area in Mumbai July 28 , 2007 .
REUTERS / Punit Paranjpe
“ Red Light Despatch ” , a monthly publication , is full of emotional outpourings of women sold to brothels as children , personal accounts of torture and harassment , poems and essays by prostitutes , book and film reviews and advocacy articles .
Health workers and prostitutes sit together once a week in a tiny newsroom located inside a brothel in India ’s financial capital to discuss stories , headlines and the design of issues .
The reporters , often themselves prostitutes or their relatives , file their contribution after scouring the brothels of Mumbai , Kolkata and New Delhi and some smaller cities .
“ We choose the best stories for publishing , ” said Rupa Metgudd , a news coordinator and daughter of a former prostitute , sifting through reports for the latest edition .
“ The magazine is not a mere publication .
For us it is journalism of purpose . ”
Although prostitution is illegal in India , it is a thriving underground industry and voluntary groups estimate that there are about 2 million women sex workers .
Launched six months ago , the magazine is a platform for the collective memories , nostalgia and dreams of the sex worker community and an attempt to wean their children away from the profession , said editor Anurag Chaturvedi .
DREAMS AND DESIRES
In one recent edition , Sita , a prostitute from Kolkata who gave only one name , told of her violent childhood marriage that forced her to flee her home and land in a brothel .

“ My dignity was torn to pieces .
I used to cry a lot .
But I soon learnt some things will never change no matter how much you cry , ” she wrote .
Elsewhere , women wrote about betrayed love , bad marriages , their dreams of living a life of dignity , of owning a “ house with lots of sky ” , and about the “ frightening ” world of prostitution .
With a little help from a voluntary group , the magazine prints about 1,000 copies in Hindi and English and is distributed free among prostitutes and residents of red light districts .
The ragtag magazine , without any photographs , looks more like a booklet but it apparently serves the purpose .
“ It ’s a platform , a vent for many prostitutes who deposit their anger , hurt and thoughts on these pages , ” said Anita Khude , a health volunteer associated with the magazine .
“ The magazine is for them and it is about them . ”
If there were any doubts about the quality of the magazine staffed by people with no journalistic experience , two former journalists help edit it .

Understanding a new concept
The idea of iterators was introduced into Python with version 2.2 .
Well , that is not quite true ; hints of the idea were already present in the older function xrange ( ) , and the file method .xreadlines ( ) .
Python 2.2 generalized the notion in much of its internal implementation and made programming custom iterators much more straightforward by introducing the yield keyword ( the presence of yield turns a function into a generator , which in turn returns an iterator ) .
The motivation behind iterators is twofold .
Working with data as sequences is often the most straightforward approach , and a sequence that is processed in linear order often does not need to actually exist all at once .
The x *( ) premonitions provide clear examples of these principles .
If you want to do something a billion times , your program will probably take a while to execute , but there is no general need for it to claim a lot of memory .
Likewise , for many types of files , processing can be a line - by - line matter , and there is no need to store the whole file in memory .
All sorts of other sequences can best be treated lazily too ; they might depend on data arriving incrementally over a channel , or upon a computation that proceeds step - by - step .
Most of the time , an iterator is utilized within a for loop , just like a true sequence is .
Iterators provide a .next ( ) method that can be invoked explicitly , but 99 percent of the time , what you will see is along the lines of :
for x in iterator : do_something_with(x )
The loop is terminated when the behind - the - scenes call to iterator.next ( ) raises a StopIteration exception .
By the way , a true sequence can be turned into an iterator by calling iter ( seq ) -- this will not save any memory , but it can be useful in the functions discussed below .
Python 's evolving split personality
There is something schizophrenic in Python 's attitudes towards functional programming ( FP ) .
On the one hand , many Python developers disparage the traditional FP functions map ( ) , filter ( ) , and reduce ( ) , usually recommending using list comprehensions in their place .
But the whole of the itertools module is composed of functions of the very same sort , merely operating on " lazy sequences " ( iterators ) rather than on completed sequences ( lists , tuples ) .
Furthermore , there is no syntax in Python 2.3 for " iterator comprehensions , " which would seem to have to same motivation as list comprehensions .
I suspect Python will eventually grow some form of iterator comprehension , but it depends on finding a suitably natural syntax for them .
In the meanwhile , we have a number of useful combinatorial functions in the itertools module .
Broadly , each of these functions accept some parameters ( usually including some basis iterators ) and return a new iterator .
For example , the functions ifilter ( ) , imap ( ) , and izip ( ) are directly equivalent to the respective built -ins that lack the initial i .
Missing equivalents
There is no ireduce ( ) in itertools , although it might seem natural ; a possible Python implementation is :
Listing 1 . Sample implementation of ireduce ( )
def ireduce ( func , iterable , init=None ) : if init is None : iterable = iter( iterable ) curr = iterable.next ( ) else : curr = init for x in iterable : curr = func ( curr , x ) yield curr
The use case for ireduce ( ) is similar to that for reduce ( ) .
For example , suppose you want to add a list of numbers contained in a large file , but stop when a condition is met .
You could monitor the ongoing total with :
Listing 2 . Adding and totaling a list of numbers
from operator import add from itertools import * nums = open ( ' numbers ' ) for tot in takewhile ( condition , ireduce ( add , imap ( int , nums ) ) : print " total = " , tot
A more real - world example is probably something like applying a stream of events to a stateful object , such as to a GUI widget .
But even the simple example above shows the FP flavor of iterator combinators .
Basic iterator factories
All the functions in itertools can easily be implemented in pure Python as generators .
The main point of including the module in Python 2.3 + is to provide standard behaviors and names for some useful functions .
While programmers could write their own versions , each one would create a slightly incompatible variation in practice .
The other point , however , is to implement iterator combinators in efficient C code .
Using itertools functions will be a bit faster than writing your own combinators .
The standard documentation shows equivalent pure - Python implementations for each itertools function , so there is no need to repeat those in this article .
The functions in itertools are basic enough -- and distinctly named enough -- that it probably makes sense to import all the names from the module .
The function enumerate ( ) , for example , might sensibly live in itertools , but is instead a built - in function in Python 2.3+.
Notably , you can easily express enumerate ( ) in terms of itertools functions :
from itertools import * enumerate = lambda iterable : izip( count ( ) , iterable )
Let 's look first at the few itertools functions that do not use other iterators as a basis , but simply create iterators " from scratch . " times ( ) returns an iterator that yields an identical object multiple times ; in itself , this capability is moderately useful , but it is really nice as a substitute for the superfluous use of xrange ( ) and index variable to simply repeat an action .
That is , rather than :
for i in xrange ( 1000 ) : do_something ( )
You can now use the more neutral :
for _ in times ( 1000 ) : do_something ( )
If no second argument is given to times ( ) , it simply yields None repeatedly .
The function repeat ( ) is similar to times ( ) , but unboundedly returns the same object .
This iterator is useful either where a loop has an independent break condition , or within combinators like izip ( ) and imap ( ) .
The function count ( ) is a bit like a cross between repeat ( ) and xrange ( ) . count ( ) returns consecutive integers unboundedly ( starting at an optional argument ) .
However , given that count ( ) does not currently support overflow to longs correctly now , you might as well use xrange ( n , sys.maxint ) still ; it 's not literally unbounded , but for most purposes it amounts to the same thing .
Like repeat ( ) , count ( ) is particularly useful inside other iterator combinators .
Combinatorial functions
A few of the real combinatorial functions in itertools have been mentioned in passing .
ifilter ( ) , izip ( ) , and imap ( ) act just as you would expect from their corresponding sequence functions .
ifilterfalse ( ) is a convenience so that you do not need to negate a predicate function in a lambda or a def ( and it saves significant function call overhead ) .
But functionally , you could define ifilterfalse ( ) ( approximately , ignoring the None predicate ) as :
def ifilterfalse ( predicate , iterable ) : return ifilter ( lambda predicate : not predicate , iterable )
The functions dropwhile ( ) and takewhile ( ) partition an iterator by a predicate .
The former ignores yielded elements until a predicate is fulfilled , the latter yields while a predicate holds .
dropwhile ( ) skips an indefinite number of initial elements of an iterator , so it might not begin iterating until after a delay .
takewhile ( ) starts right away , but terminates the iterator if the passed - in predicate become true .
The function islice ( ) is basically just the iterator version of list slicing .
You can specify a start , stop , and step , just as with regular slices .
If a start is given , a number of elements are dropped until the passed - in iterator reaches the element of interest .
This is another case where I think refinement to Python is possible -- the best thing would be for iterators to simply recognize slices , just as lists do ( as a synonym for what islice ( ) does ) .
One final function , starmap ( ) , is a slight variation on imap ( ) .
If the function passed in as an argument takes multiple arguments , the iterable passed should yield tuples of the right size .
Basically , this is the same as imap ( ) with several iterables passed in , only with the collection of iterables previously combined with izip ( ) .
Beyond the basics
The functions included in itertools make for a good start .
If nothing else , they encourage Python programmers to become more comfortable with utilizing and combining iterators .
In a general way , widespread use of iterators is clearly important to the future of Python .
But past what is included , there are some others that I would recommend for future updates to the module .
You can easily use these immediately -- of course , if they are later included , the names or interface details could differ .
One category that would seem to be of general use is functions that take multiple iterables as arguments , then yield individual elements from each iterable .
In contrast to this , izip ( ) yields tuples of elements , and imap ( ) yields values computed from the basis elements .
The two obvious arrangements , to my mind , are chain ( ) and weave ( ) .
The first is similar in effect to concatenation of sequences ( but appropriately lazy ) .
That is , where for plain sequences you might use , for example :
for x in ( ' a ' , 'b ' , 'c ' ) + ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) : do_something ( x )
for general iterables , you could use :
for x in chain ( iter1 , iter2 , iter3 ) : do_something ( x )
A Python implementation is :
Listing 3 . Sample implementation of chain ( )
def chain ( * iterables ) : for iterable in iterables : for item in iterable : yield item
With iterables , you might also combine several by interspersing them .
There is no built - in syntax to do the same with sequences , but weave ( ) itself works fine for completed sequences also .
A possible implementation is below ( Magnus Lie Hetland proposed a similar function on comp.lang.python ) :
Listing 4 . Sample implementation of weave ( )
def weave ( * iterables ) : " Intersperse several iterables , until all are exhausted " iterables = map ( iter , iterables ) while iterables : for i , it in enumerate ( iterables ) : try : yield it.next ( ) except StopIteration : del iterables [ i ]
Let me illustrate the behavior of weave ( ) since it might not be immediately obvious from the implementation :
>>> for x in weave ( ' abc ' , xrange ( 4 ) , [ 10,11,12,13,14 ] ) : ... print x , ... a 0 10 b 1 11 c 2 12 13 3 14
Even after some iterators are exhausted , the remaining ones continue to yield values , until everything available is yielded at some point .
I will propose just one more possible itertools function .
This one owes a lot to functional programming ways of conceiving problems . icompose ( ) has a certain symmetry with the function ireduce ( ) suggested above .
But where ireduce ( ) feeds a ( lazy ) sequence of values to a function , and yields each result , icompose ( ) applies a sequence of functions to the return value of each predecessor function .
A likely use of ireduce ( ) is to feed a sequence of events to a long - lived object .
icompose ( ) might instead repeatedly pass an object to a mutator function that returns a new object .
The first is a fairly traditional OOP way of thinking about events , while the second is more of an FP way of thinking .
Here is a possible implementation of icompose ( ) :
Listing 5 . Sample implementation of icompose ( )
def icompose ( functions , initval ) : currval = initval for f in functions : currval = f( currval ) yield currval
Conclusion
Iterators -- conceived as lazy sequences -- are a powerful concept that opens new styles of Python programming .
There is a subtle difference , though , between thinking of an iterator as just a data source and thinking of it in a sequential style .
Neither way of thinking is more true per se , but the latter opens the path towards a combinatorial shorthand for manipulating programmatic events .
The combinatorial functions in itertools ( and especially some it might grow , like those I suggest ) come close to a declarative style of programming .
To my mind , these declarative styles are generally less error - prone , and more powerful .

Judaism has 13 Principles of Faith .
Maimonides was a Jewish philosopher and scholar who lived in the 12th century .
Though born in Spain , he lived and died in Egypt , his people burying him in neighboring Israel afterward .
He conducted many studies on astronomy and medicine , but his greatest achievement was the 13 Principles of Faith .
These principles came from his study of Jewish oral traditions , going back to before Roman times .
Though other scholars criticized the principles over the centuries , they remain the most popular formulation of the core teachings of the Jewish faith today .
Circumcision is a Jewish tradition .
Circumcision is a surgical procedure where a doctor removes the foreskin of a man ’s penis .
This tradition is among the oldest of the Jewish faith , going back to ancient times .
Scholars argue that at the most basic level , the reason for the tradition is to mark any Jewish man apart from other men .
Other scholars argue that even at the time , the medical benefits of circumcision were already known and that the early Jews incorporated it into their tradition .

The Torah and the Pentateuch are one and the same .
The Torah is the foundation of all Jewish holy texts .
Every other holy text builds on what the Torah teaches .
However , the Torah is n’t a single book .
In fact , Christianity named it the Pentateuch .
In Latin , it means five books , which is the first five books of the Christian and Jewish Bibles .
That is Genesis , Exodus , Leviticus , Numbers , and Deuteronomy .
How ’s that for interesting Judaism facts ?
Judaism is more than a religion .
One of the most important Judaism facts is that it ’s not just a religion .
Judaism is a culture , a political force , and even an ethnic group .
The Jews are their own people , with a distinct ethnic identity like how Europeans , Asians , and Africans are distinct from each other .
Unlike other religions , they use their own alphabet and language for both secular and religious purposes .
Christianity and Islam , are multi-ethnic religions but lack a language or alphabet the way Aramaic is for Jews .
Christianity borrowed Latin from the Romans , and Islam borrowed Arabic from the Arabs .
In terms of politics , Judaism is also tied to the Jewish ’s people history and continuing desire for a country of their own .
This goes back to ancient times , with the Kingdoms of Israel and Judah , and the modern nation of Israel .
There ’s a difference between Conservative and Orthodox Judaism .
Usually , orthodoxy and conservatism go hand - in - hand .
However , that ’s not the case when it comes to Judaism .
Orthodox Judaism firmly holds that written teachings and oral traditions come from God , and must remain unchanged by time .
In contrast , Conservative Judaism holds that while both written teaching and oral traditions have a divine origin , how they ’re interpreted is up to the rabbis , and may reflect modern circumstances .
Reform Judaism is the most flexible form of Judaism .
Reform Judaism or Liberal Judaism originated from Central Europe before spreading to Britain and the United States .
Influenced by the Enlightenment of the 18th century , Reform Judaism follows looser interpretations of Jewish law and teachings .
Reform Judaism also incorporates some .
Reform Judaism also puts greater emphasis on the prophets ’ examples as role models for the Jewish community .
Jews recite prayers 3 times a day .
In Aramaic , daily Jewish prayers are called Shacharit , Mincha , and Ma’ariv , or morning , afternoon , and evening prayers .
Jewish tradition usually involves group prayers , but it ’s allowed for individuals to pray alone if they ’d prefer .
Jews have several kinds of religious clothing .
One of those is the kippah , a skullcap worn when praying , eating , or studying .
It ’s also not unknown for some Jews to wear them at all times .
Another example of religious clothing is the tallit , a prayer shawl worn during prayer services .
Tallits also have distinctive designs called tzitzit , knotted fringes or tassels at each corner of the shawl .

Judaism follows the concept of the Sabbath .
According to the Old Testament , God created the world in 6 days and rested on the 7th day .
Therefore , Christians and Jews believe that people should follow His example , and observe the 7th day ’s rest .
However , Jews often refer to it by its Hebrew term , Shabbat .
Independently Parsing Perl
A few years into my programming career , I found myself involved in a somewhat unusual web project for an enormous global IT company .
Due to some odd platform issues , we could write the intranet half of the project only in Perl and the almost - identical public internet half only in Java .
In my efforts to pick up enough Java to help my Perl code interoperate with the code from the Java guys , I stumbled on a relatively new editor with the rather expansive name of JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA .
What a joy !
It quite simply made learning Java an absolute pleasure , with comprehensive tab completion , light and simple API docs , easy exploration of the mountain of Java classes , and unobtrusive indicators showing me my mistakes and offering to fix them .
In short , it had lots of brains and a fast , clean user interface .
Where Is IntelliPerl ?
Although I only needed it heavily for a few months , it ’s been my gold standard ever since , and my definition of what a “ great ” editor should be .
I install every new Perl editor and IDE I come across in the hope that Perl might one day get an editor half as good as what Java has had for years .
These great editors are spreading .
Java is now up to one and a half ( Eclipse is nearly great but still seems not quite “ effortless ” enough about what it does ) .
Dreamweaver gave HTML people their great editor years ago , and I ’ve heard that Python may now have something that qualifies .
Interestingly , these great editors seem to share one major thing in common .
How to Build a Great Editor
Rather than relying on the language ’s parser to examine code , great editors seem to implement special parsers of their own .
These parsers treat a file less like code and more like a generic document ( that just also happens to be code ) .
It ’s a key distinction , and one that provides two critical capabilities .
First , it creates a “ round - trip ” capability , parsing a file into an internal model and back out again without moving a single white space character out of place .
Even if parts of a file are broken or badly formatted , you can still change other parts of the file and save it correctly without it changing anything you do n’t alter .
Second , it makes the parser extremely safe and error - tolerant .
Any code open in an editor is there for a reason–generally because it is n’t finished yet , is broken , or needs changing .
A document parser can hit a problem , flag it , stumble for a character or so until it finds something it recognizes , and then continue on .
Parsing as code is an entirely different task , and one often unsuited to these type of faults .
For example , take the following .
print " Hello World !
" ; } MyModule -> foobar ;
For an editor using Perl itself to understand this code , it ’s game over once it hits the naked closing brace , because the code is invalid .
Without knowledge of what is below the brace , you lose all of the intelligence that needs the parser : syntax highlighting , module checking , helpful tips , the lot .
It ’s just simply not a reasonable way to build an editor , where a file can be both unfinished and have dozens of bugs .
Building a Document Parser for Perl
Even without an editor to put it in ( yet ) , a document parser for Perl would be extraordinarily useful for all sorts of tasks .
At the time , though , all I really wanted was a really accurate HTML syntax highlighter .
Some time in early 2002 , I was bored one afternoon and had a first stab at the problem .
The result was pretty predictable , given patterns I ’ve seen in others trying the same thing .
It was A ) based on regular expressions , and B ) useless for anything even remotely interesting .
Between then and the start of The Perl Foundation grant in December 2004 , I ’ve spent a day or so a month on the problem , rewriting and throwing away code .
I ’ve junked two tokenizers , one lexer , an analysis package , three syntax highlighters , an obfuscation package , a quote engine , and half of the classes in the current object tree .
Now , finally , PPI is complete , bar some minor features and testing .
It is 100 percent round - trip safe , and it ’s been stress tested against the 38,000 ( non - Acme ) modules in CPAN , handling all but 28 of the most broken and bizarre .
What Does It Do ?
PPI should be the basis for any task where you need to parse , analyze or manipulate Perl , and it finally provides a platform for doing these tasks to their full potential .
This covers a huge range of possible tasks ; far too many to cover in any depth here .
For this article , I want to demonstrate how PPI can improve existing tools that currently only do a very basic job , when there is the potential for so much more .
One of these is part of the PAR application - packaging module .
When PAR bundles a module into the internal include directory , it tries to reduce the size of the modules by stripping out POD .
Of course , what would be better would be to strip out everything that is excess and cut PAR file sizes even more .
This is a form of compression , but given the potential confusion in using something like “ Compress : : Perl ” as a name , I ’m picking my own term .
I hereby anoint the term “ Squish ” .
A squished module occupies as little space as possible , having had redundant characters removed .
It will be extremely small , although it might look a little “ squished ” to look at :)
Perl :: Squish
Rather than showing you the final project , I prefer to show the process of squishing a single module .
# Where is File :: Spec on our system ?
use Class :: Inspector ; my $ filename = Class :: Inspector->resolved_filename ( ' File : : Spec ' ) ; # Load File :: Spec as a document use PPI ; my $ Document = PPI :: Document -> new ( $ filename ) ;
Everything you do with PPI starts and finishes with PPI :: Document objects .
If you find yourself using the lexer directly , you are probably doing something wrong .
Where can I start cutting out the fat ?
For starters , many core modules have an __END__ section .
# Get the ( one and only ) __END__ section my $ End = $ Document -> find_first ( ' Statement : : End ' ) ; # Delete it from the document $ End -> delete if $ End ;
PPI provides a set of search methods that you can use on any element that has children .
find_first is a safe guess , because there can only be one __END__ section .
The search methods actually take &wanted functions like File : : Find , so ' Statement : : End ' is really syntactic sugar for :
sub wanted { my ( $ Document , $ Element ) = @_ ; $ Element ->isa ( ' PPI : : Statement : : End ' ) ; }
Of course , there ’s a faster way to do the same thing .
The prune method finds and immediately deletes all elements that match a particular condition .
# Delete all comments and POD $ Document -> prune ( ' Token : : Pod ' ) ; $ Document -> prune ( ' Token : : Comment ' ) ;
For a more serious example , here ’s how to strip the non-compulsory braces from -> method ( ) :
# Remove useless braces $ Document -> prune ( sub { my $ Braces = $ _ [ 1 ] ; $ Braces ->isa ( ' PPI :: Structure : : List ' ) or return ''; $ Braces -> children == 0 or return '' ; my $ Method = $ Braces -> sprevious_sibling or return ''; $ Method ->isa ( ' PPI :: Token : : Word ' ) or return ''; $ Method -> content !~ /:/ or return '' ; my $ Operator = $ Method -> sprevious_sibling or return '' ; $ Operator ->isa ( ' PPI : : Token : : Operator ' ) or return ''; $ Operator -> content eq '->' or return '' ; return 1 ; } ) ;
It ’s a little bit wordy , but is relatively straightforward to write .
Just add conditions and discard as you go .
You can get other elements , calculate anything or call sub-searches .
When you have finished , be sure to save the file .
# Save the file $ Document -> save ( " $filename.squish " ) ;
Wrapping It All Up
All you need to do now is is wrap it all up in some typical module boilerplate .
package Perl : : Squish ; use strict ; use PPI ; our $ VERSION = ' 0.01 ' ; # Squish a file in place # Perl : : Squish -> file ( $ filename ) sub file { my ( $ class , $ file ) = @_ ; my $ Document = PPI :: Document -> new ( $ file ) or return undef ; $ class -> document ( $ Document ) or return undef ; $ Document -> save ( $ file ) ; } # Squish a document object # Perl :: Squish -> document ( $ Document ) ; sub document { my ( $ squish , $ Document ) = @_ ; # Remove the stuff we did earlier $ Document -> prune ( ' Statement : : End ' ) ; $ Document -> prune ( ' Token : : Comment ' ) ; $ Document -> prune ( ' Token : : Pod ' ) ; $ Document -> prune ( sub { my $ Braces = $ _ [ 1 ] ; $ Braces ->isa ( ' PPI :: Structure : : List ' ) or return ''; $ Braces - > elements == 0 or return '' ; my $ Method = $ Braces -> sprevious_sibling or return ''; $ Method ->isa ( ' PPI :: Token : : Word ' ) or return ''; $ Method -> content !~ /:/ or return '' ; my $ Operator = $ Method -> sprevious_sibling or return '' ; $ Operator ->isa ( ' PPI : : Token : : Operator ' ) or return ''; $ Operator -> content eq '->' or return '' ; return 1 ; } ) ; # Let 's also do some whitespace cleanup my @whitespace = $ Document -> find ( ' Token : : Whitespace ' ) ; foreach ( @whitespace ) { $ _->{content} = $ _->{content} =~ /
/ ? "
" : " " ; } 1 ; } 1 ;
Finally , the last step is to wrap it all up as a proper module .
You can see the finished product prettied up with PPI ’s syntax highlighter at CPAN :: Squish .
I ’ve added a few additional small features to the basic code described above , but you get the idea .
See also Perl : : Squish for more details .
In 15 minutes , I ’ve knocked together a pretty simple module that dramatically improves on what you could do without something like PPI .
Now imagine the hard things it makes possible .
CommonDreams has erased me from their web site .
On Wednesday , August 5th , I posted a comment on CommonDreams in response to an article there by Medea Benjamin .
I initially had trouble getting the comment to appear on the site , but chalked that up to technical problems with their comment script ( since they 've had various issues with it ) .
A few hours later my comment disappeared from the comment thread .
I still thought this might be a technical glitch and so I posted the comment again ... but it disappeared yet again , this time within a few minutes .
By the afternoon I 'd posted it yet one more time , as well as posting a response to another person ( " Rebel Farmer " ) ; within minutes , both his comment and my reply to him were deleted as well .
Throughout this time there were long periods where comments I submitted would seem to fall into a black hole ; the comment form would take them , but they never appeared in the comment thread .
But if I tried to submit the same comment again the site would respond with " Duplicate comment detected " -- so it was accepting them , but also holding them for some reason .
Still hoping that this might be a technical issue rather than a ban or block , I tried creating a different user and posting from it , which worked initially ... but then it started being blackholed as well .
Thanks to a referral the next day to my site from the URL " http://www.commondreams.org/archive/wp-admin/moderation.php " , I can say with certainty that the editors were intercepting and silently deleting my comments .
It gets worse .
After my comments had been deleted from the Medea Benjamin article thread for the fourth time , I searched Google for all appearances of my username ( distantocean ) on commondreams.org .
I 'd been posting comments there for about two months , so there were a fair number of hits .
But when I followed one of the article links , I was shocked to see that the text " distantocean " did n't appear anywhere in the page -- my comment was gone .
I tried another article , and again , the comment I 'd posted there was nowhere to be found .
I tried all of the remaining article links , and I found that only one comment I 'd posted there -- the first one , back on July 12th - - remained intact ( presumably an oversight ) .
Every other comment I 'd ever posted on CommonDreams had been deleted .
The cold feeling that had been spreading through my stomach throughout the day exploded .
I honestly felt like I 'd just been punched in the gut .
I 'd spent hours crafting those comments , and now they were gone -- just vanished .
And the fact that my comments were still in the Google cache made it clear that this had happened just recently .
Believe it or not , it still gets worse .
Not only had my own comments been removed , but comments by other users that simply mentioned my username had also been deleted .
I 'd understand if you find this difficult to credit ; believe me , it was very hard for me to accept as well .
But thanks to Google , I have proof .
Below are two copies of an article on CommonDreams ( " Democrats ’ Responsibility for Bush Radicalism " ) , including the comment thread ; the first is a copy of Google 's cached version of the page , and the second is the current version of the same page :
The uncensored version from Google 's cache
The censored version as it currently stands on the CommonDreams web site
If you look at the comment counts in these pages ( just after the article itself ) you 'll see that the uncensored version from Google 's cache has 133 comments -- but the current page from the CommonDreams site has only 127 .
And if you look more closely you 'll see that of the six deleted comments , three of them were written by me and the other three ( two by " baska " and one by " srelf " ) mentioned my username .
The specific comments that were deleted are numbers 92 , 94 , 99 , 104 , 126 , and 127 in the uncensored version .
No other comments are missing -- just mine , and those that mentioned my username .
I 'd invite you to read my comments in the uncensored version ( you can find them via CTRL - F " distantocean " ) and see if you think there was anything in them that justified their deletion from the site -- not that anything could justify deleting the comments of other people whose only transgression was responding to me , of course .
I spent so much time writing the main comment that I reposted it on my own site , here ; Arthur Silber felt it was worthwhile enough to link to it .
CommonDreams has ignored every query I 've sent them about this .
I 've emailed them directly , and I 've tried contacting them via comments ( since I know they read those -- even if only for a moment , before they delete them ) .
But they 've refused to respond .
Since I know that they 've visited my web site in the process of moderating ( and deleting ) one of my comment - queries , I know they 've seen what I 've written , and so I 'm left with no doubt that these have been deliberate actions .
Based on their first set of deletions of my comments , I have to assume that this started because someone at CommonDreams did n't like my response to Medea Benjamin , and decided to retaliate not just by deleting my response to that article but by wiping out everything I 'd written on the site .
And removing my own comments was n't enough for them -- they went further and actually destroyed all traces of my existence on the site , with no regard for the effects on innocent bystanders .
I 'm not the only person CommonDreams has censored -- in fact there were other people on that very same Medea Benjamin thread asking where their comments had gone ( they also received no answers ) , and I saw comments by other people appear briefly and then disappear minutes later .
And here 's another article discussing censorship by CommonDreams .
As that article notes and as I 've seen for myself , when people ask about the censorship , CommonDreams typically responds by censoring those comments as well .
But I 've never heard of them erasing someone completely from their site ( though how would I ? after all , they control the medium , and they obviously do n't hesitate to exercise that control ) .
I can barely express how dumbfounded , disappointed , and disillusioned I am by this .
One of the major progressives web sites on the Internet , a site that regularly publishes articles about threats to freedom of speech , apparently feels that it 's perfectly acceptable to censor writing based solely on the political content .
They issue no warnings ; they offer no explanations ; they allow no appeals .
They have n't even posted a comment policy that I can find anywhere on the site ( maybe because " we 'll delete any comment we like , and there 's nothing you can do about it " sounds a bit too authoritarian ) .
They 're in control , and they apparently like it that way .
The contempt that this shows for their readership and for the principles of free expression and free association is breathtaking .
To anyone who posts on CommonDreams : you should know that nothing you write there is permanent .
If the CommonDreams editors disagree with what you 've written -- no matter how thoughtfully you 've expressed it or how relevant it may be -- they can simply delete it .
And if they disagree strongly enough , they may do to you what they did to me and delete every trace of you from the site .
I would n't have believed it myself , but at this point the evidence is overwhelming .
Do n't take my word for it ; look at the before and after versions of the article I 've provided above and see for yourself .
I 've saved the crowning irony for last .
The very day after they vanished me from their site , CommonDreams published an article by Ruth Conniff titled " Overcoming Censorship " .
Though perhaps I can even top that one : I tried to post a comment in response to the article , but it never showed up .
UPDATE : A friend noticed a comment last night on CommonDreams that independently verifies my own experience , which puts my last doubts on the matter to rest .

Columnist says Bush administration fears Powell will emerge as anti-war critic Nick Juliano
Published : Thursday August 9 , 2007
Print This Email This
Of all the former Bush administration officials whose advice was ignored -- to disastrous effect -- in the run-up to the Iraq war , Colin Powell has remained the most stoic and unwilling to criticize what others have called a lack of planning and overall mismanagement that led America to its current predicament .
A column published Thursday suggests that all could change at a most inopportune time for the administration , as it prepares to release its second surge - related progress report next month .
" Powell is the White House 's ticking - time - bomb scenario , " Sidney Blumenthal writes in Salon .
" He was Petraeus before Petraeus , the good soldier before the good soldier , window - dressing before window - dressing .
The White House aides ' fear of Powell reflects their guilt , if not their stricken consciences , over his disposal .
Powell was used , ruined and tossed overboard .
His warnings were ignored , his loyalty was abused , and when he no longer served Bush 's purposes he was unceremoniously discarded . "
Blumenthal notes Feb. 5 , 2003 , the date of Powell 's infamous United Nations presentation , " will live in mendacity , for every statement he made was later revealed to be false . "
A recently released documentary , " No End in Sight , " featured devastating interviews with three of Powell 's former aides and associates who were involved with Iraq 's reconstruction .
RAW STORY previously published an exclusive excerpt of the film .
Blumenthal predicts the criticisms from Powell 's former inner circle -- chief of staff , Col. Lawrence Wilkerson ; his former deputy , Richard Armitage ; and former U.S. ambassador Barbara Bodine -- could foreshadow the former Secretary of State 's personal criticisms of the war .
" Armitage 's debut in particular has the White House fuming and fretting that it somehow signals Powell 's emergence as a full - throated critic in the middle of the September P.R. offensive , " Blumenthal writes .
Sources close to National Security Adviser Stephen Hadley tell Blumenthal he " has voiced anger and concern about whether Powell will step forward and what he might say , and other presidential aides are wondering how to cope with that nightmarish possibility . "
In a June appearance on Meet the Press , Powell was critical of the troop surge , Blumenthal notes , but otherwise he has strayed from criticizing the decisions he witnessed in the run-up to war .
" Powell 's absence cedes the political terrain to those who ousted him from office , " Blumenthal writes .
" Notwithstanding his tarnished reputation , he has a final chance to regain his dignity and at least some of his previous standing by stepping forward at the crucial hour . "
The state of Texas was set to reach a milestone last night with the scheduled execution of Johnny Ray Conner for a murder he committed nearly 10 years ago .
He would be the 400th person to be executed in Texas since the state resumed capital punishment in 1982 , a figure that is considerably higher than in other US states with capital punishment .
Twenty prisoners have been executed this year in Texas , and three more are scheduled to die by lethal injection next week .
Five further executions are scheduled for September .
Since 1976 , 1,091 prisoners have been executed in the US .
Last year , 53 people were executed in the country , putting it behind China , Iran , Pakistan , Iraq , and Sudan in a ranking of countries with the most executions .
The grisly milestone prompted the EU , which has banned the death penalty , to appeal to the Texas governor , Rick Perry , " to exercise all powers vested in his office to halt all upcoming executions and to consider the introduction of a moratorium in the state . "
The request met with a blunt response .
" Two hundred and thirty years ago , our forefathers fought a war to throw off the yoke of a European monarch and gain the freedom of self - determination , " said the governor 's spokesman .
Texans long ago decided that the death penalty is a just and appropriate punishment for the most horrible crimes committed against our citizens .
While we respect our friends in Europe , welcome their investment in our state and appreciate their interest in our laws , Texans are doing just fine governing Texas . "
Conner was convicted of killing a shopkeeper , Kathyanna Nguyen , during a robbery in 1998 .
Witnesses identified him as the man seen running from the scene , but a federal court ruled that he should have a new trial because evidence that he had a leg injury which would have prevented him from running was not presented at his original trial .
That ruling , however , was reversed by the 5th US circuit court .
Conner 's trial lawyers said the injury never was an issue because he told them his broken leg had healed .
The appeals court said there was no testimony at his trial about his limp and none of his lawyers ever noticed one .
Conner 's lawyers have asked the supreme court to stop the execution .
On an anti-death penalty website , Conner called his conviction an " atrocious act of barbarity against the law and mankind " .
DALLAS , Texas ?-
A former Apollo astronaut blasted the U.S. spaceagency today in its handling of a Congressionally - mandated study on dealingwith the threat of Near Earth Objects ( NEOs ) striking the Earth .
Russell " Rusty " Schweickart , the lunar module pilot for the Apollo 9 mission , called a recently issued NASA report on dealingwith Earth - threatening asteroids , ? flawed ?
and ?
not valid .?
Schweickart noted that Earth impacts of huge space rocks arerare .
But as history has shown , a cosmic - smashing event is a very real occasion ? when both the Earth and an asteroid can be at an ugly intersection of timeand space .
?
It ?s those circumstances which we want to avoid , ?
Schweickart saidhere today at the 26th annual National Space Society ?s InternationalSpace Development Conference .
In fact , next year is the celebration of the 100thanniversary of the Siberia - smacking Tunguska event of a 45 to 50 meter diameterasteroid .
?
Had it hit a couple of hours later it might have wiped out London or Moscow ? instead it wiped out 2,000 square kilometers of Siberia forest andmaybe a few reindeer , ?
Schweickart observed .
Schweickart is Chairman of the B612 Foundation , a confab of scientists , technologists , astronomers , astronauts , and other specialists dedicated to significantly alter the orbit ofan asteroid in a controlled manner by 2015 .
He was also wearing his hat as amember of the Association of Space Explorer ?s ( ASE ) Committee on Near EarthObjects .
Through the ASE organization , a set of internationalworkshops , stretching over a year and a half , are being held to further detailthe NEO threat and promote a global response to potential Earth - menacingobjects .
The results of those workshops , Schweickart said , are to be submittedin the spring of 2009 to the UN Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space .
Earth : Control - Alt - Delete
? What we ?re talking about here is the possibility ?
in anevolutionary sense ?
of a Control - Alt - Delete ; a [ computer - like ] reboot of theevolutionary system that has already occurred many times on Earth , ?
Schweickartsaid .
In any dealings with space rocks , there ?s need for earlywarning , a deflection capability and an international decision - makingcapability , Schweickart said .
Schweickart reported that by 2019 asteroid watchers willhave on the books upwards of 10,000 objects with a non-zero probability ofimpacting Earth .
?
The bottom line , ?
he said , ? is that in the next 10 to 12 years , we are going to , in all likelihood , have to make decisions ?
not becauseone of these things is going to hit us ?
but because several of them look asthough they might hit us .?
? We ?re going to have to act in a timely way , ?
Schweickartsaid .
?
What is changing dramatically in the next decade is our knowledge of theNEO environment .
You have to take action based on your knowledge ?
your bestunderstanding of the truth .?
Civil disobedience
NASA recently responded to a study request from Congress ? an assessment of how best to track , catalog , as well as deter a NEO found to beon a collision course with Earth .
As one of its major conclusions , the studyadvised that use of nuclear explosions can deflect such an Earth - bruisingevent .
That approach is wrong - headed , Schweickart responded .
Rather , using existing robot impactor technology , as well as a gravity - tractormethod of altering the asteroids trajectory ever - so - slightly , would give youboth the oomph and the precision that you need to re-direct a NEO from an Earthimpact .
? Right now , I put NASA in the same category of technicalaccuracy as Hollywood with Deep Impact and Armageddon , ?
he noted , twoless - than - accurate movies that featured Earth - impacting objects .
? NASA did a terrible technical analysis which led them tothat conclusion , ?
Schweickart said .
?
It ?s wrong , wrong , wrong .?
? The report as it stands is not valid .
The recommendationsthat they made are based on an exceptional set of asteroids that they pickedrather than what is most likely to be needed to be deflected , ?
Schweickart toldSPACE.com . ?
It ?s a flawed report .?
Schweickart said that ?
NASA basically pulled off a federalagency version of civil disobedience ?
by not recommending a program or budgetin dealing with the dangers from NEOs .
? NASA has just refused to obey thelaw ?
that ?s not good news .?
Wanted : mission rules
In dubbing the NEO issue as a ? cosmic natural hazard ?? nobody is responsible for handling the threat , within the U.S. government orany other government , Schweickart said .
He urged conference attendees to write theU.S. Congress and demand a hearing on the results of the NASA report .
? In the next 15 years , the population of the world is goingto be concerned about this issue , ?
Schweickart said .
The former Apolloastronaut called for ?
Mission Rules ? for NEO deflection to be drawn up by theinternational community .
?
If we do our homework right , never again should an asteroidthat can do damage on the ground impact the Earth , ?
Schweickart suggested .
?
We ? reliving at a time -- with our technology -- we have the capability to eliminatethis major shaper of evolution ?
the evolution of life on this planet .?
? We ?re now on the top of the heap .
Enough cosmic gardener , you ?re fired .
That ?s the task ?
that ?s the challenge , ?
Schweickart concluded .

Deadly impact : A U.S. Humvee burns in April near Samarra , about 60 miles north of Baghdad , after an improvised explosive device detonated near its convoy .
Roadside bombs account for more than half of the U.S. combat deaths in Iraq .
Pfc. Aaron Kincaid , 25 , had been joking with buddies just before their Humvee rolled over the bomb .
His wife , Rachel , later learned that the blast blew Kincaid , a father of two from outside Atlanta , through the Humvee 's metal roof .
Army investigators who reviewed the Sept. 23 attack near Riyadh , Iraq , wrote in their report that only providence could have saved Kincaid from dying that day : " There was no way short of not going on that route at that time ( that ) this tragedy could have been diverted . "
A USA TODAY investigation of the Pentagon 's efforts to protect troops in Iraq suggests otherwise .
GRAPHIC WITH VIDEO : Military struggles to adapt to war 's top killer Years before the war began , Pentagon officials knew of the effectiveness of another type of vehicle that better shielded troops from bombs like those that have killed Kincaid and 1,500 other soldiers and Marines .
But military officials repeatedly balked at appeals — from commanders on the battlefield and from the Pentagon 's own staff — to provide the life - saving Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicle , or MRAP , for patrols and combat missions , USA TODAY found .
In a letter to Defense Secretary Robert Gates late last month , two U.S. senators said the delays cost the lives of an estimated " 621 to 742 Americans " who would have survived explosions had they been in MRAPs , rather than Humvees .
The letter , from Sens. Joseph Biden , D - Del. , and Kit Bond , R - Mo. , assumed the initial calls for MRAPs came in February 2005 , when Marines in Iraq asked the Pentagon for almost 1,200 of the vehicles .
USA TODAY found that the first appeals for the MRAP came much earlier .
As early as December 2003 , when the Marines requested their first 27 MRAPs for explosive disposal teams , Pentagon analysts sent detailed information about the superiority of the vehicles to the Joint Chiefs of Staff , e-mails obtained by USA TODAY show .
Later pleas came from Iraq , where commanders saw that the approach the Joint Chiefs embraced — adding armor to the sides of Humvees , the standard vehicles in the war zone — did little to protect against blasts beneath the vehicles .
Despite the efforts , the general who chaired the Joint Chiefs until Oct. 1 , 2005 , says buying MRAPs " was not on the radar screen when I was chairman . "
Air Force general Richard Myers , now retired , says top military officials dealt with a number of vehicle issues , including armoring Humvees .
The MRAP , however , was " not one of them . "
Something related to MRAPs " might have crossed my desk , " Myers says , " but I do n't recall it . "
Why the issue never received more of a hearing from top officials early in the war remains a mystery , given the chorus of concern .
One Pentagon analyst complained in an April 29 , 2004 , e-mail to colleagues , for instance , that it was " frustrating to see the pictures of burning Humvees while knowing that there are other vehicles out there that would provide more protection . "
The analyst was referring to the MRAP , whose V - shaped hull puts the crew more than 3 feet off the ground and deflects explosions .
It was designed to withstand the underbelly bombs that cripple the lower - riding Humvees .
Pentagon officials , civilians and military alike , had been searching for technologies to guard against improvised explosive devices , or IEDs .
The makeshift bombs are the No. 1 killer of U.S. forces .
The MRAP was not new to the Pentagon .
The technology had been developed in South Africa and Rhodesia in the 1970s , making it older than Kincaid and most of the other troops killed by homemade bombs .
The Pentagon had tested MRAPs in 2000 , purchased fewer than two dozen and sent some to Iraq .
They were used primarily to protect explosive ordnance disposal teams , not to transport troops or to chase Iraqi insurgents .
The goal : Iraqis ' stand up ' so U.S. can ' stand down '
Even as the Pentagon balked at buying MRAPs for U.S. troops , USA TODAY found that the military pushed to buy them for a different fighting force : the Iraqi army .
On Dec. 22 , 2004 — two weeks after President Bush told families of servicemembers that " we 're doing everything we possibly can to protect your loved ones " — a U.S. Army general solicited ideas for an armored vehicle for the Iraqis .
The Army had an " extreme interest " in getting troops better armor , then - brigadier general Roger Nadeau told a subordinate looking at foreign technology , in an e-mail obtained by USA TODAY .
In a follow - up message , Nadeau clarified his request : " What I failed to point out in my first message to you folks is that the US Govt is interested not for US use , but for possible use in fielding assets to the Iraqi military forces . "
In response , Lt. Col. Clay Brown , based in Australia , sent information on two types of MRAPs manufactured overseas .
" By all accounts , these are some of the best in the world , " he wrote .
" If I were fitting out the Iraqi Army , this is where I 'd look ( wish we had some ! ) "
The first contract for what would become the Iraqi Light Armored Vehicle — virtually identical to the MRAPs sought by U.S. forces then and now , and made in the United States by BAE Systems — was issued in May 2006 .
The vehicles , called Badgers , began arriving in Iraq 90 days later , according to BAE .
In September 2006 , the Pentagon said it would provide up to 600 more to Iraqi forces .
As of this spring , 400 had been delivered .
The rush to equip the Iraqis stood in stark contrast to the Pentagon 's efforts to protect U.S. troops .
In February 2005 , two months after Nadeau solicited ideas for better armor for the Iraqis and was told MRAPs were an answer , an urgent - need request for the same type of vehicle came from embattled Marines in Anbar province .
The request , signed by then - brigadier general Dennis Hejlik , said the Marines " cannot continue to lose … serious and grave casualties to IEDs … at current rates when a commercial off - the - shelf capability exists to mitigate " them .
Officials at Marine headquarters in Quantico , Va. , shelved the request for 1,169 vehicles .
Fifteen months passed before a second request reached the Joint Chiefs and was approved .
Those vehicles finally began trickling into Anbar in February , two years after the original request .
Because of the delay , the Marines are investigating how its urgent - need requests are handled .
The long delay infuriates some members of Congress .
" Every day , our troops are being maimed or killed needlessly because we have n't fielded this soon enough , " says Rep. Gene Taylor , D - Miss .
" The costs are in human lives , in kids who will never have their legs again , people blind , crippled .
That 's the real tragedy . "
Not until two months ago did the Pentagon champion the MRAP for all U.S. forces .
Gates made MRAPs the military 's top priority .
The plan is to build the vehicles as fast as possible until conditions warrant a change , according to a military official who has direct knowledge of the program but is not authorized to speak on the record .
Thousands are in the pipeline at a cost so far of about $ 2.4 billion .
Gates said he was influenced by a press report — originally in USA TODAY — that disclosed Marine units using MRAPs in Anbar reported no deaths in about 300 roadside bombings in the past year .
His tone was grave .
" For every month we delay , " he said , " scores of young Americans are going to die . "
One reason officials put off buying MRAPs in significant quantities :
They never expected the war to last this long .
President Bush set the tone on May 1 , 2003 , six weeks after the U.S. invasion , when he declared on board the aircraft carrier Abraham Lincoln that " major combat operations in Iraq have ended . "
Gen. George Casey , the top commander in Iraq from June 2004 until February this year , repeatedly said that troop levels in Iraq would be cut just as soon as Iraqi troops took more responsibility for security .
In March 2005 , he predicted " very substantial reductions " in U.S. troops by early 2006 .
He said virtually the same thing a year later .
Casey was n't the only optimist .
In May 2005 , Vice President Cheney declared that the insurgency was " in its last throes . "
Given the view that the war would end soon , the Pentagon had little use for expensive new vehicles such as the MRAP , at least not in large quantities .
The MRAPs ordered for the Iraqis were intended to speed the day when , to use Bush 's words , Iraqi forces could " stand up " and the United States could " stand down . "
Nadeau , who wrote the e-mail that led to MRAPs for the Iraqis , explains why he did so : " The U.S. government knows that eventually we 're going to get out " of Iraq .
The United States wants " to help get ( the Iraqis ) in a position to take care of themselves . "
For U.S. forces , however , the answer was something else : adding armor to Humvees .
Nadeau and others say the choice made sense because Humvees were already in Iraq and the improvements — adding steel to the sides , upgrading the windows and replacing the canvas doors — could be made quickly , and far more cheaply .
Adding armor to a Humvee cost only $ 14,000 ; a Humvee armored at the factory cost $ 191,000 ; today , an MRAP costs between $ 600,000 and $ 1 million , though some foreign models cost only about $ 200,000 in 2004 .
The solution to the IED problem in 2003 had to be " immediate , " says retired vice admiral Gordon Holder , director for logistics for the Joint Chiefs until mid-2004 .
" We had to stop the bleeding . "
Holder says MRAPs seemed impractical for the immediate need : " We should n't take four years to field something the kids needed yesterday . "
Would it actually have taken four years ?
That depends upon how much urgency the Pentagon and Congress attached to speeding production .
Force Protection Inc. , the small South Carolina company that landed the first significant MRAP contracts , was criticized this month by the Pentagon 's inspector general for failing to deliver its vehicles on time .
But bigger defense contractors were available then — and have secured MRAP contracts in recent weeks that call for deliveries in as little as four months .
A bigger obstacle might have been philosophical :
The MRAP did n't fit the Pentagon 's long - term vision of how the military should be equipped .
Then - Defense secretary Donald Rumsfeld regarded the Iraq war " as a means to change " the military , " make it lighter , make it more responsive , make it more agile , " Holder says .
The MRAP , heavier and slower than the Humvee , would n't have measured up , he says .
The commander ' My No. 1 threat '
By June 2004 , the military had lost almost 200 U.S. troops to the homemade bombs .
Gen. John Abizaid , then head of U.S. Central Command , told the Joint Chiefs that " IEDs are my No. 1 threat . "
He called for a " mini-Manhattan Project " against IEDs , akin to the task force that developed the atomic bomb during World War II .
The Pentagon organized a small task force that , two years later , morphed into a full - fledged agency — the Joint IED Defeat Organization , or JIEDDO .
Its leader , Montgomery Meigs , is a retired four - star general .
Its annual budget totals $ 4.3 billion .
Its mission : to stop IEDs from killing U.S. troops .
In one of its PowerPoint presentations , JIEDDO made its priorities clear .
First , prevent IEDs from being planted by attacking the insurgency .
Then , if a device is planted , prevent it from exploding .
" When all Else Fails , " reads another slide , " Survive the blast . "
That put solutions such as the MRAP into the category of last resorts .
JIEDDO did spend its own money for 122 MRAPs , but it primarily focused on electronic jammers to prevent bombs from being remotely detonated , unmanned surveillance aircraft to catch insurgents putting bombs along roads and better intelligence on who was building and planting bombs .
The agency has claimed some successes .
Insurgents in 2007 had to plant six times as many bombs as they did in 2004 to inflict the same number of U.S. casualties , Meigs said in an interview .
But the insurgents — Sunnis loyal to the deposed leader Saddam Hussein , Shiites who hated the U.S. occupiers and foreigners aligned with al - Qaeda — often managed to stay one step ahead of JIEDDO .
They changed the kind of explosives they planted and varied the locations of the devices and the way they detonated them .
When the Pentagon added armor to the sides of Humvees to guard against bombs planted along roadsides , the insurgents responded by burying bombs in the roads .
The bombs could blast through the vulnerable underbelly of the Humvees .
The insurgents also moved to larger , more sophisticated bombs , some packed with as much as 100 pounds of explosives .
Deputy Secretary of Defense Gordon England , the No. 2 official at the Pentagon , testified on Capitol Hill in June that " as the threat has evolved , we have evolved .
We work very , very hard to be responsible to our troops . "
Taylor , the Democratic congressman from Mississippi , pressed England about why the Pentagon waited until May to request substantial numbers of MRAPs .
" Are you telling me no one could see that ( need ) coming , no one could recognize that the bottom of the Humvee " did n't protect troops , and " that 's why the kids inside are losing their legs and their lives ? "
Taylor asked .
" That is too simplistic a description , " England replied .
" People have not died needlessly , and we have not left our people without equipment . "
To Pentagon decision - makers , the Humvee seemed able to handle the threat early in the war — roadside bombs , rather than those buried in the roads .
" If anybody could have guessed in 2003 that we would be looking at these kind of ( high - powered , buried ) IEDs that we 're seeing now in 2007 , then we would have been looking at something much longer " term as a solution , Holder says .
" But who had the crystal ball back then ? "
Nadeau , now a major general in charge of the Army 's Test and Evaluation Command in Alexandria , Va. , also defends the Pentagon 's choices .
He says buried IEDs did not become a serious threat to the armored Humvees until 2006 .
Critics might say , " ' Why did n't you guys buy 16,000 MRAPs a decade ago ? ' " Nadeau says today .
" You know , I did n't need them . "
Six officers interviewed by USA TODAY say the threat to the Humvees surfaced sooner .
Lt. Col. Dallas Eubanks , chief of operations for the Army 's 4th Infantry Division in 2003 - 04 , says IEDs became more menacing before he left Iraq .
" We were certainly seeing underground IEDs by early 2004 , " he says .
In mid-2005 , two top Marines — Gen. William Nyland , assistant Marine commandant , and Maj. Gen. William Catto , head of Marine Corps Systems Command — testified before Congress that they were seeing an " evolving " threat from underbelly blasts .
They said at the time that armored Humvees remained their best defense .
The congressman MRAP's ' simple ' advantage Just after lunch on June 27 , 2004 , a group of enlisted men parked a handful of armored vehicles near a cinderblock building at Marine headquarters in Fallujah , Iraq .
The day had turned sweltering , like every summer afternoon in central Iraq .
But this day was special .
A congressional delegation had arrived , and among the dignitaries was Rep. Duncan Hunter , then the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee .
Hunter was n't just a powerful congressman .
He was a Vietnam War veteran , and his son , then a 27 - year - old Marine lieutenant also named Duncan , was stationed at the base .
More important to most of the Marines , the California Republican had been instrumental in pushing the Pentagon to get better armor for them .
Humvees with cloth doors — canvas , like the crusher hat that Hunter wore that day — had been standard issue when the war began .
The fabric worked well to shield the sun ; it offered no protection against explosives .
Then , as now , Hunter was impatient with the pace of procurement in Iraq .
That winter , he had dispatched his staff to steel mills , where they persuaded managers and union leaders to set aside commercial orders to expedite steel needed to armor the Humvees .
He also worked with the Army and its contractors to expand production .
In Fallujah , Hunter recognized the Humvees .
He could n't identify the two vehicles next to them .
One was called a Cougar , the other a Buffalo .
Both were MRAPs , made by Force Protection Inc. , and both , he was told , were coveted .
They were used by explosives disposal teams , but combat units " looked at them and said , ' We want those , ' " Hunter recalls .
Throughout most of Iraq , they still have n't arrived .
Despite requests from the field , Pentagon officials decided to ration the vehicle .
In 2003 and 2004 , they bought about 55 , and only for explosives disposal units .
But they chose a different approach for protecting the rest of the troops : adding armor to Humvees .
The choice was problematic .
The Humvee 's flat bottom channels an explosion through the center of the vehicle , toward the occupants .
Memos and e-mails obtained by USA TODAY show a stream of concerns about the decision to armor the Humvee .
Most went up the chain of command and withered : • December 2003 :
At the direction of then - deputy Defense secretary Paul Wolfowitz , who was troubled by the mounting death toll from IEDs , the Joint Chiefs began to explore options for giving troops better armor .
Detailed information on the Wer'Wolf , an MRAP made in the African country of Namibia , was passed from analysts in the Pentagon to Lt. Col .
Steven Ware , an aide collecting information for the Joint Chiefs .
• March 30 , 2004 : Gen. Larry Ellis , in charge of U.S. Forces Command in Atlanta , sent a memo to the Army 's chief of staff , Gen. Peter Schoomaker .
He complained that " some Army members and agencies are still in a peacetime posture . "
U.S. commanders in Iraq told him that the armored Humvee " is not providing the solution the Army hoped to achieve . "
He did n't recommend MRAPs but rather suggested accelerating production of a combat vehicle called the Stryker .
In response , the military said new Humvee armor kits would suffice .
• April 28 - 29 , 2004 : Duncan Lang , a Pentagon analyst who worked in acquisition and technology , suggested purchasing the Wer' Wolf , the MRAP put before the Joint Chiefs in December 2003 .
In an e-mail to colleagues and supervisors , Lang said " a number could be sent to Iraq " as quickly as , or even more quickly than , additional armored Humvees . "
He called it " frustrating to see the pictures of burning Humvees while knowing that there are other vehicles out there that would provide more protection . "
• April 30 , 2004 : Another Pentagon analyst , Air Force Lt. Col.
Bob Harris , forwarded details about MRAP options to a member of the IED task force .
The list included a variety of MRAPs , among them the Wer ' Wolf and Force Protection 's Cougar .
" There was no great clarity as to why they did n't pursue these options , " Harris says .
" I saw it as my job to educate . "
Harris is now an acquisition officer at Hanscom Air Force Base in Massachusetts .
Hunter says the advantages the MRAP had on the Humvee were clear .
" It 's a simple formula , " Hunter says .
" A vehicle that 's 1 foot off the ground gets 16 times that ( blast ) impact that you get in a vehicle that 's 4 feet off the ground , " like the MRAP .
Although Hunter favored adding armor to Humvees , he now calls the military 's devotion to that approach a costly mistake .
" It 's true that they saved more lives by moving first on up - armoring the Humvees , " he says .
" The flaw is that they did nothing on MRAPs .
The up - armoring of Humvees did n't have to be an exclusive operation . "
Holder dismisses the idea that the Pentagon could have moved on a dual track : armoring Humvees while ordering up MRAPs .
He doubts Congress would have funded both at the time .
But that 's exactly what Congress is doing now — buying both vehicles .
" We probably should 've had the foresight " to start buying MRAPs earlier , says Ware , the Joint Chiefs aide ( now retired ) who passed the information to superiors and counterparts in the Army and Marines .
But " we just could n't get them there fast enough . "
Adding armor to the Humvee , Ware says , " was better than nothing . "
The lieutenant colonel ' Hope no one gets wasted '
A PowerPoint presentation , dated Aug. 25 , 2004 , shows wounded troops lying in hospital beds .
Most are bandaged .
One is bloody .
His left eye is barely open , his injured right is covered by a patch .
Each was maimed by an IED .
Each , save one , was in a Humvee .
On another slide : " Numerous vehicles on the market provide far superior ballistic protection " than the Humvee , wrote then - lieutenant colonel Jim Hampton , the man who prepared the presentation for the operations staff of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in Baghdad .
Safety is a passion for Hampton .
He 's so concerned with security that he asks his wife , Kate , to take her pistol when she goes for walks on their 80 acres in rural Mississippi .
When he got to Iraq in early 2004 , he was tasked with looking at armor options to protect the Corps of Engineers , the agency sent to help with rebuilding efforts .
For weeks , he studied armor options .
His conclusion :
The corps should get MRAPs to protect its people , specifically Wer'Wolves .
Hampton says he asked for 53 Wer'Wolves .
The corps got four .
Hampton could n't have been more opposed to up - armoring the Humvees and warned his superiors .
He even e-mailed his wife from Iraq .
" Hey Babe , " his e-mail read .
" Just a little aggravated with the bureaucracy .
It is simply beyond my comprehension why we 're having to go through such ( an ordeal ) to order confounded hard vehicles .
I sure hope no one gets wasted before the powers - that - be get off their collective fat asses . "
Finally , he wrote his congressman , Rep. Chip Pickering , R - Miss. , urging him to investigate deaths involving the Humvee .
" We would never consider sending troops " in Humvees " up against armor or artillery , " Hampton wrote , " but this is tantamount to what we 're doing because these vehicles are being engaged with the very ordnance delivered by artillery in the form of improvised explosive devices . "
By November 2004 , Pentagon analyst Lang had grown discouraged , an e-mail shows .
" I have found that you can never put the word out too many times , " he wrote on Nov. 17 .
" I send it on to ( the Secretary of Defense 's office ) , Army and ( Marine Corps ) contacts I have .
Some of it is getting to the rapid fielding folks and force protection folks that are looking at Iraq issues .
I do not see much action . "
Lang closed the message with a variation on his earlier plea : " For the life of me , I can not figure out why we have not taken better advantage of the sources of such vehicles , " he wrote .
" We should be buying 200 , not 2 , at a time .
These things work , they save lives and they do n't cost much , if any , more than what we are using now . "
At the time , a basic Wer'Wolf cost about the same as a factory - made armored Humvee : around $ 200,000 .
In December 2004 , at a town hall meeting with troops in Kuwait , a soldier asked Rumsfeld about the lack of armor on military vehicles .
Rumsfeld explained the situation this way : " You go to war with the Army you have .
They 're not the Army you might want or wish to have at a later time . "
The concerns troops voiced at the meeting might have had an impact .
Within a week , the Marine Corps Systems Command in Quantico posted its first notice seeking information on MRAPs from potential contractors .
Back in Fallujah , the desire for the Cougar had grown .
By February 2005 , the Marines were formally asking for more .
Field commanders sent their first large - scale request for MRAPs , seeking 1,169 vehicles with specifications that closely mirrored those of the Cougar .
They no longer envisioned the vehicle as limited to explosives disposal teams ; they wanted MRAPs for combat troops , too .
Roy McGriff III , then a major , drafted the request signed by Brig .
Gen. Hejlik .
" MRAP vehicles will protect Marines , reduce casualties , increase mobility and enhance mission success , " the request read .
" Without MRAP , personnel loss rates are likely to continue at their current rate . "
In spring 2005 , he would have a chance to argue his case before top generals .
The Marine major ' Unnecessary ' casualties They convened March 29 - 30 , 2005 , at the Marine Corps Air Station in Miramar , Calif .
The occasion : a safety board meeting , a regular gathering to address safety issues across the Corps .
In attendance : five three - star generals , four two - stars , seven one - stars and McGriff .
McGriff knew the MRAP 's history and the Pentagon 's reluctance to invest in the vehicle .
He had learned about the vehicle from a fellow Marine , Wayne Sinclair .
Sinclair , then a captain , wrote in the July 1996 issue of the Marine Corps Gazette that " an affordable answer to the land mine was developed over 20 years ago .
It 's time that Marines at the sharp end shared in .
.. this discovery . "
Addressing the generals , McGriff recommended analyzing every incident involving Marine vehicles the same way investigators probe aircraft crashes .
Look at the vehicle for flaws , McGriff recalls telling the officers , and examine the tactics used to defeat it .
Lt. Gen. Wallace Gregson , commander of Marine Corps Forces in the Pacific , and Lt. Gen. James Mattis , leader of the Marine Combat Development Command , listened and then conferred for a moment .
The room grew quiet .
" Then they said , ' OK , what do you want to do ? ' " McGriff remembers .
He recited the very plan that the Pentagon , under a new Defense secretary , would embrace in 2007 : " A phased transition .
Continue to armor Humvees .
At the same time , as quickly and as expeditiously as possible , purchase as many MRAPs as possible .
Phase out Humvees . "
According to McGriff , the room again grew silent .
Then , Mattis finally spoke : " That 's exactly what we 're going to do . "
Mattis ' words failed to translate into action .
The urgent - need request McGriff drafted went unfulfilled at Marine headquarters in Quantico .
A June 10 , 2005 , status report on the request indicated the Marine Corps was holding out for a " future vehicle , " presumably the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle — more mobile than the MRAP , more protective than the Humvee , and due in 2012 .
In practical terms , that meant no MRAPs immediately .
McGriff foresaw some of the turmoil over vehicles in a prophetic 2003 paper for the School for Advanced Warfighting in Quantico .
" Currently , our underprotected vehicles result in casualties that are politically untenable and militarily unnecessary , " his paper read .
" Failure to build a MRAP vehicle fleet produces a deteriorating cascade of effects that will substantially increase " risks for the military while " rendering it tactically immobile . "
Mines and IEDs will force U.S. troops off the roads , he wrote , and keep them from aggressively attacking insurgents .
The words were strong and the conclusions were damning .
Rhodesia , a nation with nothing near the resources of the U.S. military , had built MRAPs more than a quarter - century earlier that remained " more survivable than any comparable vehicle produced by the U.S. today , " McGriff wrote .
Despite his views then , McGriff , now a lieutenant colonel , says he understands the delays .
MRAPs needed to be tested to ensure they could perform in combat .
" Nothing happens fast enough when people are fighting and dying , " he says today .
" But amidst the chaos , you still have to make the right choices .
In the end , I think the Marines got the MRAP capability as quickly and safely as possible . "
Others disagree .
Marine Maj.
Franz Gayl , now retired , was science adviser to the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force in Iraq .
He saw how Marines were still being killed or maimed in Anbar in the fall of 2006 .
If the Marine Corps had decided MRAPs were a top priority , he says , it could and should have pursued them with the same urgency the Pentagon is now showing .
" The ramp - up of industry capacity was delayed by over 1 ½ years , " Gayl says , " until it became the dire emergency that it is today . "
Bureaucrats did n't want the MRAP sooner " because it would compete against " armored Humvees and " many other favored programs " for funding , Gayl says .
Gayl , who works as a civilian for the Marines at the Pentagon , has filed for federal whistle - blower protection because he fears retaliation for speaking out about the failure to get MRAPs sooner .
Defense Secretary Gates ' Lives are at stake ' After McGriff addressed the generals in March 2005 , another 15 months passed .
Then the Marines in Iraq reiterated the request for MRAPs .
This time , they sent the request directly to the Joint Chiefs .
This time they were successful .
In December 2006 , after insurgent bombs had killed almost 1,200 U.S. troops in Iraq , the Joint Chiefs validated requests from Iraq for 4,060 MRAPs , and the formal MRAP program was launched .
By March 2007 , Marine Corps Commandant James Conway called the vehicle his " No. 1 unfilled warfighting requirement . "
In part , that 's because he saw it save lives in Anbar province .
Brig .
Gen. John Allen , deputy commander of coalition forces there , says the Marines tracked attacks on MRAPs since January 2006 .
The finding : Marines in armored Humvees are twice as likely to be badly wounded in an IED attack as those in MRAPs .
Perhaps more convincing : No Marines have been killed in more than 300 attacks on MRAPs there .
The news , revealed in USA TODAY on April 19 , drew the attention of Defense Secretary Gates , four months into his job at the Pentagon .
He was traveling in Iraq and read about the MRAP 's success in the Pentagon 's daily news roundup .
Weeks later , at a news conference , Gates said the Pentagon would rush MRAPs to Iraq " as best we can . "
Late last month , top Pentagon officials approved an Army strategy for buying as many as 17,700 MRAPs , allowing a one - for - one swap for its armored Humvees .
About 5,200 MRAPs had been approved for the other services .
Now , Pentagon officials decline to say exactly how many MRAPs they need .
One official says they 'll build MRAPs as fast as possible , then recalibrate the military 's needs as they assess operations in Iraq , a tacit acknowledgment that they may need fewer MRAPs as U.S. troops are withdrawn .
During another news conference late last month , Gates worried that the companies building the MRAP — not only Force Protection but BAE Systems , General Dynamics , Oshkosh Truck , Armor Holdings , International Military and Government and Protected Vehicles — wo n't be able to get the vehicles to Iraq fast enough .
" I did n't think that was acceptable , " Gates said .
" Lives are at stake . "
The young lieutenant ' Safest vehicle ever '
As the sun began to bake the Iraqi countryside last month , Marine 2nd Lt. George Saenz headed back to his base on the outskirts in Fallujah .
He felt oddly joyful .
Saenz had just spent hours leading his platoon through one of the most excruciating battlefield jobs — inching a convoy along the crumbling streets of Fallujah , searching for homemade bombs planted in the asphalt or dirt .
The night before had proved dangerous .
Two bombs had blown up underneath Saenz 's convoy , including one beneath his vehicle .
As Saenz turned through the gray blast walls protecting the base , he says he could n't help but think :
If I had been riding a Humvee , I would n't be here right now .
Saenz knew why he was alive .
His platoon in the 6th Marine Regiment Combat Team had replaced its Humvees with MRAPs .
The two blasts produced just one injury , a Marine whose concussion put him on light duty for a week .
" We 're probably in the safest vehicle ever designed for military use , " Saenz says , recalling his platoon 's record :
Three months .
Eleven bomb attacks .
No one dead .
MRAPs have become legendary in Anbar since Marines began using them on dangerous missions clearing roadside bombs .
Tank commanders , radio operators and others drop by Saenz 's platoon every day to do what Rep .
Hunter had done three years earlier — inspect the small fleet of MRAPs , knock on the armor , sometimes crawl inside .
Scores of MRAPs are scheduled to arrive in Anbar this summer .
That means they 'll be available for the first time to the Marines for tasks other than clearing IEDs , says Marine Col .
Mike Rudolph , logistics officer for U.S. forces in western Iraq .
No one has decided how MRAPs will be used , but " everybody wants one , " Rudolph says .
To be sure , the vehicle is n't perfect .
Saenz 's team warns that MRAPs drive like trucks , plodding and heavy .
Some models are so bulky that troops struggle to see over the boxy hood and so noisy a driver has to shout at someone 2 feet away .
" They 're just so heavy , " Sgt. Randall Miller says .
" These are virtually designed off a semi- truck platform . "
After substantial testing , the military also has concluded that MRAPs are vulnerable to explosively formed projectiles , the newest and most devastating variation of the IED .
More armor has been developed for the MRAPs the Pentagon ordered this spring .
Miller is n't complaining .
On his first tour in Iraq in 2004 - 05 , Miller searched for land mines in a Humvee .
His detection technique was simple : " Go real slow , cross your fingers . "
He still drives slowly but feels safer knowing the MRAP 's V - shaped hull will deflect a bomb blast .
" I 've seen our guys get hit and walk away , " Miller says .
" They 're awesome , awesome vehicles . "
The widow ' They should 've done it ' sooner Whom or what is to blame for the delay in getting safer vehicles for the 158,000 U.S. troops in Iraq ?
Jim Hampton , now a retired colonel , questions why the Pentagon and Congress did n't do more to keep the troops safe .
" I have colleagues who say people need to go to jail over this , and in my mind they do , " Hampton says .
Hunter , now running for President , blames the Pentagon bureaucracy , which he says " does n't move fast enough to meet the needs of the war fighter .
We have a system in which the warfighting requirements are requested from the field and the acquisition people say , ' We 'll get to it on our schedule . ' "
Other members of Congress blame Rumsfeld and his vision of transforming the military into a leaner , faster fighting force .
Rep. John Murtha , D - Pa. , wonders if Rumsfeld 's forceful personality silenced some of the generals .
" Rumsfeld so intimidated the military that I 've lost confidence in them telling us what they really need " in Iraq , Murtha says .
" They all knew the Rumsfeld rule : Your career is over if you say anything contrary " to his policies , Murtha says .
" It 's much better now that Rumsfeld is gone .
The military is being much more honest . "
If the Pentagon " had just listened to the guys in the field " who wanted MRAPs , Murtha says , " we 'd have them in Iraq right now . "
USA TODAY could not determine what role , if any , Rumsfeld played in MRAP deliberations .
A spokesman for Rumsfeld , now running a foundation in Washington , said last week that the former Defense secretary would not comment .
Aaron Kincaid 's widow , Rachel , does n't know who should be held accountable .
She is haunted by whether getting MRAPs to Iraq earlier might have saved her husband 's life .
The bomb that blew apart his Humvee lay along the path he and his unit took , and no one noticed .
Today , she wonders :
Was his death really about the path that he took , or about the path the Pentagon spent years avoiding , the path that , in May , finally led them to the vehicle that might have saved her husband 's life ?
" You think there is always something that could 've been done to prevent it , " Rachel Kincaid says of her husband 's death .
" If that 's been around for that many years , " she says of the MRAP , " why has n't it been used ?
They should 've done it at the beginning of the war .
They should 've done it three years ago , four years ago . "

People are constantly checking out the music on my ipod ( iPhone ) and asking how I find all these obscure bands to listen to .
I 'm not so certain that they are obscure , but they are new , at least new compared to Led Zeppelin , Bon Jovi , and Bruce Springsteen , which populates most of my peers collections .
Now I like Led Zep , and Skynyrd , and Clapton , but how many times can you really listen to Layla before putting a gun to your head ?
There really is a ton of fascinating new bands out there and with the proliferation of music blogs , torrent sites , and other forms of new media , we - as music fans - have access to loads of great stuff - more than ever before .
So this then leads back to that original question :
How do I find all the new bands that I listen to ?
I have a little system that I 've shared with a few friends and will now share with you .
It is a great way to turn on to some musical styles or bands that just would n't otherwise come across your radar .
Metacritic -
This is one of my favorite websites and a great place to find reviews on music , books , movies , games , and television programs .
Rather than having their own in - house writers , Metacritc is a compendium of a crosssection of blogs and review sites , thus their ratings are a composite of many views , providing a much more accurate reading of an items true quality .
I check the music section daily for new reviews .
Anything that is rated 80 or above and is in one of my chosen genres ( indi , rock , alternative , alt country , electronic ) then I move on to step 2 .
Itunes - Apples Music portal is not only a great place to purchase music , but a great place to preview songs prior to purchase .
After finding a few selections that I am interested in , I 'll go to the iTunes store and see if those albums are carried there .
If so , I will first check the user reviews to see if they are consistent with what I read on Metacritic and then I will preview the tracks to see if it is something I would like .
Just because I like what I hear does n't mean I 'm going to purchase them , at least not from the iTunes store .
In a concession to the recording industry , apple encodes most of their music with a system known as DRM ( Digital Rights Managment ) , which not only prevents how you listen to your purchased music ( there is a limit to how you burn the items to disc and whether you can play them in other players ) , but also greatly compromises the sound quality .
I prefer to avoid DRM if at all possible .
Instead I ...
Pirate Bay or other Torrent Sites
Now I 'm promoting piracy , at least I do n't think I am .
I think these sites can be plenty useful while still benefiting the artists whose products are swapped via these services .
Torrent sites allow you to download files ( software , music , movies , etc. ) for free .
The recording industry has declared war on these sites as they believe that file sharing on the web greatly cuts into their revenue .
Whether file sharing has that impact or not is not up for debate here , the manner in which I use these sites ( and that which I am suggesting here ) is one that would be a boon for the recording industry , if only they would try to find a way to get behind it and support rather than shutting it down .
So I search the torrent sites for those selections that passed the previous criteria .
If I find them , I will download the torrent file ( which will then download the music file to my hard drive ) .
Now I have some new music to check out .
If I agree with the reviews , and feel I have a worthwhile album , one that I wish to continue listening to then I move on to the next step .
If I do n't care for it I delete the music from my hard drive and move on .
Ebay , Amazon , SecondSpin.com , etc .
If after downloading and album I find that I really enjoyed it and would like to make it a part of my listening rotation , I will go to one of the above sites along with a few others that sell 2nd hand cds and if I can find the CD I will purchase it - used preferably .
If I can't find it this way then I will go back to Amazon and purchase a new copy .
In this way , I feel I am using the torrent sites as a tool to find new music .
The file sharing is n't resulting in my purchasing less music .
It is resulting in my purchasing more music .
It 's too bad the music industry does n't see this as a potential model that is worth promoting .
Last FM Pandora
Metacritic was one of my starting points , but not the only one .
LastFM and Pandora are too really cool tools for expanding your musical horizons .
They both work similarly - you plug in a few bands or albums that you like and the system plays you music it thinks you would like .
You then rate each of the selections which makes the system " smarter " in knowing what your true tastes are .
I have found a ton of great music this way .
Once I find a few bands or albums that I like I then go back to step 2 and proceed as before .
AllMusic , Pitchfork Media
AllMusic is like an encyclopedia of music .
You can plug in any artist , album , or song and pull up a wealth of information about your selection .
On the home page of the site are Editors Selections , where the sites editors post their favorite albums of the month .
This is a great way to find new stuff as is Pitchfork Media .
PM is my favorite music blog .
They have a section entitled Best New Music where you can always find great ideas for new things to listen to .
Again , I will take any new selections and run them through the above routine .
In the past year I have turned on to scores of new bands that I otherwise would n't have come across .
Here are Ten Bands I found through the above system :
Last week ,
The Pirate Bay announced that it filed charges against against some of the key players in the entertainment industry for corrupting and sabotaging their BitTorrent tracker .
We asked Brokep , one of The Pirate Bay founders to give us some more background information on this counterattack that will , once again , embarrass the entertainment industry .
The Pirate Bay filed charges against 10 major media companies , including Paramount Home Entertainment , Twentieth Century Fox and Universal Music Group .
Fighting fire with fire some would say , but what ’s really motivating them to take on these companies ?
TorrentFreak :
What is the main reason why you decided to file charges ?
Brokep :
To make the big companies aware about their own wrong doings .
They are huge corporations where I ’m sure a lot of different people decide .
I do n’t want that to be an excuse , I want them to take their crappy methods and stop their wrong - doing .
They are going around accusing the pirate community for doing immoral stuff , when they do illegal stuff .
We need to make a statement that just because something might be hard to fight it does n’t mean that laws do not imply in the case .
TorrentFreak :
In your blog post you said that the MediaDefender leaks started all this .
Have you contacted MediaDefender about this suing of their clients ?
Brokep : Yes .
I talked to Randy Saaf , he sounded like a nice guy but he did n’t want to talk about it .
He basically said “ you do what you have to do ” and honestly – if it were my clients , I would be a bit more eager to not get them in trouble .
TorrentFreak :
What ’s the legal status of the leaked emails , can they be used in the lawsuit as evidence ?
Brokep : Yes .
We have something called “ fri bevisprÃ¶vning ” in Sweden which means that evidence , no matter how they ’re obtained , can be used .
TorrentFreak :
Do you have any other evidence against the media companies ?
Brokep :
Yes , stuff like our own logs of the connections from MD and such .
TorrentFreak :
Have you heard anything from the companies you pressed charges against ?
Brokep : No .
We tried having a debate in national swedish radio but they refused to talk to us .
They sent a note using IFPI saying “ we will not talk about unserious claims like this ” .
It ’s a twist of irony .
They do illegal stuff and it ’s unserious claims , we do stuff they consider immoral and they force the police to help them out .
How ’s that for democracy …
TorrentFreak :
What message do you want to send out to the movie and music studios and anti-piracy companies like MediaDefender , and what else do you hope to accomplish by pressing charges ?
Brokep :
That you ca n’t fight file sharing .
You have to join it , embrace it and adopt to it .
It ’s the only way , like it or not .
It ’s not going away , it ’s grows every day and it ’s for a good reason – the people want it .
And the people are their customers , why fight them ?
Listen to them .
TorrentFreak : Thanks Brokep , and good luck of course !
Historians often assume that they need pay no attention to human evolution because the process ground to a halt in the distant past .
That assumption is looking less and less secure in light of new findings based on decoding human DNA .
People have continued to evolve since leaving the ancestral homeland in northeastern Africa some 50,000 years ago , both through the random process known as genetic drift and through natural selection .
The genome bears many fingerprints in places where natural selection has recently remolded the human clay , researchers have found , as people in the various continents adapted to new diseases , climates , diets and , perhaps , behavioral demands .
A striking feature of many of these changes is that they are local .
The genes under selective pressure found in one continent - based population or race are mostly different from those that occur in the others .
These genes so far make up a small fraction of all human genes .
A notable instance of recent natural selection is the emergence of lactose tolerance — the ability to digest lactose in adulthood — among the cattle - herding people of northern Europe some 5,000 years ago .
Lactase , the enzyme that digests the principal sugar of milk , is usually switched off after weaning .
But because of the great nutritional benefit for cattle herders of being able to digest lactose in adulthood , a genetic change that keeps the lactase gene switched on spread through the population .
In a withering critique of his fellow Republicans , former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan says in his memoir that the party to which he has belonged all his life deserved to lose power last year for forsaking its small - government principles .
In " The Age of Turbulence : Adventures in a New World , " published by Penguin Press , Mr. Greenspan criticizes both congressional Republicans and President George W. Bush for abandoning fiscal discipline .
The book is scheduled for public release Monday .
The Wall Street Journal bought a copy at a bookstore in the New York area .
Mr. Greenspan , who calls himself a " lifelong libertarian Republican , " writes that he advised the White House to veto some bills to curb " out - of - control " spending while the Republicans controlled Congress .
He says President Bush 's failure to do so " was a major mistake . "
Republicans in Congress , he writes , " swapped principle for power .
They ended up with neither .
They deserved to lose . "
Many economists say the Fed , by cutting short - term interest rates to 1 % in mid-2003 and keeping them there for a year , helped foster a housing bubble that is now bursting .
In his book , which was largely written before much of the recent turmoil in credit markets , Mr. Greenspan defends the policy .
" We wanted to shut down the possibility of corrosive deflation , " he writes .
" We were willing to chance that by cutting rates we might foster a bubble , an inflationary boom of some sort , which we would subsequently have to address ....
It was a decision done right . "
Well , what do you know .
Turns out the iPod touch is a reality after all .
While we initially assumed that Mr. Jobs would n't be so kind as to bless us all with two new full - fledged iPods in a single day , we 're elated that he had other ideas .
The new flagship iPod has " the same size screen as the iPhone , but it 's even thinner " ( eight - millimeters , for those taking notes ) , and it also touts the " same multi - touch interface " found on the firm 's handset .
Additionally , it boasts a 3.5 - inch widescreen display , the ability to " flick through your photos , " and you even get the " slide to unlock " feature , too .
And yes , this thing actually has WiFi .
Of note , the built - in wireless antenna is n't exactly attractive , but if it means that we can surf the web ( YouTube included ) and buy tunes on our iPod , we suppose it may be an acceptable flaw .
As for battery life , the touch is said to last 22 - hours when playing back audio and 5 - hours when watching video , but only time will tell how draining web surfing will be .
The iPod touch will be arriving in 8GB and 16GB flavors and will be priced at $ 299 and $ 399 , respectively , when they ship " worldwide in a few weeks . "
For some reason a couple of people who have written to me in the last few days , on matters unrelated to this post , have mentioned in passing that the Democrats won a “ narrow victory ” in 2006 .
Apparently this is conventional wisdom , what you get from reading or watching a lot of commentary .
So I thought it might be worth pointing out that it ’s absolutely not true .
In fact , it ’s quite strange how the magnitude of the Democratic victory has been downplayed .
After the 1994 election , the cover of Time showed a charging elephant , and the headline read “ GOP stampede . ”
Indeed , the GOP had won an impressive victory : in House races , Republicans had a 7 percentage point lead in the two - party vote .
In 2006 , Time ’s cover was much more subdued ; two overlapping circles , and the headline “ The center is the new place to be . ”
You might assume that this was because the Democrats barely eked out a victory .
In fact , Democrats had an 8.5 percentage point lead , substantially bigger than the GOP win in 1994 .
Also , the new Democratic majority in the House is n’t just larger than any the Republicans achieved over their 12 - year reign ; it ’s much more solidly progressive than their pre-1994 majority .
It ’s just one election , and may not represent a trend ( although I think it does . )
But the 2006 election was , in fact , a progressive landslide .
Generational Real - time Garbage Collection : A Three - part Invention for Young Objects , Daniel Frampton , David F. Bacon , Perry Cheng , David Grove .
ECOOP 2007 .
While real - time garbage collection is now available in production virtual machines , the lack of generational capability means applications with high allocation rates are subject to reduced throughput and high space overheads .
Since frequent allocation is often correlated with a high - level , object - oriented style of programming , this can force builders of real - time systems to compromise on software engineering .
We have developed a fully incremental , real - time generational collector based on a tri-partite nursery , which partitions the nursery into regions that are being allocated , collected , and promoted .
Nursery collections are incremental , and can occur within any phase of a mature collection .
We present the design , mathematical model , and implementation of our collector in IBM 's production Real - time Java virtual machine , and show both analytically and experimentally that the collector achieves real - time bounds comparable to a non-generational Metronome - style collector , while cutting memory consumption and total execution times by as much as 44 % and 24 % respectively .
Clinton camp says citing progress does n't equal endorsing surge Nick Juliano
Published : Tuesday August 21 , 2007
Print This Email This Sen. Hillary Clinton 's ( D - NY ) comment that some new US " tactics " in Iraq are " working " should not be taken as an endorsement of President Bush 's troop surge strategy , her campaign said Tuesday .
" She has said this before and was specifically referring to reports of increased cooperation from Sunnis leading to greater success against Al Qaeda in Al Anbar , " campaign spokesman Phil Singer said in an e-mail to RAW STORY .
A headline that appeared on the Drudge Report early Tuesday said , " Hillary on Surge ? ' It 's Working ' ... " .
It linked to an Associated Press report on Clinton 's comments Monday at the Veterans of Foreign Wars annual convention .
Clinton cited successes in Iraq 's Al Anbar Province as an example of how changed tactics are " working , " but her comments were not meant as an endorsement of President Bush 's surge strategy as a whole , her campaign said .
Clinton believes there 's been progress quelling violence in Iraq 's Anbar province , but does n't believe the overall troop surge has been effective and continues to argue there is no military solution to end US involvement in Iraq , Singer said .
" We 've begun to change tactics in Iraq , and in some areas , particularly in Al Anbar Province , it 's working , " Clinton told the gathering of veterans in Kansas City , Mo. , according to a New York Times account of the speech .
" We 're just years too late changing our tactics .
We can't ever let that happen again .
We can't be fighting the last war ; we have to be preparing to fight the new war . "
The Times said Clinton 's remarks were " notable " because Republicans have been " seizing on signs of progress in Al Anbar Province in arguing against a troop withdrawal . "
Unlike the Times , the AP paraphrased the first sentence of Clinton 's quote , reporting that she " said new tactics have brought some success against insurgents , particularly in Iraq 's Anbar province , " before running a quote beginning with , " It 's working . "
Her comments referred specifically to increased cooperation from Sunnis in the area leading to progress against insurgents , but she still believes that extricating US troops from what many see as a festering Civil War is the best option .
She has made similar observations before .
PLEASE NOTE : click on the link below for the most recent oil forecast update http://www.theoildrum.com/node/3623 which includes forecasts for Kuwait and the UAE .
1. World Total Liquids Supply & Demand
Although crude oil & lease condensate ( C&C ) production is forecast to continue declining , the total liquids supply remains on a plateau until 2009 ( Fig 1 ) , due to offsetting production increases from natural gas plant liquids ( NGPLs ) , ethanol and XTL ( BTL - biomass to liquids , CTL - coal to liquids and GTL - gas to liquids ) .
Fig 1 - Total Liquids Supply & Demand to 2012 ( bottom up forecast ) - click to enlarge
According to the 11 October 2006 IEA Oil Market Report Table 3 , the current peak production of 86.13 mbd occurred on July 2006 .
On June 2007 , total liquids production fell to an unexpected 84.28 mbd , from the 13 July 2007 IEA Oil Market Report Table 3 , which represents a drop of 1.85 mbd , or just over 2 % , in only one year .
This 1.85 mbd drop is due to falls in both OPEC and non OPEC total liquids .
Unfortunately , OPEC natural gas liquids showed only a small production increase .
OPEC - 12 crude oil production fell by 1.60 mbd from July 2006 to June 2007 .
Although Angola crude oil increased by 0.14 mbd , the following significant decreases occurred : Saudi Arabia , 0.76 mbd ; Iran , 0.30 mbd ; Iraq , 0.12 mbd ; Kuwait , 0.12 mbd ; Nigeria , 0.18 mbd ; and Venezuela , 0.10 mbd.
Non OPEC significant total liquids increases were 0.46 mbd from the former USSR ( Russia , Azerbaijan , Kazakhstan and others ) and 0.25 mbd of biofuels from outside of Brazil and USA .
Non OPEC significant total liquids decreases were from Mexico , 0.12 mbd ; Canada , 0.19 mbd ; and Norway , a big decrease of 0.71 mbd .
Is future total liquids production likely to exceed the current peak of 86.13 mbd on July 2006 ?
It might be possible but it appears unlikely .
Maintenance in the North Sea would be mainly responsible for the big drop in Norway ’s production .
After the maintenance is finished , North Sea production should increase in the next few months but then North Sea production should resume its decline .
Mexico 's production is in decline now .
Former USSR production might increase by a small amount .
Canada 's production should increase slowly but the oil sands are experiencing production constraints and despite claimed reserves of up to 315 Gb ( billion barrels ) , the oil sands will probably produce , at best , a maximum of only 2.5 mbd ( million barrels / day ) .
Biofuels production should also continue increasing .
Non OPEC total liquids production might increase slowly , assuming that no unexpected disruptions occur .
In order for world total liquids production to exceed the current peak , OPEC total liquids production must also increase .
OPEC meets next in September to potentially discuss production levels .
However , OPEC will increase production if its members agree to increase production and if the many old OPEC oil fields are physically capable of increasing production .
However , OPEC member Iran does not expect that production rates will be on the agenda .
OPEC may have some capability to increase production but their remaining oil reserves could have a higher monetary value by holding production at current levels and selling remaining oil at higher prices later .
The challenges of increasing world production are highlighted by the former Saudi Aramco exploration and production head , Sadad Al - Husseini , who made this recent statement regarding the new sentiment of oil producers :
There has been a paradigm shift in the energy world whereby oil producers are no longer inclined to rapidly exhaust their resource for the sake of accelerating the misuse of a precious and finite commodity .
This sentiment prevails inside and outside of OPEC countries but has yet to be appreciated among the major energy consuming countries of the world .
Al - Husseini also made this statement in 2005 about the physical ability of the world to increase production :
‘‘ You look at the globe and ask , ‘ Where are the big increments ? ’ and there ’s hardly anything but Saudi Arabia , ’’ he said .
‘‘ The kingdom and Ghawar field are not the problem .
That misses the whole point .
The problem is that you go from 79 million barrels a day in 2002 to 82.5 in 2003 to 84.5 in 2004 .
You ’re leaping by two million to three million a year , and if you have to cover declines , that ’s another four to five million . ’’
In other words , if demand and depletion patterns continue , every year the world will need to open enough fields or wells to pump an additional six to eight million barrels a day — at least two million new barrels a day to meet the rising demand and at least four million to compensate for the declining production of existing fields .
‘‘ That ’s like a whole new Saudi Arabia every couple of years , ’’ Husseini said .
‘‘ It ca n’t be done indefinitely .
It ’s not sustainable . ’’
It is possible , but unlikely that world total liquids production will exceed the current peak of 86.13 mbd because this would require simultaneous and significant production increases from both OPEC and non-OPEC countries .
As world total liquids production is forecast to decrease to 2012 ( Fig 1 ) , two important consequences are likely to occur .
First , as demand is forecast to increase , prices are forecast to rise , using short and long run price elasticities , which will force demand downwards to equal supply .
Second , the decreased available supply may invoke the IEA Response System for Oil Supply Emergencies .
Unexpected supply reductions could trigger oil rationing among the 26 countries which are signatories to this IEA Response System , but unfortunately China , Russia , India and Brazil , which are not signatories , are highly unlikely to agree to the IEA ’s rationing method .
The resulting tensions , from oil supply shortages , among the signatory and non-signatory countries could lead not only to continued competitive oil bidding , but also to continued conflicts and violence in order to secure vital oil supplies .
2. World Crude Oil & Lease Condensate Production
The largest component of world total liquids production is world C&C production .
The first part , 2007 to 2012 , of the forecast to 2100 ( Fig 2 ) , is created using a bottom up forecast based on over 300 continuously updated regions / projects from 2007 to 2012 ( Fig 3 ) .
After 2012 , two scenarios are shown .
The first , the unlikely forecast scenario , shown by the green line , uses BP Annual Statistics Review 2006 proven reserves data which include grossly overstated OPEC reserves data .
The second , the most likely forecast scenario , shown by the dark red line , is based partly on the BP reserves data , but large downward revisions are made to OPEC reserves and small upward revisions are made to the reserves of many countries to derive a more accurate estimate of proven and probable reserves .
Yet to find C&C reserves are added to this estimate of proven and probable reserves to give world total ultimate recoverable reserves ( URR ) of 1.82 Tb ( trillion barrels ) including remaining URR of 0.78 Tb as at end 2006 .
Fig 2 - World Crude Oil & Lease Condensate Production to 2100 - click to enlarge
World C&C production continues to retain its May 2005 peak and is forecast to decline by 1 % / yr until 2009 .
The decline rate steepens to 4% / yr until 2012 .
The main reason for the end of the total liquids plateau in 2009 ( Fig 1 ) is that the C&C production decline rate changes from 1 % / yr to 4% / yr in 2009 .

3. Peak Production and Peak Discovery Time Lags
Although the forecast production decline rate in Fig 2 appears high , it is a natural time lagged response to the peak year for discoveries as shown in this section .
Fig 4 shows the peak discovery year in 1965 , followed by a steady decline in the discovery rate .
For every year since the mid 1980s , annual production has been greater than annual discoveries .
This is not sustainable and it is inevitable that world annual production will start to decline .
This timing of peak production and rate of decline is forecast by Fig 2 .
Fig 4 - World Discoveries ( source ASPO Ireland Newsletter No. 80 , August 2007 ) - click to enlarge
The figure below focuses on giant oil field discoveries and shows a similar shape to the figure above .
The number of giant oil fields discovered peaked in the 1960 - 69 decade and both the number of giant fields and their respective recoverable reserves have declined steadily .
The shape of the discovery decline curve below from 1960 to 2006 is similar to the production decline curve ( Fig 2 ) from 2005 to 2100 .
Fig 5 - World Discoveries , Giant Oil Fields ( source Giant Oil Fields – The Highway to Oil , Fredrik Robelius , March 2007 ) - click to enlarge
A very good example of the time lag between peak discovery and peak production is the USA ( Fig 6 ) .
Peak discovery was 1930 and peak production occurred 42 years later in 1972 .
Fig 4 shows peak discovery for the world occurred in 1965 .
Fig 3 predicts that peak production occurred in 2005 , which is 40 years later than peak discovery , a similar time lag to the USA .

4. World Crude Oil & Lease Condensate Production Changes
Year on year production changes , represented by the green bars in Figures 7 and 8 below , show the biggest declines for Mexico , North Sea and Saudi Arabia and the biggest increases for Russia , Azerbaijan and Angola .
Angola has many projects which should increase its production capacity but actual production rates may be limited to OPEC quota targets of about 2 mbd which are likely to be “ assigned this year or early 2008 ” according to the OPEC Secretary General .
Russia ’s mature field production will probably limit Russia ’s future production growth .
Month on month changes from Mar 2007 to Apr 2007 ( Fig 7 ) , represented by the light blue bars , indicate that the reduction of militant action in Nigeria helped increase its production .
Over the same time period , Russia showed a small decrease in production , assumed to be caused by seasonal maintenance , while Iraq , USA , Australia , China and the North Sea showed small increases .
Fig 7 - World Crude Oil & Lease Condensate Production Changes to April 2007 - click to enlarge
Month on month changes from Apr 2007 to May 2007 ( Fig 8 ) show an unfortunate fall in Nigeria ’s production due presumably to increased militant action .
Production also fell for Canada , Kazakhstan and the North Sea , assumed to be due to seasonal maintenance .
The production drop for Mexico is due mainly to continued geological decline as PEMEX announced that “ oil reserves may run out in seven years ” .
Also from Apr 2007 to May 2007 , Canada decreased C&C production by almost 0.10 mbd , despite the optimism about oil sands .
Russia showed a small increase in production of only 0.02 mbd .
Could this mean that Russia ’s C&C production is on a plateau ?
The large total drop of 0.51 mbd in world C&C production from Apr 2007 to May 2007 should reverse in the coming months as maintenance activities are completed .
Hopefully some easing of militant attacks will allow Nigeria ’s production to also increase .
Fig 8 - World Crude Oil & Lease Condensate Production Changes to May 2007 - click to enlarge
World C&C production is dropping , on a year on year basis , by about 0.20 mbd ( Figs 7 & 8 ) .
This is not a high decline rate but given that Russia is probably unable and unwilling to increase production and that Saudi Arabia , the North Sea and Mexico are unlikely to reverse their decline rates , the world C&C production rate will continue to decline ( Fig 3 ) .
5. Saudi Arabia Crude Oil & Lease Condensate Production
Saudi Arabia remains a key producer in the world and continually reminds the world of its enormous reserves and surplus production capacity .
This paragraph on capacity in IEA 's 12 June 2007 Oil Market Report , page 15 , explains Saudi Arabia ’s current surplus capacity situation within an OPEC context .
Notional spare capacity stands at 4.0 mb/d , while our measure of effective spare capacity ( excluding Indonesia , Iraq , Nigeria and Venezuela ) stands at 2.85 mb/d .
Although these volumes are physically producible , even this lower figure likely overstates what OPEC could actually shift onto the market given current prices and shortages in refinery upgrading capacity .
Heavy , sour Saudi Arabian and Kuwaiti crude accounts for 88 % of the effective spare capacity figure .
In the absence of substantial discounts , these volumes might struggle to find buyers while sizeable amounts of refinery upgrading capacity remain offline for scheduled and unscheduled maintenance .
Readily marketable spare crude capacity may therefore be much lower , and a more accurate reflection of current market tightness .
In other words , this IEA paragraph says that the world has only 0.35 mb/d spare capacity of readily marketable light sweet crude because the spare capacities of 2.20 mb/d from Saudi Arabia and 0.30 mb/d from Kuwait are hard to sell heavy sour crudes .
In August 2007 , energy analyst Bill Herbert reaffirmed IEA ’s views when he said that “ even if OPEC decides to open the spigot a bit more , it ’s hardly a guarantee prices would stay in check .
Most of OPEC ’s spare capacity is in heavy sour crude oil , which must be processed in types of refineries that already are running at full capacity .
There ’s very little ability on the part of the supply system to respond to more demand ” .
Furthermore , the EIA Short Term Energy Outlook , 7 August 2007 stated that “ The low level of surplus OPEC oil production capacity , which is primarily in heavy crude oil , remains a key reason for the continued tight market conditions …
Further , the apparent unwillingness by OPEC to use available surplus capacity in the face of rising crude oil prices reduces any downward price impact that additional surplus capacity might have . ”
Given these statements by the IEA , Herbert and the EIA , the following forecast assumes no effective spare capacity of easily marketable Saudi Arabia crude .
It is also assumed that Saudi Arabia will produce their fields while maintaining the annual depletion rate , which is annual production as a percentage of ultimate recoverable remaining reserves , at less than about 5.3 % / yr .
This should ensure that reservoir damage does not occur due to overproduction from their fields .
The figure of 5.3% / yr was selected because the annual depletion rate of remaining reserves reached a peak of 5.3 % / yr in the third quarter of 2006 ( Fig 9 ) , based upon estimated ultimate recoverable reserves ( URR ) of 175 Gb for Saudi Arabia .
This figure of 5.3 % / yr could be too optimistic .
Tariq Shafiq , a petroleum engineer who was Vice President and Executive Director of the Iraq National Oil Company ( INOC ) , said that a depletion rate of 4 - 5 % is well within good reservoir management for large fields .
In addition , Colin Campbell stated on page 7 of his ASPO Ireland Newsletter No. 80 , August 2007 that “ a Depletion Rate of 4.2 % ... sounds quite reasonable for a mature country like Kuwait , compared for example with 6.5 % in the United Kingdom or 4.5 % in the US - 48 ” .
If a lower forecast annual depletion rate is assumed then Saudi Arabia ’s production rate would drop faster than is forecast ( Fig 9 ) .
The estimated URR of 175 Gb is equal to 155 Gb of non heavy crude plus 20 Gb of heavy crude .
Although the heavy sour crude fields of Safaniya and Manifa may ultimately produce much more than 20 Gb , only 20 Gb is assigned because this low quality crude is difficult to market and difficult to process by refineries .
The non heavy crude URR of 155 Gb includes 85 Gb for Ghawar ( light ) , 15 Gb for Abqaiq ( extra light ) , 8 Gb for Berri ( extra light ) and the remaining URR is assigned to Aramco ’s other non heavy crude fields including Marjan , Qatif , Khurais , Zuluf , Shaybah , Abu Safah and Khursaniyah .
The estimated URR is based mainly on the information sources about Saudi Arabia , located at the end of this article .
The possibility of a lower Saudi Arabia total URR exists .
Based on this mathematical technique , this recent research “ suggests that the Saudi Qt ( or total URR ) is only 150 Gb , which in turn suggests that Saudi Arabia is now over 70 % depleted , with about 40 Gb in remaining recoverable reserves . ”
A 2006 research paper , using the same method , estimated a total URR of 160 Gb , as shown in this plot .
Another source of oil reserves , prior to nationalization of Saudi Aramco in 1980 , is a report titled “ Critical Factors Affecting Saudi Arabia ’s Oil Decisions ” , published by the US General Accounting Office in 1978 .
As referenced on page 72 of Twilight in the Desert , this report stated that the remaining proven reserves as at the end of 1976 was 110 Gb with 70 Gb in the four super giants of Ghawar , Safaniya , Abqaiq and Berri .
Cumulative production from these four giant fields was 26 Gb and cumulative production for all Saudi Arabia was 29 Gb .
Thus , total proven reserves ( produced and remaining ) at the end of 1976 was equal to 139 Gb ( 29 Gb plus 110 Gb ) , of which 96 Gb ( 26 Gb plus 70 Gb ) was attributable to the four super giants and 43 Gb ( 3 Gb plus 40 Gb ) was attributable to the rest of the fields .
This figure of 139 Gb does not include probable reserves , unlike total URR , and is less than the total URR estimates of 150 Gb and 160 Gb from the two research sources above .
Allowing for the inclusion of probable reserves and only small discoveries since the last giant field Shaybah was found in 1968 , an appreciation from 139 Gb to the total URR of 175 Gb appears reasonable .
As of June 2007 , Aramco ’s total cumulative C&C production is 112 Gb , being 64 % of the URR 175 Gb .
Over half of the 112 Gb has been produced from the super giant Ghawar .
Abqaiq , Berri and Safaniya have also been significant producers .
Aramco has produced over half of the estimated URR and the production curve is forecast to follow a typical post peak decline curve , shown by the red line in Fig 9 .
Unfortunately , the new production capacities from AFK , Shaybah expansion , Nuayyim and Khurais are not enough to offset decline from existing fields .
Aramco has scheduled Manifa last because it will produce heavy oil which is less marketable than lighter grades .
Fig 9 - Saudi Arabia Crude Oil & Lease Condensate Production to 2020 ( bottom up forecast ) - click to enlarge
Figs 9 and 10 have been updated for Aramco ’s most recent project schedule , released in June 2007 , which no longer includes originally scheduled expansion from both Al Khafji ( Neutral Zone , 0.30 mbd , 2011 ) and Shaybah phase 2 expansion ( 0.25 mbd , 2010 ) .
Furthermore , Aramco ’s recent project schedule showed Khurais start - up on June 2009 , but now a recent press release dated 25 July 2007 , on Saudi Aramco ’s website states that Khurais is “ scheduled for the end of 2009 ” , which is assumed to be December 2009 for Figs 9 and 10 .
Although Khurais is forecast to produce 1.1 mbd , Matt Simmons doubts that Khurais will produce 0.8 mbd .
This report stated that the “ Khurais field west of the giant Ghawar field could potentially increase Saudi production by a further 800,000 b/d ” and another report made a similar statement “ Another potential project , at the Khurais field , could increase Saudi production capacity by 800,000 bbl/d ” .
These statements indicate that the forecast production of 1.1 mbd from Khurais might be too high .
There are three forecast scenarios from 2007 to 2080 , shown in Fig 10 .
The solid red line shows a “ Do Nothing ” forecast scenario .
This represents a production decline rate of 8%/ yr which is equivalent to ultimate recoverable reserves of 148 Gb ( billion barrels ) .
This scenario is highly unlikely but serves as a useful lower bound for the forecast production profile .
The “ New Peak ? ” dashed red line represents a scenario for which another peak is attained .
However , the inset in the chart explains that another 1.75 mbd would be required from other projects and infill drilling .
This is highly unlikely and predicts that a peak in 2005 has passed .
The “ Bottom Up ” dark blue line in Fig 10 represents the most likely scenario and includes the bottom up forecast to 2020 from Fig 9 , followed by an annual production decline rate of 5%/yr .
Fig 10 - Saudi Arabia Crude Oil & Lease Condensate Production to 2080 - click to enlarge
Saudi Arabia has never directly admitted that it has passed peak C&C production , but in August 2004 a former OPEC president , Purnomo Yusgiantoro , admitted that “ oil prices were at crazy levels , but that OPEC was powerless to cool the market …
There is no more supply ” .
Thus , based on Yusgiantoro ’s statement , in August 2004 , Saudi Arabia ’s C&C production was at maximum capacity of 9.5 mbd , up by a significant 1.1 mbd from April 2004 ( EIA ) .
Furthermore , on 11 April 2006 , according to this source and requoted here , Platts quoted a Saudi Aramco spokesman saying that “ Saudi Aramco ’s mature crude oil fields are expected to decline at a gross average rate of 8% / yr without additional maintenance and drilling ” and that “ This maintain potential drilling in mature fields combined with a multitude of remedial actions and the development of new fields , with long plateau lives , lowers the composite decline rate of producing fields to around 2 % . ”
Therefore , as of April 2006 , Aramco ’s crude oil production was forecast by this Aramco spokesman to decline at 2%/ yr which means that Saudi Arabia has passed peak crude oil production .
These three sources provide additional information about Saudi Arabia ’s production decline rates .
Aramco Senior Vice President Abdullah Saif admitted that “ One challenge for the Saudis in achieving this objective is that their existing fields sustain 5 percent - 12 percent annual " decline rates , " ( as reported in Petroleum Intelligence Weekly and the International Oil Daily ) meaning that the country needs around 500,000 - 1 million bbl/d in new capacity each year just to compensate ” .
The Schlumberger CEO said that “ the industry is dealing with a phenomenon that is exaggerated by the lack of investment over the past 18 years .
This phenomenon is the decline rate for the older reservoirs that form the backbone of the world ’s oil production , both in and out of OPEC .
An accurate average decline rate is hard to estimate , but an overall figure of 8 % is not an unreasonable assumption . ”
The EIA also stated that a “ challenge for the Saudis in achieving their strategic vision to add production capacity is that their existing fields sustain , on average , 6 to 8 percent annual " decline rates ” ( as reported by Platts Oilgram ) in existing fields , meaning that the country needs around 700,000 bbl/d in additional capacity each year just to compensate for natural decline . ”
Saudi Arabia C&C production was 9.5 mbd in August 2004 .
According to the previous EIA statement , Saudi Arabia needs 0.7 mbd additional capacity each year just to compensate for natural decline .
Therefore , three years later , by August 2007 , additional capacity of 2.1 mbd ( 3*0.7 mbd ) would have been required just to compensate for natural decline .
Since August 2004 there was a total capacity addition of only 1.1 mbd from these two projects as stated by Saudi Aramco ’s Press Kit on their website .
In late 2004 , Qatif ( including Abu Safah ) began operations with production capacity of 0.8 mbd and in early 2006 , 0.3 mbd capacity from Haradh III , 0.3 mbd ( Fig 9 ) , which leaves a shortfall of 1.0 mbd .
This implies that Saudi production in August 2007 is 8.5 mbd , 1.0 mbd less than the 9.5 mbd production in August 2004 , excluding capacity additions from infill drilling .
Accordingly , this number of 8.5 mbd is slightly less than the number of 8.6 mbd for July 2007 , from the EIA Short Term Energy Outlook , Table 3a , 7 August 2007 .
Based on the quotes and statements in this and the previous two paragraphs , it is highly unlikely that capacity additions from new projects , including infill drilling , are sufficient to compensate for existing production decline , and consequently the “ Bottom Up ” scenario in Fig 10 remains the most likely scenario .
6. Other Components of Total Liquids Production
Natural gas plant liquids show an increase in production due to OPEC projects from Saudi Arabia , Algeria , Iran and Qatar .
Saudi Aramco ’s most recent project schedule , released in June 2007 , shows two significant NGPL projects to be completed within a year : Hawiyah at 318,000 barrels / day and Khursaniyah at 290,000 barrels / day .
Fig 11 - World Natural Gas Plant Liquids Production to 2012 ( bottom up forecast ) - click to enlarge
Ethanol and XTL ( BTL , CTL and GTL ) production is forecast to double to 2012 .
Unfortunately , the increased production of government subsidised corn based ethanol in the USA is increasing the prices of many other food products .

Processing gains are defined by the EIA as “ The volumetric amount by which total output is greater than input for a given period of time .
This difference is due to the processing of crude oil into products which , in total , have a lower specific gravity than the crude oil processed . ”
These gains are forecast to decline slowly based on the decline in C&C ( Fig 3 ) .

Justice Dept 's apparent mission was to slur Dems , says former GOP Attorney General Jason Rhyne
Published : Wednesday October 24 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This Former US Attorney General Richard Thornburgh , a Republican who headed the Department of Justice under Presidents Reagan and George H.W. Bush , yesterday accused a US attorney in Pennsylvania of pursuing a politically motivated indictment of a prominent regional Democrat .
Now a a private sector attorney , Thornburgh represents a former county medical examiner , Cyril Wecht , who was indicted by a federal grand jury in 2006 .
In testimony before the House Judiciary Committee , which is conducting an ongoing probe into possible GOP steerage of Justice Department prosecutions , Thornburgh said his client 's indictment was pure politics .
" He has always been a contentious , outspoken , highly critical and highly visible Democratic figure in western Pennsylvania , " Thornburgh said of Wecht .
" In other words , he would qualify as an ideal target for a Republican U.S. attorney trying to curry favor with a department which demonstrated that if you play by its rules , you will advance . "
Wecht was indicted for purportedly instructing county employees to aid his private consulting business , and for giving unclaimed human cadavers to a a local university in exchange for free laboratory space .
Calling those charges " totally false and unfounded , " Thornburgh said that " Dr. Wecht -- the Democrat , scientist and educator -- was forthwith labeled a body snatcher and a media feeding frenzy ensued .
The U.S. attorney thus succeeded in the department 's apparent mission of casting Democrats in a negative light during the election year . "
But the US attorney in question , Mary Beth Buchanan , denied the accusations .
" The prosecution of Dr. Wecht is based solely on the facts and the law , " she said in a statement , as reported by the Los Angeles Times .
" The government intends to try this case in a court of law , where it belongs and is still pending . "
Thornburgh also charged that Buchanan avoided prosecuting Republicans within her jurisdiction .
" The fact that no investigation was undertaken stands out when Democrats in the western district of Pennsylvania have been investigated in such a highly visible manner , " Thornburgh said .
Republicans on the House Judiciary Panel , however , took issue with Thornburgh 's accusations .
" Your testimony . . . is the most pathetic example of innuendo and hearsay that I have seen , " said Rep. Ric Keller ( R - FL ) , during the hearing .
" The citizens of the United States must have confidence that the department is conducting itself ... without actual political influence or the appearance of political influence , " Thornburgh said .
" Unfortunately , that may no longer be the case . "
The House committee also heard testimony yesterday relating to another alleged instance of politicization within the Justice Department -- the case of former Alabama Governor Don Siegelman , a Democrat who is currently in federal prison serving time on corruption charges .
A GOP lawyer had previously testified to her belief that former White House advisor Karl Rove had encouraged the prosecution of Siegelman .
A video of a portion of Thornburgh 's remarks can be found at TPMMuckraker .
The transcript of his opening testimony follows below : # Thank you .
Chairman Scott , Chairman Conyers , Chairwoman Sanchez , Ranking Member Forbes and other members of the committee and subcommittees -- thank you for the opportunity to speak to you today about the significant dangers and serious harm that can be caused by the politicizing of federal criminal investigations and prosecutions by the U.S. Justice Department .
First and foremost , let me affirm my own belief that politics has no place in the decision making process of whether or not to charge citizens of the United States with any crime , federal or otherwise .
These citizens must have confidence that the Department of Justice is conducting itself in a fair and impartial manner without actual political influence or the appearance of political influence .
Unfortunately , that may no longer be the case .
Let me begin by stating that I come before you as an advocate representing Dr. Cyril Wecht , the former elected coroner of Allegheny County , Pennsylvania who is currently under indictment in the western district of Pennsylvania and in which proceedings my firm represents him .
Although the indictment contains 84 counts , it is not the type of case normally constituting a federal corruption case brought against a local official .
There is no allegation that Dr. Wecht ever solicited or received a bribe or kickback .
There is no allegation that Dr. Wecht traded on a conflict of interest in conducting the affairs of his elected office .
None of the traditional indicia of public corruption are presented in this case .
Instead , the prosecution of Dr. Wecht seeks to use the unprecedented theories which seek to convert a hodgepodge of alleged violations of home rule charters , county codes , and state ethic provisions into federal felonies .
Many of these alleged underlying violations do not even carry state - mandated penalties , yet are now utilized as a vehicle for federal felony prosecutions which brand the accused as a corrupt public servant .
A detailed summary of the shortcomings in these charges is set forth in my written statement especially at Pages 4 and 5 , which I ask be made part of the record .
Suffice to say , most of the charging counts allege what I would call nickel and dime transgressions which are sought to be converted into federal felony charges .
Some of these counts involve , for example , the use of office fax machines for personal business , such as the transmission of Dr. Wecht 's curriculum vitae and fee schedule to a local public defender seeking his assistance , and an executed contract for a teaching engagement , postal charges for mailing histological slides to attorneys in black lung cases who had consulted Dr. Wecht , and expense billings irregularities and invoices mailed to Dr. Wecht 's private clients .
A number of felony counts derived from alleged improper billing for use of a county car while traveling to outlying counties to assist local prosecutors and coroners .
Astonishingly , the government 's own evidence indicates that they knew prior to indictment that an audit of the billings of Dr. Wecht to the counties in question showed them to be 99.99 percent accurate -- a record that was nonetheless turned into 37 separate felony counts covering a total of $ 1,700 , and the list goes on .
What has come to pass is the realization of the often expressed fear that the generality and ambiguity of the mail fraud statutes could be used to expand federal jurisdiction so far into matters of state government that it could be used , as one judge put it , to regulate theft of pencils from an office supply cabinet .
The Congress might fairly be asked , " Is that what you intended ? " A similar expansion of Title XVIII U.S.C. 666A1A charges that Dr. Wecht in each year from 2001 to 2005 stole property valued at $ 5,000 or more -- charges not based on a classic theft required by law but in Dr. Wecht 's use of county personnel , equipment , resources , and yes , space of the coroner 's office to assist in his private business .
We thus found ourselves asking why would the U.S. attorney 's office for the western district of Pennsylvania attempt to make such a stretch of federal law .
With that background , we came to learn in part from your committee 's investigation as well as from various news accounts that the Department of Justice in its evaluation of its prosecutors in certain cases fired U.S. attorneys not for performance - based reasons but for political ones .
We came to learn that those United States attorneys who among other things aggressively pursued Democrats as opposed to those who did not remained in place or were promoted .
In fact , we learned from the study conducted by Mr. Shields and Mr. Kragen that this administration is seven times more likely to prosecute Democrats than Republicans .
Possessed of that information , the prosecution of Dr. Cyril Wecht takes on a different and troubling light .
Dr. Wecht is a prominent and highly visible Democrat in the predominantly Democratic region of the western district of Pennsylvania .
He is known nationally and internationally as one of the world 's leading forensic pathologists .
He often speaks and is retained to conduct autopsies on some of the county 's highest profile -- country 's highest profile cases .
In addition to Dr. Wecht 's renown in the area of forensic pathology , he has always been a contentious , outspoken , highly critical , and highly visible Democratic figure in western Pennsylvania .
In other words , he would qualify as an ideal target for a Republican U.S. attorney trying to curry favor with the department which demonstrated that if you play by its rules you will advance .
Ms. Buchanan must have observed this phenomenon first hand during her service as the director of the executive office of U.S. attorneys .
Dr. Wecht 's case , although high profile , was not the only apparent political prosecution in western Pennsylvania .
In addition to Dr. Wecht , U.S. Attorney Buchanan conducted highly visible grand jury investigations of the former Democratic mayor of Pittsburgh , Tom Murphy , and Peter DeFazio , the former Democratic sheriff of Allegheny County in which Pittsburgh is situated .
She also prosecuted some lesser known Democratic Party members in the sheriff 's office .
It should be noted that of these three high profile , very public Democratic prosecutions , one resulted in a misdemeanor macing plea , one resulted in no plea and an alternative resolution , and Dr. Wecht 's case remains pending .
All three Democrats were front page stories during the run-up to the 2006 elections .
During this same period , not one Republican officeholder was investigated and / or prosecuted by Ms. Buchanan 's office -- not one .
Although a whistleblower in Republican Congressman Tim Murphy 's office accused the congressman of using paid staff members in his election campaign , no investigation was conducted that we are aware of .
Despite a local outcry that former Republican Senator Rick Santorum was defrauding a local community by claiming residency when he actually resided in Virginia for purposes of having the school district pay for his children 's cyber schooling , we are aware of no investigation being conducted .
I cannot and do not opine on the merits of either case , but the fact that no investigation was undertaken stands out when Democrats in the Western District of Pennsylvania have been investigated and indicted in such a highly visible manner .
This stands as -- ( Thornburgh is interrupted by a question from the panel . )
We have stepped forth in our written statement , to which I refer once more , concerns we have about the conduct of the case agent -- FBI agent in this case , and I will refer you to that .
One might argue that Dr. Wecht is entitled to a day in court and he will have that day , but the public 's perception of apparent politics at the Department of Justice will not easily be changed or remedied no matter the outcome of this trial .
Sally Kalson , a veteran columnist for the Pittsburgh Post - Gazette , wrote in her column of July 22 , 2007 and I quote , " An ambitious and enthusiastic Bush partisan like U.S. Attorney Mary Beth Buchanan might well consider Dr. Wecht a plum target good for many brownie points at the White House . "
She further wrote and I quote again , " The jury has yet to convene on Dr. Wecht , but the verdict on the Bush administration is , loud and clear , 100 percent political . "
This is the unfortunate manner in which the Department of Justice is viewed in the Western District of Pennsylvania .
We should not allow any citizen of the United States to proceed to trial knowing that his prosecution may have been undertaken for political reasons as opposed to being done to serve the interest of justice .
Sadly , that appears to have been so in the case against Dr. Wecht .
And I thank you for the extended opportunity to appear before you today .

I ’ve only had Google Buzz now for about 24 hours , but I already feel that it has the potential to revolutionize the way people communicate with friends and family .
It ’s easy to look at Buzz as being Google ’s too - little - too - late competitor to Facebook , with a bit of Foursquare and a dash of Twitter thrown in .
But in my mind , Google took everything that is right about those services and threw out the crap .
Facebook is all about ego
If your Facebook home page is anything like mine , it is filled with junk .
Farmville this , Mafia Wars that , Joe has joined the Save the Manatees Group , Sarah is now friends with Fred .
I DON ’T CARE .
I ’ve filtered out most of this stuff with Facebook ’s “ hide ” settings , yet still , Facebook feels like High School to me .
From the way your friends are so prominently enumerated and displayed on your profile , to the endless lists of causes people join , all of it just reminds me of the ego - centric days of yore when all most people cared about was looking cool .
You see , Facebook ’s main focus , the page at it ’s core , is the profile page .
Your online persona .
Everything you do adds to that page like some sort of shiny bauble to be shown off .
If you ’re tagged in a photo , it shows up on your wall , if you become friends with someone , it shows up on your wall , people write directly on your wall , and all this in turn gets pushed out to your friends ’ feeds .
Too much noise , not enough signal .
Do n’t get me wrong , Facebook can be fun , and it does have it ’s occasional value .
Sometimes I actually see stuff on there that I care about from my friends and family .
It ’s just buried under tons of garbage .
Buzz is all about communication
Buzz takes Facebook and flips it around .
While your Google Profile , like your Facebook profile , does make up a part of the Buzz ecosystem , it ’s only ancillary .
This makes the mindset completely different .
Buzz does n’t bother telling me when someone starts following someone else , or if their relationship status has changed , or if they got a high score in some new game .
Buzz just makes it easy for people to communicate those things to me if they so choose .
This gives the whole service a different feel than Facebook .
Think more “ I want to show this to people , ” rather than “ look at me . ”
My email inbox is already where I go to communicate .
It makes perfect sense to make it easier for people to aggregate content into that space .
That is Buzz ’s true promise : help me share content and keep in touch .
Facebook can keep the posturing .
The identities of the bureau ’s experts have not been made public , Ms. Billingsley said , but they include chaplains and scholars in seminaries and at the American Academy of Religion .
Academy staff members said their organization had met with prison chaplains in the past but was not consulted on this effort , though it is possible that scholars who are academy members were involved .
The bureau has not provided additional money to prisons to buy the books on the lists , so in some prisons , after the shelves were cleared of books not on the lists , few remained .
A chaplain who has worked more than 15 years in the prison system , who spoke on condition of anonymity because he is a bureau employee , said : “ At some of the penitentiaries , guys have been studying and reading for 20 years , and now they are told that this material does n’t meet some kind of criteria .
It does n’t make sense to them .
They ’re asking , ‘ Why are our tapes being taken , why our books being taken ? ’ ”
Of the lists , he said , “ Many of the chaplains I ’ve spoken to say these are not the things they would have picked . ”
The effort is unnecessary , the chaplain said , because chaplains routinely reject any materials that incite violence or disparage , and donated materials already had to be approved by prison officials .
Prisoners can buy religious books , he added , but few have much money to spend .
Religious groups that work with prisoners have privately been writing letters about their concerns to bureau officials .
Would it not be simpler , they asked the bureau , to produce a list of forbidden titles ?
But the bureau did that last year , when it instructed the prisons to remove all materials by nine publishers — some Muslim , some Christian .
The plan to standardize the libraries first became public in May when several inmates , including a Muslim convert , at the Federal Prison Camp in Otisville , N.Y. , about 75 miles northwest of Manhattan , filed a lawsuit acting as their own lawyers .
Later , lawyers at the New York firm of Paul , Weiss , Rifkind , Wharton & Garrison took on the case pro bono .
They refiled it on Aug. 21 in the Federal District Court for the Southern District of New York .
It looks like DARPA 's newly - instated Urban Challenge is shaping up nicely , with this self - driving Isuzu SUV from Austin Robot Technology and the University of Texas now joining the likes of Team LUX's Volkswagen Passat and NC State 's Lotus Elise in competing for the top prize .
As with those other vehicles , the SUV ( dubbed Marvin ) is completely autonomous , relying on an array of sensors , video cameras , artificial intelligence , and machine - learning technology to ( hopefully ) avoid catastrophe as it motors about .
As you might guess , the Urban Challenge presents a few different obstacles for the vehicles to deal with than the Grand Challenge does , including intersections , improperly parked cars , and traffic laws that must be followed at all times .
Marvin still has a ways to go before it can get a chance to drive away a few million dollars richer , however , with it required to pass a basic driving test this summer and a national qualifier in October before it 's allowed to enter the big event in November .

Claim : Video demonstrates that 6 - volt lantern batteries contain 32 AA batteries .
FALSE
Example : [ Collected via the Internet , October 2007 ]
Received this video and I ’m not sure if it is valid or not .
Guess I could disassemble a 6 volt lantern battery and find out .
But as I recall from my high school chemistry days , and the warning on the side of the battery , it is full of stuff that could be dangerous to the average lay person .
Received this video and I ’m not sure if it is valid or not .
Guess I could disassemble alantern battery and find out .
But as I recall from my high school chemistry days , and the warning on the side of the battery , it is full of stuff that could be dangerous to the average lay person .
Essentially it states that if one needs a cheap source of AA sized batteries , by disassembling a 6 volt lantern battery , you will find 32 AA batteries inside of the 6 volt battery .
Origins :
This video purporting to demonstrate that 6 - volt lantern
batteries are actually made up of a casing enclosing 32 AA batteries is just a gag , another form of “ Fool ’s Errand “ intended to lure people into trying ( or at least believing in ) something non-existent .
Exactly what ’s inside 6 - volt lantern batteries can vary a bit from manufacturer to manufacturer ; they typically contain four individual cells that can be extracted ( opening up a battery is not a recommended procedure ) , but those cells are n’t necessarily batteries that would be of much use to the ordinary consumer .
A page displaying the removal of four 1.5V zinc - carbon cells from a 6 - volt battery can be found here , and the following video also shows the extraction of cells from within a 6 - volt battery :
Likewise , 9 - volt batteries also contain individual cells , but again those cells are n’t necessarily batteries of a kind that the typical consumer would have much use for .

Bureaucratic management , as distinguished from profit management , is the method applied in the conduct of administrative affairs the result of which has no cash value on the market .
~ Ludwig von Mises
When it comes to our health , one would assume that the government is there to protect us through reasonable and sensible regulations .
This is , however , far from the truth .
The FDA in particular has been the cause of misery for those who have been unable to legally seek cures and treatment , the result of which ranges anywhere from health complications to death .
Millions Hurt , Billions Wasted
Imagine that you are critically ill , terminally perhaps , and a new experimental treatment has just been discovered .
The doctors say that it ’s still very new , barely tested , but it shows early signs of promise .
You have tried every mainstream treatment available .
None of them have worked .
In a fit of complete desperation , you decide that , since you ’re going to die anyway , you might as well go out swinging .
You ask for the new treatment .
Your doctor is aghast !
Not only will he not be “ party to someone preying on you , ” he knows the new treatment is expensive and your insurance wo n’t cover it anyway .
Even if you can pay , the answer is a resounding , “ No . ” You ’re stuck .
But hey , at least they ’re looking out for you .
By the way , there are some who would say that this is exactly what happened to Coretta Scott King .
Regardless of the somewhat dicey background of the “ alternative medicine practitioner ” she went to see , it seems rather clear that the decision should have been hers , not some government agency , no matter how well - intentioned .
They and people like them protect you from yourself , but unfortunately , no one is available to protect you from them .
These appalling incidents are not , as many would think , exceptions .
They are indeed how the FDA works .
It holds a state monopoly on the ultimate decision - making ability when it comes to drug and treatment approval .
In other words , it ’s health socialism .
Instead of the patient making a decision ( with the help of doctors and other specialists ) , the one who gets the final word is a group of government “ experts ” who , through their decrees , have your best intentions in their selfless hearts .
Just a glance at some of the recent behavior from the FDA reaffirms the point .
When the FDA removes a senior scientist for voicing concerns about the safety of a product , one has to wonder what their real purpose might be .
When it comes to attacking private property and forcefully preventing peaceful exchange , the FDA is not a newbie .
On the contrary , they are quite experienced in the crackdown department .
For decades , the FDA has raided healers , vitamin shops and supplement companies .
Here we have people who are engaging in mutually beneficial exchange and in comes the almighty state to destroy it all .
Regardless of one ’s position on “ alternate ” medicine , what matters is that those willing to sell products have found others willing to buy them .
No one should have the right to impede that relationship .
In terms of its effects in the health industry , the FDA slows down the adoption of new technology , creating a chilling effect on development of potential life - saving treatments .
Instead of the new drugs , treatments and medical devices being immediately available to hospitals , physicians and patients , they have to go through a lengthy and expensive bureaucratic process .
This hurts patients , the ones who would otherwise be able to consume these new products and services .
And though companies are sometimes precluded from being unable to develop and sell their technology , they often benefit from intervention .
This is because only those who can afford to stay in business long enough to survive the FDA approval process are likely to receive such an approval .
Bigger companies , therefore , are able to marginalize smaller ones .
When we combine the nefarious Food and Drug Administration with other policies enacted by the national and local governments , the panorama is not quite a glorious one .
Medical patents , corporate welfare , subsidies , tariffs , quotas , regulations and a highly litigious legal system have established barriers that increase the cost of doing business .
As usual , we find high prices and low quality .
For some folks things are so bad that , just as foreigners travel to the U.S. for treatment that their FDA equivalent has prohibited , some locals are starting to travel to other countries to seek treatment that has been banned here .
If the above was n’t bad enough , what ’s worse is that since this is a government program financed through that pesky practice called taxation , the victims of the FDA are actually contributors to the very system that kills them .
The charade is over once we realize that the FDA , far from protecting , is actually victimizing its “ customers ” by forcing them into a closed set of choices ( and sometimes no choice at all ) .
Withdrawing one ’s consent exposes this agency ’s true criminal nature .
Capitalism : Cause or Cure ?
Looking at how insurers tend to influence health care in the U.S. one might reach the conclusion that the free market is the reason why people can’t obtain any type of care they wish .
While it is definitely true that insurers can negatively impact how one is treated , the real problem — as expected — extends from the interaction between the state and those who use the state to close down the market .
Regulation drives the market to take a certain shape and that shape precludes many of the choices that consumers would otherwise have .
Let ’s examine a couple of working cases .
Case 1 : Person
A is sick and he knows exactly what it will take to cure him .
He knows both where to obtain his cure and he knows that it will be effective .
He decides to obtain his cure from Person B .
How is this situation normally handled in a regulated market ?
First of all , Person B must be licensed to provide a cure of this type or likely any related services .
Based upon the laws in the locale , Person A or Person B , or both of them , could be breaking the law if they were to interact !
Consider the lunacy here .
A person with knowledge and desire is prevented from exercising his free will , and prevented from making a decision in his own self - interest simply because another organization — an organization only peripherally interested , if at all , in his health — has succeeded in controlling access to the market .
Make no mistake , licensing requirements are about little else but control of who can enter a market .
Conversely , how would the free market react ?
There would be no licensing ( state - enforced ) requirements .
Membership in any professional organizations would be voluntary .
While the consumer could take advantage of the recommendations of such a body , no outside influence could require it .
Those who wish to consume make the choices and those who wish to provide items for that consumption would be subject to market backlash if what they provide proves to be less than satisfactory .
Case 2 : Person
A is sick and has no idea what it will take to cure him .
He has heard of a cure that has promise , available from Person C , but the possible cure is expensive , due simply to high demand and small supply — that is , because of the market — and this price point will preclude him from obtaining it without help .
How is this situation normally handled in a regulated market ?
This situation would be handled exactly the same way as Case 1 , with licensing requirements , artificially smaller markets for cures , etc. Person A is stuck .
What about the free market ?
Even in a truly free market , it is still possible that Person A ’s insurance company could decide that certain treatments are “ outside the norms ” that would be automatically covered .
However , in all probability , there would exist insurers that specialized in “ risky ” or “ experimental ” treatments , versus the case now where all insurers ’ hands are tied by statist regulation .
These insurers could charge a higher premium from their customers , in exchange for allowing them to seek out the “ latest - and - greatest ” approaches to care .
In fact , purveyors of experimental cures would seek insurers out to get on their list of options !
Again , with no state to artificially shrink the supply , the “ pull ” of the market — demand for the treatments — would automatically require insurers to cover more options or risk losing customers .
It ’s also possible that the drug manufacturers and other health specialists , eager to show insurers ( as well as hospitals and doctors ) that their treatment is safe , would pay for and publicize their latest test results .
Like today , they might also pay for the costs of this experimental treatment .
What these two simple examples are intended to show is that capitalism , sometimes reduced to “ the profit motive ” does not , by itself preclude any option for which there is a market .
In fact , it is only mechanisms intended to reduce choice and implemented with the help of the state that can do this .
Without intervention , choices rise to their highest natural level and poor choices are weeded out automatically .
With intervention — in the manner of licensing requirements , regulations , etc. — choices fall to the level most appropriate to make those “ pulling the strings ” the most wealthy , and shield those responsible from the costs normally doled out by the market .
Errors
The FDA intervenes in the economy by being the only organization with the power to determine which products can be bought , sold , imported and used .
As such , any errors that it makes impact everyone .
There are two kinds of errors that the FDA can make : Type I and Type II .
Also called a “ false positive , ” a Type I error , in the context of the FDA ’s testing system , means not approving a drug or treatment that should be approved .
Conversely , a Type II error , also called a “ false negative ” in the context of the FDA ’s testing system , means approving a drug or treatment that should not be approved .
Setting the criteria for efficacy too tight means that tests that should be allowed to be sold are not .
Setting the criteria for efficacy too loose means that tests that are either ineffective or dangerous get through .
So besides having to arbitrarily determine the criteria for testing and coming up with a metric to determine safety , the FDA also has to gamble a bit , for it is simply impossible for it to assume that every drug it approves will not have a detrimental effect on anyone who uses it .
Nor can it guarantee that drugs it prohibits would not have worked on some .
At this point we would like to point out that errors do exist in the free market .
The difference , however , between the market and the state is that the latter lacks a negative feedback mechanism .
In the market , if a company makes a mistake , it can be severely punished by the customers .
With the government , no such thing happens .
When the FDA makes a mistake , it does n’t go away or downsize ; it cannot be boycotted or legally bypassed ; one cannot seek alternate quality control and certification systems .
In fact , we are perpetually tied to the FDA and any state agency through taxation .
The state has no incentive to be more effective by controlling cost or increasing quality because it can always rely on a constant influx of funds .
Private enterprise , on the other hand , has to rely on the repeat satisfaction of its customers for it continue to stay in business and prosper .
Again , the problem is not that errors exist , but rather that when you have a monopoly on drug and treatment testing , when there are errors , some of the key people responsible are unfairly insulated from the backlash .
Responsibility without negative consequence always breeds inefficiency and corruption .
Imagine that instead of a monolithic FDA we had a myriad of competing agencies .
It is the purpose of the testing agency to offer comprehensive and reliable reports on new technologies and to offer insurance companies , hospitals , physicians , and the public in general , an idea of the risks involved with treatments .
Therefore if an agency states that drug X contains significant risks ( let ’s say an above number of severe side effects ) , it would make this information available .
Other agencies , whose clients depend on them for accurate information , would almost certainly jump on this and either corroborate or rebuff the report about drug X .
The FDA has implanted a one - size - fits - all regimen , eliminating choice and crowding out potential advances in the health care industry .
Our recommendation ?
Abolish the FDA .
Conclusion
Medical treatment socialism is but one of the many ways that the state makes our lives less livable .
In their magnanimous quest to keep us safe from ourselves , they ultimately close many critical avenues that would have saved thousands ( maybe millions by now ) of lives .
The state kills .
But do not despair .
It ’s For Your Own Good .
The Best of Manuel Lora
Partly it was the midnight bicycle rides the man took around the nearby lake , wearing sunglasses and a thick woolly hat .
Partly it was his insatiable penchant for takeaway food , his apparent reluctance to leave his house and the fact that he never answered his telephone .
Mostly , however , Mr Amaral was suspicious of the constantly changing appearance of the 44 - year - old expat .
" It was n't just me .
All of the guards thought he was kind of mafioso , " he said .
" He used all these different hats .
He changed his hair all the time ; first it was black , then blond and then white .
He had sideburns , then a moustache , and he wore dark glasses .
All of the windows of his cars were blacked out . "
What Mr Amaral did not realise was that the reclusive resident was Juan Carlos Ramírez - Abadía - a 44 - year - old drug kingpin described this week as one of the world 's most wanted narco - traffickers .
Abadía , who was seized at his Morada dos Lagos hideout on Tuesday by Brazilian federal police and was better known as Chupeta , or Lollipop , is accused of ordering more than 300 murders and smuggling billions of dollars worth of cocaine into the United States and Europe .
South American newspapers have described Abadía , who is charged with leading the Norte del Valle , Colombia 's largest cocaine cartel , as the heir to Pablo Escobar .
One key business partner , it emerged this week , was Juan Carlos Ortiz Escobar , the nephew of the infamous Medellín drug boss .
Fortress
Nestled in the eucalyptus - covered hilltops outside Sao Paulo , the fortress - like Morada dos Lagos condominium is the perfect place for somebody seeking privacy .
The leafy , gated community is hemmed in by a towering , 3,500 - volt electric fence and is policed day and night by a private security force armed with revolvers and machetes .
A large sign , near the estate 's entrance , promises everything a rich Brazilian businessman , or indeed a fugitive drug trafficker , could dream of : " Security , tranquillity and harmony . "
It was here , about two years ago , that Abadía began to build his Brazilian HQ , administering his global cocaine empire from a luxury mansion , equipped with a gym and swimming pool .
Last Tuesday his fiefdom began to crumble as dozens of federal police swept into the mansion and arrested the Colombian .
He was dressed , according to witnesses , in just his underpants .
Abadía 's life as a cocaine capo reportedly began in 1986 .
A university - educated horse enthusiast from the city of Palmira in south - west Colombia , he joined the Cali cartel in the mid-1990s at a time when it dominated the Colombian cocaine market following the 1993 killing of Pablo Escobar .
After a 1995 crackdown on the Cali cartel , Colombian authorities say he switched to the Norte del Valle cartel , becoming one of its leaders .
In 1996 he was sentenced to 13 years in prison in Colombia but by 2001 he was free again .
Keen never to return to jail , Abadía plotted his escape to Brazil .
According to a statement given to Brazilian police this week , he boarded a small boat bound for Brazil 's north - eastern coast in 2004 , carrying $ 4 m ( £ 2 m ) in cash .
From the north - eastern state of Ceara he travelled in a small aircraft to Barretos , a town in the interior of Sao Paulo state .
Soon after this he set up camp in the Morada dos Lagos , one of five secluded condominiums in Aldeia da Serra , 20 miles from the centre of Sao Paulo .
Police claim Abadía commanded a sprawling network of businesses from here - among them a jet ski outlet , cattle ranches and hotels - which were used to launder the profits from cocaine sales in the US and Europe .
Some estimates this week suggested the trafficker was worth as much as $ 1.8 bn .
He also purchased farms and luxury homes across Brazil .
The £ 500,000 Sao Paulo mansion , which the Guardian visited this week , was packed with designer furniture , top - of - the - range electronic equipment and nearly $ 1 m in cash .
He shared the house with his Colombian wife , and two miniature pinscher designer dogs , one of which was keeping a lonely watch from the master bedroom this week as federal police scoured the house for fake walls and hidden evidence .
Abadía kept the lowest possible profile at Morada dos Lagos .
The estate 's 39 - year - old manager , Marco Antonio de Souza , said he rarely left his house and had no guests .
Instead the Colombian preferred to order takeaways from the local bakery , La Ville , and watch DVDs on his 1.8 - metre ( 72 inch ) plasma screen TV .
He never answered the telephone , the condominium 's receptionist said .
" He never said anything to us , " said Mr Amaral .
" He 'd just raise his hand and make gestures . "
Occasionally , it seems , he did leave his lair , not least to undergo several major sessions of plastic surgery at a well - known clinic in Sao Paulo 's chic Jardins neighbourhood .
Mugshots released by the federal police this week showed wounds on Abadía 's face - proof , they said , that he had undergone a recent operation , possibly his sixth .
The trafficker also used a series of false passports and names .
At the time of his arrest he was posing as an Italian citizen and using a passport issued in Argentina .
He also possessed nearly 150 mobile phones , using each one only once so as not to be traced .
But despite his constant attempts to lie low , Brazilian authorities were gradually closing in on the trafficker for whom the US government was offering a $ 5 m bounty .
His downfall reportedly began in 2005 , triggered by a minor plane accident in the southern city of Curitiba involving a pilot who was helping smuggle money into the country for Abadía .
According to the Brazilian media , police became suspicious about the amount of money found on the light aircraft , which was being used by the pilot , Andre Luiz Telles Barcellos .
Two years of secretive investigation , which eventually led to Abadía , followed .
His fate was apparently sealed when Brazilian authorities sent a sample of the Colombian 's voice picked up by a phone tap to the US drug enforcement administration ( DEA ) .
Using voice - recognition technology , US agents were able to confirm that the suspect , whose appearance had been radically altered by surgery , was their target .
Then , at dawn on Tuesday , the hunt for the Americas ' most wanted trafficker came to an end .
It was just after 2 am when seven black cars belonging to the federal police pulled up at the Morada dos Lagos guardhouse .
Minutes later the officers , with two agents from the DEA , were pouring up the trafficker 's lawn and past his illuminated , miniature palm trees .
The officers forced open the building 's thick , triple - bolted front door and pushed their way inside .
They first stumbled across the trafficker 's naked wife , according to one security guard who was present .
Extradition
Mr Barcellos , the pilot , was also arrested in Tuesday 's operation , and stands accused of helping the Colombian smuggle millions in cash into Brazil .
Abadía 's arrest came in stark contrast to his cinematic life as a drug trafficker .
According to Mr Amaral , who accompanied the police operation at the house , the Colombian offered no resistance and spent much of the day sat on his bed , handcuffed and wearing only his underwear .
" I 'll have my whole life to talk to you when I 'm there [ in the US ] , " he told the DEA agents , according to reports in one Brazilian newspaper , referring to his possible extradition to the US .
This week , as federal agents continued to quiz the Colombian in central Sao Paulo and US authorities began the extradition process , the manager of the Morada dos Lagos was keen to point out that there was still no evidence that any crime had been committed at the millionaires ' estate .
He pointed to the condominium 's electric fence which , he said , was capable of throwing off any unwelcome visitors at least three metres .
" There 's never been a single crime here , " Mr Souza insisted , as a second federal police vehicle pulled up outside the Colombian drug baron 's home to continue the search .
Meanwhile , there were reports in Brazil yesterday that security had been stepped up at the federal police 's HQ in Sao Paulo , due to fears that allies of the reputed drug lord could attempt to rescue him .
Hideout of choice
Brazil has long been considered a popular hideout for those fleeing the long arm of the law , including Nazi war criminals , cocaine traffickers and political fugitives .
Reports in the Brazilian press this week suggest several other major Colombian traffickers may be at large in the South American country .
Analysts say Brazil 's popularity among traffickers is down to the relative ease with which money can be laundered there , as well as the availability of chemicals used to transform coca leaves into cocaine .
Brazil 's most famous expat fugitive was Ronnie Biggs , one of the Great Train Robbers , who spent nearly 30 years in self - imposed exile in Rio .
The Italian mafia has also used Brazil as a refuge .
According to the Rio newspaper O Globo , some 100 members of the mafia were extradited from Rio to Italy from 1994 to 2004 .

In a twist of legal irony , BitTorrents site Pirate Bay of Sweden announced on its blogFriday that it has alerted Swedish authorities over allegations that it has been the subject of " infrastructural sabotage , " " denial of service attacks , " hacking " and " spamming " by some of the biggest names in the media .
The alleged evidence comes from some of the 6,000 e-mails and other information the clandestine group , MediaDefender - Defenders posted Saturday on BitTorrents sites .
MediaDefenders - Defenders said it obtained the information from hacking e-mails from California 's MediaDefender , a company that charges Hollywood to police their copyrights .
The Pirate Bay has been under considerable scrutiny from MediaDefender and the entertainment industry because the Bay posts links to tracker files that can be used to download copyrighted movies for free .

Two and a half years ago , Public Interest Watch , a self - described watchdog of nonprofit groups , wrote to the Internal Revenue Service urging the agency to audit Greenpeace and accusing the environmental group of money laundering and other crimes .
Last September , the IRS began a months - long audit of the U.S. arm of Greenpeace , known for steering its boats in the way of whaling ships and oil tankers .
This month , Greenpeace says , it received notice from the IRS that the group " continues to qualify for exemption from federal income tax " as a nonprofit entity .
Greenpeace says an IRS auditor told it that the PIW letter triggered the audit .
The IRS wo n't say how it decided to audit Greenpeace .
What is clear is where PIW has gotten a lot of its funding : Exxon Mobil Corp. , the giant oil company that has long been a target of Greenpeace protests .
" I believe organizations should be scrutinized and audited , but I just do n't believe you should get targeted because ... you 're a critic of Exxon Mobil , " said John Passacantando , executive director of Greenpeace USA , the U.S. affiliate of Amsterdam - based Greenpeace International .
Exxon Mobil confirmed that it has provided funds to PIW , but said that it was n't aware of the IRS audit and that it played no role in initiating the audit .
In an email , company spokesman Mark D. Boudreaux said : " PIW 's stated mission of ensuring that charitable organizations spend donations in accordance with their charitable tax status is a laudable public policy goal . "
Another spokesman , Russ Roberts , added : " It 's hard for us to have sympathy for an organization that would complain that the IRS audited them . "
Exxon Mobil said it funds think tanks and other groups that agree with its positions on global warming and other issues .
Eric L. Smith , an IRS spokesman , said that under federal law , he can't discuss the Greenpeace case .
He said a nonpartisan IRS panel of career professionals reviews allegations against nonprofit groups to determine whether an audit is warranted .
Reviews of the agency 's decision - making process , he said , " have tended to find as a general rule that we are fair and even - handed . "
According to its
Web site , PIW was founded in 2002 " in response to the growing misuse of charitable funds by nonprofit organizations and the lack of effort by government agencies to deal with the problem . "
Its motto : " Keeping an Eye on the Self - Appointed Guardians of the Public Interest . "
It was founded by Michael J. Hardiman , a Washington - based lobbyist and public - relations consultant who previously worked for a Republican congressman .
As a lobbyist , he has represented the American Conservative Union and the American Trucking Association , among other groups .
The PIW Web site says the group 's initial funding came from " business organizations . "
In an interview , Mr. Hardiman declined to name any of those sources .
He said he left PIW in February 2004 to work in Iraq as a civilian employee of the Defense Department .
His successor at PIW , Lewis Fein , who serves as interim executive director , also declined to name any of the group 's funders .
PIW 's most recent federal tax filing , covering August 2003 to July 2004 , states that $ 120,000 of the $ 124,094 the group received in contributions during that period came from Exxon Mobil .
The company would n't say whether it provided funds to PIW at other times , but said it no longer gives money to the group .
The previous year , PIW reported donations totaling $ 49,600 , but did n't identify sources .
PIW has criticized several nonprofit groups for alleged misdeeds , including the American Heart Association , which it accused of allowing its logo to be used to endorse Subway sandwiches in exchange for donations -- a charge the AHA denies .
It also wrote to the IRS in August 2003 to urge an audit of Dogwood Alliance , an Asheville , N.C. , forest - protection group that has campaigned against office - supply chains Staples Inc. and OfficeMax Inc .
Sarah Hodgdon , executive director of Dogwood Alliance , said the IRS audited the group in 2004 but did n't revoke its tax - exempt status .
" I suspected that the audit followed the letter that Public Interest Watch sent , " she says .
She said the group has never targeted Exxon Mobil ; the company said it is n't familiar with Dogwood Alliance .
Messrs .
Hardiman and Fein said PIW has n't specifically targeted groups of a particular political bent .
" We went after conservative and some of the more lefty groups , " Mr. Hardiman said .
" We tried to throw our net rather wide . "
Since 2003 , one of PIW 's biggest targets has been Greenpeace .
In its signed application that year for tax - exempt status from the IRS , PIW named only one nonprofit on which it was focusing -- Greenpeace -- and noted that it " has launched an indepth investigation of " the group .
While PIW is exempt from paying federal taxes , contributions to the group are n't tax - deductible .
Greenpeace has labeled Exxon Mobil the " No. 1 climate criminal " and taken particular exception to the oil company 's insistence that fossil fuels are n't the main cause of global warming .
Greenpeace protesters spilled red wine on tables at an oil - industry meeting in London in February 2003 where Lee Raymond , Exxon Mobil 's chief executive officer at the time , was the guest of honor .
In May that year , activists chained themselves to the main gate of Exxon Mobil 's headquarters in Irving , Texas , where executives were gathering for the company 's annual meeting .
In September 2003 , PIW wrote to the head of the IRS urging the agency to audit Greenpeace and to challenge its tax - exempt status .
PIW attached a report it published in which it accused Greenpeace of " blatant self - dealing , " money laundering and other illegal activities .
The letter accused Greenpeace of " laundering " more than $ 24 million in tax - deductible contributions by diverting them to a related entity that had held protests against the Iraq war , an oil tanker and a nuclear - power station .
Greenpeace officials said an IRS auditor showed up at their Washington office Sept. 12 , 2005 .
Mr. Passacantando said that when the auditor , Charles Walker , arrived , he pointed to a picture of an activist chained to an Exxon Mobil gas pump and said , " You guys are engaged in illegal activity and this stuff has got to stop . "
Mr. Walker later said the audit had been triggered by the PIW complaint , according to Mr. Passacantando .
Mr. Walker did n't return a telephone call seeking comment .
Mr. Smith , the IRS spokesman , said he could n't comment on Mr. Walker 's alleged remarks .
Greenpeace officials said the audit lasted nearly three months ; they had a closing conference with the IRS on Dec. 8 .
The group received letters from the IRS dated March 1 that said both arms of the U.S. organization -- Greenpeace Fund Inc. and Greenpeace Inc. -- still qualified for tax - exempt status .
The letters did note nine " deficiencies " uncovered during the audit , including Greenpeace 's recordkeeping .
The agency also found that while the activist group had been engaged in unspecified unlawful activities , they were n't Greenpeace 's primary purpose and therefore do n't affect its tax status .

Perception of conservative bias in media 64 percent higher since Sept. 2001 Nick Juliano
Published : Monday October 8 , 2007

Print This Email This Near majority who see ' liberal ' media unchanged compared to growth in conservative perception
The number of Americans who see the media as too conservative has grown by 64 percent since September of 2001 , while the larger proportion of those who see it as too liberal has stagnated over the same period , according to a new Gallup poll .
About one in five respondents in a recent survey -- 18 percent -- see the media as being too conservative a 63.6 percent increase over the 11 percent who saw conservative bias six years ago , Gallup found .
Perceptions of conservative bias have increased steadily since 2001 and were slightly higher last year , when 19 percent said the media favored the right wing .
Nearly half of Americans see the media as being too liberal , but that measure in the survey released Monday did not move from the 45 percent who saw liberal bias in 2001 .
" The tendency on the part of Americans to perceive the news media as too liberal has been observed in each Gallup survey in which this question has been asked since 2001 , " writes Gallup pollster Frank Newport .
" Still , if there is a perceptible trend , it is the finding that the ' too conservative ' number has been climbing slightly throughout the decade . "
The liberal bias perception seems overwhelmingly fueled by Republicans , more than three in four of whom say the media is left - leaning , but Democrats are not as likely to see conservative bias in the media .
In fact , slightly more independents ( 25 percent ) than Democrats ( 22 percent ) told pollsters the media is too conservative , although a 43 percent plurality of independents saw a liberal bias .
A solid majority of Democrats ( 59 percent ) found the media was " just right " in providing balanced political coverage , while about a third of Americans , regardless of party affiliation , said there was no bias in the media .
Overall , more than half of Americans have little or no trust and confidence in the media 's ability to fairly report the news , while just 9 percent say they give the media a " great deal " of trust .
That finding is consistent with poll results over the last few years , but it marks a steep decline in Americans ' trust in journalists since Pew began asking the question during and after the Watergate scandal .
Faith in the media reached its zenith in June 1976 , when 72 percent of Americans trusted the media .
Conservative bloggers honed in on the perceptions of conservative bias , saying the poll results reflected the charge leveled by many on the right that the national press corps is in the pocket of the Democratic party .
Several blogs harped on the unchanged liberal bias perception while discounting those who see too much conservativism and ignoring the increase in conservative perception .
" Actually this is telling and a rebuke to the left - wing blabber mouths of the net such as Moveon.org , Media Matters , Daily Kos and others who drone on about ' conservative imbalance . '
It should also be used as a proof that if there is a problem with unbalanced media then its on the left , not the right , " writes a blogger at Macsmind .
" As a PS , ' One in five ' , who think that there is too much ' conservative ' in the media mix , the fact that it is nt a huge number and it shows just how marginal their blabbering is . "
On the same day the report was released , several right - wing bloggers also jumped on what they saw as an unfair discrepancy between media reports of a decrease in troop deaths in Iraq last month .
" So only report the enemys news , and not ours .
It s not like we need to have a more complete and balanced picture of whats going on in Iraq , is it MSM ? " wrote the Jawa Report .
" Gotta get those anti-war Democrats into the White House , after all ! " John Cole , writing at his blog Balloon Juice , compiled several conservative reactions to an interview aired on CNN Sunday in which Pentagon reporters discussed the complications in deciding how to play reports that troop deaths went down in September .
" The drop in casualties was covered - what didnt happen was that the press didnt make all sorts of sweeping generalizations about the data , " Cole wrote .
" They acted , in other words , like a responsible press corps . "
He said he takes " with a grain of salt " the reports that conservatives distrust the media .
" It is becoming clearer and clearer to me , " he writes , " that ' too liberal ' is , for many of these folks , code for ' they dont tell me exactly what I want to hear . ' "
Green Tea Benefits # 1 : Why is Green Better ?
Pamela writes :
GreenTease , please tell me why I hear so much about green tea .
What 's the difference between it and any other type of tea ?
Do n't they all come from the same plant ?
So how can one type be any better for me than another ?
GreenTease :
Great questions , Pamela .
Thanks for asking .
Yes , you are right that the different types of teas come from the same plant .
But there are some important differences in health benefits and taste .
First of all , herbal teas are not true teas .
They may have some health benefits , but botanically they are not related .
Green teas , which many people believe to be herbal teas , are a true tea .
White , green , oolong , and black teas all come from the camellia sinensis plant .
The methods of processing , as well as the amount of exposure to oxygen after being harvested makes a big difference .
White tea comes only from the buds of the plant and is not oxidized ( or fermented ) at all .
Green tea is only the leaves of the tea plant and also is not oxidized .
Both white and green teas are steamed or heated immediately after harvesting to prevent oxidation , and then they are dried .
Black tea leaves are fully oxidized .
First they are laid out to let their moisture evaporate , and then they are rolled to release oils within the leaves which helps the oxidation process .
Finally , they are heated in an oven to complete the drying process .
Oolong tea is partially oxidized giving it a unique taste somewhere between black and green teas .
Because of these different methods and length of processing , the health benefits as well as taste of each type of tea is unique .
White and green teas , because they have had less processing time , retain their active antioxidants .
It 's the polyphenols called flavonoids in tea that are the most beneficial .
While black and green teas contain similar amounts of flavonoids , their chemical structure is different .
Green tea contains far more catechins , which is a simple flavonoid and a powerful antioxidant , while black tea's extensive oxidation converts these simple flavonoids to more complex theaflavins .
The level of catechins in green tea is what sets it apart as being more beneficial than black tea .
Green tea also has less caffeine than black tea .
Studies continue about black and green tea benefits .

On " Countdown " , David Shuster talks about a preliminary House Oversight Committee report on possible violations of the Presidential Records Act by the White House and White House officials .
The report shows a coordinated , widespread pattern of using RNC e-mail servers to conduct government business , with hundreds of thousands , and potentially millions of those e-mails having been destroyed -- all illegally .
Initially , it was not known how many White House officials were involved , but the new report reveals that in addition to Karl Rove , Andy Card , Ken Mehlman , Alberto Gonzales and as many as 88 other White House officials are involved , with many e-mail accounts being completely wiped out .

Also involved in this scandal is former Rove aide , Susan Ralston , who stepped down last month and has invoked her fifth amendment rights .
On May 10th of this year , the House Oversight Committee deposed Ralston on this and other matters which yielded some very interesting information .

The most recent ancestor of all males living today was a man who lived in Africa around 59,000 years ago , according to an international team of researchers .
The scientists from eight countries have drawn up a genetic family tree of mankind by studying variations in the Y chromosome of more than a thousand men from different communities around the world .
The Y chromosome is one of the two sex chromosomes ( X and Y ) which only men carry ( women carry two X chromosomes ) .
The new research confirms the Out of Africa theory that modern humans originated in Africa before slowly spreading across the world .
But the finding raises new questions , not least because our most recent paternal ancestor would have been about 84,000 years younger than our maternal one .
The team believes there is an explanation .
They propose that the human genetic blueprint evolved as a mosaic , with different pieces of modern DNA emerging and spreading throughout the human population at different times .
Origins of man
Evidence from the fossil record suggests that modern man originated in Africa about 150,000 years ago , before moving steadily across the globe .
This Out of Africa hypothesis has been confirmed by studies of mitochondrial DNA , the segment of genetic material that is inherited exclusively from the mother .
Based on these studies , our most recent common ancestor is thought to be a woman who lived in Africa some 143,000 years ago , the so - called Mitochondrial Eve .
To find the common paternal ancestor , the team drew up a genetic family tree of mankind .
They mapped small variations in the Y chromosomes of 1,062 men in 22 geographical areas , including Pakistan , India , Cambodia , Laos , Australia , New Guinea , America , Mali , Sudan , Ethiopia and Japan .
The new genetic family tree supports the Out of Africa scenario .
But it suggests that our most recent paternal ancestor would have been about 84,000 years younger than our maternal one .
Regions of the genome
" You can ultimately trace every female lineage back to a single Mitochondrial Eve who lived in Africa about 150,000 years ago , " said Dr Spencer Wells of the Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics in Oxford , UK , who was part of the team .
" The Y chromosome we trace again back to Africa but the date is about 80,000 years ago .
He told BBC News Online that the two studies could be reconciled .
" There 's a different evolutionary history for each region of the genome but they all are consistent in placing the ancestor of all modern humans alive today in Africa . "
The research , published in the journal Nature Genetics , gives an intriguing insight into the journey of our ancestors across the planet , from eastern Africa into the Middle East , then to southeast and southern Asia , then New Guinea and Australia , and finally to Europe and Central Asia .
Some modern - day men living in what is now Sudan , Ethiopia and southern Africa are believed to be the closest living descendants of the first humans to set out on that great journey tens of thousands of years ago .

Clubs that are still recruiting during the third week of fall
Today I have heard the news that President Bush has asked the Congress to approve the funds Iraq and Afghanistan war .
As you know that tribal areas where most of the terrorists have been hiding is my native land .
Living with terrorists I have learnt one thing the terrorists which is they want the continuation of war .
Actually they are criminals and they have made the war a source of income .
It seems that presently they are successful in their plan .
They have been keeping the whole world engaged in unnecessary war .
According to most the tribesmen , President Bush intead of wasting the money on war divert all the funds to the task , which will be bringing order in the world .
Honest people should be given the task to bring peace to the world .
We can enjoy this world to the maximum level only after peace .
Troops are also the sons of the soil doing a very hard job should not be left alone at this critical hour .
A balanced approach can bring positive change in the shape of world politics .
The Congress can play a positive role if I am not wrong .
According to the AP report , President Bush asked Congress for $ 46 billion more to bankroll wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and said he wants the money approved by Christmas .
The fighting in Iraq , in its fifth year , already has cost more than $ 455 billion .
Democrats who gained control of Congress with an antiwar message said Bush should not expect lawmakers to rubber - stamp the request .
" The colossal cost of this war grows every day - in lives lost , dollars spent , and to our reputation around the world , " House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said .
" The American people long ago rejected the president 's planned 10 - year occupation of Iraq and want the administration to provide a concrete plan to bring our troops home .
" The choice is between a Democratic plan for responsible redeployment of our troops and the president 's plan to spend another trillion dollars for a 10 - year war in Iraq .
We must end this war . "
Announcing his latest request , Bush alluded to the nation 's disenchantment with the war , which has claimed the lives of more than 3,830 members of the U.S. military and more than 73,000 Iraqi civilians .
" Our men and women on the front lines should not be caught in the middle of partisan disagreements in Washington , " the president said .
Monday 's proposal brings to $ 196.4 billion the total requested for operations in Iraq , Afghanistan and elsewhere for the budget year that started Oct.
1 . It includes $ 189.3 billion for the Defense Department , $ 6.9 billion for the State Department and $ 200 million for other agencies .
With stepped - up military operations , the war is costing about $ 10 billion a month .
The White House originally sought $ 141.7 billion for the Pentagon to prosecute the Iraq and Afghanistan missions , then asked for $ 5.3 billion more in July .
Bush 's latest request includes another $ 42.3 billion for the Pentagon .
For the State Department , Bush more than doubled his initial $ 3.3 billion request , adding $ 3.6 billion for a total of $ 6.9 billion .
The updated request includes money for peacekeeping efforts in Darfur , battling drug trafficking in Latin America , fighting famine in Africa , assisting Iraqi refugees , and the Palestinians .
Top House lawmakers have said they do not plan to act on Bush 's request until next year , but they anticipate providing interim funds when completing a separate defense funding bill this fall .
Bush said failing to approve the money would directly affect the effectiveness of U.S. troops in Afghanistan and Iraq .
" I know some in Congress are against the war and are seeking ways to demonstrate that opposition , " Bush said .
" I recognize their position and they should make their views heard .
But they ought to make sure our troops have what it takes to succeed . "
" Congress should not go home for the holidays while our troops are still waiting for the funds they need , " he said .
Bush said most of the funding request , crafted in consultation with Gen. David Petraeus , the top U.S. commander in Iraq , is for day - to - day military operations .
Congress already approved more than $ 5 billion for new vehicles whose V - shaped undercarriages provide much better protection against mines and roadside bombs .
It 's likely that Congress will quickly grant $ 11 billion more to deliver more than 7,200 of the vehicles .
The delays in submitting the remaining war funding request were in part due to unease among congressional Republicans about receiving it during the veto override battle involving a popular bill reauthorizing the State Children 's Health Insurance Program .
" President Bush wants us to rubber - stamp another $ 200 billion in war funds - all borrowed money , none of it paid for - for next year alone , " Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said .
" But when we sent a bipartisan CHIP bill to his desk to provide health insurance for the children of working families , the president called it too expensive .
Let 's remember , every dime of the money for CHIP was paid for . "
White House deputy press secretary Tony Fratto said the president did not think it was too costly , but that he wanted to restore the program to its original intent .
Over the years , several states have gotten permission from the federal government to expand the program to adults and children from middle - income families .
" He did n't say that it 's too expensive - although it is too expensive to spend money on the wrong policy , " Fratto said .
Bush made his war - spending request in the Roosevelt Room after meeting in the Oval Office with leaders of veterans service organizations , a fallen Marine 's family and military personnel who served in Iraq and Afghanistan .
The End
Just when it seemed safe to be openly proud of Australia , the cultural cringers are at it again .
This time we need to be ashamed of ourselves because Australia does not have a bill of rights .
Forget the fact Australia is one of the world 's oldest and most successful liberal democracies .
Forget the fact bills of rights did nothing for enslaved African Americans or those persecuted in Stalinist Russia .
No , we need a bill of rights to " keep up " with the rest of the world .
The cringers are the same activists , lobbyists and lawyers unable to secure political objectives at the ballot box .
Some Labor states , and the Labor Party 's national organisation wing , are in on this as well .
Now there is a new voice in the chorus : Geoffrey Robertson , QC .
Fresh off the plane he argues that Australia needs a bill of rights for two reasons : first so that we can become an " advanced " democracy ; and secondly so that our High Court and other judges can make more of an international contribution than they do now .
The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency ( JAXA ) and Osaka University have been working together to develop a device which converts sunlight into laser - light with four times the efficiency of previous attempts .
According to a report out of Tokyo , the team is working on Space - based solar power systems which can collect sunlight in space and convert it into laser light , which is then transmitted to Earth and used for electricity ... or to power a massive Death - Ray .
The project works by storing sunlight - based energy in plate made from a sintered powder of metals like chromium and neodymium .
When weak laser light is shined onto the plate , the stored energy is transferred to the laser where its strength is amplified by a factor of four .
In one test , a 0.5 - watt laser was amplified to 180 - watts by the plates .
Scientists have thus far been able to garner 40 - percent of the solar energy produced , and they hope to have a system ready for satellite mounting by the not - too - distant year 2030 .
Huzzah !

Facebook SAN FRANCISCO  Wayne Cooksey joined the flight of African - Americans from this city last year to escape soaring rents and buy a home .
Michael Higgenbotham left six years ago for a safer neighborhood and better schools for his three children .
Adell Adams retired and wanted to downsize but knew her home 's equity would n't go far in a market where decent condos start at $ 500,000 .
Aubrey Lewis was among the first to go , to nearby Oakland in 1977 .
" We left because of the housing situation , " says Lewis , 77 .
" And that was early .
It has n't gotten much better . "
African - Americans are abandoning this famously progressive city at a rate that has alarmed San Francisco officials , who vow to stop the exodus and develop a strategy to win blacks back to the city .
In June , Mayor Gavin Newsom appointed a task force to study how to reverse decades of policies — and neglect — that black leaders say have fueled the flight .
Black flight can alter a city 's character .
" It 's important for a city 's future that it be a diverse place , and San Francisco is drifting toward being an upper - middle - class city , " says Ed Blakely , director of Katrina recovery for New Orleans .
According to Census estimates , the number of blacks here shrank from 13.4 % of the population in 1970 to just 6.5 % in 2005 — the biggest percentage decline in any major American city .
Other cities are losing blacks to the suburbs — Chicago , Los Angeles , Houston , Dallas , San Diego , Washington and Oakland among them — but none has seen anything like what 's happening here .
The actual number of blacks has dwindled to about 47,000 out of a population of roughly 744,000 .
In Los Angeles , the proportion of blacks is 9.9 % , just over half what it was in 1970 , although the number of blacks remains relatively high — 366,000 , according to 2005 Census estimates .
And in Chicago an estimated 1 million blacks remain — about one - third of the population — even though more than 55,000 have left since 2000 , says Kenneth Johnson , a Loyola University Chicago demographer who analyzed 2005 Census data .
" The flight is certainly more intense in San Francisco than elsewhere , " says Hans Johnson , a demographer with the Public Policy Institute of California here .
No single cause explains the continuing exodus , according to city officials , leaders in the black community , demographers and current and former black residents .
The high cost of housing — one of the highest in the nation — is a dominant theme , but there are other factors :
• The loss in the 1950s and 1960s of a key black enclave to urban renewal .
• High crime rates in some of the city 's surviving black neighborhoods .
• Substandard public housing , as acknowledged by city officials .
• Dissatisfaction with underperforming urban schools .
" Black people really do n't matter in San Francisco .
It 's what this generation of political leadership inherited , " says Chuck Collins , president of the YMCA of San Francisco .
" There 's been a very uneasy truce with the black population . "
The task force " ought to study what 's wrong with the white power structure , why they can't be responsive to the African - American community , " says Amos Brown , pastor of Third Baptist Church and president of the local NAACP chapter .
" They did n't need us anymore . "
Stopping black flight will be " an uphill battle , " Blakely says .
" If you 're a middle - class African - American , one of your dreams was to move into a nice mixed neighborhood and send your kid to a decent school . "
Today , African - Americans across the USA are " suburbanizing " at a rate slightly higher than whites , he says .
" As their incomes go up , they move out . "
Lower - income blacks are leaving , too , typically to a city 's closest suburbs .
When cities redevelop blighted public housing or replace it with mixed - income units , many residents are left out .
Lost ' Harlem of the West '
In the 1940s and 1950s , in segregated San Francisco , the historic Fillmore neighborhood was the " Harlem of the West , " thriving with culture and black - owned businesses .
Lionel Hampton , Duke Ellington , Billie Holiday , John Coltrane and other headliners jammed at dozens of jazz clubs .
Block after block of Victorian and Queen Anne row houses filled the neighborhood .
It died as quickly as it bloomed .
In a city dominated by a conservative white establishment and strong unions after World War II , blacks were frozen out of skilled jobs at Hunters Point , the West Coast 's major naval shipbuilding and maintenance facility .
Housing covenants barred " Negroes and Orientals " from white neighborhoods , and white businesses shunned blacks .
In the 1960s and 1970s , urban renewal — " Negro removal " to many blacks , the YMCA 's Collins says — swept away the Fillmore .
Hundreds of homes and businesses were razed , and 4,000 blacks were displaced , city officials estimate .
" A lot of people will tell you it was n't some urban renewal innocent mistake but that deliberate efforts were made to transform that community in a way that pushed African - Americans out , " says Fred Blackwell , director of the Mayor 's Office of Community Development .
" This was n't just a San Francisco thing , " says the policy institute 's Johnson .
Urban renewal projects in Detroit , St. Louis and other cities created large impoverished populations at the same time businesses were lost .
" It led middle - class African - Americans to leave , " he says .
Memories of the Fillmore 's demise cloud plans to redevelop San Francisco 's southeastern corner — an area that includes the shipyard , a federal Superfund site that the Navy is cleaning up , and the Candlestick Park area .
In this built - out city with water on three sides and little vacant land , those 800 acres could address a critical need for affordable housing .
An aversion to affordable housing ?
Redevelopment could slow the African - American exodus , but it 's unclear how it would address the far more challenging work of attracting blacks to the city .
At $ 9.14 an hour , San Francisco has one of the nation 's highest minimum wages .
It offers a tax credit to working families .
As of July , uninsured residents under age 65 became eligible for universal health care .
Preschool is available free to every child .
The city has approved more affordable housing in the past few years than at any other time in its history , Newsom says .
Many blacks here shun buying affordable housing because those homes have " equity restrictions " to keep them affordable , which means they can't be resold at market rates .
" They see homeownership as a chance to gain assets that will grow .
So they 'll go outside the city , " says Ed Donaldson , counseling director for the San Francisco Housing Development Corp .
Newsom says he 's focusing on " asset creation " — strategies to help blacks , Latinos and others create wealth by owning homes and businesses .
That will be a priority of the task force , he says .
" San Francisco 's strength is the fact that we do n't just tolerate our diversity , we celebrate it , " Newsom says .
" One of the real gifts of living in this city is living together and advancing together across every conceivable difference .
There 's magic to that . "

It 's the feel of diet soda in the mouth that makes it taste crummy , not the flavor of the artificial sweetener , studies suggest .
Consumers claim they dislike the taste of aspartame and Splenda , but research by two University of Illinois food scientists shows that swillers of diet and regular soda are also influenced by a subtle factor called mouth - feel .
Mouth - feel refers to a food or beverage 's body , fullness and thickness , the scientists say , and the presence of high - fructose corn syrup in regular soda and its absence in diet might be a distinguishing factor for discerning drinkers .
Drink up !
Soo - Yeun Lee and Shelly Schmidt trained 12 people for four weeks to use a 15 - point scale to rate the characteristics that contribute to the mouth - feel of diet and regular soda .
The panelists became so skilled that they were able to accurately identify significant differences in the mouth - feel of 14 samples that sensitive lab instruments identified as very small .
" We worked with solutions of sucrose and high - fructose corn syrup , asking panelists to detect when beverages began to differ from water in mouth - feel , " said sensory scientist Soo - Yeun Lee .
" And they were able to accurate identify varying degrees of viscosity on our 15 - point scale . "
" The human mouth cavity appears to be a super - rheometer ( the lab instrument that measures viscosity or thickness ) , " said Lee 's colleague Shelly Schmidt .
Lee , Schmidt and S.M. Kappes ,
Lee 's graduate student at the time , co-authored four studies about the sensory characteristics of diet beverages which were recently published in the Journal of Food Science .
Halo and horns effects
Enjoying food is complex , involving not only taste and mouth - feel , but also aroma , vision and hearing .
" If you bite into an apple and it does n't crunch , it affects your perception of the way the apple tastes , " Lee said .
" And if a beverage does n't feel right in your mouth , that affects your perception of the way the beverage tastes too . "
If a food attribute enhances the flavor " sense " that humans have of something eaten , sensory scientists call that a " halo effect . "
If the attribute diminishes the flavor sense , scientists say it has a horns effect .
When color was added to lemon - lime beverages , panelists believed that the beverage had more body , meaning the color conferred a halo effect .
But the color also led tasters to think the beverage had less carbonation , which it did not , meaning the color also conferred a horns effect , Lee said .
" We think the lemon - lime flavor , which is exciting to the mouth , helps mask the mouth - feel difference , and that 's why diet lemon - lime drinks were perceived as tasting more like their non-diet counterpoint than cola - flavored drinks , " Lee said .
" It 's probably also the reason the new lime diet colas are so popular , " Lee said .
" The sour taste of the lime works with the carbonation to keep the mouth busy so the consumer does n't notice the lack of body as much . "
Seeking a new ingredient
Eventually , the scientists would like to find an ingredient that gives body to diet soft drinks without adding calories or other unpleasant side effects .
" We need to find an ingredient that has no calories but gives the same mouth - feel as sucrose , " Lee said .
This ingredient would make diet drinks more appealing .
" If we could make diet soda taste better , it would be a big step in fighting the obesity epidemic , " Schmidt said .
" Many people know they should cut calories , but they wo n't drink diet pop because they do n't like the taste . "
Christians throughout church history have debated the nuances of Eschatology .
These debates will doubtless last until Jesus Himself decides to end them .
Until then , the theological battles extolling or condemning premillennialism or postmillennialism , pre-tribulation Rapture or post - tribulation Rapture , etc. , will continue .
To be sure , this column is not an attempt to resolve or even argue these interpretations of Scripture .
Let every man be persuaded in his own heart .
Personally , I do n't think it 's worth arguing about .
Whether a Christian is premillennial or postmillennial , whether he or she believes in the pre-tribulation Rapture or not is immaterial to our responsibilities .
We Christians have a duty to be the " salt " and " light " of society until Jesus returns -- whenever that is .
And , frankly , the time of His return is His business , not ours .
If we would concentrate on those matters that truly belong to us , we would be much more effective .
Arguing and battling between Christians over the nuances of Eschatology only serves to advance the cause of the Enemy .
It is counterproductive and fruitless to anything worthwhile .
That being said , a brief reference to the belief that a literal antichrist is yet to come is in order .
Accepting this interpretation of the Book of Revelation , there will come in the days of " great tribulation " a Western World leader , known as the antichrist , or beast .
Christians accepting this interpretation believe that the antichrist will unite the Western World , mainly Europe and the United States , and will implement a satanic despotism .
Part of the antichrist 's reign upon the Western World ( called , by some , The Revived Roman Empire ) will be the demand that everyone accept " the mark of the beast " in his hand or forehead .
Of course , the number Scripture uses is 666 .
Everyone who does not accept this mark will be deemed to be an outlaw : unable to buy or sell , or contract normal daily business of any kind .
However , acceptance of the mark will also mean rejection of God and salvation .
Premillennialists believe they will be " raptured " to Heaven before these events take place .
Some believe the church will go through the " great tribulation , " while most postillennialists do n't believe in a literal " tribulation " at all , but believe these Scriptures are related to other events altogether .
Regardless of how one interprets the Book of Revelation , I think most all believers will accept the Apostle John 's warning that the spirit of antichrist is already in the world .
( I John 2:18 ; 4:3 ) Can we not readily agree that anything that resembles antichrist is a form of antichrist ?
Accordingly , did not the German church have an obligation to resist Adolph Hitler ?
Of course they did .
However , at the end of the day , out of over 14,000 pastors and church congregations in Germany at the time , only 800 properly discerned the evil Hitler for who he was and openly opposed him .
The rest not only tolerated him , but openly praised him , promoted him , and punished anyone who failed to do the same .
Yet , Hitler definitely personified the spirit of antichrist .
While publicly professing to be a Christian , he privately disdained Christians and was caught up in secret societies and the occult .
He was driven to lead Germany into preemptive wars of aggression .
He cast off Germany 's republican form of government and consolidated power unto himself .
He implemented a total surveillance society in the name of national security .
He was so completely accepted and adored by Germany 's churchmen that German congregations were told that in order to be good Christians they had to be good Nazis and that to support any other political party than Hitler 's was to fight against God .
He enacted strict gun control laws .
Why did Germany 's pastors and Christians not recognize Hitler for who he was ?
Can we not say that , in their own way , Germany 's pastors and churches accepted the mark of the beast ?
Sure they did .
No , Hitler was not THE antichrist , but he certainly exemplified the spirit of antichrist .
As such , he deserved to be resisted .
However , before we become too judgmental toward the Christians of 1930's Germany , we should look in the mirror .
Are not many Christians in these United States behaving in the exact same manner ?
Have not many of us already embraced the spirit of antichrist ?
And if so , have we not , in our own way , already accepted the mark of the beast ?
Sure we have .
Many pastors and Christians embrace the authoritarian policies of one George W. Bush with the same enthusiasm and blind loyalty as Germans did Hitler .
For example , according to White House insiders , while publicly embracing conservative Christians , the White House is privately said to have nothing but disdain for Christians .
Mr. Bush acknowledged being a member of Skull & Bones , a secret society with a dark history .
Others have reported that he is a member of Bohemian Grove , which , according to some , is an occultist society of the most sinister variety .
Yet , all of this is rejected out of hand by most Christians today .
Plus , George W. Bush ( as did Adolph Hitler ) has led America into a preemptive and aggressive war against a foreign nation without provocation .
Now , there is even talk at the White House of expanding the war in Iraq with attacks against Iran and Syria , and maybe even Pakistan .
In addition , he is in the process of turning America into a Hitlerian surveillance society where our every move , phone call , and email are being monitored by federal police agencies .
Yet , conservative Christians are still so infatuated with President Bush that they actually believe that anyone who resists the President is resisting God .
They further believe that if anyone votes for any candidate who is not a Republican ( Bush 's party ) , they are fighting against God .
They gladly surrender their constitutional liberties and safeguards .
They enthusiastically support an unconstitutional war in Iraq and would no doubt support expanding the war to wherever Bush decided .
They happily cede Bush the power to tap their phones , read their emails , or open their mail ( without warrant or court order , no less ) .
Regardless of one 's politics or religion , the spirit of Big Brother , the spirit of military aggression , the spirit of occultism , the spirit of a police state mentality , the spirit of deception are all part of the spirit of antichrist .
Therefore , whether one identifies himself as a premillennialist or a postmillennialist or anything in between ; whether we believe in a Rapture or not ; no matter what our understanding of Eschatology might be , every Christian has a duty to " resist the devil " in any form in which he reveals himself .
And that certainly means that any political leader , regardless of party , who embodies or exemplifies the spirit of antichrist , must be resisted .
Anything less means to accept , in a way , the mark of the beast .

Interview with Kip Hawley
In April , Kip Hawley , the head of the Transportation Security Administration ( TSA ) , invited me to Washington for a meeting .
Despite some serious trepidation , I accepted .
And it was a good meeting .
Most of it was off the record , but he asked me how the TSA could overcome its negative image .
I told him to be more transparent , and stop ducking the hard questions .
He said that he wanted to do that .
He did enjoy writing a guest blog post for Aviation Daily , but having a blog himself did n’t work within the bureaucracy .
What else could he do ?
This interview , conducted in May and June via e-mail , was one of my suggestions .
Bruce Schneier :
By today ’s rules , I can carry on liquids in quantities of three ounces or less , unless they ’re in larger bottles .
But I can carry on multiple three - ounce bottles .
Or a single larger bottle with a non-prescription medicine label , like contact lens fluid .
It all has to fit inside a one - quart plastic bag , except for that large bottle of contact lens fluid .
And if you confiscate my liquids , you ’re going to toss them into a large pile right next to the screening station — which you would never do if anyone thought they were actually dangerous .
Can you please convince me there ’s not an Office for Annoying Air Travelers making this sort of stuff up ?
Kip Hawley : Screening ideas are indeed thought up by the Office for Annoying Air Travelers and vetted through the Directorate for Confusion and Complexity , and then we review them to insure that there are sufficient unintended irritating consequences so that the blogosphere is constantly fueled .
Imagine for a moment that TSA people are somewhat bright , and motivated to protect the public with the least intrusion into their lives , not to mention travel themselves .
How might you engineer backwards from that premise to get to three ounces and a baggie ?
We faced a different kind of liquid explosive , one that was engineered to evade then - existing technology and process .
Not the old Bojinka formula or other well - understood ones — TSA already trains and tests on those .
After August 10 , we began testing different variants with the national labs , among others , and engaged with other countries that have sophisticated explosives capabilities to find out what is necessary to reliably bring down a plane .
We started with the premise that we should prohibit only what ’s needed from a security perspective .
Otherwise , we would have stuck with a total liquid ban .
But we learned through testing that that no matter what someone brought on , if it was in a small enough container , it was n’t a serious threat .
So what would the justification be for prohibiting lip gloss , nasal spray , etc ?
There was none , other than for our own convenience and the sake of a simple explanation .
Based on the scientific findings and a do n’t - intrude - unless - needed - for - security philosophy , we came up with a container size that eliminates an assembled bomb ( without having to determine what exactly is inside the bottle labeled “ shampoo ” ) , limits the total liquid any one person can bring ( without requiring Transportation Security Officers ( TSOs ) to count individual bottles ) , and allows for additional security measures relating to multiple people mixing a bomb post - checkpoint .
Three ounces and a baggie in the bin gives us a way for people to safely bring on limited quantities of liquids , aerosols and gels .
BS : How will this foil a plot , given that there are no consequences to trying ?
Airplane contraband falls into two broad categories : stuff you get in trouble for trying to smuggle onboard , and stuff that just gets taken away from you .
If I ’m caught at a security checkpoint with a gun or a bomb , you ’re going to call the police and really ruin my day .
But if I have a large bottle of that liquid explosive , you confiscate it with a smile and let me though .
So unless you ’re 100 % perfect in catching this stuff — which you ’re not — I can just try again and again until I get it through .
This is n’t like contaminants in food , where if you remove 90 % of the particles , you ’re 90 % safer .
None of those false alarms — none of those innocuous liquids taken away from innocent travelers — improve security .
We ’re only safer if you catch the one explosive liquid amongst the millions of containers of water , shampoo , and toothpaste .
I have described two ways to get large amounts of liquids onto airplanes — large bottles labeled “ saline solution ” and trying until the screeners miss the liquid — not to mention combining multiple little bottles of liquid into one big bottle after the security checkpoint .
I want to assume the TSA is both intelligent and motivated to protect us .
I ’m taking your word for it that there is an actual threat — lots of chemists disagree — but your liquid ban is n’t mitigating it .
Instead , I have the sinking feeling that you ’re defending us against a terrorist smart enough to develop his own liquid explosive , yet too stupid to read the rules on TSA ’s own website .
KH : I think your premise is wrong .
There are consequences to coming to an airport with a bomb and having some of the materials taken away at the checkpoint .
Putting aside our layers of security for the moment , there are things you can do to get a TSO ’s attention at the checkpoint .
If a TSO finds you or the contents of your bag suspicious , you might get interviewed and / or have your bags more closely examined .
If the TSO throws your liquids in the trash , they do n’t find you a threat .
I often read blog posts about how someone could just take all their three - ounce bottles — or take bottles from others on the plane — and combine them into a larger container to make a bomb .
I ca n’t get into the specifics , but our explosives research shows this is not a viable option .
The current system is not the best we ’ll ever come up with .
In the near future , we ’ll come up with an automated system to take care of liquids , and everyone will be happier .
In the meantime , we have begun using hand - held devices that can recognize threat liquids through factory - sealed containers ( we will increase their number through the rest of the year ) and we have different test strips that are effective when a bottle is opened .
Right now , we ’re using them on exempt items like medicines , as well as undeclared liquids TSOs find in bags .
This will help close the vulnerability and strengthen the deterrent .
BS : People regularly point to security checkpoints missing a knife in their handbag as evidence that security screening is n’t working .
But that ’s wrong .
Complete effectiveness is not the goal ; the checkpoints just have to be effective enough so that the terrorists are worried their plan will be uncovered .
But in Denver earlier this year , testers sneaked 90 % of weapons through .
And other tests are n’t much better .
Why are these numbers so poor , and why did n’t they get better when the TSA took over airport security ?
KH : Your first point is dead on and is the key to how we look at security .
The stories about 90 % failures are wrong or extremely misleading .
We do many kinds of effectiveness tests at checkpoints daily .
We use them to guide training and decisions on technology and operating procedures .
We also do extensive and very sophisticated Red Team testing , and one of their jobs is to observe checkpoints and go back and figure out — based on inside knowledge of what we do — ways to beat the system .
They isolate one particular thing : for example , a particular explosive , made and placed in a way that exploits a particular weakness in technology ; our procedures ; or the way TSOs do things in practice .
Then they will test that particular thing over and over until they identify what corrective action is needed .
We then change technology or procedure , or plain old focus on execution .
And we repeat the process — forever .
So without getting into specifics on the test results , of course there are times that our evaluations can generate high failure rate numbers on specific scenarios .
Overall , though , our ability to detect bomb components is vastly improved and it will keep getting better .
( Older scores you may have seen may be “ feel good ” numbers based on old , easy tests .
Do n’t go for the sound - bite ; today ’s TSOs are light - years ahead of even where they were two years ago . )
BS : I hope you ’re telling the truth ; screening is a difficult problem , and it ’s hard to discount all of those published tests and reports .
But a lot of the security around these checkpoints is about perception — we want potential terrorists to think there ’s a significant chance they wo n’t get through the checkpoints — so you ’re better off maintaining that the screeners are better than reports indicate , even if they ’re not .
Backscatter X -ray is another technology that is causing privacy concerns , since it basically allows you to see people naked .
Can you explain the benefits of the technology , and what you are doing to protect privacy ?
Although the machines can distort the images , we know that they can store raw , unfiltered images ; the manufacturer Rapiscan is quite proud of the fact .
Are the machines you ’re using routinely storing images ?
Can they store images at the screener ’s discretion , or is that capability turned off at installation ?
KH :
We ’re still evaluating backscatter and are in the process of running millimeter wave portals right alongside backscatter to compare their effectiveness and the privacy issues .
We do not now store images for the test phase ( function disabled ) , and although we have n’t officially resolved the issue , I fully understand the privacy argument and do n’t assume that we will store them if and when they ’re widely deployed .
BS : When can we keep our shoes on ?
KH : Any time after you clear security .
Sorry , Bruce , I do n’t like it either , but this is not just something leftover from 2002 .
It is a real , current concern .
We ’re looking at shoe scanners and ways of using millimeter wave and / or backscatter to get there , but until the technology catches up to the risk , the shoes have to go in the bin .
BS : This feels so much like “ cover your ass ” security : you ’re screening our shoes because everyone knows Richard Reid hid explosives in them , and you ’ll be raked over the coals if that particular plot ever happens again .
But there are literally thousands of possible plots .
So when does it end ?
The terrorists invented a particular tactic , and you ’re defending against it .
But you ’re playing a game you ca n’t win .
You ban guns and bombs , so the terrorists use box cutters .
You ban small blades and knitting needles , and they hide explosives in their shoes .
You screen shoes , so they invent a liquid explosive .
You restrict liquids , and they ’re going to do something else .
The terrorists are going to look at what you ’re confiscating , and they ’re going to design a plot to bypass your security .
That ’s the real lesson of the liquid bombers .
Assuming you ’re right and the explosive was real , it was an explosive that none of the security measures at the time would have detected .
So why play this slow game of whittling down what people can bring onto airplanes ?
When do you say : “ Enough .
It ’s not about the details of the tactic ; it ’s about the broad threat ” ?
KH : In late 2005 , I made a big deal about focusing on Improvised Explosives Devices ( IEDs ) and not chasing all the things that could be used as weapons .
Until the liquids plot this summer , we were defending our decision to let scissors and small tools back on planes and trying to add layers like behavior detection and document checking , so it is ironic that you ask this question — I am in vehement agreement with your premise .
We ’d rather focus on things that can do catastrophic harm ( bombs ! ) and add layers to get people with hostile intent to highlight themselves .
We have a responsibility , though , to address known continued active attack methods like shoes and liquids and , unfortunately , have to use our somewhat clunky process for now .
BS : You do n’t have a responsibility to screen shoes ; you have one to protect air travel from terrorism to the best of your ability .
You ’re picking and choosing .
We know the Chechnyan terrorists who downed two Russian planes in 2004 got through security partly because different people carried the explosive and the detonator .
Why does n’t this count as a continued , active attack method ?
I do n’t want to even think about how much C4 I can strap to my legs and walk through your magnetometers .
Or search the Internet for “ BeerBelly . ”
It ’s a device you can strap to your chest to smuggle beer into stadiums , but you can also use it smuggle 40 ounces of dangerous liquid explosive onto planes .
The magnetometer wo n’t detect it .
Your secondary screening wandings wo n’t detect it .
Why are n’t you making us all take our shirts off ?
Will you have to find a printout of the webpage in some terrorist safe house ?
Or will someone actually have to try it ?
If that does n’t bother you , search the Internet for “ cell phone gun . ”
It ’s “ cover your ass ” security .
If someone tries to blow up a plane with a shoe or a liquid , you ’ll take a lot of blame for not catching it .
But if someone uses any of these other , equally known , attack methods , you ’ll be blamed less because they ’re less public .
KH : Dead wrong !
Our security strategy assumes an adaptive terrorist , and that looking backwards is not a reliable predictor of the next type of attack .
Yes , we screen for shoe bombs and liquids , because it would be stupid not to directly address attack methods that we believe to be active .
Overall , we are getting away from trying to predict what the object looks like and looking more for the other markers of a terrorist .
( Do n’t forget , we see two million people a day , so we know what normal looks like . )
What he / she does ; the way they behave .
That way we do n’t put all our eggs in the basket of catching them in the act .
We ca n’t give them free rein to surveil or do dry - runs ; we need to put up obstacles for them at every turn .
Working backwards , what do you need to do to be successful in an attack ?
Find the decision points that show the difference between normal action and action needed for an attack .
Our odds are better with this approach than by trying to take away methods , annoying object by annoying object .
Bruce , as for blame , that ’s nothing compared to what all of us would carry inside if we failed to prevent an attack .
BS : Let ’s talk about ID checks .
I ’ve called the no-fly list a list of people so dangerous they cannot be allowed to fly under any circumstance , yet so innocent we ca n’t arrest them even under the Patriot Act .
Except that ’s not even true ; anyone , no matter how dangerous they are , can fly without an ID — or by using someone else ’s boarding pass .
And the list itself is filled with people who should n’t be on it — dead people , people in jail , and so on — and primarily catches innocents with similar names .
Why are you bothering ?
KH : Because it works .
We just completed a scrub of every name on the no-fly list and cut it in half — essentially cleaning out people who were no longer an active terror threat .
We do not publicize how often the no-fly system stops people you would not want on your flight .
Several times a week would low - ball it .
Your point about the no-ID and false boarding pass people is a great one .
We are moving people who have tools and training to get at that problem .
The bigger issue is that TSA is moving in the direction of security that picks up on behavior versus just keying on what we see in your bag .
It really would be security theater if all we did was try to find possible weapons in that crunched fifteen seconds and fifteen feet after you anonymously walk through the magnetometer .
We do a better job , with less aggravation of ordinary passengers , if we put people - based layers further ahead in the process — behavior observation based on involuntary , observable muscle behavior , canine teams , document verification , etc .
BS : We ’ll talk about behavioral profiling later ; no fair defending one security measure by pointing to another , completely separate , one .
How can you claim ID cards work ?
Like the liquid ban , all it does is annoy innocent travelers without doing more than inconveniencing any future terrorists .
Is it really good enough for you to defend me from terrorists too dumb to Google “ print your own boarding pass ” ?
KH :
We are getting at the fake boarding pass and ID issues with our proposal to Congress that would allow us to replace existing document checkers with more highly trained people with tools that would close those gaps .
Without effective identity verification , watch lists do n’t do much , so this is a top priority .
Having highly trained TSOs performing the document checking function closes a security gap , adds another security layer , and pushes TSA ’s security program out in front of the checkpoint .
BS : Let ’s move on .
Air travelers think you ’re capricious .
Remember in April when the story went around about the Princeton professor being on a no- fly list because he spoke out against President Bush ?
His claims were easily debunked , but the real story is that so many people believed it .
People believe political activity puts them on the list .
People are afraid to complain about being mistreated at checkpoints because they ’re afraid it puts them on a list .
Is there anything you can do to make this process more transparent ?
KH : We need some help on this one .
This is the biggest public pain point , dwarfing shoes and baggies .
First off , TSA does not add people to the watch - lists , no matter how cranky you are at a checkpoint .
Second , political views have nothing to do with no - flys or selectees .
These myths have taken on urban legend status .
There are very strict criteria and they are reviewed by lots of separate people in separate agencies : it is for live terror concerns only .
The problem comes from random selectees ( literally mathematically random ) or people who have the same name and birth date as real no - flys .
If you can get a boarding pass , you are not on the no-fly list .
This problem will go away when Secure Flight starts in 2008 , but we ca n’t seem to shake the false impression that ordinary Americans get put on a “ list . ”
I am open for suggestions on how to make the public “ get it . ”
BS : It ’s hard to believe that there could be hundreds of thousands of people meeting those very strict criteria , and that ’s after the list was cut in half !
I know the TSA does not control the no-fly and watch lists , but you ’re the public face of those lists .
You ’re the aspect of homeland security that people come into direct contact with .
Some people might find out they ’re on the list by being arrested , or being shipped off to Syria for torture , but most people find out they ’re on the list by being repeatedly searched and questioned for hours at airports .
The main problem with the list is that it ’s secret .
Who is on the list is secret .
Why someone ’s on is secret .
How someone can get off is secret .
There ’s no accountability and there ’s no transparency .
Of course this kind of thing induces paranoia .
It ’s the sort of thing you read about in history books about East Germany and other police states .
The best thing you can do to improve the problem is redress .
People need the ability to see the evidence against them , challenge their accuser , and have a hearing in a neutral court .
If they ’re guilty of something , arrest them .
And if they ’re innocent , stop harassing them .
It ’s basic liberty .
I do n’t actually expect you to fix this ; the problem is larger than the TSA .
But can you tell us something about redress ?
It ’s been promised to us for years now .
KH : Redress issues are divided into two categories : people on the no-fly list and people who have names similar to them .
In our experience , the first group is not a heavy user of the redress process .
They typically do n’t want anything to do with the U.S. government .
Still , if someone is either wrongly put on or kept on , the Terrorist Screening Center ( TSC ) removes him or her immediately .
In fact , TSA worked with the TSC to review every name , and that review cut the no-fly list in half .
Having said that , once someone is really on the no-fly list , I totally agree with what you said about appeal rights .
This is true across the board , not just with no - flys .
DHS has recently consolidated redress for all DHS activities into one process called DHS TRIP .
If you are mistaken for a real no -fly , you can let TSA know and we provide your information to the airlines , who right now are responsible for identifying no - flys trying to fly .
Each airline uses its own system , so some can get you cleared to use kiosks , while others still require a visit to the ticket agent .
When Secure Flight is operating , we ’ll take that in - house at TSA and the problem should go away .
BS : I still do n’t see how that will work , as long as the TSA does n’t have control over who gets on or off the list .
What about Registered Traveler ?
When TSA first started talking about the program , the plan was to divide people into two categories : more trusted people who get less screening , and less trusted people who get more screening .
This opened an enormous security hole ; whenever you create an easy way and a hard way through security , you invite the bad guys to take the easier way .
Since then , it ’s transformed into a way for people to pay for better screening equipment and faster processing — a great idea with no security downsides .
Given that , why bother with the background checks at all ?
What else is it besides a way for a potential terrorist to spend $ 60 and find out if the government is on to them ?
KH : Registered Traveler ( RT ) is a promising program but suffers from unrealistic expectations .
The idea — that you and I are n’t really risks and we should be screened less so that TSA can apply scarce resources on the more likely terrorist — makes sense and got branded as RT .
The problem is that with two million people a day , how can we tell them apart in an effective way ?
We know terrorists use people who are not on watch lists and who do n’t have criminal convictions , so we ca n’t use those criteria alone .
Right now , I ’ve said that RT is behind Secure Flight in priority and that TSA is open to working with private sector entities to facilitate RT , but we will not fund it , reduce overall security , or inconvenience regular travelers .
As private companies deploy extra security above what TSA does , we can change the screening process accordingly .
It has to be more than a front - of - the - line pass , and I think there are some innovations coming out in the year ahead that will better define what RT can become .
BS : Let ’s talk about behavioral profiling .
I ’ve long thought that most of airline security could be ditched in favor of well - trained guards , both in and out of uniform , wandering the crowds looking for suspicious behavior .
Can you talk about some of the things you ’re doing along those lines , and especially ways to prevent this from turning into just another form of racial profiling ?
KH : Moving security out from behind the checkpoint is a big priority for us .
First , it gives us the opportunity to pick up a threat a lot earlier .
Taking away weapons or explosives at the checkpoint is stopping the plot at nearly the last possible moment .
Obviously , a good security system aims at stopping attacks well before that .
That ’s why we have many layers of security ( intel , law enforcement , behavior detection , etc. ) to get to that person well before the security checkpoint .
When a threat gets to the checkpoint , we ’re operating on his / her terms — they pick when , where , and how they present themselves to us .
We want to pick up the cues on our terms , before they ’re ready , even if they ’re just at the surveillance stage .
We use a system of behavior observation that is based on the science that demonstrates that there are certain involuntary , subconscious actions that can betray a person ’s hostile intent .
For instance , there are tiny — but noticeable to the trained person — movements in a person ’s facial muscles when they have certain emotions .
It is very different from the stress we all show when we ’re anxious about missing the flight due to , say , a long security line .
This is true across race , gender , age , ethnicity , etc .
It is our way of not falling into the trap where we predict what a terrorist is going to look like .
We know they use people who “ look like ” terrorists , but they also use people who do not , perhaps thinking that we cue only off of what the 9/11 hijackers looked like .
Our Behavior Detection teams routinely — and quietly — identify problem people just through observable behavior cues .
More than 150 people have been identified by our teams , turned over to law enforcement , and subsequently arrested .
This layer is invisible to the public , but do n’t discount it , because it may be the most effective .
We publicize non-terrorist - related successes like a murder suspect caught in Minneapolis and a bank robber caught in Philadelphia .
Most common are people showing phony documents , but we have even picked out undercover operatives — including our own .
One individual , identified by a TSO in late May and not allowed to fly , was killed in a police shoot - out five days later .
Additionally , several individuals have been of interest from the counter - terrorism perspective .
With just this limited deployment of Behavior Detection Officers ( BDOs ) , we have identified more people of counterterrorism interest than all the people combined caught with prohibited items .
Look for us to continue to look at ways that highlight problem people rather than just problem objects .
BS : That ’s really good news , and I think it ’s the most promising new security measure you ’ve got .
Although , honestly , bragging about capturing a guy for wearing a fake military uniform just makes you look silly .
So far , we ’ve only talked about passengers .
What about airport workers ?
Nearly one million workers move in and out of airports every day without ever being screened .
The JFK plot , as laughably unrealistic as it was , highlighted the security risks of airport workers .
As with any security problem , we need to secure the weak links , rather than make already strong links stronger .
What about airport employees , delivery vehicles , and so on ?
KH : I totally agree with your point about a strong base level of security everywhere and not creating large gaps by over - focusing on one area .
This is especially true with airport employees .
We do background checks on all airport employees who have access to the sterile area .
These employees are in the same places doing the same jobs day after day , so when someone does something out of the ordinary , it immediately stands out .
They serve as an additional set of eyes and ears throughout the airport .
Even so , we should do more on airport employees and my House testimony of April 19 gives details of where we ’re heading .
The main point is that everything you need for an attack is already inside the perimeter of an airport .
For example , why take lighters from people who work with blowtorches in facilities with millions of gallons of jet fuel ?
You could perhaps feel better by setting up employee checkpoints at entry points , but you ’d hassle a lot of people at great cost with minimal additional benefit , and a smart , patient terrorist could find a way to beat you .
Today ’s random , unpredictable screenings that can and do occur everywhere , all the time ( including delivery vehicles , etc. ) are harder to defeat .
With the latter , you make it impossible to engineer an attack ; with the former , you give the blueprint for exactly that .
BS : There ’s another reason to screen pilots and flight attendants : they go through the same security lines as passengers .
People have to remember that it ’s not pilots being screened , it ’s people dressed as pilots .
You either have to implement a system to verify that people dressed as pilots are actual pilots , or just screen everybody .
The latter choice is far easier .
I want to ask you about general philosophy .
Basically , there are three broad ways of defending airplanes : preventing bad people from getting on them ( ID checks ) , preventing bad objects from getting on them ( passenger screening , baggage screening ) , and preventing bad things from happening on them ( reinforcing the cockpit door , sky marshals ) .
The first one seems to be a complete failure , the second one is spotty at best .
I ’ve always been a fan of the third .
Any future developments in that area ?
KH :
You are too eager to discount the first — stopping bad people from getting on planes .
That is the most effective !
Do n’t forget about all the intel work done partnering with other countries to stop plots before they get here ( UK liquids , NY subway ) , all the work done to keep them out either through no - flys ( at least several times a month ) or by Customs & Border Protection on their way in , and law enforcement once they are here ( Ft. Dix ) .
Then , you add the behavior observation ( both uniformed and not ) and identity validation ( as we take that on ) and that ’s all before they get to the checkpoint .
The screening - for - things part , we ’ve discussed , so I ’ll jump to in - air measures .
Reinforced , locked cockpit doors and air marshals are indeed huge upgrades since 9/11 .
Along the same lines , you have to consider the role of the engaged flight crew and passengers — they are quick to give a heads - up about suspicious behavior and they can , and do , take decisive action when threatened .
Also , there are thousands of flights covered by pilots who are qualified as law enforcement and are armed , as well as the agents from other government entities like the Secret Service and FBI who provide coverage as well .
There is also a fair amount of communications with the flight deck during flights if anything comes up en route — either in the aircraft or if we get information that would be of interest to them .
That allows “ quiet ” diversions or other preventive measures .
Training is , of course , important too .
Pilots need to know what to do in the event of a missile sighting or other event , and need to know what we are going to do in different situations .
Other things coming : better air - to - ground communications for air marshals and flight information , including , possibly , video .
So , when you boil it down , keeping the bomb off the plane is the number one priority .
A terrorist has to know that once that door closes , he or she is locked into a confined space with dozens , if not hundreds , of zero - tolerance people , some of whom may be armed with firearms , not to mention the memory of United Flight 93 .
BS : I ’ve read repeated calls to privatize airport security : to return it to the way it was pre-9/11 .
Personally , I think it ’s a bad idea , but I ’d like your opinion on the question .
And regardless of what you think should happen , do you think it will happen ?
KH : From an operational security point of view , I think it works both ways .
So it is not a strategic issue for me .
SFO , our largest private airport , has excellent security and is on a par with its federalized counterparts ( in fact , I am on a flight from there as I write this ) .
One current federalized advantage is that we can surge resources around the system with no notice ; essentially , the ability to move from anywhere to anywhere and mix TSOs with federal air marshals in different force packages .
We would need to be sure we do n’t lose that interchangeability if we were to expand privatized screening .
I do n’t see a major security or economic driver that would push us to large - scale privatization .
Economically , the current cost - plus model makes it a better deal for the government in smaller airports than in bigger .
So , maybe more small airports will privatize .
If Congress requires collective bargaining for our TSOs , that will impose an additional overhead cost of about $ 500 million , which would shift the economic balance significantly toward privatized screening .
But unless that happens , I do n’t see major change in this area .
BS : Last question .
I regularly criticize overly specific security measures , because forcing the terrorists to make minor modifications in their tactics does n’t make us any safer .
We ’ve talked about specific airline threats , but what about airplanes as a specific threat ?
On the one hand , if we secure our airlines and the terrorists all decide instead to bomb shopping malls , we have n’t improved our security very much .
On the other hand , airplanes make particularly attractive targets for several reasons .
One , they ’re considered national symbols .
Two , they ’re a common and important travel vehicle , and are deeply embedded throughout our economy .
Three , they travel to distant places where the terrorists are .
And four , the failure mode is severe : a small bomb drops the plane out of the sky and kills everyone .
I do n’t expect you to give back any of your budget , but when do we have “ enough ” airplane security as compared with the rest of our nation ’s infrastructure ?
KH : Airplanes are a high - profile target for terrorists for all the reasons you cited .
The reason we have the focus we do on aviation is because of the effect the airline system has on our country , both economically and psychologically .
We do considerable work ( through grants and voluntary agreements ) to ensure the safety of surface transportation , but it ’s less visible to the public because people other than ones in TSA uniforms are taking care of that responsibility .
We look at the aviation system as one component in a much larger network that also includes freight rail , mass transit , highways , etc .
And that ’s just in the U.S .
Then you add the world ’s transportation sectors — it ’s all about the network .
The only components that require specific security measures are the critical points of failure — and they have to be protected at virtually any cost .
It does n’t matter which individual part of the network is attacked — what matters is that the network as a whole is resilient enough to operate even with losing one or more components .
The network approach allows various transportation modes to benefit from our layers of security .
Take our first layer : intel .
It is fundamental to our security program to catch terrorists long before they get to their target , and even better if we catch them before they get into our country .
Our intel operation works closely with other international and domestic agencies , and that information and analysis benefits all transportation modes .
Dogs have proven very successful at detecting explosives .
They work in airports and they work in mass transit venues as well .
As we test and pilot technologies like millimeter wave in airports , we assess their viability in other transportation modes , and vice versa .
To get back to your question , we ’re not at the point where we can say “ enough ” for aviation security .
But we ’re also aware of the attractiveness of other modes and continue to use the network to share resources and lessons learned .
BS : Thank you very much for your time .
I appreciate both your time and your candor .
KH : I enjoyed the exchange and appreciated your insights .
Thanks for the opportunity .

EPA
IT WAS uncharacteristically low - key for the industry 's greatest showman .
But the essay published this week by Steve Jobs , the boss of Apple , on his firm 's website under the unassuming title “ Thoughts on Music ” has nonetheless provoked a vigorous debate about the future of digital music , which Apple dominates with its iPod music - player and iTunes music - store .
At issue is “ digital rights management ” ( DRM ) — the technology guarding downloaded music against theft .
Since there is no common standard for DRM , it also has the side - effect that songs purchased for one type of music - player may not work on another .
Apple 's DRM system , called FairPlay , is the most widespread .
So it came as a surprise when Mr Jobs called for DRM for digital music to be abolished .
This is a change of tack for Apple .
It has come under fire from European regulators who claim that its refusal to license FairPlay to other firms has “ locked in ” customers .
Since music from the iTunes store cannot be played on non-iPod music - players ( at least not without a lot of fiddling ) , any iTunes buyer will be deterred from switching to a device made by a rival firm , such as Sony or Microsoft .
When French lawmakers drafted a bill last year compelling Apple to open up FairPlay to rivals , the company warned of “ state - sponsored piracy ” .
Only DRM , it implied , could keep the pirates at bay .
This week Mr Jobs gave another explanation for his former defence of DRM : the record companies made him do it .
They would make their music available to the iTunes store only if Apple agreed to protect it using DRM .
They can still withdraw their catalogues if the DRM system is compromised .
Apple cannot license FairPlay to others , says Mr Jobs , because it would depend on them to produce security fixes promptly .
All DRM does is restrict consumer choice and provide a barrier to entry , says Mr Jobs ; without it there would be far more stores and players , and far more innovation .
So , he suggests , why not do away with DRM and sell music unprotected ?
“ This is clearly the best alternative for consumers , ” he declares , “ and Apple would embrace it in a heartbeat . ”
Why the sudden change of heart ?
Mr Jobs seems chiefly concerned with getting Europe 's regulators off his back .
Rather than complaining to Apple about its use of DRM , he suggests , “ those unhappy with the current situation should redirect their energies towards persuading the music companies to sell their music DRM - free . ”
Two and a half of the four big record companies , he helpfully points out , are European - owned .
Mr Jobs also hopes to paint himself as a consumer champion .
Apple resents accusations that it has become the Microsoft of digital music .
Apple can afford to embrace open competition in music players and online stores .
Consumers would gravitate to the best player and the best store , and at the moment that still means Apple's .
Mr Jobs is evidently unfazed by rivals to the iPod .
Since only 3 % of the music in a typical iTunes library is protected , most of it can already be used on other players today , he notes .
( And even the protected tracks can be burned onto a CD and then re-ripped . )
So Apple 's dominance evidently depends far more on branding and ease of use than DRM - related “ lock in ” .
The music giants are trying DRM - free downloads .
Lots of smaller labels already sell music that way .
Having seen which way the wind is blowing , Mr Jobs now wants to be seen not as DRM 's defender , but as a consumer champion who helped in its downfall .
Would n't it lead to a surge in piracy ?
No , because most music is still sold unprotected on CDs , people wishing to steal music already can do so .
Indeed , scrapping DRM would probably increase online - music sales by reducing confusion and incompatibility .
With the leading online store , Apple would benefit most .
Mr Jobs 's argument , in short , is transparently self - serving .
It also happens to be right .
Hybrid car economics will face a new road test this month with the arrival of fresh models sporting revised mileage ratings from the Environmental Protection Agency .
This year , new test standards have forced manufacturers to lower advertised efficiency claims on most models compared to previous years , and car lots are bracing for a tougher environment for hybrid sales .
It will " make for an interesting summer , " said Phil Reed , the fuel economy guide editor at auto website Edmunds.com .
The estimations are based on data from Edmunds.com that assumes 15,000 miles driven per year and gasoline at an average price of $ 2.70 .
Revised EPA Miles Per Gallon Estimates
Hybrids can cost from $ 1,500 to $ 4,500 more than their gas - only equivalents .
The new mileage estimates mean it will take longer to recoup that extra cost in money saved on gas .
Experts say the shift could dampen demand , although some hybrids will look better on paper than others .
According to a formula devised by Edmunds , it would take nearly 10 years to recoup the extra costs after buying a 2007 Mercury Mariner Hybrid , up from 6.6 according to the old mileage ratings .
For the 2007 Honda Accord and Honda Civic hybrids it takes 14.5 and 6.5 years , respectively .
The 2007 Toyota Prius remains a good bargain when compared to a similarly equipped 2007 Toyota Camry – it takes just 1.2 years to break even .
The latest sales figures on hybrids remain strong .
Toyota sold 90 percent more gas - electric vehicles during the first two months of 2007 compared to the previous year .
And in March 2007 , hybrid sales nearly doubled over the previous March .
But come summer , attitudes might change .
Some consumers seem to have soured a bit on hybrids .
Michael Spath of Jacksonville , Florida , had considered the Prius when he purchased his last car , but he did n't trust the EPA ratings and decided on the less expensive Toyota Corolla .
" It gets the same mileage as the Prius for a heck of a lot less money , " Spath said in an e-mail .
The adjusted fuel - economy ratings make the economics clear .
" I would not purchase a hybrid because they are in fact not cost - effective .
I really wish they were because I probably would have bought one , " he said .
As previously reported by Wired News , many hybrid owners have experienced fuel economy far below the EPA estimates .
Now , after more than 20 years of producing mileage estimates that were far above what most drivers experienced , the EPA has added new testing procedures that more closely match what the average driver will experience .
The EPA created an online calculator based on the revised testing methodology that generates more realistic expectations for today 's vehicles .
The two top - selling hybrid vehicles , the Prius and Honda 's Civic Hybrid , will lose 12 and 11 miles per gallon respectively from their city driving estimates .
Other vehicles are downgraded between 2 and 4 mpg ( see chart ) .
Overall , vehicle city mileage estimates dropped by about 12 percent , and some vehicles are expected to be rated 30 percent lower , according to EPA documents .
The new EPA tests factor in real - world conditions such as speeding , varying weather and lead - footed driving .
Vehicles like hybrids with smaller engines pay a higher penalty during the acceleration test , as well as the tests that simulate going up a hill and maintaining highway speeds .
The fuel - economy estimates that appear on 2008 vehicles wo n't be based on actual test data , but will be an approximation ( as used in EPA 's calculator ) , according to EPA spokesman John Millett .
This year , auto manufacturers can choose whether to run the additional tests , but starting with the 2010 model year , the EPA will require the tests on all new cars , he said .
Hybrid vehicle performance was previously overestimated partly because the tests included vehicles ' idling for long periods , causing many hybrids to shut down their engines to conserve fuel .
The old testing methodology registered " a higher fuel economy for hybrid vehicles than is achieved under typical driving conditions , " according to EPA documents .
The new ratings will , on a positive note , end debate about hybrids not performing as advertised , said Dave Alexander , a senior analyst at ABI Research .
Conscientious drivers ( who brake and start slowly and keep the needle below 60 mph ) could even surpass the EPA ratings , he said .
" There is potential in the long run for better customer satisfaction . "

This is so priceless , and so easy to see happening , customer service being what it is today .
A lady died this past January , and The Bank billed her for February March for their annual service charges on her credit card , added late fees and interest on the monthly charge .
The balance of $ 0 , is now somewhere around $ 60 .
A Family Member placed a call to The Bank .
Here is the exchange :
Family Member : “ I am calling to tell you she died in January . ”
The Bank : “ The account was never closed , and the late fees charges still apply . ”
Family Member : “ Maybe you should turn it over to collections . ”
The Bank : “ Since it is 2 months past due , it already has been . ”
Family Member :
So , what will they do when they find out she is dead ? ”
The Bank : “ Either report her account to frauds division or report her to the credit bureau .
Maybe both ! ”
Family Member : “ Do you think God will be mad at her ? ” ( I really liked this part !!!!)
The Bank : “ Excuse me ? ”
Family Member : “ Did you just get what I was telling you ?
The part about her being dead ? ”
The Bank : “ Sir , you ’ll have to speak to my supervisor . ” !
( Supervisor gets on the phone )
Family Member : “ I ’m calling to tell you she died in January . ”
The Bank : “ The account was never closed , so the late fees and charges still apply . ”
( This must be a phrase taught by The Bank ! )
Family Member : “ Do you mean you want to collect from her estate ? ”
The Bank : ( stammering ) “ Are you her lawyer ? ”
Family Member : “ No , I ’m her great - nephew . ”
The Bank : “ Could you fax us a certificate of death ? ”
Family Member : “ Sure . ” ( fax number is given )
After they get the fax :
The Bank : “ Our system just is n’t set up for death .
I do n’t know what more I can do to help . ”
Family Member : “ Well , if you figure it out , great !
If not , you could just keep billing her .
I really do n’t think she will care . ”
The Bank : “ Well , the late fees charges do still apply . ”
( What is wrong with these people ??!!)
Family Member : “ Would you like her new billing address ? ”
The Bank : “ Yes , that will help . ”
Family Member : ” Odessa Memorial Cemetery , Highway 129 , Plot Number 69 . ”
The Bank : “ Sir , that is a cemetery ! ”
Family Member : “ What do you do with dead people on YOUR planet ?!!

US weighs possible strikes on Iran 's military : report Agence France - Presse

The US administration has shifted strategy and is drawing up plans for possible air strikes against Iran 's Revolutionary Guard instead of the country 's nuclear sites , the New Yorker magazine reported on Sunday .
Read the full New Yorker article here .
President George W. Bush has requested the Joint Chiefs of Staff revise plans for a possible attack on Iran , with the focus on " surgical " raids against the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps which Washington accuses of targeting US forces in Iraq , the magazine wrote .
Previous contingency plans called for a more elaborate bombing campaign against suspected nuclear sites in Iran as well as other infrastructure , the magazine reported , citing unnamed former officials and government consultants .
The change in focus comes as Bush and his top aides have begun to describe the war in Iraq in public statements as increasingly a " strategic battle between the United States and Iran , " said the article by investigative reporter Seymour Hersh .
During a video conference over the summer , Bush allegedly told Ryan Crocker , the US ambassador to Iraq , that he was considering striking Iranian targets across the border and that the British " were on board , " according to the article .
But Israeli leaders were dismayed that Washington had decided not to target Iran 's nuclear program and French officials had expressed doubts about the possible limited air strikes , it said .
While Bush has not yet issued an " execute order " for a military operation inside Iran , the pace of attack planning has increased markedly and the CIA has dramatically expanded a unit focusing on Iran , it said .
The amended plan would call for using the US Navy 's " sea - launched cruise missiles and more precisely targeted ground attacks and bombing strikes , including plans to destroy the most important Revolutionary Guard training camps , supply depots , and command and control facilities , " it said .
Vice President Dick Cheney was pushing to confront the Iranians despite deep concerns from Republicans that any action could be politically disastrous for the party given popular opposition to the Iraq war , a former intelligence official said .
" There is a desperate effort by Cheney et al. to bring military action to Iran as soon as possible , " the official said .
" Meanwhile , the politicians are saying , ' You can't do it , because every Republican is going to be defeated , and we 're only one fact away from going over the cliff in Iraq . ' "
Bush and his advisers have adopted the new " counter - terrorism " approach recognizing the US public is not convinced that Iran poses an imminent nuclear threat and that the US intelligence community believes Tehran is at least five years away from obtaining an atomic bomb .
But officials are betting the case for hitting Iranian forces blamed for attacking US soldiers would be easier to make , the magazine wrote .
" This time , unlike the attack in Iraq , we 're going to play the victim .
The name of our game seems to be to get the Iranians to overplay their hand , " said Zbigniew Brezinski , a former national security adviser under ex-president Jimmy Carter and a critic of the Bush administration 's foreign policy .
Brezinski said that Iran would probably respond to a US attack " by intensifying the conflict in Iraq and also in Afghanistan , their neighbors , and that could draw in Pakistan .
" We will be stuck in a regional war for twenty years , " he said .
The magazine quoted a Defense Department spokesman saying the administration remains committed to a diplomatic solution to disputes with Iran .

Hizbollah's Response Reveals
Months Of Planning
By Robert Fisk
16 July , 2006
The Independent
I t will be called the massacre of Marwaheen .
All the civilians killed by the Israelis had been ordered to abandon their homes in the border village by the Israelis themselves a few hours earlier .
Leave , they were told by loudspeaker ; and leave they did , 20 of them in a convoy of civilian cars .
That 's when the Israeli jets arrived to bomb them , killing 20 Lebanese , at least nine of them children .
The local fire brigade could not put out the fires as they all burned alive in the inferno .
Another " terrorist " target had been eliminated .
Yesterday , the Israelis even produced more " terrorist " targets - petrol stations in the Bekaa Valley all the way up to the frontier city of Hermel in northern Lebanon and another series of bridges on one of the few escape routes to Damascus , this time between Chtaura and the border village of Masnaa .
Lebanon , as usual , was paying the price for the Hizbollah - Israeli conflict - as Hizbollah no doubt calculated they would when they crossed the Israeli frontier on Wednesday and captured two Israeli soldiers close to Marwaheen .
But who is really winning the war ?
Not Lebanon , you may say , with its more than 90 civilian dead and its infrastructure steadily destroyed in hundreds of Israeli air raids .
But is Israel winning ?
Friday night 's missile attack on an Israeli warship off the coast of Lebanon suggests otherwise .
Four Israeli sailors were killed , two of them hurled into the sea when a tele - guided Iranian - made missile smashed into their Hetz - class gunboat just off Beirut at dusk .
Those Lebanese who had endured the fire of Israeli gunboats on the coastal highway over many years were elated .
They may not have liked Hizbollah - but they hated the Israelis .
Only now , however , is a truer picture emerging of the battle for southern Lebanon and it is a fascinating , frightening tale .
The original border crossing , the capture of the two soldiers and the killing of three others was planned , according to Hassan Nasrallah , the Hizbollah leader who escaped assassination by the Israelis on Friday evening , more than five months ago .
And Friday 's missile attack on the Israeli gunboat was not the last - minute inspiration of a Hizbollah member who just happened to see the warship .
It now appears clear that the Hizbollah leadership - Nasrallah used to be the organisation 's military commander in southern Lebanon - thought carefully through the effects of their border crossing , relying on the cruelty of Israel 's response to quell any criticism of their action within Lebanon .
They were right in their planning .
The Israeli retaliation was even crueller than some Hizbollah leaders imagined , and the Lebanese quickly silenced all criticism of the guerrilla movement .
Hizbollah had presumed the Israelis would cross into Lebanon after the capture of the two soldiers and they blew up the first Israeli Merkava tank when it was only 35 feet inside the country .
All four Israeli crewmen were killed and the Israeli army moved no further forward .
The long - range Iranian - made missiles which later exploded on Haifa had been preceded only a few weeks ago by a pilotless Hizbollah drone aircraft which surveyed northern Israel and then returned to land in eastern Lebanon after taking photographs during its flight .
These pictures not only suggested a flight path for Hizbollah 's rockets to Haifa ; they also identified Israel 's top - secret military air traffic control centre in Miron .
The next attack - concealed by Israel 's censors - was directed at this facility .
Codenamed " Apollo " , Israeli military scientists work deep inside mountain caves and bunkers at Miron , guarded by watchtowers , guard - dogs and barbed wire , watching all air traffic moving in and out of Beirut , Damascus , Amman and other Arab cities .
The mountain is surmounted by clusters of antennae which Hizbollah quickly identified as a military tracking centre .
Before they fired rockets at Haifa , they therefore sent a cluster of missiles towards Miron .
The caves are untouchable but the targeting of such a secret location by Hizbollah deeply shocked Israel 's military planners .
The " centre of world terror " - or whatever they imagine Lebanon to be - could not only breach their frontier and capture their soldiers but attack the nerve - centre of the Israeli northern military command .
Then came the Haifa missiles and the attack on the gunboat .
It is now clear that this successful military operation - so contemptuous of their enemy were the Israelis that although their warship was equipped with cannon and a Vulcan machine gun , they did n't even provide the vessel with an anti-missile capability - was also planned months ago .
Once the Hetz - class boats appeared , Hizbollah positioned a missile crew on the coast of west Beirut not far from Jnah , a crew trained over many weeks for just such an attack .
It took less than 30 seconds for the Iranian - made missile to leave Beirut and hit the vessel square amidships , setting it on fire and killing the sailors .
Ironically , the Israelis themselves had invited journalists on an " embedded " trip with their navy only hours earlier - they were allowed to film the ships ' guns firing on Lebanon - and the moment Hizbollah hit the warship on Friday , Hizbollah 's television station , Al - Manar , began showing the " embedded " film .
It was a slick piece of propaganda .
The Israelis were yesterday trumpeting the fact that the missile was made in Iran as proof of Iran 's involvement in the Lebanon war .
This was odd reasoning .
Since almost all the missiles used to kill the civilians of Lebanon over the past four days were made in Seattle , Duluth and Miami in the United States , their use already suggests to millions of Lebanese that America is behind the bombardment of their country .

Click to viewAccording to support discussions and their own description pages , Apple has removed the ability to add events in the iPod touch 's calendar , even while it uses the same operating system and application frameworks as the iPhone [ Updated after the jump ]
Advertisement
After a lengthy discussion in Apple 's support boards about an image published in iLounge 's " The Beat is On " galleries , the company has removed the words " entering calendar events " from its US features page , as you can see in this screenshot :
Advertisement
However , the full text can still be read in other international pages ( like Canada , United Kingdom , Spain or France ) , which still carry the original US english copy .
After apparently pulling Bluetooth functionality at the last second , it seems like Apple is trying to further create distinctions between the two devices , positioning the iPhone as a productivity platform and the touch as an entertainment device .
Fortunately , if the move is confirmed in the final release of the product , the hackers will come later to the rescue .
[ Update Sept. 10th 04:37 AM ]
A reader points out that Microsoft also does artificial product segmentation .
Like with the Home edition of Windows , it includes the Internet Information Server component , which can't be used unless you hack the OS .
However , this does n't make artificial crippling right for the consumer .
Advertisement
I can fully understand Apple removing the CSR Bluetooth chip to make the iPod touch cheaper than the iPhone .
It 's a cost - saving measure , and they owe to their shareholders to save money and increase profits .
But taking a line of code out of a program to make some people buy the iPhone is a dodgy and surprising move by Apple .
It may be normal for Redmond , but certainly not for Cupertino .
As with shareholders , they also owe their customers some respect .
And yes , it 's Apple 's choice and they can do whatever they want as a company .
However , these practices are quite different from what Apple has been doing in the past with all their products , including Mac OS X vs Mac OS X Server .
Segmentation is fine , but having a phone and EDGE and SMS and Bluetooth built in in the iPhone is enough feature differentiation to justify the current $ 100 price gap .
Why limit a simple piece of software and risk customer alienation ?
Advertisement
Obviously , there is a limit to product segmentation and the increasing uproar in Apple 's discussion pages demonstrates that people do n't get this kind of artificial crippling .
Hopefully , Apple will get the message and change this before the product becomes available .

That is the new book by James R. Flynn .
He suggests the following :
Today we have no difficulty freeing logic from concrete referents and reasoning about purely hypothetical situations .
People were not always thus .
In other words , people in earlier times really were stupider when it came to abstract thought , but this was primarily for environmental reasons .
These people also had more daily , practical skills , again for reasons of practice .
We in contrast receive daily workouts with hypotheticals , rapidly moving images , and spatial reasoning .
So Flynn is suggesting that IQ is n’t more multi-dimensional than it may seem .
The Flynn Effect gains are in fact concentrated in the most spatial and abstract versions of IQ tests .
Flynn summarizes the " Dickens - Flynn " model , through which environment and IQ interact in multiplicative fashion .
Smart people seek out environments which make them even smarter , and this helps reconcile the cross-sectional IQ data ( adoption does n’t change IQ so much ) with the time series of increasingly higher IQ scores ( environments are changing for everybody ) .
This reconciliation was fuzzy to me , but I took Flynn to be claiming that separated identical twins will reimpose common environmental forces on themselves , thus keeping their IQs in relatively close long - run synch .
I still do n’t understand what kind of test ( might it contrast permanent vs. temporary environmental shocks ? ) might falsify the Dickens - Flynn model .
Flynn also argues that the Chinese in America attained high levels of achievement before
above - average IQs .
This book does n’t tie up all the loose ends , and it could have been written in a more organized fashion .
Still it is one of the more interesting volumes of the year .
Addendum : I have long thought that the Germanic " Hausmusik " tradition was responsible for producing so many great composers in one relatively short period of time .
Flynn ’s book offers ( unintended ) hints about why it is so hard to reproduce the cultural blossomings of times past , and also why future creations will seem baffling to the old fogies .
I was tempted to offer a Poll , but I 'm much more interested in hearing your serious ideas about this than in creating a " push poll " where folks can critique or endorse my preconceptions .
What does it mean when at the most famously successful " partisan " Democratic blog - in the burgeoning netroots community that 's supposedly poised to change the landscape - the party leader breaks all her promises and ignores us , even for the election season , without apology ?
( Pelosi also promised to attend Yearly Kos , but evidently authorizing warrantless spying took a priority . )
Actually , it looks like the only person posting here who even noticed we were being boycotted and insulted by our party 's leader is a snark who calls herself Speaker Nancy ( no last name , but the satirical intent is obvious ) .
" Speaker Nancy " has been far more attentive and accurate than the real Pelosi lately .
She even predicted that the real Pelosi would rush unconstitutional changes to FISA through the Congress , and offered more of a reason why than Pelosi ever did .
Weirdly , the reaction to Speaker Nancy was largely , ' Delete her account , it 's too close to Pelosi 's real name , she must be a troll - and we do n't want Bill O'Reilly to find out how much the real Nancy Pelosi despises us !'
What 's wrong with us ?
Will this community quietly avoid this discussion - and abandon any influence we might have - to protect the principal actor in " our " party 's current leadership vaccuum ?
Do we so envy the Republicans that we 've embraced blind partisanship , selective accountability , cronyistic loyalty and denial as our own core values ?
Nancy Pelosi is the one who should be answering the question in this diary 's title .
Recommending it might be the only way we 'll ever see her around these parts again .
UPDATE WITH ACTION :
This diary has struck a nerve .
It has been on the front page for more than 24 hours , with 680 +
Recommends and over 900 comments , most agreeing that the nominal party leader has abandoned Democrats - and not just by blowing off her empty pledges to the Daily Kos .
One person questioned my use of the term " boycott " .
130 questioned my use of the term " leader " .
( Predictably , some floated the idea that Pelosi 's critics are " Republican plants " or trolls , but this time we rejected that ruse .
Discussions like this are what Daily Kos is about - not a violation of its FAQ . )
Our role must be action , not just criticism .
We 're not waiting for Nancy Pelosi to show up now .
She will listen only when her constituents and former supporters have an alternative .
Her San Francisco Congressional seat is 100 % safe from Republicans , so the usual " Help , A Third Party Spoiler ! " that empowers Bush 's Blue Dogs in the South will never be an issue .
If you have a primary challenger recommendation , fine .
If you like Cindy Sheehan , fine .
( Several comments expressed regret over the way Cindy was treated here . )
If you want to promote the next Bernie Sanders from the Bay Area , that 's probably what we need .
Standing up could even spur action in other districts , prying unresponsive incumbents loose from their undeserved power .
I will be posting again on this topic , aiming to turn our passion into action , and I strongly encourage others to do so .
Think before you code
In the past ten days , I have n't written a single line of code for tarsnap .
And I 'm proud of it .
There has been a trend lately , particularly where internet startups are concerned , to measure success by the number of lines of code written .
People talk about the all - important " first - mover advantage " and about things moving at " internet speed " , while Paul Graham -- co-founder of Viaweb and of the Y Combinator startup incubator -- lists " Release Early " as # 1 on his list of lessons for startups to learn .
In a recent article about Y Combinator , Paul Graham pointed to the fact that two people had written 40,000 lines of code in three months as a sign that they were doing something right ; he went on to point out that " you never see that in a big company " .
To me this number is , if anything , a sign that things are going horribly wrong :
Anyone who is consistenly writing more than 5,000 lines of code per month is either ( a ) not working on a problem which is difficult enough to be interesting ( any half - competent programmer can write binary searches , quicksorts , and depth - first graph traversals at a rate of thousands of lines of code per day ) ; ( b ) utterly incompetent ( we 've all seen people who can replace ten lines of working code with a thousand lines of buggy code ) ; or ( c ) going to have to throw out and rewrite most of their code once they realize that it does n't solve the problem which they needed to solve -- with this realization most likely coming after their first release .
Of these three scenarios , I think it is the third which is the most dangerous , and -- with apologies to Fred Brooks -- I 'm going to call it the " zeroth - system effect " .
In his book " The Mythical Man-Month " , Fred Brooks notes that after a first system which works but has very few features typically comes a second system which is bloated with all the features which were considered but not included in the first system ( and as a result of this , the second system invariably takes longer and is more expensive than expected ) .
The zeroth system is what comes before the first system :
Not only does it have very few features , but it does n't work .
Of course , when I say that the zeroth system does n't work , I do n't mean that it does n't successfully do anything useful ; rather , I mean that it contains such fundamental bugs as to cast doubt upon whether the authors had any understanding of the field in which they were operating .
An example of this is the recent Cross - site scripting vulnerability in reddit : Cross - site scripting attacks were widely known and understood long before reddit was created , and the classic example of where XSS vulnerabilities can occur -- sites where users can post comments to be read by other users -- exactly matches this vulnerability .
So what have I been doing for the past ten days ?
Improving my understanding of the field in which I 'm about to write code -- namely , cryptography and cryptographic protocols .
I 'm about to start writing the client - server protocol code for tarsnap , and I want it to be secure : Based on the work I 've already done , there 's no danger of an attacker ( assuming he has n't stolen keys , ca n't factor 2048 - bit integers , can't break AES , etc. ) being able to decrypt or forge tarsnap backups , but the client - server protocol needs to be secure in order to prevent an attacker from ( a ) impersonating a client and deleting backups , ( b ) impersonating a client and wasting said client 's money , or ( c ) impersonating a server and causing a client to think that data is being backed up ( or that a backup is being deleted ) when it is n't .
Part of what I 've concluded is that given the state of cryptographic libraries ( i.e. , there is n't anything available which is immune to side channel attacks )
I 'm going to use Elgamal key agreement instead of transporting session keys over RSA : Elgamal keys can be generated far more quickly ( since they can all use the same modulus ) , so by bounding the rate at which information leaks through side channels and by frequently generating new keys , I can prevent any server key from being disclosed via a side channel attack .
If I had jumped into writing code immediately , I would n't have been able to make such a reasoned decision .
" Write code " is definitely important .
" Release early " , too .
But more important than either of those is " Understand the problem you 're trying to solve " ; and most important of all : " Do it right " .

04:32 pm - Psychologically healthy Buddhists ...
... do they exist ?
I used to think that when I went into Buddhist communities , I would encounter relatively " enlightened " people : like average people , except only a little wiser and more mindful .
My actual experience of sangha , in person and online , is that Buddhist groups are magnets for especially maladjusted and lost people .
The passage of time and accumulation of experience interacting with multiple sanghas has only confirmed this further .
I 'm not saying this universally applies to anyone interested in a Buddhist group , but it seems on average , there 's more psychological disturbance and even lower levels of average , street - level clarity manifested in the conversations I 've had with various " Buddhists " than with random folks in other settings and on the street .
This has been quite discouraging , and has stirred up a lot of skepticism on my part about Buddhism and the claims made by its practitioners .
On top of various degrees of dissociative , thought - disordered , and delusional behavior , I 've also seen an exceptionally common trend of emotional maladjustment .
What makes this even more of a concern is that it seems that a lot of people ( from people who 've just read a few books to actual teachers ) have used Buddhist rhetoric to justify their emotionally unhealthy ways of being .
People with deep - seated traumas and a lot of painful emotions who have learned to dissociate or repress as a coping mechanism find cosmic justification for these practices in Buddhism .
And I 'm not making these observations from on high - - I 've been , and probably still am , to some extent , one of those people .
I 've just recently begun to see how many of the things I thought and did that I thought were " spiritual " or " wise " were really just psychologically disordered behavior .
Now that I 'm finally seeing and dealing with a lot of psychological and emotional stuff in new and healthy ways , seeing my own emotions as valid and finding relief from deep - seated neuroses through working with them , I 'm starting to see the pathological ways I 've used Buddhism to perpetuate dysfunctional patterns of thinking and behavior .
I 'm not saying that I have n't benefited from Buddhism or that I do n't believe that it's of great value as a religious tradition .
I have benefited from it deeply , in ways I do n't think I could have from anything else .
I am so grateful I have encountered the Dharma and practiced the path .
But I now see that it 's not the end - all , be-all .
A lot of people who go on about enlightenment are obviously not even functioning well on an average day - to - day level psychologically .
I think there 's a lot of self - and group delusion that goes on in Buddhist circles .
And it can go very deep .
It 's shocking , and sad , the way people use religion to hurt themselves and other people , and in ways in which they often do n't even realize what they 're doing .
If you do n't have respect and compassion for yourself , you will never be able to truly feel or manifest those things for others .
And that does n't require reifying your ego .
Nor does it mean being selfish or self - centered .
It means looking to your emotions as something worth exploring , worth addressing and healing , rather than seeing them as something you can surgically extract with enough meditation or " insight . "
Ultimately , emotions may be empty , but that does n't mean that when you can realize and see this that they disappear .
If you have n't dealt with your own emotional " stuff , " you will continue to act it out , no matter how spiritually " enlightened " you might otherwise be or become .
If you need proof of this , just look to all of the brilliant teachers who have led incredibly dysfunctional lives .
Do n't deny yourself kindness because it seems to be the more enlightened thing to do .
That 's just bullshit .

Seriously , these problems exist in any religion you care to look at ; atheists and agnostics are n't all completely sane either , for that matter .
People are fucked up , no matter what groups they happen to belong to .
If you expect otherwise you will never cease to be disappointed .

Well , of course .
Certainly , my expectations early on were unrealistic and idealized .
But what I found over time was n't that the people I was encountering had a " normal " level of dysfunction , but a higher level of dysfunction than that I have encountered with others outside of the Buddhist milieu .

Hmm , I 'd say your right , when talking about communities , since there is an overhead name to them , which does n't mean that they have to be a specific way .
So , you might have a buddhist community , with a lot of " broken " people in it , does n't mean it has to do with buddhism itself , it has to do woth the people there .
Everything that goes in a spiritual , an esoteric way , even if just some way of specific psychological practice , has the potential to attract those in need for it .
As for buddhism itself , I see it perfectly matching with a lot of psychological facts about a better inner working .
It all depends on the perception and the use of it .
Some of the things you say , a seeing and dealing with things in a proper way , are as buddhistic as it gets , at least for me they are .
I for myself , have met so many disfunction in so many occasions and in some many places , that I 've come to the conclusion , that disfuntion is the norm , whereas everything else is something you have to work for really hard .
Some donÄt try at all , which is cool , and some you might find at a buddhist group . :-)
Bottom line , you 'll find it everywhere , maybe you expect it otherwise from some people , which is a big mistake , at least in my experience .
Take care !

You make a lot of excellent points .
And to be clear , I do n't see the people that have struck me as more dysfunctional than average as " broken . "
Like you , I can see how such people could benefit from the practice , and sincerely hope that they do .
What worries me is that the opposite might be true -- that the messages they 're getting and what they 're doing is reinforcing and deepening these issues , rather than alleviating them .
That certainly happened with me to some extent .
Buddhist practice helped me in a lot of ways , but it also reinforced some of my most harmful dysfunctions .
Of course , it 's easy to say , " That 's because of you , not the teaching , " but my point is not to vilify Buddhist teaching , but to say that if Buddhist communities attract such vulnerable individuals , that this can happen should be a concern for all of us .
We need to take care of ourselves and each other first before we worry about a whole bunch of esoteric crap that 's ultimately meaningless .

From : phaenix_ash Date : October 25th , 2007 09:38 pm ( UTC ) ( Link ) for the record , the states of dissociation and meditation are very distinctly different .
are you certain you 're not reading social awkwardness or simple shyness as dysfunction ?

I wish my memory was clear enough that I could recall a specific conversation so I could put something concrete out there , but I can't .
But I definitely would n't just say it was shyness or social awkwardness .
There 's a difference between stumbling over one 's words and speaking and acting in ways that are jarring and unsettling .
I get in a lot of random conversations around Brooklyn and Manhattan , and work with people that are diagnosed with mental illness , and I feel completely at ease in these various situations and with these people , whereas I continue to get a completely creeped out and uncomfortable feeling in the spiritual settings I seek out on my own .
To be fair , in these settings , I 've also connected with people who have n't struck me in this way , but they 've actually been the exception .
I wish I could explain it better , but my current ideas about why this might be are someone cynical thoughts about religion in general .

I think some of this is an effect of the people who know do n't or wo n't say and those who say stuff do n't know .
That is , those of use active here and in many other communities online are here specifically because we are seeking , not because we have answers or are enlightened .
I also think that 's especially true for most western , not - raised - Buddhist Buddhists , who I suspect are over - represented in online communities such as this one .
I , for one , have made a change from the religion in which I was raised because I think there was a problem and it did n't work ( for me or in general ... whichever ) .
That is , converted Buddhists are more likely to be dissatisfied with their early lives , the doctrines they were raised with , or their previous ways of living .
Therefore they are more likely to have substantial challenges to their psychological or emotional health from those past experiences .
It 's therefore largely a phenomenon of self - selection in my opinion .
YMMV .

I certainly would n't expect to see the same dynamic in a Buddhist community where being Buddhist was just a matter of cultural transmission on a larger scale .
Even though Buddhism continues to become more mainstream in the States , it 's still largely a religion that draws people in a very idiosyncratic way .

You make interesting points .
I know I turned to Buddhism after a particularly traumatic period in my life that affected me greatly .
I will say , though , that it has helped me to overcome those things in ways that nothing else could , and it has bettered my life .
I think any religion I actually believed in would have ... but I did n't choose to believe in Buddhism .
It found me .
Fortunately , I know Buddhists who are well adjusted , as well as those who are not :)

To be fair , I 'm probably exaggerating the matter a bit for the sake of stirring up some good conversation here .
And I 'm taking a certain perspective in this post , and one could easily look at it in another way : traumatic experiences " open us up " and point to the essentially empty nature of the mind , and that plus the way the equanimity of meditation can help with the immediate pain of particular emotions , make Buddhism a natural draw for people who are wounded and struggling .
I know that I 've benefited the most , and that my practice has deepened the most , in the most difficult periods in my life .
And to be clear , I 'm not trying to stigmatize people struggling with emotional and psychological difficulty .
It 's more just a concern of mine that " What if this Buddhist stuff is making some people suffer more ? "
It 's a complex issue for me , because I can see ways that my engagement with Buddhism both hurt and helped me .
But the good ultimately outweighed the bad , so maybe it 's not worth worrying about too much .
I do n't know .

Good question , and we could get all esoteric about how it 's just an empty concept , but I think it 's really pretty simple .
The ideal of psychological health would be to have a pretty steady level of contentment and low level of anxiety , to be able to communicate effectively with others , and to be able to have rewarding relationships that support and soothe more than they hurt .
Also , to have resolved past trauma so that it does not dominate your daily thinking and behavior patterns .
That 's an ideal , but even so , what I 'm realizing now is that it 's actually possible to move toward that , and it can be even more rewarding than " spiritual stuff . "
Of course , it 's false to set up a distinction between the two , but yet I 've seen it done a lot in " spiritual circles . "

I 'm wondering which groups of people ( religious or otherwise ) you 've encountered you feel are most " psychologically healthy " , when you start to look at them like that .
Seems like I meet so many dysfunctional people , the Buddhists are a breath of fresh air in comparison .
But it 's all a question of context , is n't it ?

I would n't say I 've found one group that is the most psychologically healthy .
It 's just that I 've noticed this trend toward the opposite end of the spectrum in spiritual communities .
Which makes me wonder about religion sometimes .

I 've never personally seen anyone use Buddhism for what I considered a justification for dysfunction
An example would be someone with feelings of self - loathing using Buddhist teachings to further enforce the belief that doing anything for him or herself or thinking about his or her own needs was " unenlightened " and " unskillful , " and thus continuing to persist in dysfunctional relationships .
Another example would be someone with painful emotions using various meditation practices to dissociate from those emotions , rather than look at them any more deeply or try to work through them .

From : turil Date : October 26th , 2007 12:08 am ( UTC ) ( Link ) I have a theory ( ok it 's made up mostly of other people 's theories , but I call it mine , too ) that you need both intellectual AND emotional health to be mentally healthy .
Buddhism the philosophy can help you be more intellectually healthy by helping you think in healthier ways .
And Buddhism the practice ( meditation , focusing , mindfulness , etc. ) can help you with the emotional health stuff , by letting you literally feel different states , and giving you some control over them .
But all this takes time , especially for those of us who grew up in a particularly unhealthy environment , and picked up lots of intellectually and emotionally unhealthy habits .
So those who are drawn to the healing aspects of Buddhism , are going to have to spend a lot of time in the Buddhist community before they learn healthier thinking and feeling .
And really , why else would you be drawn into Buddhism if not for the healing aspects ?
Reply ) ( Thread
From : nobody _ Date : October 26th , 2007 12:27 am ( UTC ) ( Link ) Good points .
I think that most people drawn to it are probably looking for some form of healing , but I think that many of us do n't realize it at the time .
I know I identified my interest in it early on more as an intellectual pursuit , and did n't really see myself being motivated by my own suffering .
I guess the point I was trying to make is just that I hope that Buddhism is promoting healing , and not further retrenching those bad habits .

From : oboegoddess Date : October 26th , 2007 12:25 am ( UTC ) ( Link ) I do n't personally know a lot of Buddhists or have much experience in a Buddhist community , but the Buddhist who I think I 've been closest to in my life was the therapist I saw when I was in high school .
She did n't push religion on me or anything , but her counseling obviously came from her Buddhist perspective , and to this date she is the only counselor that I feel has significantly helped me work through the problems I was having at the time ( other counselors helped some , but not really that much ) .
I remember her as being so centered and peaceful and really having this calming and loving aura about her , while also being very down to earth and funny .
I know this is only one person , but I saw her as being the most psychologically healthy person I knew ( at least from what I experienced being around her ) .
I think it 's natural that people who are suffering or at low points in their lives tend to seek out something " higher " spiritually .
Personally , I have been most drawn to Buddhism during difficult times , and it has definitely had a positive impact on my life and made me have more compassion toward myself and the world .
I have resisted labeling myself as any religion because I firmly believe in finding my own path , so I never felt the need to " sacrifice " for the cause .
However , I certainly have adhered to beliefs in my life that were ultimately harmful to myself or others , so I can see how people might warp the meanings of Buddhist teachings and cause themselves further suffering .
But honestly , if Buddhism was n't there I 'm sure people would latch onto some other cause or religion until they are truly ready to face themselves .
As long as we are living in this world , there are going to be opportunities to cling to things in unhealthy ways in an attempt to escape our suffering , and I think people just have to eventually become aware of this for themselves when they are ready .

That 's a wonderful story re : your counselor .
I would like to be like that some day :)
You make a lot of good points as well .
I 'm glad I followed my whim and posted this , because the comments and discussion have been really interesting and informative .
I definitely am thinking now about different ways of looking at what I 've been seeing , and these new perspectives are more positive than the one I had previously .
I was seeing the context as an agent of the dysfunction , rather than thinking of it as an agent of healing and just that I 've been encountering some folks who are more in the early stages of it ... like I was at one point :)

The Arab Center for the Studies of Arid Zones and Dry Lands ( ACSAD ) in Syria called the reports of an Israeli attack on its facility in Dir a - Zour completely " made - up " and claimed that it only learned of the purported attack after seeing satellite images of its property and reading about the attack in the news .
In an announcement , the center wrote that it was shocked to hear of the " fabricated lies of the Zionist media " that its facilities were the target of a supposed Israeli raid .
The center added that it would be happy to organize a tour of its property for the international press .
Israel - Syria Relations Syria says Israel wants to make excuses for war Reuters Syrian vice president says Syrian not interested in war with Israel ' in distant or near future , ' accuses Jerusalem of spreading false reports Syria says Israel wants to make excuses for war
Last weekend , in a Ynet special report , Ron Ben - Yishai took pictures and interviewed eyewitnesses living in the small town of Dir A - Zour located next to the research center .
One of the interviewees claimed to have heard sonic booms during the alleged Israeli attack , but said he did not hear explosions on the ground .
Ron Ben - Yishai at research center
Syrian Vice President Farouq al - Shara echoed the announcement made by the center .
He said Israel was spreading false allegations that it intended to attack Syrian weapons of mass destruction facilities .
He also added that Syria was not interested in going to war with Israel in the near or distant future .
" Everything that has been reported about this attack is erroneous and is part of an Israeli campaign of psychological warfare that will not succeed in misleading Syria , " the vice president said at a press conference in Damascus with his Iraqi counterpart Adel Abdul - Mahdi Saturday .
According to Al - Shara , this attack was meant to raise the morale of the Israeli army after it failed in its attempt to destroy Hizbullah in the Second Lebanon War .
Scientists are trying to preserve the species by sending a Noah 's Ark population of healthy animals to zoos and sanctuaries on the mainland .
Institutions in Europe and the United States are also expected to play a part in Project Ark , aimed at conserving the creatures and , if possible , releasing them back into the wild if and when the disease is eliminated .
A total of 48 devils have been relocated to zoos around Australia , and four devils have been born at a Queensland wildlife park participating in the project .
The size of a grain of rice at birth , they were the first babies produced under the captive breeding program .
While the births were hailed as a rare snippet of good news , the prognosis for Tasmanian devils is bleak .
The highly contagious disease is transmitted when the cantankerous creatures bite each other , fighting over food or mating .
It has spread across three quarters of the island .
The disease , which causes tumours to grow on the face , first appeared on Tasmania 's remote north - east coast , its provenance a mystery .
The cancer takes root in the devil 's mouth and pushes out its teeth .
Many have died of starvation .
The fear is that the devil , which inspired the Warner Brothers Loony Tunes character , Taz , will go the way of the Tasmanian tiger , or thylacine , which was hunted to the point of extinction in the 1930s .
The Project Ark program may be one way to help save the species , with the aim being to hold about 1500 devils , an " insurance population " , in captivity .
Zoos taking part in the project include the Healesville Sanctuary , the Australian Reptile Park and Wildlife Sanctuary in Sydney and the Currumbin Wildlife Sanctuary in Queensland , where the babies were born .
Other institutions are building special enclosures for the devils as they prepare to take their quota .
It is anticipated that up to 20 zoos on the mainland will become involved over the next three years .
After that , according to Caroline Lees , who is co-ordinating the program for the Australasian Regional Association of Zoological Parks and Aquaria , 15 to 20 overseas zoos may be sent healthy devils .
Lees recently told the Sydney Morning Herald that it was the first project of its kind .
" There are global programs for species survival , with the red panda or golden lion tamarin , " she said .
" But there has n't been a project set up at a global scale to save an animal from disease before . "
It may not be enough , though .
Scientists warn that animals begin to lose their natural behaviour after several generations in captivity — and it could take that long for the disease to be eradicated .
So it is important , if possible , for a devil population to be maintained in the wild .
Wildlife experts are considering the feasibility of relocating a number of creatures to islands off Tasmania , where they would be safe from the spread of the disease .
One location being assessed is Maria Island , a former convict settlement off the east coast , now a national park .
Scientists are carrying out an evaluation of the environmental impact of devil refugees arriving on the island .
Eventually it is hoped that half a dozen islands and protected peninsulas could become home to healthy devils , which could then breed sustainable populations .
Hamish McCallum , professor of wildlife research at the University of Tasmania , says : " At the moment , we have no vaccine , we have no effective treatment , so the one thing we know we can do is take uninfected animals to a place that the disease can't easily reach .
" But one of the risks is that , after several generations in captivity , animals begin to lose their natural behaviours .
" We need to have more than just captive populations .
It would be a tragedy if they were only in zoos . "
McCallum says that , ideally , experts wanted to maintain a population of 1000 in the wild , but that would probably not be feasible .
As a start , he is hoping to put 30 on Maria Island ; 30 devils are waiting in quarantine in Hobart .
Such projects cost money and there is not much of it around , despite the urgency of the problem .
The Tasmanian Government has pledged $ 3 million to combat the disease over the next two years .
Tasmanian Greens MP
Nick McKim points out that the government is spending twice that sum to sponsor an Australian Rules football club , and says that tens of millions of dollars are needed to save the devil from going the way of the Tasmanian tiger .
Some funding has been provided by the Federal Government , but scientists criticise the slow official response to the disease .
It was not until 2003 that funds were allocated for research , although the first case was identified in 1995 .
" We are now in a race against extinction , " says Menna Jones , a leading Tasmanian devil biologist .
Devils are the world 's largest carnivorous marsupial , but they may not be the most endearing of Australian native creatures .
They are greedy and aggressive , fighting over scavenged food and carcasses , and eating just about anything they encounter in the forests .
They have been known to consume an entire horse carcass , eating skin , bones and flesh , and leaving behind only the shoes .
Initial theories that the disease was caused by a virus have been discounted .
Some scientists believe it may have started with rogue cancer cells in a single devil .
Some observers have suggested that the spraying of pesticides by the farming and forestry industries , combined with genetic weaknesses , may have been the catalyst .
Plantation forests in Tasmania are sprayed with chemicals , while the poison 1080 , banned in large parts of the world , is used to kill rabbits , a favourite devil food .
As well as conserving healthy animals in zoos , wildlife experts are trapping and culling diseased devils in an attempt to halt the spread of the disease .
Infected animals are being cleared from the Tasman Peninsula , south of Hobart .
The project costs about $ 200,000 a year .
Scientists are also injecting healthy devils with disabled facial tumour cells to see whether they have an immune response .
The hope is that this research could lead to the development of a vaccine .
But catching devils , whether to test or inoculate them , is a tricky job .
Devils do not take kindly to being trapped .
One of the problems with the captive breeding program is that devils have a very short fertility period , with females having only about three chances to fall pregnant in their lifetime .
Perhaps because of this , females mate with multiple partners in a quest for the fittest , strongest father for their cubs .
Before the cancer appeared , the species was thriving .
The disease is now believed to be within 50 kilmetres of the west coast , where devils have so far been unaffected .
In some areas of the island , the Tasmanian icon is already extinct .
AMERICANS are hard workers , but not necessarily the most productive , according to the Bureau of Labour Statistics .
It has compared America 's output per worker , and output per hour , with that of other rich countries .
The average American worker produced $ 90,000 of output in 2006 , measured at purchasing - power parity .
Only Norwegians , some of whom work on oil - rigs , did better .
Using output per hour , however , shows a different picture .
Employees in Norway , Belgium , the Netherlands and France all churn out more than Americans ' $ 50 an hour .
Proof , perhaps , that workers are motivated best by shorter hours and more holidays .

This is a guest post by automotive columnist Eric Peters .
Big Brother may be about to get just a bit bigger .
General Motors just announced a new and improved version of its OnStar telematics system that could be used to shut your car ’s engine off ( or at least , cut back the power ) remotely .
Touted as a “ safety ” feature ( of course ) , the upgraded version of OnStar would give external authorities ( law enforcement – and , of course , GM ) the ability to send out a signal keyed to the car ’s on board computer , which in turn would ease off the gas – no matter how hard you ’re putting foot down .
GPS - equipped cars already can be located in real time at any time , whether moving or stationary .
The “ enhanced ” version of OnStar would , however , be the first use of satellite technology to physically control the vehicle / supersede the driver .
The system goes live in 2009 , when GM will begin offering it on more than 1.7 million new cars and trucks .
Chevrolet will lead the way – with up to 60 percent of ’09 models fitted with “ enhanced ” OnStar .
So what ’s wrong with the idea ?
Is it cabin - in - the - woods paranoia to be concerned about what , after all , could be a valuable tool for law enforcement ?
The answer depends to a great extent on how much you trust the government .
Certainly , the use of “ enhanced ” OnStar to stop high - speed car chases and retrieve stolen cars is hard to argue with .
But will that be all the technology ’s used for ?
Consider this :
The insurance industry is at this very moment lobbying Congress to impose electronic speed governors on heavy trucks – limiting them to no faster than 68 mph .
Surprisingly , the trucking industry is n’t completely opposed to the idea – provided electronic speed limiters are also fitted to ordinary passenger vehicles , too .
Fair ’s fair , right ?
Now add a dash of “ enhanced ” OnStar to the brew .
Come 2009 , it will be technically feasible to make speeding impossible .
A modern car is controlled by computers ; the computers are now tied into GPS systems such as OnStar – which have the ability to send and receive electronic transmissions , including instructions that tell the computer how to run the car .
“ Smart ” speed limit signs can now be fitted with transmitters ; when a car with “ enhanced ” OnStar comes into range , the transmitter tells the car ’s computer what the maximum allowable speed shall be – and ye shall drive no faster .
Welcome to the future .
“ Technology should not just entertain us or make us more comfortable , ” croons NHTSA Administrator Nicole R. Nason .
“ It should make us safer . ”
Of course .
And what could be safer than making speeding an impossibility ?
If you have n’t heard this argument voiced openly , just wait .
It ’s coming as sure as Lindsay Lohan ’s next DWI .
The safety nags have been patiently waiting for years for technology to catch up to their agenda .
Courtesy of GM , that day has arrived .
Our friends in the insurance and safety lobbies will soon be urging that this “ optional ” technology become a mandatory feature on every new car .
Speeding is illegal – right ?
Who is going to argue in favor of allowing the automakers to continue building and selling cars capable of being driven 30 , 40 , 50 mph faster than the highest lawfully allowable maximum ?
What about the children , after all ?
And if that ’s not alarming enough , consider the likely follow - up .
Once all new cars are fitted with in - car speed nannies , the glassy eye of government will very likely turn its gaze upon older cars – especially older pre-computer cars , which ca n’t be electronically controlled because there is no on - board electronic controller .
The old car hobby is already ( justly ) alarmed by recent changes in antique / classic car licensing and registration laws – which are making it harder and more expensive to keep an older car on the road .
In Virginia , for example , changes to the laws governing antique vehicle registration now empower police to conduct what amount to “ road - side safety checks . ”
If the cop decides your antique vehicle does n’t meet this or that jot or tittle of the law , he can seize your plates on the spot and have your antique vehicle towed to the impound lot – notwithstanding that most cops do n’t have any specific knowledge of what is / is n’t “ right ” about decades - old vehicles .
Now the authorities have a new tool in their kit .
A cudgel by which they cannot only beat speeders into submission – but which could very well be used to take older cars off the road forever .
Consider yourself warned .
And remember to say “ thanks , GM . ”

• Video : Natalie Cox at home
But this spread is just some of what 15 - year - old Natalie Cox consumes alone on a typical day .
Natalie can pack away a staggering 7,500 calories – almost five times the recommended daily intake .
As a result , she already tips the scales at almost 25 stone .

• Boy of eight who weighs 14st may be taken from his family
Doctors have warned her that if she does n't
stop eating vast amounts of junk food , she may not reach her 30th birthday .
Natalie , who has been piling on the pounds since she was a toddler , is addicted to a low - quality diet dominated by crisps , chocolate and pies .
She said : " I weighed about eight stone when I was eight years old .
I started putting on an extra stone every year until I was 11 and learnt
to cook for myself .
" Then it just got worse and worse .
At age 12 I was 14 stone 7lb and at 13
I was 20 stone .
" Now I ’m almost 25 stone and a size 32 .
I 'm only 5ft 6in tall and more than three times the size I should be . "
Her mother Cheryl , a 42 - year - old care assistant , said Natalie had tried everything to lose weight , including endless diets and regular
sessions with a personal trainer .
But she said the teenager 's addiction to food beats her every time .
Her problem is so extreme she once resorted to eating the leftover scraps of a family meal from the dog 's dinner bowl .
Speaking at at the family home in Winchester , Mrs Cox , who spends £ 150 a week on food for Natalie , said : " She just ca n’t stop eating .
She
loves food .
" The first thing she 'll do when she gets in from school is go straight to the cupboard for a load of biscuits then onto the fridge to see what she can get her hands on .
" She 's very secretive about it too .
Food goes missing all the time . "
Mrs Cox said she does not dare to stop buying junk food because she knows Natalie would find other ways of getting her hands on it .
She has conned money from her family by claiming she needed to buy books .
And in the past she has
stolen food to satisfy her appetite .
Her mother , who weighs 16 stone , added : " I 'm at the end of my tether .
Nothing seems to work . "
She and her husband Ken feel the only option left for their daughter is tohave a gastric band fitted .
They have a son , Peter , 13 , who has a normal weight .
Natalie , who struggles for breath and gets chest pains because of her size , has suffered taunts of " Fat Nat " at school .
She was horrified to read recent reports
about eight - year - old Connor McCreaddie and nine - year - old Samantha Hames , who each weigh about 14 stone .
She said : " I just want to tell them to do something about their eating now – otherwise they ’ll end up like me .
" I can't get any nice clothes and I 've got horrible stretchmarks all over me .
" I see girls on the TV like J - Lo and Kelly Brook and think I 'd love to look like that .
It really gets me down . "
The case concerned wedding pictures of the two Hollywood film stars taken in New York for a Spanish publication , Hello !
The trial was held in London for much the same reason as are the Olympics .
The British public sector can be guaranteed to invest the most trivial event with pomp , dignity and stupefying expense .
There is also a good chance of getting away with murder if the money is right .
Even so , why the law lords felt obliged to act as judicial extras in a " spoiler " row between two magazine picture desks is a mystery .
The only plausible explanation is that British judges are suckers for a glamour trial and will sell their services anywhere to get their hands on one .
The actual judgment on Wednesday was barking mad .
The Douglases had sold " exclusive rights " to take pictures of their 2000 wedding for £ 1 m to OK !.
The event was to be an intimate affair confined to 350 of the couple 's closest celebrities and costing a mere £ 1.2 m .
To stress this intimacy it was held not in that paparazzi - infested cauldron of fame , Swansea ( Zeta - Jones 's home town ) , but in a secret hideaway that bore a marked resemblance to Manhattan 's Plaza hotel .
In other words , this was not a private wedding but a showbusiness one , its publicity value so calibrated as to maximise revenue .
Crucial to the deal was a promise by the Douglases to OK !
that no other cameras would be allowed inside the Plaza .
Rivals naturally rose to the challenge .
A photographer for Hello !
magazine gained entry by posing as " a guest or waiter " , callings apparently indistinguishable among celebrities .
He escaped with his scoop and his pictures were published on the same day as those in OK ! , depicting the usual banal images of faces , clothes , champagne , cake and glamour .
It was a classic spoiler , of the sort perpetrated by Fleet Street every day of the week .
Douglas , hero of Basic Instinct and Fatal Attraction , contrived to find the Hello ! pictures " seedy and voyeuristic " .
Zeta -Jones swore on oath that she was " devastated , shocked and appalled " by them .
Despite having stripped to the waist to defend her honour in the Mask of Zorro , she regarded herself as " violated " by a shot of her being fed wedding cake with a spoon by Douglas .
( The master of the rolls should have called a halt at his point : etiquette surely demands a fork . )
A normal person would have told the Douglases to dry their tears and get a life .
They got their money .
OK !
magazine could not have possibly suffered financial loss from Hello !'s leak .
Besides , as one early judge pointed out , the essence of the marriage ceremony is explicitly public , to avert bigamy ( a sensible precaution in Hollywood circles ) .
" If any of ye know cause , or just impediment , why these two persons should not be joined ... ye are to declare it . "
Perhaps the Book of Common Prayer should be redrafted : " Dearly beloved , we are gathered here in the sight of God and only those to whom exclusive rights have heretofore been assigned for the said million pounds . "
The Douglas case was neither thrown out nor sent to some county court , as might have befitted its merits .
It " opened in the West End " at the high court , which found for the Douglases in a satisfying blaze of publicity .
OK ! was awarded £ 1 m in damages from Hello ! .
Two years later , the court of appeal reversed this judgment and now the law lords have , by a majority , reversed the reversal , concluding that Hello ! was indeed liable for breaking a contract between the Douglases and OK !.
An awestruck Lord Hoffman emphasised that " the point of which one should never lose sight was that OK !
had paid £ 1 m for the benefit of the obligation of confidence imposed on all those present at the wedding ...
There was no reason why they were not entitled to enforce it . "
As for the terrible suffering imposed by all this costly delay on the Douglases , the law courts allowed them an ex gratia payment of £ 14,600 for their " distress and inconvenience " .
Why £ 14,600 and not £ 140,600 or £ 1,460,000 was not explained .
I suppose lawyers have never been good at noughts .
But it is rumoured they did plague both houses by splitting the costs between both sides .
Clearly Hoffman is right in remarking that contracts should be enforced .
But enforced by whom on whom ?
The Douglases would have had justice on their side in ejecting the errant photographer once they failed to spot him .
But beyond that , it was surely just another celebrity wedding badly policed .
The Douglases knew it and blew it .
Indeed if there was any suing to be done , OK !
must surely have had a case against the Douglases for failing adequately to protect their contract .
The Douglases could then have sued the Plaza hotel or their party planners for rotten security .
The Plaza hotel could perhaps have sued the photographer or even Hello ! for trespass .
The trouble is that these suits would have been in America and would have been treated with ridicule .
The only country where judges might take the farrago with sufficiently extravagant seriousness is Britain .
While courts are overcrowded , jails are jammed with prisoners waiting on remand and lawyers are professing overwork and underpay , these theatricals are enacted at Westminster .
Why ?
Does the master of the rolls really feel that Britain should become a sort of international court for the relief of distressed celebrities ?
As he pondered the dusty attics and dank basements of the Inns of Court , was he struck by a vision of Chancery Lane as the Silicon Valley of fatuous litigation ?
( In February an equally absurd palaver went to the House of Lords over whether a lay rector should repair a particular church roof . )
As it is the courts have made fools of themselves .
The Douglas case had nothing to do with the right to privacy , notoriously indefinable as it is .
Nobody can stage a wedding , sell the publicity rights for £ 1 m and then claim that they were trying to remain private .
Managed publicity is not privacy .
As for the " obligation of confidence " on newspapers not to scoop rivals who have paid for so - called exclusives , this is censorship born of madness .
Newspapers must guard their exclusives as best they can , not call on law lords to act as their bouncers and heavies .
Either way , this is a blatant case of one law for the rich and one for the poor .
The law lords are still hoping to find a new home across Parliament Square from Westminster commensurate with their newly glamorous status .
They should go the whole hog and move up the road to the Ritz , where they clearly belong .

May 14 , 2007  --
It goes zero to 60 in about four seconds .
Its top speed is 130 miles per hour .
And it does n't use an ounce of gasoline .
It 's the Tesla Roadster , a new car that 's fueled entirely by electricity and could be hitting the lot just in time .
The Tesla Roadster is named after Nicola Tesla , the largely forgotten genius inventor of alternating current electricity , and it's the brainchild of Martin Eberhard , who said he designed it because he cares about the environment and because he wanted one for himself .
" It 's time for us to do something about our dependence on foreign oil , " Eberhard said .
" It 's time for us to do something about global warming .
But I was n't ready to go drive around some goofy little car .
…
Think of how electric cars look .
All the ones you 've ever thought of . "
There have n't been many electric cars .
Early automobiles ran on electricity , as did General Motor 's ill - fated and quickly abandoned EV1 , which debuted in the 1990s and died soon thereafter .
Eberhard said there 's " nothing beautiful " about the Prius , perhaps the best - known hybrid car .
" It does n't do anything for me , " he said .
" Think of it this way .
A world of 100 percent hybrids is still 100 percent addicted to oil . "
' The Next Great American Car Company '
So Eberhard , who made his fortune with a couple of Internet companies , set out to build the car he wanted to drive , one that would change the image of the electric car forever .
Eberhard said he wanted " to get people to think of electric cars as being actually hip and desirable and fun . "
And that 's only the beginning .
Eberhard also wants to achieve something even he admits is audacious .
" Our ultimate goal is to be the next great American car company , " he said , " to have a whole line of cars for every kind of driver and all of them not burning gasoline . "
Eberhard teamed with another Internet millionaire , Elon Musk , the man who invented PayPal .
The 35 - year - old Musk is busy with another venture called Space X , which , among other projects , is contracted to design , build and operate NASA 's replacement shuttle for transporting astronauts to the International Space Station .
Musk said it took only five days for him to decide to invest in Tesla after meeting with Eberhard .
He 's put $ 37 million into the company so far .
" I am a big believer in Tesla , and I believe it 's going to be a great success , " Musk said .
Behind the Wheel
Instead of starting with a mass market vehicle , Tesla 's doing just the opposite : starting at the high end and working its way down .
" I really believe the right entry point in the market is a sports car , " Musk said .
" Because there , people are willing to pay a high unit cost .
So you get that into the market , and you continue to innovate and optimize and go progressively higher volume and more affordable with each successive model . "
In four months they had orders for all of their " signature " cars .
The first 100 , with a $ 100,000 price tag , sold to the likes of George Clooney , the founders of Google , Arnold Schwarzenegger and William of the Black Eyed Peas .
Going forward , they plan to make 1,000 Roadsters a year , with a sticker price of $ 92,000 .
That investment gets customers a two - seater that weighs in at a relatively light 2,600 pounds and is powered by lithium ion batteries , like the ones in your computer … exactly 6,381 of them .
" They are the exact same kind of cell that would power a lap top computer or a camcorder , " explained David Vespremi , Tesla Motors ' director of public relations , while showing us the car .
" This is very different from a combustion engine . "
So different , in fact , that it is n't an engine at all -- it 's a motor .
Fewer Moving Parts
" The motor [ is ] tiny by comparison to an engine in a typical combustion car .
It weighs about 77 pounds , and you could literally put it in a backpack and walk out of the room with it if you chose to , " Vespremi said , while showing us the car .
" What it does is , it has one moving part .
It 's an AC motor , so it takes current straight from the battery and turns that into … the power that moves the car down the road . "
Is there anything that a standard gasoline - powered car offers that the Tesla lacks ?
" Well , you have all the belts and the hoses and the gaskets and the plugs and exhaust components .
None of that exists with this car .
The entire drive line consists of 12 moving parts , " Eberhard said , as opposed to thousands in a regular car .
But there are drawbacks :
The battery pack is warrantied for 100,000 miles , but after that , replacement could be costly -- in the thousands of dollars .
Tesla argues that with battery technology improving every year , each successive year 's models will be better .
You 're not completely off the grid because it does require electricity , and you can go only 200 miles between charges .
Vespremi said the charging station can be installed by " any competent electrician , " and it allows you " to get that quick charging time of 3 ½ hours .
Most people hook it up to the drier circuit .
And then you just treat it like a gas pump . "
The Roadster is still in test mode -- the company hopes to start actual production this fall .
The car has gone for its first round of safety tests and , according to the company , has done extremely well .
Vespremi told us that part of the reason the car is so safe is because the chassis is made of extruded bonded aluminum , " the exact same kind of chassis that would be used in something like a Formula One car or an Indy car .
This is what allows those drivers to wreck at a couple hundred miles per hour and walk away , " he explained .
' I Like Fast '
So far , those who 've put down deposits can't even test drive the Roadster ; they can only be driven in it .
Bob Huntley and his wife , Marilyn Miller , flew to San Carlos , Calif. , from Houston to see what they 're getting .
" I like fast , obviously , " Huntley said , " but more important to me is the smile I will have knowing that I am not putting $ 50 gas in every time I want to go 200 miles .
It 's perfect .
And I get to pass everyone while I do it . "
While they work to get the Roadster street ready , the engineers at Tesla are pushing ahead on two more models .
The designs are under wraps , but they envision a family - size sedan and a smaller mass - market electric car in the next two to five years .
But the real money may come in selling their technology .
" We are in negotiations with some fairly big auto companies , so we hope to make a really big difference in CO2 concentration in three ways , " said Musk .
" One is in the cars we make ourselves , two is the licensing the electric drive trains and accelerating the technology deployment in other car companies , and three is by serving as a good example to the rest of the auto industry and hoping that they follow our lead . "
Capitalism and Altruism
Musk says there is an element of altruism behind the company , but that the best way to serve their goal is to make Tesla a profitable company .
" There 's a lot to be said for money and glory , " said Musk .
" I would n't say that those were unimportant .
There is nothing wrong with wanting to make money or have a glorious outcome .
Those are good things .
For me personally that 's not the most important thing .
But I still value those things .
I 'm not Mother Teresa . "
Though design and testing takes place just south of San Francisco , the Tesla Roadsters will be built at the Lotus Elise plant in Hithel , England .
And who gets the first car off the assembly line ?
" Well , I get car No. 1 , " said Musk .
" I guess there are some advantages to investing $ 37 million in a company . "
Another advantage could be immortality .
If Tesla works , it would be the first successful startup auto manufacturer in the United States in more than 50 years .
War Uncensored --
On the Ground in Iraq and Afghanistan Photographer Peter van Agtmael 's unflinching portraits of Iraq and Afghanistan .
October 3 , 2007  -- I traveled to Iraq for the first time in January 2006 .
The idea had gnawed at me since 2004 , when I realized that the war was going to continue for a very long time .
At that point I was just learning photography and lacked the courage and the cash to go to Iraq on my own .
By the end of 2005 , I was living in South Africa and working regularly on assignment for Time magazine .
I had seen a lot and had learned to trust my instincts .
In the end , what I thought I had learned in Africa did n't matter much .
A lot of the time the patrols were a roll of the dice , even with the most experienced units .
I spent two and a half months of 2006 embedding with infantry units in Baghdad , Mosul and Rawah , Iraq .
On patrol every day , I was able to document a cross section of the war : wary foot patrols , impromptu football games , midnight raids , barbecues , gun battles , video game tournaments , suicide bombings , the wounded and the dead .
I returned home to Washington , D.C. , for a break but was restless and unhappy .
I felt I had only scratched the surface of the conflict , and nothing at home seemed worthwhile or interesting in comparison .
I headed back to Baghdad in June to rejoin the 10th Mountain Division , which was plodding along much as before .
The only change seemed to be on the headquarters ' wall , which had become more cluttered with portraits of the fallen .
When the 10th rotated back to the United States at the end of its tour , I stationed myself at the Combat Support Hospital in the Green Zone , the busiest U.S. military hospital in Iraq .
It was here that the scale of the violence taking place in the capital was made abundantly clear .
While life on patrol was more boring than terrifying , the hospital was inundated with war 's ravages .
The first patient I photographed was a 4 - year old girl who had been shot in the chest .
One of the last was a U.S. soldier hit by an improvised explosive device , or IED , who was carried in yelling " Daddy , Daddy , " then " Put me to sleep . "
His skin was peeling in clumps from his body .
He died shortly afterward .
Disturbed by what I had seen at the hospital , I joined an infantry unit in East Baghdad .
While chatting casually in an undermanned Humvee , I realized I was sitting in the seat of a soldier I had photographed just a week before in the hospital who had been shot .
A few weeks later , I was on my way home again to join my parents on a family vacation I 'd promised to attend .
I returned to the United States wound tight and though I tried to relax , I could not .
A few weeks after I left Iraq a friend of mine , a young medic in the hospital in Baghdad , died of a drug overdose .
A month later , one of the Humvees I 'd ridden in was hit by an IED , killing everyone inside .
The soldiers were just weeks from returning to the United States .
I floated through the following months in a daze .
Reluctant to travel back to Iraq , I instead began photographing soldiers who had returned home from the war and the families of those who never made it back .
I visited the mother , wife and son of my dead friend Jimmy .
I documented the slow recovery of Jeff Reffner , a big , gentle Pennsylvanian whom I photographed after he was wounded in Baghdad .
I went to small - town funerals , and to Section 60 at Arlington cemetery , where the dead from Iraq and Afghanistan are buried .
The young man I saw burn to death is buried there .
Slowly , I began thinking about returning to Iraq .
I went to Afghanistan instead .
I had seen so little coverage from that war and I hoped I could contribute something .
But as I tried to fund my trip , I was met with apathy .
While my agency had helped me to fund my Iraq trips through assignments from American magazines , the only publication that has published the Afghan work is Croatian .
The war in Afghanistan was equally real .
On my first mission with the medevac unit we picked up a bloody stretcher carrying a dead American soldier covered by a blanket .
His buddy , shot in the chest in the same ambush , faded in and out of consciousness on the frantic flight to the nearest hospital .
Now I 'm back in the United States , photographing the recovery of wounded soldiers .
They are men of all backgrounds , reflective on the wrenching changes the war has inflicted on their lives , and determined to move on .
Sometimes , late at night after too many beers , stories are told of dead children in shot - up cars and frantic escapes after wrong turns .
The hospital rooms are beautifully appointed with donated luxuries , but in the beds are legless amputees that sit in the shadows by themselves late at night chain - smoking cigarettes .
Peter van Agtmael , 26 , studied history at Yale University .
He is currently working on a long - term project about the toll of America 's wars at home and abroad .
In 2006 , van Agtmael was named one of " 25 under - 25 Up- and - coming American Photographers " by the Center for Documentary Studies at Duke University .
In 2007 , he won a World Press Photo Award for his images of night raids in Iraq .
Van Agtmael remains friends with many of the soldiers he photographed in Iraq and Afghanistan , and in some cases continues to follow their recovery .
The U.S. Army and all soldiers pictured consented to having these photos taken and made public .

Retailers warn of growing Mafia influence in the south
The Mafia has turned into one of Italy 's biggest business enterprises with a turnover of more than $ 120 bn ( £ 60 bn ) a year , a new report says .
The report , prepared by Italy 's leading retailer 's association , warns of growing Mafia influence in the south .
It estimates that 7 % of Italy 's output is filtered off by organised crime .
Hush money
The retailer 's association says it is seriously concerned by the spread of Mafia extortion rackets from small to big businesses .
Some of Italy 's best known and largest construction companies are denounced by name in the report for allegedly turning a blind eye to organised crime .
Organised crime is present in all areas of the economy , from food manufacture to tourism , from real estate to finance and in the service industries , the report says .
Big business also finds it easier to negotiate agreements with the Mafia rather than to denounce extortion rackets to the police , it adds .
The study alleges that 20 % of Italian shops pay regular hush money to criminals to carry on business undisturbed .
The proportion is much higher in southern Italy .
In Sicily , eight out of 10 shops pay a regular monthly sum to the Mafia , the report says .
Deputy Minister of the Interior Marco Minniti said the growth of Mafia business crime was alarming .
DOOCY : You ’re looking live at pictures from San Diego — Santiago , CA , where the wildfires continue .
We were talking earlier in today ’s telecast with Adam Housley and apparently police officers in a hovering helicopter saw a guy starting one of these fires .
And Allison Allison Camerota , an FBI memo from late in June of this year is popping up this morning and it is ominous .
CAMEROTA : This actually has happened for many years in the past as well .
An FBI sent out to local law - enforcement said that an al Qaeda detainee had given them some information that the next wave of terrorism could be in the form of setting wild fires .
Adam Housley said lots of people on his block were asking him about it .
Obviously this is something the FBI has looked into .
They will continue to investigate it .
Oh , a Detainee said so ?
Well , geez , we know we can certainly take that one to the bank .
I mean , Curveball was just so SPOT .
ON .
with the mobile labs was n't he ?
CARLSON : If they have this person in custody it probably wo n’t take long to be able to develop a link if there is one .
KILMEADE : A June 25 memo from the FBI ’s Denver offices reported three days ago , excuse me , five days ago , by the Arizona Republic , that is a newspaper , they have been carrying the story and they continue to expand upon it .
DOOCY : Brian , the plot they say , according to this detainee , and they do n’t know if the detainee is telling the truth .
The plot was to set three or four wildfires .
But they do n’t mention California .
They mention Colorado , Montana , Utah , and Wyoming .
We do know for a fact that a number of the fires in southern California are of a suspicious nature and they are investigating arson .
It 's fair to argue that there has been some evidence of arson in the California Wildires .
This has been a situation that has gone back for generations , year in and year out - since as a matter of fact - most of Southern Calfornia is a mild desert !
But to state that their might be active al - Qeada cells and sympathizers in HelL - A is going a bit far .
Not that CNN 'S Glen Beck has n't already been circling that block with his claim that it's ...
" unfortunate that a handful of people who hate America ... are losing their homes in a forest fire today " .
Is it " unfortunate " that they lost their homes or " unfortunate " that the supposedly " Hate America " by becoming successful in the entertainment industry ?
Which one is it Glen ?
Of course now he 's claiming that this was just a joke and is now playing the well worn right - wing victim card .
Y'see it's all those lefty liberal bloggers who are really the mean people .
BECK : Let me get to your phone calls here in a second .
I want to have a -- I want to have a frank and open conversation with you here for a second .
Apparently , I have upset a few liberal bloggers .
Woe is me .
And I need to be extraordinarily clear on one thing .
Not with you .
And I 'll explain in a second .
These people -- they 're amazing .
They 're incredible .
They claim that I 'm serious when I 'm joking and try to cause trouble , and then they say I 'm joking when I 'm serious and try to cause trouble .
There 's no way -- if you disagree with any of these people -- there 's no way that you can ever win .
And here 's the interesting thing :
Even if you agree with these people , there 's no way you can ever win .
If you 've listened to me for years , you know wildfires are deeply personal to me .
Wildfires make blood shoot out of my eyes .
But for the bloggers , it does n't matter what I really think .
It does n't -- they 're not trying to convince you I 'm a bad guy .
You know .
You know who I am .
What they 're trying to do is convince people who do n't watch the TV show , who do n't listen to the show .
They 're trying to convince them that I 'm an evil supervillain .
Because those people can be convinced .
So let me just -- let me tell you , so you know , so you can tell those who want to make me into an evil supervillain .
Who do you have to be to think that it 's a good thing that anybody 's house burns down ?
Who do you have to be ?
Who do you have to be Glenn ?
Maybe you have to be a guy
That thinks it 's FUNNY that people 's homes have burned down when you disagree with ( some of ) them politically ??
How could we ever think anyone on the right - wing would stoop so low as to make fun of people who 've lost every possession in the worst firestorm in history , after they 've been so kind in their responses to people like Graeme Frost , Bethany Wilkerson , The 82nd AirBorne , Capt Jon Soltz , Micheal J. Fox , John Edwards , Cindy Sheehan and the 9 - 11 Widows ?
After they 've attacked sick kids , why exactly would anyone think twice about Beck and his ilk attacking the victims of a massive fire ?
But not to worry , it was just a joke - minus the funny part .
And who knew that the right - wing hated the rich people who live in expensive houses on the hill so much ?
Maybe they can get them some fresh juicy new tax cuts to help buy a new house somewhere else as long as it is n't already flooded with the other kinds of people - y'know the middle - class and the poor ?
And while they 're at it how about a few man-made Islands or something for the looming construction boom of new Luxury Condos far away from anyone who can't afford them ?
That outta be Posh , like totally Paris and Nicole .
One big problem with Glenn 's entire view is that so much of these fires have affected Orange County and San Diego , both of whom are giant Red Swaths in an otherwise Blue State .
Orange County was so gracious that they 've bought us both Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan not to mention B - 1 Bob Dornan , Dana Rorbacher ( sic ) and from San Diego we 've have had Duke Cunningham , Jerry Lewis and Darrell Issa .
If you subscribe to the Fixed News view of things on the other hand , the ones who " Hate America " are apparently the enormous enclave of Islamo Fascists who 've decided their best weapon against the Imperialism of the West is to Flick a Bic .
In that case , trying to burn down John Wayne 's house almost makes sense .
And all this time while Fox and Beck are keeping us distracted with their pathological nuttiness - the real issues raised by these fires goes ignored while the White House Censors the head of CDC on the issue of the human impacts of Climate Change .
Today , Dr. Julie Gerberding , director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , testified before the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee on the " Human Impacts of Global Warming . "
Gerberding told the committee that global warming " is anticipated to have a broad range of impacts on the health of Americans , " but gave few specifics , instead focusing on CDC ’s current preparation plans .
CDC officials are now revealing that the White House heavily edited Gerberding ’s testimony , which originally was longer and had more " information on health risks " :
" It was eviscerated , " said a CDC official , familiar with both versions , who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the review process .
The official said that while it is customary for testimony to be changed in a White House review , these changes were particularly " heavy - handed , " with the document cut from its original 14 pages to four .
It was six pages as presented to the Senate committee .
The White House ’s deletions included " details on how many people might be adversely affected because of increased warming and the scientific basis for some of the CDC ’s analysis on what kinds of diseases might be spread in a warmer climate and rising sea levels . "
I 'm thinking right now that one particular risk happens to be trying to breath in a smoke cloud so large you can See it from Space !
So while Fox is chasing phantom al Qeada in the hills of Malibu ( just as they 've been chasing phantom AQI through the streets of Najaf and Fallujah for four years now ) the impacts of gradual and steady planetary warming , which can clearly contribute to the types of dry conditions that help facilitate the tragedy that hit Southern California , remain ignored and forgotten by an Administration that has a long history of denying fact and science .

The attack on Turkish troops was one of the deadliest for some time
The PKK guerrilla group claimed it had also taken " several " soldiers hostage , but this was denied by the government .
Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan has called a crisis meeting in Ankara , which is likely to consider whether to attack PKK bases in Iraq .
But the defence minister said such action would not take place " urgently " .
" There are plans to cross border " but " not urgently " , Vecdi Gonul said after meeting US Defence Secretary Robert Gates in Ukraine .
On Wednesday , MPs voted overwhelmingly in support of a motion to allow the military to launch offensives across the border , against rebels based in the remote , mountainous north of Iraq .
It followed an escalation of raids by the PKK - the Kurdistan Workers ' Party - as part of its armed campaign for Kurdish autonomy .
Recent attacks blamed on the group have left more than 40 Turkish soldiers and civilians dead .
Iraq has urged Turkey not to strike across the border .
Iraqi President Jalal Talabani , himself a Kurd , called on the PKK rebels to lay down their arms .
" But if they insist on continuing to fight , they should leave Iraqi Kurdistan and not create problems here , " he said .
Iraq 's parliament passed a motion condemning Turkey 's threat of force , but also called for the PKK to leave Iraq .
Passengers wounded
In the latest attack shortly after midnight , a large group of PKK rebels crossed the border from Iraq and staged their assault near the village of Daglica in Hakkari province , the Turkish military said .
The army said it sent reinforcements and helicopters to the area , fired artillery and launched retaliatory attacks in which 32 guerrillas were killed .
Turkish demonstrators demanded action against the PKK
Enlarge Image
PKK sources confirmed the fighting , and claimed more troops were killed than the official figure of 12 .
" There were clashes with the Turkish troops late last night in which we have killed at least 16 soldiers and wounded 20 .
We also captured several , " Reuters quoted an unnamed rebel source as saying .
Turkey 's defence minister denied that , saying : " There are no hostages . "
Not far from the scene of the fighting , a minibus was later caught in a landmine explosion , also blamed on the PKK , that injured 10 civilians , the state news agency Anatolia said .
Thousands of Turks joined protests in several cities denouncing the attacks and calling for action against the PKK .
The prime minister said : " We are very angry . "
But he said he was " resolved to deal with these matters in a cool - headed manner " .
Increased pressure
About 3,000 PKK fighters are believed to be based in northern Iraq near the Turkish border , says the BBC's Sarah Rainsford in Istanbul .
THE PKK Formed in late 1970s Launched armed struggle in 1984 Dropped independence demands in 1990s Wants greater autonomy for Turkey 's Kurds Leader Abdullah Ocalan arrested in 1999 Ended five - year ceasefire in 2004
Profile : The PKK
There have been regular clashes in the area since earlier in the year , but the latest attack was one of the deadliest for some time .
The clashes will increase pressure on the government from the public and the military for a tough response , our correspondent says .
The United States , Turkey 's Nato ally , has called for restraint , fearing that any incursions would destabilise Iraq 's most peaceful area - the autonomous Kurdish region in the north .
The White House decried the PKK 's actions , saying : " These attacks are unacceptable and must stop now . "
More than 30,000 people have been killed since the PKK began fighting for greater autonomy for the largely - Kurdish south - eastern Turkey since 1984 .

Vitter secures $ 100 K for Louisiana anti-evolution group Nick Juliano
Published : Monday September 24 , 2007
Print This Email This Religous conservatives receiving funds have political ties to embattled senator
In a move ostensibly aimed at providing " better science education " in Louisiana schools , Sen . David Vitter has secured $ 100,000 in taxpayer dollars to fund an anti-evolution effort spearheaded by a religious group politically connected to the alleged prostitute - soliciting Republican .
Vitter secured an earmark in an upcoming labor , health and education financing bill for the Louisiana Family Forum , which The New Orleans Times Picayune reports has " taken the lead in promoting ' origins science , ' which includes the possibility of divine intervention in the creation of the universe . "
The group was founded by Tony Perkins , a former Louisiana state lawmaker who now leads the conservative Family Research Council .
The Louisiana Family Forum works to " present biblical principals " on public policy issues , and until a reporter questioned them about it , the group 's Web site included a " battle plan to combat evolution , " which argued the theory " has no place in the classroom . "
Despite Vitter 's admission earlier this year that he used a Washington , DC , call - girl service and allegations that he frequented prostitutes in New Orleans , the first - term Republican has maintained the support of religious conservatives in his home state .
In a YouTube clip posted by user " lafamilyforum , " the group 's executive director Gene Mills defended Vitter from comparisons to Idaho Sen .
Larry Craig , who was arrested in a restroom sex sting in June .
" The media 's going to do whatever it can to smear any of the family values guys , and unfortunately Vitter has been elevated into that role , not because of what he has done on the family values front , which is commendable , " but because of the prostitution allegations , Mills said .
He went on to praise the fact that " Vitter has repented of the allegations .
He sought forgiveness , reconciliation and counseling . "
The political ties between Vitter and the group go beyond some much - needed recent PR help and stretch to the senator 's first campaign in 2004 , although the Family Forum 's tax exempt status prohibits it from engaging in political activity , the Times Picayune reports .
" Dan Richey , the group 's grass - roots coordinator , was paid $ 17,250 as a consultant in Vitter 's 2004 Senate race , " according to the newspaper .
" Records also show that Vitter 's campaign employed Beryl Amedée , the education resource council chairwoman for the Louisiana Family Forum . "
Vitter 's office downplayed the relationship between the senator and the group , saying it's not surprising their employees would overlap because of a shared philosophy .
" This program helps supplement and support educators and school systems that would like to offer all of the explanations in the study of controversial science topics such as global warming and the life sciences , " Vitter said in a written statement .
Critics torpedoed the idea that Vitter 's earmark was anything but an attempt to federally subsidize religious instruction .
" This is a misappropriation of public funds , " Charles Kincade , a civil rights lawyer in Monroe , La. , who has been involved in church - state cases told the Times Picayune .
" It 's a backdoor attempt to push a religious agenda in the public school system . "
Not long ago , while speaking about the Iraq Occupation , a relative told me , in all sincerity , that the U.S. could no longer afford to be isolationist .
I shrugged .
Because that 's what I do now when talking politics with any family that 's not my wife .
I shrug .
And then steer the conversation to sports
The U.S. has virtually never been isolationist in any real sense of the word .
We are a dangerous , aggressive nation that has slaughtered millions and millions in the name of democracy , freedom , liberty , or whichever catch - phrase worked best at the time .
But mainly , we are an empire .
And we will kill any that stand in the way of our imperial goals .
And there is no error when I write " we . "
Because
We the People have allowed this to happen .
We lost control of our government .
We allowed the United States to define itself as a nation of international murders and terrorists .
We have stood to the side and even applauded as our nation has attacked country after country .
And while there are plenty that protest America 's overt acts of aggression , there obviously just are n't enough .
And there is n't enough passion in it .
Because the voices for peace are easily drowned out by a government and media that believes we are a nation entitled to kill anyone , anywhere , for whatever reason , and whether those reasons are truthful or not .
Think of it - the Democratic Party allowed itself to be insulted as the party that was " weak on defense . "
So now , Democratic candidates talk of how they would bring war to others , and the weapons they would use .
The " weak on defense " bait has been so easily swallowed , even though the United States is anything but defensive .
We are an offensive juggernaut .
And it appears obvious that soon that offense will be unleashed on Iran .
And many more innocents will die .
And many more will grow to hate America .
And the cycle will continue .
Because Americans will continue to allow it .
And because our leaders - for whom the word " diplomacy " is spoken with disdain and anger - know of no other way .
And if you look clearly , you will see that the government truly believes it is doing the will of the people .
We the People allowed the Neoconservative takeover of our nation .
And they are no fluke .
They are the natural progression of things .
After eons and eons of American military involvement everywhere from Panama to Palestine , we have become a people at ease with our nation 's murderous plans .
The endless bursting of bombs in our name have drowned out peace , and We the People have no idea what a world without American aggression sounds like .
Murder has become white noise .
Even speaking of using nuclear weapons is no longer taboo .
Imagine that .
Discussion of a preemptive nuclear strike on a sovereign nation is now considered serious foreign diplomacy .
And those in charge see this all as validation and are able to strut about with murderous hubris .
Their hunger for a militarized free - market empire is endless .
We are gluttons for war and the Middle East is a virtual buffet of targets .
It 's gotten increasingly difficult to imagine those currently in charge resisting the opening to launch a first - strike attack on Iran .
Followed by a draft .
Followed by more war .
Followed by a war economy .
Followed by more war .
Serial killers do n't slow down until they are forced to stop , after all .
And with military bases dotting the globe , a public and world unwilling to stop them , things will continue on their obvious path .
The U.S. has the largest military in the history of the planet and will continue to use it and refuse to allow the world to know peace .
And We are all culpable .
The U.S. is an aggressive , warring nation .
And unless something dramatic happens , and We the People force those in charge to give up the belief that the U.S. has a divine right to rain death on any nation they so please , things are going to get much worse .

GOP voters respond positively to idea of universal health care David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Monday August 6 , 2007
Print This Email This When Fox News asked on Monday " Who came out ahead ? " at the GOP debate in Des Moines , Republican pollster and consultant Frank Luntz answered that the participant who " surprised voters the most " was second - tier candidate Mike Huckabee .
Luntz monitored the responses of 29 Republican voters on a moment - by - moment basis throughout the debate and found that " Mike Huckabee in his communication , in the language that he used , took voters who for the most part had never even heard of him and turned them into Huckabee supporters . "
Luntz highlighted in particular how his electronic graphs " climb when Mike Huckabee talks about the changes that are needed to American health care . "
" If you want to know how to fix it , I 've got a solution , " Huckabee said at the debate .
" Either give every American the same kind of healthcare that Congress has or make Congress have the same kind of health care that every American has . "
As he spoke , the electronic graphs rose dramatically for both moderate and conservative Republicans , from a neutral reading of 50 into the 80's .
" Health care is an issue that transcends politics and transcends ideology , " commented Luntz .
" Democrats are more willing to support universal care .
Republicans are still focused on the free market system .
But when Huckabee talked about giving health care , the same benefits , to the average American that Congress has , that really scores . "
Last May , Huckabee criticized Michael Moore 's Sicko and even took a cheap shot at Moore 's weight , saying , " Frankly , Michael Moore is an example of why the health care system costs so much in this country .
He clearly is one of the reasons that we have a very expensive system . "
However , a week ago , Huckabee wrote to Moore , suggesting they meet to find " common ground " and saying , " The two of us may have something in common : a passion for reforming the health care system in America ...
While I respect your efforts to call attention the health care crisis in this country in your movie ' Sicko , ' I feel that your view that all would be improved with free universal and government provided health care is simplistic . "
The system enjoyed by Congress under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program , which Huckabee invoked at the debate , involves the government negotiating contracts with private health plans and covering up to 75 % of the premiums for those enrolled .
Luntz concluded the segment by showing the members of his focus group describing Huckabee as " honest " and " refreshing " and said that he has a real chance to break out of the second tier .

MYSORE , India — Thousands of Indians report to Infosys Technologies ’ campus here to learn the finer points of programming .
Lately , though , packs of foreigners have been roaming the manicured lawns , too .
Many of them are recent American college graduates , and some have even turned down job offers from coveted employers like Google .
Instead , they accepted a novel assignment from Infosys , the Indian technology giant : fly here for six months of training , then return home to work in the company ’s American back offices .
India is outsourcing outsourcing .
One of the constants of the global economy has been companies moving their tasks — and jobs — to India .
But rising wages and a stronger currency here , demands for workers who speak languages other than English , and competition from countries looking to emulate India ’s success as a back office — including China , Morocco and Mexico — are challenging that model .
Many executives here acknowledge that outsourcing , having rained most heavily on India , will increasingly sprinkle tasks around the globe .
Or , as Ashok Vemuri , an Infosys senior vice president , put it , the future of outsourcing is “ to take the work from any part of the world and do it in any part of the world . ”
Mirofinance helps give poor people access to credit
The website , called MicroPlace , acts as a broker between ordinary investors and microfinance organisations .
For as little as $ 100 , US investors will be able to help entrepreneurs in poor countries , be they coffee sellers in Cambodia or hairdressers in Ghana .
The investments last between two and four years and offer a small return .
" We really wanted to make it accessible for small everyday investors , " said Tracey Pettengill Turner , the founder and general manager of MicroPlace .
" You can earn a return on your investment and help the world 's working poor , " she said .
Business not charity
Microfinance is the supply of small , usually unsecured loans to poor households and small businesses in developing countries .
The rates of interest are usually quite high but allow access to credit in places where people cannot readily obtain bank loans .
Its role in helping people out of poverty was highlighted when microfinance pioneer Muhammad Yunus won the Nobel peace prize in 2006 .
Ms Turner said MicroPlace vets the loan providers that appear on the site and said issuers have good track records and few defaults .
She said that microfinance honoured the hard - working nature of many poor people and borrowers preferred loans to donations .
" It puts them on an equal footing with business people not charity cases , " she said .
The investments available offer investors a return of 1.5 % to 3.0 % a year
Ebay said it would reinvest any profits back in its own social initiatives .
For the time being , Ms Turner said only US residents will be able to make investments on the site via eBay 's paypal service or through a regular bank account .
Resume
This is the fourth post in a series of posts on programming web
applications with PLT Scheme .
In part one and two the model and view of a small Reddit - like application were discussed .
Part three were about the basic operation of the PLT Scheme web - server .
Here in part four we will finish the discussion of the controller .
Finally I 'll explain how to get this code from PLaneT , so you can run it on your own machine .
Do n't forget to leave a comment , if you have questions or suggestions .
The Controller
The controller handles user interactions .
The concrete actions in our application are :
Viewing the front - page
Up - and down - voting a link
Viewing the page for submitting new links
Submitting a new link
For each action , we 'll have a function that invokes the appropriate function in the model , receives data back , and then let the view generate a web - page based on the data .
The function handling the viewing of the front - page is simply :
( define ( do - front - page )
( html - front - page 0 1 ( page 0 ) ) )
The function page is from the model and html - front - page in the view ( see earlier posts ) .
Implementing the controller
An user interaction is sent to the web - server in the form of a request .
Given a request , the web - server determines which servlet is to handle the request , and then calls the servlet 's start function .
Here we have a choice .
Even though the controller conceptually is one entity , a common way to implement controllers is to have separate servlets for each action .
In this tutorial however I 'll implement the controller as a single servlet , and let it dispatch on the action .
The url for the servlet will be :
http://localhost/servlets/control.scm
The action will be given as a parameter .
One way to send the parameter is to include it as part of the link :
http://localhost/servlets/control.scm?action=submitnew
Another is to let action be a hidden field in a form .
The Start Function
After the receipt of a request the web - server starts the control - servlet by calling the start function with the request in
question .
The web - framework provides us with a special form servlet , that allows us to to define the start function simply as :
( require ( planet " web.scm " ( " soegaard " " web.plt " 2 0 ) )
( define start
( servlet
( dispatch - on - action ) ) )
Here the servlet form evaluates to a function that
receives a request
stores the information in the request in various parameters
evaluates its bodies , the result of the last body must be an x-expr
construct a response based upon the x-expr and the contents of the various response parameters
During development it is mighty convenient to see any errors directly
in the browser .
Therefore , let 's introduce the form , with - errors - to - browser :
( define start
( servlet
( with - errors - to - browser
send / finish
dispatch - on - action ) )
Dispatching on actions
Any parameters sent as part of the request , are saved as bindings in current - bindings by the servlet - form in start .
The dispatch code is therefore very simple :
( define ( dispatch - on - action )
( with - binding ( current - bindings ) ( action )
( match action
[ " updown " ( do - updown ) ]
[ " submitnew " ( do - submit- new ) ]
[ " submit " ( do - submit ) ]
[ else ( do - front - page ) ] ) ) )
If the action is missing , the front page is shown .
Submital of new links
The action " submitnew " simply shows a page with a form , where a new url and title can be entered :
( define ( do - submit - new )
( html - submit - new - page ) )
Hitting " submit " will POST the data to our servlet , and the action will be " submit " .
The controller must send the data to the model in order to add the new link .
The user should return to the frontpage .
One way to achieve this is as follows :
( define ( do - submit )
( with - binding ( current - bindings ) ( url title )
( when ( and url title )
( insert - entry title url 10 ) ) )
( do - front - page ) )
Can you spot a problem ?
The problem and its solution
What happens if the user hits the refresh button in their browser ?
The same data will be posted again .
This is often referred to as the " Double Submit problem " .
The solution is to redirect the browser to the frontpage .
If the user now hits refresh , then they 'll just get the frontpage again .
( define ( do - submit )
( with - binding ( current - bindings ) ( url title )
( when ( and url title )
( insert - entry title url 10 ) ) )
( current - redirect - temporarily " http://localhost/servlets/control.scm " )
( html - redirect - page " Redirecting to frontpage " ) )
The redirection is put in place , by setting the parameter current - redirect - temporarily .
When the servlet form constructs the reponse it checks whether any redirection parameters are set , if not it produces a normal " 200 OK " response ; however , if set , it produces a redirection response ; e.g. , in the case of current - redirect - temporarily , a " 302 Found " .
Note :
You can also use current - redirect - see - other to get a " 303 See Other " response .
Note : See
Redirect after Post by Michael Jouravlev for a thorough discussion of the POST - Redirect - GET technique .
Up - and Down- voting
The up - and down - arrows could be simple links , but if they were we would run into a similar problem with refresh .
We therefore turn each link into a form , and handle its submital with the POST - Redirect - GET technique as before .
The only complication is that big submital buttons are n't pretty ; images of arrows are much prettier .
This is solved with a little JavaScript ( see the post on the view ) .
( define ( do - updown )
( with - binding ( current - bindings ) ( entry_id arrowitem )
( match arrowitem
[ " down " ( when entry_id
( decrease - score entry_id ) ) ]
[ " up " ( when entry_id
( increase - score entry_id ) ) ]
[ else
' do - nothing ] ) )
( current - redirect - temporarily ( format " http://localhost:~a/servlets/control.scm " port ) )
( html - redirect - page " Redirecting to frontpage " ) )
Downloading the code
To download the code and try it , open DrScheme and enter the following in the interaction window :
( require ( planet " install.scm " ( " soegaard " " listit.plt " 1 0 ) ) )
Then call install to copy the web - site to a
folder of your choice :
> ( install " c:/tmp/ my- listit " )
Copying the web -site to c:/tmp/ my-listit .
Please wait ...
The web - site has now been copied to c:/tmp/ my-listit .
To test it , open " launch.scm " in DrScheme and run it .
Have fun !

Both bills would raise tobacco taxes .
The federal excise tax on cigarettes would rise to $ 1 a pack under the Senate bill and to 84 cents a pack under the House measure , from 39 cents a pack .
The House bill would sharply reduce federal subsidies paid to insurance companies offering private health plans to Medicare beneficiaries .
Many Democrats say these plans , which serve nearly one - fifth of the 43 million Medicare beneficiaries , are overpaid .
The Senate bill does not deal with Medicare .
Michael O. Leavitt , the secretary of health and human services , said Congress was jeopardizing health care for millions of needy children by passing bills that “ the president will have no choice but to veto . ”
Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa , a Republican who helped write the Senate bill , said he intended to try to persuade Mr. Bush to sign the legislation that emerges from Congress .
But Mr. Grassley said that he would fight the proposed cuts in Medicare payments to private plans .
“ It ’s a question of equity for rural America , ” Mr. Grassley said .
“ Before 2003 , rural Medicare beneficiaries rarely had private Medicare plans to choose from .
They did not have the same choices people have in urban America .
These plans can be a good choice for people with a chronic illness , for lower - income people and for those who want extra benefits . ”
Insurers say the private plans would disappear from many parts of the country if Medicare payments were cut as proposed by House Democrats .
But AARP , the lobby for older Americans , has endorsed the House bill .
It says the “ excess payments ” to private plans cause higher premiums for all beneficiaries , including those in traditional Medicare .
For months we at Antiwar.com have been monitoring the situation between Iran and the United States , parsing the words of administration spokesmen for any hints of when and how hostilities between the two countries might begin .
We ’ve been running reports from insiders saying that the Cheney faction is pushing for an attack , that Bush is quite amenable but is biding his time , and that an assault on Tehran is imminent .
Now the president has come out openly with his warlike intentions .
In a speech delivered Tuesday , he reiterated recent charges by Washington that Iran is arming and training Iraqi Shi’ite groups who are launching attacks on American forces in Iraq , and he announced : " I have authorized our military commanders in Iraq to confront Tehran ’s murderous activities . "
Translation :
The bombing begins shortly .
A recent blog item on LewRockwell.com does much to confirm this well - grounded suspicion .
In a letter to Rockwell , a former Hillsdale College student describes the celebratory attitude toward war held by Hillsdale lecturer Victor Davis Hanson and his fellow neocons ( Bill Kristol , Midge Decter , Harvey Mansfield ) , adding this chilling anecdote :
" At one point during his class Hanson related a story where he was in the Oval Office discussing the matter of Iran [ with the president ] .
Hanson closed his story by saying that Bush vowed to do something about Iran before his term expired . "
The invasion and occupation of Iraq has become the intellectual and political touchstone for a whole generation of American politicians and pundits , who either did or did not predict the disastrous outcome and either did or did not sign on to a " patriotic "  and idiotic  cause that was popular at the time .
A good number of our laptop bombardiers have since recanted , including Andrew Sullivan , who played the role of drum majorette in the march to war ; Francis Fukuyama , who provided the Wagnerian musical score ; and William F. Buckley Jr. , who allowed his magazine to be used by the neocons as an instrument of lying war propaganda  and libelous smears directed at conservative opponents of the Iraq folly .
Buckley shocked his fellows when he admitted " one ca n’t doubt that the American objective in Iraq has failed " and urged on the administration and his fellow conservatives " the acknowledgment of defeat . "
Ah , but not VDH and his fellow fantasists , including Buckley ’s epigones over at National Review , who are stubbornly hewing to the neoconservative line .
Immune to evidence , however vivid , that their premises and ideological theories are not only wrong but actively harmful to American interests in the Middle East and worldwide , these people  the neocon " dead - enders , " to borrow one of Donald Rumsfeld ’s favorite phrases  are quite simply crackpots .
They are like proponents of the Flat Earth theory , or advocates of phrenology : in the face of all evidence to the contrary  mountains of it  they hold that the " real truth " ( about the earth ’s flatness , the " scientific " validity of phrenology , all the " progress " we ’re making in Iraq ) is being " suppressed . "
This dogged denial is the virtual definition of crackpottery , and it brings to mind a recent post by Matt Yglesias at The Atlantic wherein he complains that the crackpots ( neocon variety ) are being mainstreamed by ostensibly " liberal " Washington think - tanks :
" The crux of the matter is that we have here in Washington , D.C. , a certain number of institutions working in the national security sphere that are essentially crackpot operations 
AEI , The Weekly Standard , the Project for a New American Century , and the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies come to mind .
Now one can argue ’ till the cows come home whether or not it should have been clear in August 2002 that these were crackpot operations , but over the past five years they ’ve demonstrated themselves to indubitably be crackpot institutions . "
Yglesias ’ beef is with Brookings , whose resident scholar , Michael O’Hanlon  currently playing the " left " wing of the administration ’s push to legitimize and make permanent the " surge "  is getting up there on the stage with the AEI - PNAC - Weekly Standard peddlers of discredited nostrums .
To those of us immersed in the arcana of neoconology , however , the establishment of a neocon- occupied beachhead on the liberal " left " comes as no surprise , since , after all , the left is where neoconservatism first cohered into a distinct political tendency .
What ’s truly scary , however , is that this cult of snake - oil salesmen , of which Hanson is a prime example , have easy access to the White House , where they are the confidantes of a president who believes he has been chosen by God to carry out a vast and sacred mission of global regime change .
Yes , it ’s distressing that the neocons seem to have infiltrated the core institutions of liberal Washington , but the real danger is that these discredited crackpots are still in command of the White House .
Cheney is wounded but hardly paralyzed , and the cranks who surround him , and who predicted a " cakewalk " in Iraq , are now bawling that we ca n’t back down from confronting Tehran in view of Iran ’s " provocations " in Iraq and Afghanistan .
That none of the allegations against Iran are proven , or even all that credible to begin with , is neither here nor there : our crackpot theorists will take any factoid and readily fit it into the jigsaw puzzle of unsourced accusations , vague " intelligence , " and other manufactured " evidence " of Iranian perfidy .
The other day I wrote about a piece that appeared on the Web site of the pro-war Family Security Matters , a front group for the neoconservative Center for Security Policy , in which the author called for Bush to make like Caesar , brush aside the Constitution , and proclaim himself president - for - life , while nuking Iraq ( and presumably Iran ) .
This crazed polemic caused a stir of outraged disbelief throughout the blogosphere , and many were and are convinced it was a hoax , a satire , the result of an LSD flashback , or perhaps all of the above .
Whatever the truth may be , what one realizes upon reading of the president ’s future war plans is that he has already made like caesar , thrown Congress aside , and crossed the Rubicon that flows between republic and empire .
It is hardly necessary for Bush to formally dissolve Congress , since that body long ago abdicated its constitutional authority and responsibilities .
When it comes to the conduct of American foreign policy , George W. Bush already has absolute power , and it is becoming all too apparent that he intends to wield it against Iran .
The Democrats ’ failure to defund the Iraq occupation has led , inexorably , to the likelihood of a border " incident " with Iran that will  tragically , and almost inevitably  result in a conflict that will draw in every country in the Middle East , roiling the Muslim world .
The compromises , the craven capitulations , the excuse - making for Democrats whose hearts were and are supposedly in the right place but who succumbed , in the end , to the lure of pork over principle , have brought us to this  to the prospect of yet another war , albeit a much bigger and potentially more destructive one .
NOTES IN THE MARGIN
I wanted to wait until most of the returns came in before I thanked everyone who contributed to our summer fundraising campaign .
While we ’re still getting donations trickling in , I can safely ( and proudly ) announce that we raised $ 76,000  exceeding our fundraising goal by some six grand .
To all who gave , a heartfelt thanks  you came through once again .
My trepidation , as the time to launch the summer drive approached , was , it appears , entirely unwarranted , and I ’m very grateful for that : in this case , I loved being proved wrong .
We are working every day to justify your confidence in and support for the work we are doing .
I know you agree it ’s important work , and do n’t imagine that we ’re going to be resting on our laurels .
We ’re constantly striving to improve our coverage of world affairs , and you ’ll be seeing some changes soon .
One example : we ’re instituting comments in the blog , and we ’re thinking about having them for all columns and articles as well .
What do you think ?
Also , I ’m blogging regularly over at Taki ’s Top Drawer , where I ’m allowed to write about stuff that has nothing to do with war and peace , or even , necessarily , politics .
Here I comment on Sen. Larry Craig ’s tearoom theatrics , and here ‘s a note about the Lobby ’s effort to quash all discussion of the new book by John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt .
A brickbat to Hugo Chavez and a bouquet to George Szamuely : it ’s all happening over at Taki ’s Top Drawer .
On Tuesday's " Countdown " retired Major General Paul Eaton gave his view on the Viet Nam comparisons made by President Bush in his speech today .
Needless to say , he was not impressed and slammed Bush , comparing his failures in Iraq to those made during the Viet Nam conflict and his misunderstanding of the basic facts .
Maj .
General Eaton has long been a critic of the president and the Republican party for the devastating damage they 've done to our military .

Stewart : " ... As a veteran , what did you think when you heard the president was going to go down this road , giving this speech to this audience .
Are n't there other issues out there he might have addressed ? "
Eaton : " My father 's name is engraved on the Viet Nam War Memorial .
Killed in action after - missing in action for 38 years .
I thought it was a bad idea to start going down this uh - this slink to Viet Nam during this speech .
It was - it did not serve the country well , it does not serve the American fighting man and woman in Iraq well , and it certainly does n't serve the veterans well . "
In the closing days of the second world war , a truck left Göttingen carrying a mysterious machine marked with the code word V4 .
The V1 , V2 and V3 were secret weapons with which Hitler had hoped to turn the tide of war , so it was not surprising that the truck was given high priority .
After an adventurous journey , the machine ended up hidden in a cellar near the Austrian border .
We shall leave it there while we step back and reflect on the question raised by my title .
Clearly the modern electronic computer had to wait until modern electronics - but could not some steam powered or clockwork version have been built earlier ?
Bust of Leibniz by Johann Gottfried Schmidt
One of the many dreams of the Renaissance was the dream of the machine .
Renaissance books show pictures of machines to lift water , to play music , to fly and to destroy enemies , Few , if any , of the devices had any chance of working but the desire to remove the barrier between the living and non-living had entered humanity 's bloodstream .
It is no accident that some of the earliest mechanical calculators were designed by the philosophers Pascal and Leibniz .
Pascal 's machine could add and Leibniz 's machine could multiply .
Objects of metal had acquired skills which had seemed the province of the soul .
In his philosophical work , Leibniz was prepared to consider the prospect of thinking machines .
... supposing there were a machine , so constructed as to think , feel and have perception , it might be conceived as increased in size , while keeping the same proportion , so that one might go into it as in a mill .
That being so , we should , on examining its interior , find only parts which work upon one another , and never anything to explain a perception .
Leibniz was also concerned with a related idea , that of the algorithm .
An algorithm is a set of instructions for carrying out a calculation without the calculators making any decisions for themselves .
Such a calculation requires no " free will " and " reduces the calculator to a machine " .
Leibniz considered the possibility of algorithms which would apply to logical argument as well as mathematics .
Priceless , or nearly so .

Although Pascal tried to commercialise his machine , it was not until the middle of the 19th century that adding machines were made and sold successfully .
Earlier machines were simply too delicate for constant use .
It is instructive to compare the case of the adding machine with that marvel of 18th century technology , the precision clock .
Three differences stand out .
Even a moderate time - keeper is so useful that it commands a ready market .
An adding machine is only attractive if it as accurate and cheap as a clerk .
It was clear that a clock accurate enough to allow the solution to the problem of finding longitude at sea would be , if not priceless , nearly so .
A perfect adding machine would just be a machine for adding .
Part of the solution to making a good clock is to make the mechanism " do as little work as possible " and to protect it from the outside world .
An adding machine must take its data from the outside world and return its results to the outside world .
It cannot lead the pampered and lazy life of a clock .
Where an obvious need existed , technological difficulties could be overcome .
In the early 1800's , the French weaver Joseph Jacquard invented a loom in which a series of punched cards controlled the patterns of cloth and carpet produced .
Within a few years , tens of thousands of Jacquard and Jacquard inspired looms were in operation .
Before Jacquard , machines were built to do one thing .
Clocks told the time , windmills ground corn , cranes lifted things and so on .
Now there was a machine which could be instructed to do many things simply by changing a pattern of holes on a card .
In 1820 , Babbage became interested in the construction of a special purpose machine to automate part of the process of table making .
This project was sufficiently important to attract substantial government backing , but no machine was built .
We know that the designs were feasible since a few machines based on Babbage 's ideas were actually built and operated during the 19th century .
A plausible argument can be made that the British Government 's investment was more than repaid by the Babbage project 's role as a nursery for British precision engineering .
One of the reasons for the failure to build a machine was its replacement in Babbage 's mind by the grander project of a universal machine able to carry out any mathematical calculation .
We know that Babbage 's final plans were logically sound and that he did indeed design the mechanical equivalent of today 's electronic computer .
Could his universal " Analytical Engine " have been built and operated ?
Opinions differ .
Many fortunes were lost before typesetting could be reliably mechanised .
Even if a " demonstration model " of a Babbage machine could have been constructed ( most people agree that it could ) the nature of the technology meant that scaling up to bigger machines would have involved new difficulties .
In my view , one of the chief obstacles to the realisation of the Analytical Engine was the failure to imagine tasks grand enough for the grand machine .
I am not aware of any proposal to use the machine for purposes where human labour could not do the job reasonably well .
One task where humans seemed inadequate was processing the results of the US census .
It took seven years to tabulate the results of the 1880 census and something new was obviously needed for the 1890 census .
The something new was provided by Hollerith who used a system based on punched cards .
Once the data had been entered onto the cards , sorting and counting was done mechanically .
This time , processing took only two years and produced a superior product .
Over the next fifty years , the use of such " punched card " machines grew steadily as did their capabilities and the uses to which they were put .
The years from 1870 to 1960 also saw the invention and use of a number of " analogue computing machines " .
Roughly speaking , these machines modeled a physical system by mechanical or electrical means .
One of earliest was the very successful Kelvin tide predictor in which a complex arrangement of wheels and pulleys drew a graph showing the sea level to be expected at a given port at a given time .
One of the last and apparently most spectacular was an immense agglomeration of glass tubes , plumbing and coloured water which was intended to model the British economy .
Many of these analogue machines were both ingenious and useful but from our point of view they were merely special purpose devices .
We are more interested in a byproduct of the foundational crisis which struck mathematics during the first part of the 20th century .
This was the analysis of the notion of computation by Turing and others .
Turing showed that it was possible to build " universal computing machines " which could do anything that any other " computing machine " could do .
Instead of having to build a new device for each problem , we can build a single machine to do anything .
Moreover , Turing 's analysis showed that the " natural design " , seen , for example , in Babbage 's Analytical Engine , gave a universal machine .
As is well known , Turing spent the second world war breaking German military codes .
Turing and his co-workers built a succession of machines to help them in this task .
The first , the famous bombes , were special purpose devices .
The last , Colossus , was still built for a single purpose but it was clear that those who designed and used it knew how to design and build an electronic universal computer .
What of the V4 in its Austrian cellar ?
It was not a weapon of war but another computing machine , the Z4 , the fourth design of Konrad Zuse .
Of it too , one could say that the man who built it knew how to design and build an electronic ( strictly speaking , electro - mechanical ) universal computer .
The Z4 was installed at Zurich in 1950 with some modifications and matched the performance of computers elsewhere .
To this list could be added at least three groups in the United States , of which the group headed by Eckert and Mauchly was ultimately the most influential in shaping future developments .
Within two or three years , several true electronic universal machines had been built .
( Using one definition , the first one actually to operate was the Cambridge EDSAC , but the guiding ideas behind the Cambridge machine came from elsewhere . )
Why was the universal machine built when it was built ?
The first answer might be that it was called into being by military needs .
This is not a satisfactory explanation .
Some of the groups mentioned above were indeed aided by the state of war but others ( particularly Zuse ) were hindered .
A more satisfactory explanation would start from two observations .
The advance of engineering meant that many useful components were available " off the shelf " .
Changes in the way that mathematics was applied to physics and engineering meant that there were many important problems which required computations of a size beyond human capabilities .
( Zuse 's machine was intended to study flutter in aeroplane wings . )
Could a universal machine have been built earlier ?
What follows are personal and not very valuable opinions .
We are used to very powerful machines but our answer must depend in part on the minimum computational power which might make a universal machine worth building .
My view is that a machine that could reliably carry out a program involving a few thousand calculations ( additions , multiplications and so on ) and take only a few hours to do so would have found many uses from 1900 onwards .
Even the earliest universal electronic computers could do a hundred times better than this , but we are asking for the minimum satisfactory performance .
I suspect that someone combining the insight of a Turing or a Babbage with a similar genius for tinkering could have produced such a computer on the basis of Hollerith punched card machines .
Less controversially , telephone relays were available , reasonably cheap and reliable in the 1920s and these were to form the basis of Zuse 's computers .
Looked at this way , the answer to the question posed in my title is that the computer was not " invented " , but " emerged " when the technology was available to build it and sufficient problems existed to occupy it .
It could have emerged earlier , but the further we go back in time , the more difficult it would have been to make it work reliably and to find appropriate problems which required its use .

Rank - and - file Democrats in Congress are criticizing the party ’s leaders for allowing the White House to sap momentum from the antiwar movement during the August recess .
“ The White House is taking great advantage of the Democrats not pushing back , ” said Rep. Lynn Woolsey , California Democrat and co-founder of the antiwar Out of Iraq Caucus .
“ We need bolder steps from the Democrats , ” she said .
“ The people of this country are waiting for some leadership — some bold leadership — from the people that they elected to be the majority of the House and the Senate . ”
An antiwar Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee said the party lost momentum in the war debate and later this month will likely again fail to force a U.S. troop pullout from Iraq .
The member did not want to be identified discussing leadership shortcomings .
Top Democrats , including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada , have responded by raising the pitch of the war debate since returning to Washington this week .
Their criticism that Baghdad failed at national reconciliation and that recent U.S. military successes are exaggerated set the stage for the next pullout bid after Congress receives a progress report Monday from Army Gen. David H. Petraeus , U.S. commander in Iraq .
Rep. Jim McGovern , Massachusetts Democrat and Out of Iraq Caucus member , credited Mrs. Pelosi with doing a good job in the war debate , but he conceded that Mr. Bush has “ had the bully pulpit to himself over the break . ”
The president used a surprise Labor Day visit to Iraq ’s Anbar province to showcase success in that one - time al Qaeda stronghold where Sunni tribal leaders recently helped U.S. troops to drive out the terrorists .
“ We ’re kicking ass , ” Mr. Bush said of U.S. troops in Iraq as he arrived Tuesday in Australia for the Asia - Pacific summit , grabbing headlines when the off - the - cuff remark to Australian Deputy Prime Minister Mark Vaile was reported by the Sydney Morning Herald .
Democrats planned to seize upon other war studies presented this week that , in part , highlight failures of the fledgling Iraqi government , including a report on Iraqi security forces yesterday by an independent commission headed by retired Marine Gen.
James L. Jones , former U.S. commander in Europe .
The report , however , did not support calls for a speedy troop withdrawal , which Democrats say would extract U.S. forces from a civil war and force the Iraqi government to take charge .
Commission member John Hamre , president of the Washington - based Center for Strategic and International Studies , told a House panel that continued U.S. military presence in Iraq safeguards the United States ‘ many strategic interests in the Middle East .
“ Every one of those interests would be seriously diminished if we have to crawl out or run out of Iraq , ” he told the Armed Services Committee .
The report concluded that Iraqi security forces would not be ready to police their country alone for at least 18 months .
It recommended giving Iraqis a lead role but with substantial support and training by U.S. forces .
Gen .
Jones told the committee that he opposed a pullout deadline , which he said could “ work against us , ” and advocated carefully planned force reductions that do not jeopardize recent security gains .
House Minority Whip Roy Blunt urged members to take a “ broad , objective look ” at the reports , noting that the Jones report showed “ that real progress is being made in raising a reliable Iraqi army . ”
“ As Congress continues to take in these reports and evaluate the merit of their recommendations , we owe it to our men and women fighting abroad to take a broad , objective look at the conditions in the field , the progress they continue to make , and the ways we can come together as an institution to help — not hinder — their continued success , ” said Mr. Blunt , Missouri Republican .
Democrats have attempted to discredit Gen. Petraeus ahead of his delivering the administration ’s war assessment .
Mrs. Woolsey said Gen. Petraeus ’ report would be “ packaged spin ” from the White House , echoing early criticism of the report from Democratic leaders .
Mr. McGovern also took a pre-emptive swipe at the progress reports .
“ What the president has to say does n’t carry much water here , ” Mr. McGovern said .
“ I do n’t trust the president on this war any more .
I know those are strong words .
I just do n’t [ trust him ] . ”
Democratic leaders repeatedly refer to the report as the “ Bush report ” and voiced skepticism that it would be an honest assessment .
The congressionally mandated report from the administration , which will be delivered in two parts by Gen. Petraeus and U.S. Ambassador to Iraq Ryan C. Crocker , is expected to show some U.S. military advances but limited progress from Baghdad toward ending sectarian fighting .

Despite the prevailing belief that adult brain cells do n't grow , a researcher at MIT 's Picower Institute for Learning and Memory reports in the Dec. 27 issue of Public Library of Science ( PLoS ) Biology that structural remodeling of neurons does in fact occur in mature brains .
This finding means that it may one day be possible to grow new cells to replace ones damaged by disease or spinal cord injury , such as the one that paralyzed the late actor Christopher Reeve .
" Knowing that neurons are able to grow in the adult brain gives us a chance to enhance the process and explore under what conditions - genetic , sensory or other - we can make that happen , " said study co-author Elly Nedivi , the Fred and Carole Middleton Assistant Professor of Neurobiology .
While scientists have focused mostly on trying to regenerate the long axons damaged in spinal cord injuries , the new finding suggests targeting a different part of the cell : the dendrite .
A dendrite , from the Greek word for tree , is a branched projection of a nerve cell that conducts electrical stimulation to the cell body .
" We do see relatively large - scale growth " in the dendrites , Nedivi said .
" Maybe we would get some level of improvement ( in spinal cord patients ) by embracing dendritic growth . "
The growth is affected by use , meaning the more the neurons are used , the more likely they are to grow , she said .
The study 's co-authors - Nedivi ; Peter T. So , an MIT professor of mechanical and biological engineering ; Wei -Chung Allen Lee , an MIT brain and cognitive sciences graduate student ; and Hayden Huang , a mechanical engineering research affiliate - used a method called two - photon imaging to track specific neurons over several weeks in the surface layers of the visual cortex in living mice .
While many studies have focused on the pyramidal neurons that promote firing , this work looked at all types of neurons , including interneurons , which inhibit the activity of cortical neurons .
With the help of technology similar to magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , but at a much finer , cellular resolution , the researchers were able to stitch together two - dimensional slices to create the first 3 - D reconstruction of entire neurons in the adult cortex .
Dendritic branch tips were measured over weeks to evaluate physical changes .
What the researchers saw amazed them .
In 3 - D time - lapse images , the brain cells look like plants sprouting together .
Some push out tentative tendrils that grow around or retract from contact with neighboring cells .
Dendrite tips that look like the thinnest twigs grow longer .
Of several dozen branch tips , sometimes only a handful changed ; in all , 14 percent showed structural modifications .
Sometimes no change for weeks was followed by a growth spurt .
There were incremental changes , some as small as seven microns , the largest a dramatic 90 microns .
" The scale of change is much smaller than what goes on during the critical period of development , but the fact that it goes on at all is earth - shattering , " Nedivi said .
She believes the results will force a change in the way researchers think about how the adult brain is hard - wired .
Nedivi had previously identified 360 genes regulated by activity in the adult brain that she termed candidate plasticity genes or CPGs .
Her group found that a surprisingly large number of CPGs encode proteins in charge of structural change .
Why are so many of these genes " turned on " in the adult well after the early developmental period of dramatic structural change ?
The neuroscience community has long thought that whatever limited plasticity existed in the adult brain did not involve any structural remodeling , mostly because no such remodeling was ever detected in excitatory cells .
Yet evidence points to the fact that adult brains can be functionally plastic .
In response to the CPG data , Nedivi and Lee revisited this question with the help of So and Huang .
By applying an innovative new imaging technology that allows monitoring of neuronal structural dynamics in the living brain , they found evidence for adult neuronal restructuring in the less - known , less - accessible inhibitory interneurons .
" Maybe the inhibitory network is where the capacity is for large - scale changes , " Nedivi said .
" What 's more , this growth is tied to use , so even as adults , the more we use our minds , the more robust they can be . "

As owners of the Apple iPhone recently learned , it rarely pays to be the first to buy into a hot new technology .
" Sure , there 's some intangible value to being the first kid on the block to have that new toy , " says Denny Arar , senior editor with PC World magazine .
" But -- and I can't think of a single product where this is n't true -- the first generation is bound to be buggy .

The Department of Education operates a range of aid programs for elementary and secondary schools .
The aid and related regulations have generally failed to lift academic achievement .
The department also subsidizes higher education through student loans and grants .
Unfortunately , that aid has fueled inflation in college tuition and is subject to widespread abuse .
The department will spend $ 108 billion in 2019 , or $ 850 for every U.S. household .
It employs 4,000 workers and operates more than 110 different subsidy programs .
Steve Job ’s keynote at WWDC this year inspired some and was disappointing to others — but , as usual , it was interesting & entertaining .
I ’ve always liked Apple ’s products , and spend an embarrassing amount of my own money on them .
So I ’m interested in what he ’s got to say .
Every so often though , as inspired as he is , he says something that betrays at best a blurry view of the real world , at worst an explicit intent to bring more of the world under directed control from Cupertino , and that happened Monday .
The big news , of course , is that Apple ’s releasing Safari on Windows — and although it ’s been a rough first few days for them ( and will get rougher ) , more choices are generally good for users , and so I ’m hopeful that they can work to produce a product of quality on Windows eventually .
I ’m quite fond of Firefox , of course , and am very happy that people everywhere in the world continue to adopt our browser in increasing numbers .
Here ’s a screen capture from the keynote of what Steve thinks the world looks like today ( discussion starts at about 1:06 into the preso ) :
We could quibble with the numbers , but close enough .
It does n’t give much credit to the large & growing number of other quality browsers that are on the scene today , and certainly does n’t give any sophisticated understanding of the situation outside the United States , where things vary more .
Close enough , though .
But here ’s the graph that betrays the way that Steve , and by extension Apple , so often looks at the world :
He said this : “ Well we dream big .
We would love for Safari ’s marketshare to grow substantially .
That ’s what we ’d love . ”
Aw , shucks .
Fantastic !
Dream big !
Imagine a world of …wait for it …access to the web controlled by 2 companies — and why not just go with the 2 dominant operating system vendors in the world .
But make no mistake : this was n’t a careless presentation , or an accidental omission of all the other browsers out there , or even a crummy marketing trick .
Lots of words describe Steve & his Stevenotes , but “ careless ” and “ accidental ” do not .
This is , essentially , the way they ’re thinking about the problem , and shows the users they want to pick up .
There are a couple of problems , of course .
The first is that this is n’t really how the world is .
The second is that , irrespective of Firefox , this is n’t how the world should be .
First , it is n’t really how the world is .
The meteoric rise of Wikipedia , Creative Commons , Linux and Firefox , among many other examples , shows that today ’s connected world is no longer constrained by the monopolies and duopolies and cartels of yesterday ’s distribution — of the publishers , studios , and OS vendors .
Hundreds of millions of users , in every language around the world are now making new choices .
That Apple does n’t feel this , even within the familiar reality - distortion - field confines of Moscone Center , illustrates much of the problem .
Second , it is n’t how the world should be .
Even if we could somehow put that movement back in the bottle — that a world of just Starbucks & Peets , just Wal - mart & Target , just Ford & GM — that a world of tight control from a few companies is good , it ’s the wrong thing to do .
It destroys participation , it destroys engagement , it destroys self - determination .
And , ultimately , it wrecks the quality of the end - user experience , too .
Remember ( or heard about ) when you had to get your phone from AT&T ?
Good times .
So here ’s my point , to be clear : another browser being available to more people is good .
I ’m glad that Safari will be another option for users .
( Watch for the Linux port Real Soon Now . )
We ’ve never ever at Mozilla said that we care about Firefox market share at the expense of our more important goal : to keep the web open and a public resource .
The web belongs to people , not companies .
This world view that Steve gave a glimpse into betrays their thinking : it ’s out - of - date , corporate - controlled , duopoly - oriented , not - the - web thinking .
And it ’s not good for the web .
Which is sort of moot , I think , because I do n’t think this 2 party world will really come to be .
Steve asserted Monday that Safari on Windows will overturn history , attract 100 M new users , and revert the world to a 2 browser state .
That remains to be seen , of course .
But do n’t bet on it .

United States Senate Democratic Majority Leader from Nevada Harry Reid has asked that the senate vote on the Levin / Reed Amendment at 11:00 a.m. ( eastern time ) , which would begin a pullout of some U.S. troops from Iraq in 120 days , if the amendment is passed .
Currently , the U.S. senate is pulling an all - night debate on the Iraq war to decide whether troops should be pulled out of the country .
Despite the all - night session , some senators say that the debate is nothing more than a publicity stunt .
" Our enemies are n't threatened by talk - a- thons , and our troops deserve better than publicity stunts , " said Mitch McConnell , a Republican Senator from Kentucky .
" We have no alternative except to keep them in session to explain their obstruction , " added Reid .
Democrats are calling for a " simple majority vote " of at least 51 in order for the amendment to go forward , while Republicans want at least 60 votes .

The Oscar - winning film “ An Inconvenient Truth ” touted itself as the world ’s first carbon - neutral documentary .
The producers said that every ounce of carbon emitted during production -- from jet travel , electricity for filming and gasoline for cars and trucks -- was counterbalanced by reducing emissions somewhere else in the world .
It only made sense that a film about the perils of global warming would n’t contribute to the problem .
Co-producer Lesley Chilcott used an online calculator to estimate that shooting the film used 41.4 tons of carbon dioxide and paid a middleman , a company called Native Energy , $ 12 a ton , or $ 496.80 , to broker a deal to cut greenhouse gases elsewhere .
The film ’s distributors later made a similar payment to neutralize carbon dioxide from the marketing of the movie .
It was a ridiculously good deal with one problem :
So far , it has not led to any additional emissions reductions .
Advertisement
Beneath the feel - good simplicity of buying your way to carbon neutrality is a growing concern that the idea is more hype than solution .
According to Native Energy , money from “ An Inconvenient Truth , ” along with payments from others trying to neutralize their emissions , went to the developers of a methane collector on a Pennsylvanian farm and three wind turbines in an Alaskan village .
As it turned out , both projects had already been designed and financed , and the contributions from Native Energy covered only a minor fraction of their costs .
“ If you really believe you ’re carbon neutral , you ’re kidding yourself , ” said Gregg Marland , a fossil - fuel pollution expert at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee who has been watching the evolution of the new carbon markets .
“ You ca n’t get out of it that easily . ”
The race to save the planet from global warming has spawned a budding industry of middlemen selling environmental salvation at bargain prices .

The companies take millions of dollars collected from their customers and funnel them into carbon - cutting projects , such as tree farms in Ecuador , windmills in Minnesota and no-till fields in Iowa .
In return , customers get to claim the reductions , known as voluntary carbon offsets , as their own .
For less than $ 100 a year , even a Hummer can be pollution - free -- at least on paper .
Driven by guilt , public relations or genuine concern over global warming , tens of thousands of people have purchased offsets to zero out their carbon impact on the planet .
“ It made me feel better about driving my car , ” said Nicky Tenpas , a 29 - year - old occupational therapist from Hermosa Beach , who bought offsets to neutralize emissions from the Jeep she always wanted .

The star of “ An Inconvenient Truth , ” former Vice President Al Gore , says he and his family are carbon neutral , as are Dave Matthews Band concerts and Coldplay albums .
The travel websites Expedia and Travelocity now offer passengers the option of counteracting their flights , and Rupert Murdoch promises that his entire News Corp. will be carbon neutral by 2010 , largely through the purchase of offsets .
Offset companies stress that they are not a cure - all for the world ’s greenhouse gas emissions , which are equivalent to 54 billion tons of carbon dioxide each year .
Tom Boucher , chief executive of Native Energy , said people should first reduce their energy consumption and waste , and then buy offsets -- “ the only way to really get to zero unless you stop driving , stop traveling . ”
But the industry is clouded by an approach to carbon accounting that makes it easy to claim reductions that did n’t occur .
Many projects that have received money from offset companies would have reduced emissions by the same amount anyway .

The growing popularity of offsets has now prompted the Federal Trade Commission to begin looking into the $ 55 - million - a - year industry .
“ Everybody would like to find happy - face , win - win solutions that do n’t cost anything , ” said Robert Stavins , an environmental economist at Harvard University .
“ Unfortunately , they do n’t exist . ”
Selling clean air
In the rolling hills of southwestern Pennsylvania , outside the town of Berlin , Dave Van Gilder ’s family has been raising cows for four decades .
He and his twin sons , Jason and Justin , tend to their 400 Holsteins while his wife , Connie , keeps the books .

The smell of manure has long been the sweet exhaust of a dairy farm running full tilt .
Millions of pounds of cow excrement over the decades were funneled from the barns to a 3.3 - million - gallon lagoon , where it decayed , burping invisible clouds of the potent greenhouse gas methane .
In the days of Van Gilder ’s father , nobody cared about the greenhouse gases .
But things began to change a few years ago .
Van Gilder did n’t know it , but his lagoon had become an economic opportunity .
Advertisement
A local congressman urged him to apply for a state alternative energy grant to build a system that would capture methane from cow manure and burn it to generate electricity .
The whole project , known as a methane digester , would cost about $ 750,000 -- $ 631,000 of it coming from the state and the U.S. Department of Agriculture .
Van Gilder had to make up the difference , but he figured he could earn that back -- and in several years start making money -- by supplying electricity for the farm and selling the excess to the local utility .
A year before construction began , Van Gilder was contacted by Native Energy , which wanted to buy his emissions reduction , along with the reductions of others who had won state energy grants .
Advertisement
Van Gilder had never heard of the company or the idea of selling clean air .
Nothing came of his discussions with the company until construction started on the massive tank for heating manure .
He gladly signed a contract to sell Native Energy 29,000 tons in carbon dioxide reductions -- the company ’s estimate of how much greenhouse gas the digester will keep out of the atmosphere over the next 20 years .
“ There was n’t a lot of negotiation , ” said Van Gilder , who was happy to accept whatever the company was offering .
Family members said the contract prohibited them from disclosing the payment , but based on a contract with another dairy farmer , signed with Native Energy , it was about $ 70,000 , or $ 2.40 a ton .

Justin Van Gilder said the money had nothing to do with the family ’s decision to build its methane plant .
“ It was a free bonus , ” he said .
“ We still do n’t understand it all , ” Connie Van Gilder said .
“ It ’s hard for us to fathom , to see what it is doing . ”
The situation was similar for the Alaska Village Electric Cooperative , a power utility for dozens of remote communities .
In early 2006 , account manager Brent Petrie was at an Anchorage environmental conference talking about a windmill project that the cooperative was building in the Yup ’ik Eskimo village of Kasigluk , a soggy patch of tundra on the remote Yukon - Kuskokwim Delta in western Alaska .
Advertisement
Rising 100 feet over the landscape , the three 100 - kilowatt turbines were intended to reduce the area ’s dependence on diesel generators , whose fuel must be shipped in on barges .
Federal grants were covering $ 2.8 million of the project ’s $ 3.1 - million cost .
Petrie had barely finished his presentation when he was cornered by representatives from two brokers -- Native Energy and the Bonneville Environmental Foundation -- eager to buy the project ’s offsets .
The cooperative sold 25 years of carbon dioxide reductions to Native Energy for $ 36,000 -- roughly $ 4 a ton .
Native Energy had contributed just over 1 % of the total cost of the project yet claimed 100 % of its carbon reductions .
Advertisement
“ If you look at the costs of these projects , it ’s a tiny , tiny fraction , ” said cooperative president Meera Kohler .
The payment did “ not determine whether those blades turn or not . ”
At best , Kohler said , the money could cover some maintenance costs .
An untapped market
Despite its relatively small role in the project , Native Energy counts the windmills as a success , demonstrating the power of carbon offsets to encourage clean energy .
Advertisement
“ Every kilowatt - hour they produce means one fewer kilowatt - hour is generated by the diesel generators that otherwise provide power for this village , ” the company ’s website says .
Wind power has long been a fascination for Boucher , Native Energy ’s co-founder .
As an electrical engineering major in the 1970s at the University of Vermont , he built a 25 - foot - high wind turbine in his parents ’ backyard , carving the blades from a piece of redwood .
He later worked at a Vermont utility and helped develop one of the first wind farms in the northeast .
Boucher started his own company in the 1990s to sell alternative energy but soon came upon a simpler and possibly more lucrative product : voluntary carbon offsets .
It was a new twist on an old idea .
Advertisement
About 30 years ago , the U.S. government began fostering emissions markets that allowed industrial polluters to buy offsets for such gases as nitrogen oxides and sulfur oxides .
One of their successes has been in reducing acid rain in the Northeast .
The Europeans have recently adopted a similar model to regulate carbon dioxide emissions , allowing the continent ’s dirtiest industries to buy and sell rights to spew greenhouse gases .
The key to these regulated markets is a gradually falling cap on total emissions , forcing factories to either reduce their own emissions or buy someone else ’s reductions at increasing prices .
Boucher and other environmental entrepreneurs , however , believed there was an untapped market for carbon reductions : people and companies who would buy them voluntarily .
Advertisement
“ What was coming was a way for folks to take actions against global warming , ” said Boucher , a bearded 52 - year - old , who has long believed that alternative energy can be competitive with cheaper power from fossil fuels .
Native Energy , based in Charlotte , Vt. , was one of the first offset companies in the United States and has become one of the most respected in environmental circles .
It has sold offsets to thousands of individuals and companies , including Levi Strauss & Co. and Ben & Jerry ’s .
It has been big with political campaigns , providing offsets to Democratic presidential candidates Hillary Rodham Clinton and John Edwards .
The producers of the 2005 film “ Syriana , ” which claims to be the first carbon - neutral major motion picture , bought 2,040 tons of carbon dioxide reductions from the company .
After Native Energy ’s name was mentioned in the final credits for “ An Inconvenient Truth , ” visits to the company ’s website jumped 1,100 % , marketing director Billy Connelly said .
Advertisement
As a private company , it does n’t report its revenue , but Connelly said he expects it will double its sales this year , reaching a total of about 1 million tons of carbon dioxide neutralized since its founding .
“ Things have really taken off in the last year or two , ” said Boucher .
The company has about 20 employees .
Native Energy now finds itself facing competition from nearly three dozen other offset firms worldwide .
Some are nonprofit , but most of the biggest are in business to make money .
In 2006 , offset companies sold greenhouse gas reductions equivalent to at least 14.8 million tons of carbon dioxide , more than double the previous year , said Katherine Hamilton , carbon project manager for Ecosystem Marketplace , which tracks the industry .
Advertisement
Sales are expected to double again this year .
Requirements are vague
For all the money spent , nobody can say if the offsets have done much to alleviate global warming .
The problem is whether the voluntary reductions really exist .
The buzzword in the industry is “ additionality ” -- the idea that offset purchases actually lead to additional greenhouse gas reductions .
Advertisement
The concept should be simple : Pay for a project , monitor its actual reductions , then claim your share .
Instead , offset companies often have vague requirements to determine if their potential investments would actually lead to additional reductions .
Native Energy says it looks for projects that need offset revenue to survive -- a difficult standard , since the projects are expensive and the offset payments are relatively small .
But even if a project can stand on its own , it can still qualify for the money if it is novel or simply “ not business as usual , ” according to the company ’s website .
That definition has allowed Native Energy and other offset companies to claim the carbon reductions from projects in which they have played minor roles .
Still , Native Energy ’s contract requires projects to certify that whatever offset money they receive “ is a necessary component of the project ’s economic viability . ”
Advertisement
The company has struggled with whether its funding matters .
Boucher said the windmills in Alaska were debated for weeks inside Native Energy since the project already had been funded by the government .
“ This is a case of one of the more difficult determinations , ” he said .
Native Energy , he said , eventually concluded that its contribution , if used as a reserve fund for emergency repairs , was meaningful .
It helps “ to make sure these turbines will run as well as they can , and to further the chances that other wind farms will be built , ” he said .
In the case of the methane digester , Boucher said the reductions were additional since the offset payments helped cover a significant portion of Van Gilder ’s out - of - pocket expenses .
The best way to ensure additionality , according to Native Energy , is to pay a project for a decade or more of offsets while the developers are still arranging the financing .
Advertisement
The downside is that the carbon reductions might not occur for a decade or more .
One of Native Energy ’s expected future projects is a windmill development being planned for a South Dakota Sioux reservation .
Part of the offset money from “ An Inconvenient Truth ” has been earmarked for the $ 45 - million project , known as the Owl Feather War Bonnet Wind Farm .
Native Energy and the developers are still negotiating , but the payment for the next 25 years of carbon reductions could be a few million dollars .
Even in this ideal case , the developer is hesitant to say that the money he will get from Native Energy is essential .

“ Could we do it without it ? ” said Dale Osborn , head of Distributed Generation Systems Inc. in Lakewood , Colo .
“ Maybe .
But that would require charging more for the energy or the investors accepting a lower rate of return . ”
Several environmental and clean energy groups have also raised concerns about verifying projects , monitoring their actual carbon reductions and ensuring that each carbon offset is not sold more than once .
“ People are trying to do the right thing , ” said Peter Knight , a partner with Al Gore in Generation Investment Management , which invests in environmentally responsible companies .
“ It ’s a new field . . . and it ’s going through some growing pains . ”
Price of feeling good
Advertisement
Without government regulation and mandatory caps on emissions , all that is left to drive offset sales is guilt and marketing .
Offset companies charge what the market will bear .
“ How much are you willing to spend to feel good or to impress your neighbors ? ” asked Marland , of Oak Ridge National Laboratory .
For Katy Hansen , a 29 - year - old law school student , the answer was $ 429.99 .
She wanted to offset the travel of the guests to her May wedding in Madison , Wis. , and paid San Francisco - based offset company TerraPass Inc. to neutralize 40 tons of carbon dioxide .
Advertisement
“ The wedding felt out of character in a way , ” she said .
“ It was more overdone than anything in our lives . ”
It was a well - intended gesture , but one that some scientists say does carry a price .
Offsets are so convenient that they may foster a false sense that global warming can be easily solved when the hard and expensive work remains undone .
A United Nations panel recently concluded that actually reducing emissions to avoid the worst perils of global warming would cost trillions of dollars a year over the next several decades .
“ These offsets are not addressing the problem that must be addressed now , ” said James Hansen , NASA ’s top climate researcher .
“ If we just fool around with marginal things , we will be up a creek without a paddle in the rather near future . ”
Advertisement
Despite the imperfections of the offset market , some customers say , it still helps people think about their own responsibility for global warming .
“ It ’s a powerful first step , ” said Davis Guggenheim , director of “ An Inconvenient Truth . ”
“ The choice of doing this rather than nothing is not a choice . ”
He acknowledged the skepticism about voluntary offsets , but he added , “ All of us knew when you ’re doing offsets that the theoretical and symbolic quality to doing this is as important as the practical quality . ”
Ethan Prochnik , a 43 - year - old freelance television producer in Los Angeles , said the enormous threat of global warming means that everyone has to help in reducing emissions .
Advertisement
He foresees a time when a carbon tax will be factored into the price of every tomato , every pair of jeans , every computer .
Until then , offset payments are a sort of self - imposed pollution tax .
For months , Prochnik and his fiancee saved to offset a year of their lives .
He finally went to the website for an Oregon company called the Climate Trust .
He entered their state of residence , the size of their Montecito Heights house , their cars , their annual mileage and the number of flights they took in a year .
“ It ’s like a poor man ’s Prius , ” he said , explaining that he could n’t afford to trade his Isuzu Rodeo SUV for a hybrid .
Advertisement
“ It does make you feel a little better , ” said his fiancee , Amber Vovola , 29 .
Prochnik entered his credit card number and pressed the “ enter ” key .
The total came to 21.22 metric tons of carbon dioxide , or $ 200.28 .
Figuring that the website calculator did n’t cover all their pollution , he decided to buy an additional $ 300 in offsets , just to be safe .

A friend of mine has a relative who is a missionary in Eastern Europe .
He recently shared photographs and the story of a man he is caring for , who has an extremely bizarre skin condition .
The man has keratin - like matter growing out of the skin on hands and feet , which started when he was young , and very slowly continues to spread and grow .
The areas begin as skin lesions , and the matter sprouts from those spots .
The growths are very difficult to remove , and the man has so far just had to learn to live with it .
There are a few medical precedents to this man 's case , but nothing is certain until more tests are done .
In the meantime , the missionary is helping to make life easier for the man .
UPDATE : Here is the latest on this situation .
The missionary writes ...
" I found this man , and other than his hands and feet , he looked and seemed in good health .
As best as I could gather these growths began when he was 14 years old , and began in the area of his wrists .
The skin on his wrists and the back of his hands resembles that of a hedgehog - hundreds of spike like growths .
The problem is much more severe on his palms and fingers where the growths resemble very much that of nails infected with a fungus .
The growths have that same texture , smell and feel .
I cut a number of the largest growths off , most of witch did not bleed .
Some of the smaller growths did bleed a small amount and he seemed much more sensitive to the cutting of the smaller growths .
I soaked his hands first in 3 WEA ( phenyl mercuric nitrate ) and then began .
The 3 WEA did help to soften the growths but they still took time to cut through , or sand down , but it worked just as it does with these types of nails on normal hands or feet .
I was able to pull many of the smaller growths off applying steady pressure and slowly pulling .
But after 1.5 hrs there was not a noticeable change as there are hundreds and hundreds of growths .
There was also quite a bit of dissolved material in the bucket of 3 WEA after we finished .
On his feet I did not cut anything , but tried two different solutions of salicylic acid , one a bit weaker than the other , and also a freeze spray wart remover .
I met his mother and brother ( they all live together ) and their skin looked very normal .
They all eat the same foods and he and his brother sleep in the same bed .
It has grown slowly but steadily but has not spread to other parts of his body , just a bit below his knees on his legs .
He has other skin growth ( many would be skin tags ) on his face , and some moles on his chest .
The growths are not as bad on his feet but I was told that more than 10 years ago many we cauterized off his feet , and they did not return .
I think with repeated soaking and cutting most could be removed but other parts will I think need to be burned away in some form . "
I emailed the missionary a few more questions :
Is there a medical term for this man 's condition ?
Doctors here have called it Lewandowsky - Lutz , though I have not been able to find any pictures of this condition to compare .
Has any analysis of the matter growing off of his skin been done ?
There was 18 years ago , when they came up with the name of what they thought it was .
He has not been treated since then .
When do you understand that this started with him ?
He is now 38 and it started when he was 14 , on one wrist .
He never returned for treatments as he felt the first cauterizing was effective in that the growths did not return to that area , but felt they grew more quickly in other areas .
Does the man have any other unusual symptoms ?
He appears healthy other than the growths .
He has 15 skin tags on his face , and a wart in one ear .
Have there been any theories about this man 's past , something he might have done , ingested , or places he 's been to ... that may have caused it ?
As he says he did not do or eat anything his brother did not do or eat , and his brother appears to be perfectly normal , not yet .
I am currently showing the pictures to veterinarians , as I am also considering that maybe this is something he got from an animal ( pig , sheep , cow ) .
Does it look like the man 's condition is treatable or curable ?
Curable , I do n't know .
But with ongoing thorough cleaning , creams , soaking and cutting - it will be much better for him .

SEATTLE --
Patients using marijuana for ailments ranging from chronic back pain to cancer are allowed by Washington state law to possess a two - month supply of the drug .
But medical marijuana does n’t come with a standard dose or even a standard method of taking the drug .
The 1998 law has never spelled out how much usable pot nor how many plants make up a 60 - day supply .
Now the Legislature has demanded an answer to the question by July , and the state is holding hearings to ask experts and citizens for their opinions on how to determine a two - month supply .
“ There is so much you will have to take into account , ” says Joanna McKee , founder of Seattle ’s Green Cross Patient Co-op .
“ What about people who eat it ?
How different is the amount they need from people who smoke it ? ”
McKee was one of many who spoke at a state health department public meeting this month in Seattle .
More than 100 people attended , and about 45 people spoke .
Another meeting in Spokane drew similar numbers .
Most people at the meetings were clearly medical marijuana advocates .
So are most who have posted comments on a Washington Department of Health website , but a few have written to express dismay at any use of marijuana .
“ It is a waste of our time and resources to address this non-issue , ” reads one such comment .
But the issue is crucial for patients who use medical marijuana .
“ What has ended up happening is that in each county , law enforcement effectively decides what constitutes a 60 - day supply , ” says attorney Alison Holcomb , Marijuana Education Project director for the state ACLU .
“ And in some counties , that amount has been set at zero . ”
Of the 12 states that protect medical marijuana patients from state prosecution , Washington is the only one without clear guidelines on the amount a patient or designated caregiver is allowed to possess .
Those amounts are different in almost every other state .
Oregon allows the largest supply -- 24 ounces or six mature plants -- and several states only allow patients to have one ounce of usable marijuana on hand .
In California , state law sets a limit of 8 ounces or six mature plants , but cities and counties are free to establish higher guidelines .
Dr. Gregory T. Carter , a professor of rehabilitative medicine at the University of Washington School of Medicine who studies the effects of marijuana in treating patients with ALS , or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , says that all of these codified limits may be too low .
“ There are so many variables here .
Even if you just look at smokers , you have to look not only at the quality of the pot , but also at the efficiency of the smoker , ” he says .
“ Some people are better smokers than others . ”
Carter and several colleagues studied the dose amounts used on a federal study of medical marijuana , which has been in progress for more than 30 years .
Based on this , he says that a 60 - day supply works out to nearly 4 1/2 pounds per patient -- far more than the amount allowed by any state .
And , he says , “ that ’s probably a pretty conservative estimate . ”
Tom McBride , executive secretary of the Washington Assn. of Prosecuting Attorneys , welcomes the change in the law .
“ It does n’t make sense for a judge or prosecutor to have to determine how much a sick person needs -- that ’s a medical decision , and I ’ve always felt it should be made by a doctor . ”
McBride says he is n’t worried about a high limit shielding recreational pot dealers .
“ Under Washington law , ” he says , “ group growing and distribution is n’t legal , and codifying a 60 - day supply wo n’t change that . ”
Many advocates hope the state will ultimately allow patient co-ops to grow and distribute medical pot , as is the case in some parts of California .
But no one expects that to happen here any time soon .
Bruce Mirken is director of communications at the Marijuana Policy Project , a national nonprofit group that works for both medical and recreational marijuana policy reform .
He worries that Washington ’s new definition will be set too low , but at the same time emphasizes that safe access remains the larger issue for all medical marijuana patients .
“ It ’s going to remain a problem , as long as the federal government remains hostile to medical marijuana , ” he says .
That worry was reflected in many of the comments offered at the Seattle meeting .
Caroline Welch , 47 , was one of the first to tell her story .
Diagnosed with stage - three ovarian cancer earlier this summer , Welch attributes much of her ability to withstand her treatment to medical marijuana .
“ There were people producing it for me before I knew I ’d even need it , ” she says .
“ It would have taken me till next summer to cultivate the plants , get the knowledge base .
There is no way that I could have done it . ”
McKee , of the Seattle patient co-op , said she had worked with thousands of medical marijuana patients over the years .
“ I have never seen anyone with a 60 - day supply .
I have seen people with a few ounces , a few plants , ” she said .
Public comments on the issue will be accepted until the end of the year , and in early 2008 , the department of health will publish a proposed rule .
The final rule must be in place by July , which is also the deadline for the health department to report back to the Legislature on the issue of safe access to medical marijuana .

Sartre & Peanuts
Nathan Radke claims that Charlie Brown is an existentialist .
Our anti-hero sits , despondent .
He is alone , both physically and emotionally .
He is alienated from his peers .
He is fearfully awaiting a punishment for his actions .
In desperation , he looks to God for comfort and hope .
Instead , his angst overwhelms him , and manifests itself as physical pain .
There is no comfort to be found .
Poor Charlie Brown .
He waits outside of the principal ’s office , waiting to hear what will become to him .
He offers up a little prayer , but all he gets is a stomach ache .
When we are exposed to something every day we can eventually lose sight of its brilliance .
Newspaper readers have been exposed to Charles Schulz ’s comic strip ‘ Peanuts ’ for over half a century .
Even now , a few years after Schulz died , many newspapers continue to carry reruns of his strips , and bookstores offer Peanuts collections .
His characters are featured in countless advertisements , and every December networks dutifully show the Charlie Brown Christmas Special .
Is there any philosophical insight that can be gleamed from such a mainstream and common source ?
There has been much discussion concerning Peanuts as a voice of conservative Christianity , including several books such as the 1965 work The Gospel According to Peanuts .
This is not without reason ; even a cursory glance at a Peanuts anthology will reveal enough scripture references to fuel a month ’s worth of Sunday school classes .
However , to suggest that Schulz ’s philosophical insights did n’t make it past the church door would be a mistake .
While Schulz had a great interest in the Bible and the teachings of Jesus Christ , he was also highly suspicious of dogmatic pious beliefs .
In a 1981 interview , he refused to describe himself as religious , arguing that “ I do n’t know what religious means ” .
Charlie Brown was no comic strip missionary , blandly spreading the word of organized religion .
Upon reflection , the trials and tribulations of the little round - headed kid provide deep and moving illustrations of existentialism .
This mixture of Biblical teaching and existential thought is not uncommon .
The Danish Christian philosopher Søren Kierkegaard was one of the first existentialists , and his religious beliefs impelled his philosophy , rather than limiting it .
Kierkegaard was forced to confront his deeply held belief in the existence of God with the tremendous empty silence that returns from the prayers of humans , and the results were his vital and compelling theories of faith and freedom .
It should also be noted that while Schulz did not consider himself religious , neither did he refer to himself as an existentialist .
In fact , he was unfamiliar with the term until the mid 1950s , when he stumbled across a few newspaper articles about Jean - Paul Sartre .
He was certainly not formally schooled in philosophical works .
And yet , his simple line drawings provide illumination into the questions and problems raised by existentialism .
In order to identify examples of Schulz ’s philosophy , a bumper - sticker version of existentialism should prove helpful .
In his seminal 1946 work L’Existentialisme est un Humanisme , Sartre outlines some of the core aspects of his theories .
A key aspect is the idea of abandonment .
Kierkegaard felt that there was an unbridgeable gap between God and Man .
Sartre goes even further , and argues that even if there is an unknowable and unreachable God , it would n’t make any difference to the human condition .
Ultimately , we exist in an abandoned and free state .
We are responsible for our actions , and since Sartre argues that there is no God to conceive of a human nature , we are responsible for our own creation .
How does this apply to Peanuts ?
Like the existential human in a world of silent or absent deities , Schulz ’s characters exist in a world of silent or absent adult authority .
In fact , the way the strip is drawn ( with the child characters taking up most of each frame ) actually prevents the presence of any adults .
Schulz argued that , were adults added to the strip , the narratives would become untenable .
While references are sometimes made to full - grown humans ( normally school teachers ) these characters are always out of frame , and silent .
The children of Peanuts are left to their own devices , to try and understand the world they have found themselves thrust into .
They have to turn to each other for support – hence , Lucy ’s blossoming psychiatric booth ( at five cents a session , a very good deal ) .
An ideal example of abandonment is the relationship between Linus and The Great Pumpkin .
Every Halloween , Linus faithfully waits by a pumpkin patch , in the hopes that he will be blessed with the holy experience of a visitation by The Great Pumpkin .
Of course , The Great Pumpkin never shows up , and He never answers Linus ’ letters .
Despite this , Linus remains steadfast , even going door to door to spread the word of his absent deity .
Does The Great Pumpkin exist ?
We can never know .
But from an existential point of view , it does n’t matter if he exists or not .
The important thing is that Linus is abandoned and alone in his pumpkin patch .
Sartre did not deny the existence of God triumphantly .
Instead , he considered it “ ... extremely embarrassing that God does not exist , for there disappears all possibility of finding values in an intelligible heaven . ” .
Without God , everything we do as humans is absurd , and without meaning .
Certainly , spending all night in a pumpkin patch would qualify as embarrassing as well .
In the absence of any parental edicts , the characters in Peanuts have had to become very philosophically minded in order to establish for themselves what is right and wrong .
When Linus gets a sliver in his finger , a conflict erupts between Lucy ’s theological determinism ( he is being punished for something he did wrong ) and Charlie Brown ’s philosophical uncertainty ( when the sliver falls out , Lucy ’s position crumbles ) .
At Christmas time , Linus dictates a letter to Santa , questioning the validity of Santa ’s ethical judgments regarding the goodness or badness of the individual child .
“ What is good ?
What is bad ? ” asks Linus .
Good questions .
Another key aspect comes from this monstrous freedom that abandonment allows , and this aspect is despair .
In a nutshell , we are created by our actions .
We are responsible for our actions .
Therefore , we are responsible for our creation .
What we are is the sum total of what we have done , nothing more and nothing less .
But why should this cause despair ?
To answer this , Sartre examines the characteristics of cowardice and bravery .
When Sartre describes the position that opposes his own , we can see how it may be comforting to not be responsible for one ’s creation :
If you are born cowards , you can be quite content , you can do nothing about it and you will be cowards all your life whatever you do ; and if you are born heroes you can again be quite content ; you will be heroes all your life , eating and drinking heroically .
Whereas the existentialist says that the coward makes himself cowardly , the hero makes himself heroic ; and that there is always the possibility for the coward to give up cowardice and for the hero to stop being a hero .
( Jean - Paul Sartre , Existentialism and Humanism 1957 )
It is this very possibility that causes despair .
Why does Charlie Brown tear himself into knots over the little red-haired girl ?
The very possibility that he could go over and talk to her is far more distressing than its impossibility would be ; he must take ownership of his failure .
When she is the victim of a bully in the school yard , Charlie Brown ’s despair threatens to leap right off the comic page .
He is n’t suffering because he can’t help her , but because he could help her , but wo n’t : “ Why ca n’t I rush over there and save her ?
Because I ’d get slaughtered , that ’s why ... ”
When Linus helps her out instead , thereby illustrating his freedom of action , Charlie Brown only becomes more melancholic .
In order to combat despair , Charlie Brown succumbs to bad faith , which is to say , he denies his freedom : “ I wonder what would happen if I went over and tried to talk to her !
Everybody would probably laugh ... she ’d probably be insulted too ... ”
It is only by falsely denying his freedom that Charlie Brown can overcome his despair .
But by hiding behind bad faith , he does himself no favours .
Another lunch hour is spent alone on a bench with a peanut butter sandwich .
Existence is problematic and disturbing .
In one weekend strip , Schulz succinctly describes the horror of discovering one ’s own existence in the world :
Linus : I ’m aware of my tongue ...
It ’s an awful feeling !
Every now and then I become aware that I have a tongue inside my mouth , and then it starts to feel lumped up ... I ca n’t help it ... I ca n’t put it out of my mind .
... I keep thinking about where my tongue would be if I were n’t thinking about it , and then I can feel it sort of pressing against my teeth ...
Sartre devoted an entire book to this experience – his 1938 novel Nausea in which his character Roquentin is alarmed to discover his own actuality .
But Linus sums the point up very well in a few frames .
Existentialism has been accused of being defeatist and depressing ( and Sartre did n’t help his cause with terms like ‘ abandonment ’ , ‘ despair ’ , and ‘ nausea ’ ) .
But Peanuts also demonstrates the optimism of the philosophy .
Why does Charlie Brown continue to go out to the pitcher ’s mound , despite his 50 year losing streak ?
Why try to kick the football , when Lucy has always pulled it away at the last second ?
Because there is an infinite gap between the past and the present .
Regardless of what has come before , there is always the possibility of change .
Monstrous freedom is a double edged sword .
We exist , and are responsible .
This is both liberating and terrifying .
Schulz should be considered part of the generation of authors who saw active duty during World War II ; he is in the company of writers such as Joseph Heller , Kurt Vonnegut , and of course Sartre himself .
It is foolish to disregard literature simply because it appears in the funnies section of the daily paper .
Schulz ’s simple line drawings and blocky letters contain as much information about the human condition as entire shelves full of dry books .
While it is difficult to say what Sartre would have thought of Peanuts , we do know what Schulz thought of Sartre : “ I read about him in the New York Times , where he said it was very difficult to be a human being , and the only way to fight against it is to lead an active life – that ’s very true . ”
If any character has shown us the difficulties in existence , it is Charlie Brown

Around the world there are little bodies of people who quite literally control the destinies of others .
That thought horrifies me .
These are people who are allowed to make decisions as to what other people may , or may not , do with their own lives , bodies or property .
Individuals with little or no stake in the results are able to decide for people for whom their decision may literally be life or death .
Consider the story of Ronald “ Bo ” Ward .
He owned a small business , Bo ’s Barber Shop down in Clarksville , Tennessee .
Bo ’s barber shop was something of an institution .
Part of the reason was that Bo was willing to give haircuts to local military personnel even if they did n’t have the money to pay for it .
The commanding general of the 101st Airborne Division and Fort Campbell actually issued a statement about Bo . He called Bo an “ icon ” “ known for his hospitality , warm smile and engaging conversation ” and someone “ who genuinely cared about soldiers .
” Bo expanded his shop and found himself in some financial difficulties .
He had a way out , his home .
He asked for permission to rezone his property to commercial .
As commercial property the value would increase and Bo would be able to get the financing he needed to see himself through the rough patch .
A month ago he said that if the application “ does n’t go through , I lose my home , I lose my shop , I lose everything I got .
” But this requires asking a group of faceless bureaucrats to grant him permission to use his own property in a more profitable way .
The city council voted 5 - 7 against the request .
Bo ’s response was simple : “ Y’all have put me under .
I ’m out of here . ”
Bo Ward pulled out a handgun and shot himself in the head .
Bo ’s life was out of his control .
It was in the hands of other people .
Consider the problem of politics .
Each government official makes decisions which have an impact on others .
They may give , or deny , permission to an individual to use their life , liberty or property in the way that they choose .
If the bureaucrats make the “ right ” decision they gain nothing .
If they make the wrong decision they lose nothing .
They have nothing of substance on the line , not like the people who ’s lives they hold in the palms of their hands .
A simple nod of the head can change a life .
To have such power over others strikes me as inhumane .
At the very best it is indecent .
I consider myself a rather smart guy .
I know where I stand on the IQ chart .
I know what I ’m capable of doing .
Yet , I ’d never feel comfortable having this type of power over the lives of other people .
It is one thing if individuals make a decision and discover it is the wrong one .
But what happens to these people when they are powerless to make that decision and they are forced to rely on the decisions of others , other people who lose absolutely nothing if they act wrongly ?
Bo Ward ’s life was out of his own control .
It was handed over to a group of people who call themselves the city council .
But does it really matter that much if they are called a council or a lord , a king or even “ master ” .
Can humans ever realize the danger and obscenity of allowing some people to rule over others ?
The city mayor , Johnny Piper , tells the council “ How you voted was not right or wrong . ”
What ??
Is that really how he sees things ?
The decisions politicians make can literally destroy other people .
And this man actually says there is no “ right or wrong ” decision .
It ’s just another vote , another decision .
What those decisions mean to the people they control is very significant to them .
For Piper it was just another vote .
For Bo Ward it was life or death .
Mayor Piper says the council “ showed no guilt because they did what they were asked to do , as far as handling the business of the city . ”
The business of the city !
It was Bo ’s business that they controlled at that moment .
This is part of the problem with the political class , they see things as “ affairs of state ” or “ government business ” when in reality they are controlling other human beings .
Piper says he will be putting in metal detectors because he ’s concerned about “ security for elected officials . ”
How nice !
He ’s concerned about himself and his fellow politicians .
How concerned was he about Bo Ward and what impact his decision would have on that one citizen ?
Apparently not very concerned at all .
Another city council member showed a similar sensitivity .
Council member Marc Harris says he had no regrets over his vote .
“ The vote should ’ve been 12 nos , ” he bitched .
I guess the fact that five council members did n’t agree with him causes a problem .
If it were unanimous he could comfort himself by being part of the collective .
One of the insurmountable problems of government is that it allows the sort of thinking that Harris and Piper show so clearly .
Since they are each a member of this impersonal machine they take no responsibility for what they do .
It ’s the system .
They can cast votes with little consideration that this might destroy people and their lives , they comfort themselves that they personally are not responsible .
It is the system .
Government is like a glorified lynch mob where each participant convinces himself that what he is doing must be right since everyone else is doing it as well .
And Harris is acting like he ’s the victim .
He says , “ I ’m at the point where I want my life back . ”
Sort of the way Bo Ward wanted his life back .
But
Bo did n’t control his own life that night , the city council did .
This collective mentality , this idea of seeing oneself as just a cog in the machine called government , destroys the concept of responsibility .
Felix Morley once wrote that “ the State has no conscience . "
A conscience is the attribute of an individual .
But in politics decisions are made by groups so no one individual feels responsible .
Each politicians feels less and less responsible for the outcome , as there are more and more of them controlling the outcome .
The “ government ” decides not the individual so the “ government ” is responsible not the individual politicians .
And the bigger government gets the more it has .
But the bigger it gets the less there is any sense of individual responsibility among those who wield that power .
What a lethal combination is being created by this thing called government .
More and more power is concentrated in it while there is less and less individual moral restraint .
So you end up with people with vast amounts of power over others , who have no real incentive to make good decisions , and who feel limited responsibility for the consequences of their decisions .
The result of this is tragedy for the Bo Wards of the world .
The really sad thing is that most of the Bo Wards out there , who have their lives devastated by government , simply never make the news .
And Bo Ward would n’t have either but for the dramatic way in which he ended his life .
Consider an alternative ending .
Bo walks out of the meeting dejected .
In a few months time the financial crunch is too much .
He ca n’t raise the funds he needs and his business goes under .
He ca n’t pay for his house and it is repossessed .
At his age , with just the skills of a barber , he has limited job possibilities .
He suffers great emotional stress watching his family put out of their home .
Maybe he takes to drink .
It helps him forget the troubles and the pain and shame he feels in failing the people he loves .
One night , after a little too much to drink , he gets into his car but he never finishes his journey .
There is an accident and he is killed .
There might be a small mention in the local newspaper about the local man , who once owned a barber shop , and how he was killed in a car accident .
Yet his fate was actually sealed the night the council voted 5 - 7 to deny him the right to use his own property in the way he wished .
With this sort of ending no one would be traumatized , except his grieving family and friends .
The city council members would continue on , blithely ignoring the reality that they are controling the lives of other people .
Thousands of people daily have their lives turned upside - down by the politicians .
It might be the young National Guard member who dies in Iraq .
It may be the cancer patient who ca n’t eat but ca n’t use marijuana medicinally to help himself .
Vast powers , in the hands of fallible men and women , without the incentive to do the right thing .
Vast powers , being held by people who feel little moral responsibility for the outcomes they create .
And most of the time they never see the trail of tragedies that they create during their career of “ serving ” the people .
They never see it because the disasters happen outside their range of vision .
Bo Ward ’s action , as horrible and tragic as it was , was done right in front of them .
He did n’t let them escape the consequences that they imposed on him by their vote .
He made it real to them .
What they do does direct the destiny of other human beings .
But the consequences of those decisions rest almost entirely with the victims of the politicization of life .
Bo Ward ’s action made the consequences real to the people who made the decision .
For that they will never forgive him .
They will denounce him .
They will be angry with him .
They will tell everyone it was his own fault .
Bo Ward broke the illusion that controlling the lives of other people is merely a necessary thing .
He brought individual responsibility right into the laps of the decision - makers .
Instead of going away quietly , and suffering the consequences that the council would create , he made those consequences apparent and instantly obvious to people who had long ago forgotten that their power can destroy the lives of others .
This may haunt some of the politicians .
Most will ignore it .
Most will forget that there are victims each time they sign their resolutions or make their decisions .
Most will argue that they have no moral responsibility for the trauma they create .
They will tell everyone how they are necessary and they will pat each other on the back .
They will call it “ serving their fellow man ” --
I wonder if the plantation owner convinced himself that he was “ helping ” the slaves he lorded over ?
And when they retire they will give each other laudatory farewell speeches and awards and brag about their altruism .
And they can do this because , unlike Bo Ward , most their victims went away and suffered outside their view .

By the 1950s , television had become the national nightly pastime , but tiny screens and monochrome pictures left viewers itching for improvement .
Color was the obvious next step , and by 1954 the technical challenges of broadcasting in full color had been overcome .
RCA gave America a way to watch the new waves , that same year releasing the CT - 100 — an enormously complex device that required two sets of circuits , one for color , one for B&W .
Alas , it met with little success in the market .
Picture quality was poor ; images were blurry and ghosted .
" Only an inveterate ( and well - heeled ) experimenter should let the advertisements seduce him into being ' among the very first ' to own a color TV set , " sniffed Consumer Reports .
Yet more than 50 years later , Wired readers voted the CT - 100 the Greatest Gadget of All Time for launching television as we know it today .

Claim : Photographs show a live deer pulled out of the water by fisherman .
Status : True .
Example : [ Collected via e-mail , June 2007 ]
This was taken on a recent fishing trip in the Gulf .
They were 5 miles out .
Where the deer was coming from was about 5 miles back , and where he was going to he said you could barely make out that it was land .
They pulled the deer in the boat and he was so tired , he did n’t move .
This was taken on a recent fishing trip in the Gulf .
They wereout .
Where the deer was coming from was aboutback , and where he was going to he said you could barely make out that it was land .
They pulled the deer in the boat and he was so tired , he did n’t move .
Origins : Many a fisherman has experienced pulling something odd ( other than fish ) out of the water — an old tire , an appliance , maybe a carcass of a non-marine animal species ( including , sometimes , human beings ) .
But the critter that Chad Campbell of Washington and Bo Warren of Virginia pulled out of Chesapeake Bay in 80 feet of water about a mile and a half off Bloody Point one day in 2007 was not unusual just for being in the water in the first place , but for being very much a non-carcass .
What they fished out of the bay one busy Saturday was a live whitetail deer .
As they described the experience to the Maryland Gazette :
The catching was slow and they looked back to check their lines .
They saw what appeared to be a seal with its snout out of the water , but they did n’t think any seals were around their fishing grounds and they kept watching .
The catching was slow and they looked back to check their lines .
They saw what appeared to be a seal with its snout out of the water , but they did n’t think any seals were around their fishing grounds and they kept watching .
Soon they realized it was a deer trying desperately to keep afloat — and obviously losing the battle .
Fearing the whitetail would get snagged in their lines they cranked in their rigs .
Then the deer headed straight for the boat possibly thinking it was a spit of land .
But as it got closer and saw the two fishermen aboard , it had second thoughts .
With its nose barely out of the water , it appeared to have been swimming all night , said Campbell .
“ Since the fish were n’t biting , we thought we ’d give it a hand .
Bo grew up around cows , was really handy with a bow line and lasooed the deer on the first attempt . ”
They got it close ,
Bo grabbed the neck , Chad got a good hold on a flank and “ we barreled over backwards to the deck — and before we knew it , Bo was on top of the buck in velvet and had him hog tied like a calf . ”
Chad , said they feared the deer was going to “ kick the hell out of us in a 22 - foot center console boat , ” but they were lucky , it was too exhausted to resist , “ We hit the gas and ran him to the closest beach , Kent Point , where I beached the boat and we carefully unloaded our catch on the sand .
We untied him and jumped back .
“ Too weak to stand , he just sat there quivering .
We picked him up again and put his feet underneath him , but he still could n’t walk or stand .
We left him sitting there looking at us .
Before we left , I looked him in the eye and said ‘ See you on opening day ; payback time . ’
“ We do n’t know whether he made it or not , but we do know his chances were vastly improved for survival than when we first saw him . ”

If you look through the entries , they are sorted by the types of e-tailers available .
Through them , you should find what you need .
Also , there is a section for New Orleans Charities .
Consider tossing an extra Benjamin to the New Orleans Musicians Clinic , the Arabi Wrecking Krewe , or Habitat for Humanity -- they all need it .
And besides , think of the tax deductions !
Hundreds of billions are are spent on holiday shopping annually .
If this site can direct one percent of one percent of that money to New Orleans , it will mean tens of millions of dollars , recirculating and rebuilding New Orleans .

Firstly , this fiery dish gains its name arrabbiata ( angry ) because of the use of chilli .
When preparing this angry dish , feel free to use as much chilli as you want , it is up to you and to your mouth , to make it angry or very angry !
This is a recipe that has its origin in the central part of Italy , more precisely , it belongs to the Roman cooking tradition .
As you can imagine , in Italy there are many versions of it because of the different regional cooking traditions that influence this famous dish ; some are so adventurous that they have nothing to do with a proper arrabbiata ( like the use of cream or anchovies ) .
I believe the best arrabbiata is in its minimalist form and I believe that an arrabbiata should not contain pork meat ( usually bacon ) because otherwise we would trespass on another famous Roman dish , the “ Bucatini all ’amatriciana ” , which rightly requires pork meat .
The arrabbiata , in its simple way , is an aglio , oglio e peperoncino with the adding of chopped tomatoes , where fresh top quality ingredients should be used .
Also , the adding of Parmesan or Pecorino Romano cheese is not recommended because it would overwhelm the typical flavour of this dish .

Dan Savage 's " Slog " uncovered the rather disturbing fact that two of the owners of the WNBA team in Seattle , the Seattle Sonics / Storm , appear to have donated most of the budget to religious right homophobe Gary Bauer 's anti-gay marriage campaign .
From Slog :
The campaign finance records I ’ve reviewed show that Sonics / Storm co-owner Tom Ward has contributed $ 475,000 to Gary L. Bauer ’s Americans United to Preserve Marriage .
And another Sonics / Storm co-owner , Aubrey McClendon , contributed $ 625,000 .
Both men made their first contributions to the group , $ 250,000 apiece , on September 8 , 2004 — the day after the group was formed .
As I said , the controversial group doled out $ 1,056,962 in the 2004 election cycle , which means Storm owners Ward and McClendon basically bankrolled the whole thing .
Indeed , records show that between the 2004 and 2006 cycles the group spent $ 1.3 million total while Ward and McClendon ’s donations total $ 1.1 million .
People are entitled to have their views , they are not views that I happen to agree with but they are not trying to impose them on anyone out here .
Savage 's paper contacted the team for comment , they did n't get back to him , but did to the local paper .
Check out their response Yeah , $ 1.1 million for a campaign to jam conservative Christian laws down our throats , to force all Americans to live under Baptist religious principles - that , according to the Seattle Sonics / Storm is " not trying to impose " your views on anyone .
Kiss that team goodbye .
It 's bad enough to be massively huge bigots .
It 's even worse to get all pissy and lie about it .
And as Dan mentioned to me , " their games are attended mostly by lesbians .
" Not anymore .
The move has alarmed opponents of the death penalty .
Some Republicans have been complaining for years that prisoners can delay execution by 20 or more years through appeals .
They say that the original intention of the law was that the gap between sentencing and execution should be short .
The justice department , which has shifted radically to the right under the attorney general , Alberto Gonzales , is putting the final details to the changes .
The public have until September 23 to lodge an opinion after which the new rules can be implemented .
There are about 3,350 people on death row in the US .
There were 53 executions last year .
Conservatives , as well as being dissatisfied with the lengthy process at present , have expressed concern about costs : prisoners on death row cost about $ 90,000 ( £ 45,000 ) more a year to house than other inmates .
The proposed changes have divided opinion in the US .
Some state legal officials regard reform as long overdue .
Kent Cattani , a lawyer in the Arizona attorney general 's office , told the Los Angeles Times : " If you are going to have the death penalty at all , it should n't take 20 - 25 years . "
But Elisabeth Semel , director of the Death Penalty Clinic at the UC Berkley law school , said : " The inevitable result of speeding them up is to miss profound legal errors that are made .
Lawyers will not see them .
Courts will not address them . "
Kathryn Kase , co-chair of the death - penalty committee for the National Associatin of Criminal Defence Lawyers , said : " This is the Bush administration throwing down the gauntlet and saying , ' We are going to speed up executions ' . "
There are others who argue that keeping prisoners on death row for so long is itself a form of mental torture .
Although DNA testing has helped establish the innocence of more than a dozen death row inmates , conservative Republicans remain unpersuaded about the case for delay .
They are suspicious that some liberal judges opposed to the death penalty deliberately string out the legal process .
The number of executions in the US has been steadily dropping since the 1990s .
Part of the reason for opposition to the changes from opponents of the death penalty is that the new powers would be taken by Mr Gonzales , who was legal adviser to President George Bush when he was governor of Texas .
During his six years in office , Mr Bush presided over 152 executions , the largest number of any US governor in recent years .
Among the proposed changes , those on death row would have the time available to file appeals to federal courts cut from a year to six months and deadlines would be set for federal district judges of 450 days to decide and appeals courts 120 days .
Two Republican Congressmen , Dan Lungren and Jon Kyl , both of whom support the death penalty , opened the way for the changes by putting a provision in the Patriot Act last year , that switched power from states to Mr Gonzales to decide on death row prisoners ' legal representation .
A justice department spokesman , Erik Ablin , said that after the public consultation period is over , the changes will be finalised " as quickly as circumstances allow " .
Toward the end of Four Eyed Monsters , Arin Crumley and Susan Buice get a phone call from YouTube congratulating them for becoming the first filmmakers to land a feature - length narrative on the site .
The autobiographical movie , financed with $ 100,000 on credit cards , runs 71 minutes and has been viewed more than a half million times since it was posted on YouTube last week .
The drama follows the couple 's unusual dating rituals , as they abandon typical small talk and resort to writing each other paper notes .
The genius part :
In the past week alone , Crumley and Buice say they 've earned more than $ 20,000 in referral payments from sponsor Spout.com , a movie rate - and - review site that 's giving the filmmakers $ 1 for each new recommendation for Monsters made by a site visitor .
" It 's pretty insane that an independent film has made $ 20,000 in one week showing itself for free online , " marvels Crumley , who also sells DVDs and DRM - free downloads through the Four Eyed Monsters store .
Indie filmmakers seeking success on YouTube are no longer content to bask in the validation of a few thousand viewers .
Instead , these auteur - entrepreneurs are using software , crowd sourcing and " virtual studio " sites to broaden exposure for their work and make a few bucks while they 're at it .
In the case of Monsters , the YouTube coup capped a shrewd 18 - month campaign that began when the tech - savvy filmmakers posted behind - the - scenes episodes on their MySpace pages .
Then , Crumley and Buice asked fans for help to book the movie in local theaters .
" People were commenting on the videos , then commenting on each other 's comments and becoming friends with each other , " says Crumley .
" We wanted to take that social - networking dynamic and bring it into the offline world , so we asked everybody to give us their ZIP codes if they would like to see our film . "
Fan clusters emerged in six cities .
" We needed to acquire a directory of art - house theaters in those towns , so we invited our subscriber base to suggest local theaters they could imagine a movie like ours playing in .
We took the problem of not knowing where we should book the film and crowd - sourced that . "
Operating on the principal that people need to see a film before they shell out money to buy a DVD , Crumley and Buice staged a Second Life version of Four Eyed Monsters before landing on YouTube .
Student filmmaker Chris Mais used less elaborate means to push his motion - capture short Smile beyond the user - generated universe .
After spending $ 1,000 and two years making the nine - minute comedy , he posted a making - of clip on his MySpace page to build his fan base , then submitted Smile to a couple dozen film festivals .
" Festival screenings took it to the next step and legitimatized Smile so it would stand out from any other video on YouTube , " Mais says .
" That 's where I met distributors and stuff . "
Shorts International signed Mais and placed Smile with iTunes .
Mais says , " I 've sold about 3,000 copies so far , which is pretty good considering it was just an undergraduate film I made . "
Tiffany Shlain uses her own website to self - distribute DVDs of The Tribe , a 15 - minute documentary about Jewish history enacted by Barbie dolls .
" Making the film is half of it , " Shlain says .
" The other half is being really creative about using the web to get it to the right audiences by tapping into different communities online .
You do not need a middleman .
You can have a niche film and make the numbers work . "
Shlain and Mais used Withoutabox to gain exposure on the film - festival circuit .
Located in a one - story bungalow across the freeway from NBC Universal 's massive production lot , the virtual studio could n't be farther away conceptually from Old Hollywood .
CEO David Straus , a former filmmaker himself who co-founded Withoutabox when he became fed up with the hassles of filling out festival entry forms , says " Filmmakers who have the power to make a film can use that same power to monetize it . "
Withoutabox represents about 120,000 filmmakers and will soon introduce Critical Mass Ticketing , which automatically books theaters for a given movie if enough members in a given region pre-order tickets .
Fans can also acquire distribution rights through the site 's licensing tool .
" If a filmmaker comes to us , whether it's to self - distribute theatrically or online , we 've created systems that give rights - owners the opportunity to do all of that , " says Straus .
Other indie- friendly aggregators , like inDplay in San Francisco , Nashville - based fylmz and Austin 's b-side , connect filmmakers with potential fans eager to sort the wheat from the chaff .
" The system is totally overburdened with content so what you have is a bottleneck problem , " says digital filmmaking pioneer Lance Weiler , who created WorkbookProject.com as a DIY resource for other filmmakers and invented his own devices to promote a 17 - city theatrical release for his horror film Head Trauma .
" I did this embed - and - spread strategy by creating this digital audio player people could put into their own pages .
I 'd call from the road on my cell phone and do my own quote - unquote radio broadcasts .
What that points to is the widgitization of distribution tools and promotional tools people can use to build an audience . "
Will this new model of viral - based cinema gain enough traction to displace Old Hollywood marketing muscle ?
All bets are off , according to Weiler .
" Nobody really knows what that next model is , in terms of , OK , how do I monetize my content ?
But when you break it down , it comes down to human recommendation : I tell somebody , and they tell somebody else . "
Due to the fact that my favorite Window manager is now licensed non-freely ( and then some ) , I award Tuomo Valkonen the Jörg Schilling award for free software project management .
Tuomo can console himself with his award while I console myself with Tritium .
With the new dock feature announced today , I think it just turned into something I can switch to .

I am releasing version 1.0 of my Skeptical Layman 's Guide to Anthropogenic Global Warming .
You may download the pdf ( about 2.7 mb ) from the link above or by clicking on the cover photo below .
In the next few days , I will also be posting an online HTML version as well as offering a printed version at cost .
Update :
The HTML version is here , and the book can be purchased at cost through this link
The purpose of this paper is to provide a layman 's critique
of the Anthropogenic Global Warming ( AGW ) theory , and in particular to
challenge the fairly widespread notion that the science and projected
consequences of AGW currently justify massive spending and government
intervention into the world 's economies .
This paper will show that despite good evidence that global temperatures
are rising and that CO2 can act as a greenhouse gas and help to warm the Earth ,
we are a long way from attributing all or much of current warming to man-made
CO2 .
We are even further away from being
able to accurately project man 's impact on future climate , and it is a very
debatable question whether interventions today to reduce CO2 emissions will substantially
improve the world 50 or 100 years from now .
I am not a trained expert on the climate .
I studied physics at Princeton University before switching my
major to mechanical engineering , where I specialized in control theory and
feedback loops , a topic that will be important when we get into the details of
climate change modeling .
For over ten
years , my business specialty was market prediction and sales forecasting using
modeling approaches similar to ( if far less complex than ) those used in climate .
My goal for this paper is not to materially
advance climate science .
However , I have
found that the global warming skeptic 's case is seldom reported well or in any
depth , and I wanted to have a try at producing a fair reporting of the
skeptic 's position .
I have been unhappy
with several of the recent documentaries outlining the skeptic 's case , either
because they skipped over a number of critical issues , or because they
over - sold alternate warming hypotheses that are not yet well understood .
To the inevitable charge that as a
non-practitioner , I am not qualified to write this paper -- I believe that I am
able to present the current state of the science , with a particular emphasis on
the skeptic 's case , at least as well as a good reporter might , and far better
than most reporters actually portray the state of the science .
Through this paper I will try to cite sources
as often as possible and provide links for those who are reading this online ,
this report is best read as journalism , not as a scientific , meticulously
footnoted paper .

Bolton : US would support preemptive Israeli strike on Iran John Byrne

President Bush 's former United Nations ambassador John Bolton said the United States would stand behind a pre-emptive strike by Israel against countries developing " WMD facilities . "
In his remark , printed in Tuesday 's edition of the Israeli daily Yediot Achronot , Bolton directly referenced Iran .
" The greatest concern is to prevent Iran and other countries in the region from acquiring nuclear weapons , " Bolton said , according to JTA.org , a Jewish news service .
" We 're talking about a clear message to Iran -- Israel has the right to self - defense -- and that includes offensive operations against WMD facilities that pose a threat to Israel .
The United States would justify such attacks . "
Bolton 's remarks follow an Israeli airstrike on Syria Sept. 6 against what US officials described as an effort to attack nuclear material the country had received from North Korea .
" Nobody thinks the use of force is an attractive option , " Bolton continued , according to a second report .
" But let 's come down to the real question : is the use of force as an alternative preferable to Iran having nuclear weapons ?
No question about it , in my view . "
Bolton added that any Iranian strike would involve a " limited " airstrike on uranium enrichment targets rather than an invasion like Iraq .
He disagreed with retired Gen. John Abizaid who said today , " I believe that we have the power to deter Iran , should it become nuclear . 
Bolton demurred .
" The notion that living under the threat of a possible use of Iranian nuclear weapons ... may appeal to some people but it's not the kind of life I want to live and I do n't think it 's the kind of life that people in Israel , for example , or other American friends and allies in the region are happy to live with , " he said .
Asked whether Israel has the capability to strike Iran , he added , " In fact it 's so clear that on the MIT website there 's a paper by two individuals that detail from open sources just exactly how the Israelis could do it . "

The following video is from Australian Broadcasting 's Lateline , broadcast on September 18 .
Keith Olbermann delivers arguably his most pointed and most powerful Special Comment yet on the ramifications of Bush 's commutation of Libby 's sentence .
Download Download
In that moment , Mr. Bush , you broke that fundamental compact between yourself and the majority of this nation 's citizens -- the ones who did not cast votes for you .
In that moment , Mr. Bush , you ceased to be the President of the United States .
In that moment , Mr. Bush , you became merely the President ... of a rabid and irresponsible corner of the Republican Party .
Transcripts below the fold ...
Finally tonight , as promised , a Special Comment on what is , in everything but name , George Bush 's pardon of Scooter Libby .
" I did n't vote for him , " an American once said , " But he 's my president , and I hope he does a good job . "
That -- on this eve of the 4th of July -- is the essence of this democracy , in seventeen words .
And that is what President Bush threw away yesterday in commuting the sentence of Lewis " Scooter " Libby .
The man who said those seventeen words -- improbably enough -- was the actor John Wayne .
And Wayne , an ultra-conservative , said them , when he learned of the hair 's - breadth election of John F. Kennedy instead of his personal favorite , Richard Nixon in 1960 .
" I did n't vote for him but he 's my president , and I hope he does a good job . "
The sentiment was doubtlessly expressed earlier .
But there is something especially appropriate about hearing it , now , in Wayne 's voice .
The crisp matter - of - fact acknowledgement that we have survived , even though for nearly two centuries now , our Commander - in - Chief has also served , simultaneously , as the head of one political party and often the scourge of all others .
We as citizens must , at some point , ignore a president 's partisanship .
Not that we may " prosper " as a nation , not that we may " achieve " , not that we may " lead the world " -- but merely that we may " function . "
But just as essential to the seventeen words of John Wayne is an implicit trust -- a sacred trust :
That the president for whom so many did not vote , can in turn suspend his political self long enough , and for matters imperative enough , to conduct himself solely for the benefit of the entire Republic .
Our generation 's willingness to state " we did n't vote for him , but he 's our president , and we hope he does a good job , " was tested in the crucible of history , and far earlier than most .
And in circumstances more tragic and threatening .
And we did that with which history tasked us .
We enveloped " our " President in 2001 .
And those who did not believe he should have been elected -- indeed , those who did not believe he had been elected -- willingly lowered their voices and assented to the sacred oath of non-partisanship .
And George W. Bush took our assent , and re-configured it , and honed it , and sharpened it to a razor - sharp point , and stabbed this nation in the back with it .
Were there any remaining lingering doubt otherwise , or any remaining lingering hope , it ended yesterday when Mr. Bush commuted the prison sentence of one of his own staffers .
Did so even before the appeals process was complete ...
Did so without as much as a courtesy consultation with the Department of Justice ...
Did so despite what James Madison -- at the Constitutional Convention -- said about impeaching any president who pardoned or sheltered those who had committed crimes " advised by " that president ...
Did so without the slightest concern that even the most detached of citizens must look at the chain of events and wonder :
To what degree was Mr. Libby told : break the law however you wish -- the President will keep you out of prison ?
In that moment , Mr. Bush , you broke that fundamental compact between yourself and the majority of this nation 's citizens -- the ones who did not cast votes for you .
In that moment , Mr. Bush , you ceased to be the President of the United States .
In that moment , Mr. Bush , you became merely the President ... of a rabid and irresponsible corner of the Republican Party .
And this is too important a time , sir , to have a Commander - in - Chief who puts party over nation .
This has been , of course , the gathering legacy of this Administration .
Few of its decisions have escaped the stain of politics .
The extraordinary Karl Rove has spoken of " a permanent Republican majority , " as if such a thing -- or a permanent Democratic majority -- is not antithetical to that upon which rests : our country , our history , our revolution , our freedoms .
Yet our democracy has survived shrewder men than Karl Rove .
And it has survived the frequent stain of politics upon the fabric of government .
But this administration , with ever - increasing insistence and almost theocratic zealotry , has turned that stain ... into a massive oil spill .
The protection of the environment is turned over to those of one political party , who will financially benefit from the rape of the environment .
The protections of the Constitution are turned over to those of one political party , who believe those protections unnecessary and extravagant and " quaint . "
The enforcement of the laws is turned over to those of one political party , who will swear beforehand that they will not enforce those laws .
The choice between war and peace is turned over to those of one political party , who stand to gain vast wealth by ensuring that there is never peace , but only war .
And now , when just one cooked book gets corrected by an honest auditor ...
When just one trampling of the inherent and inviolable " fairness " of government is rejected by an impartial judge ...
When just one wild - eyed partisan is stopped by the figure of blind justice ...
This President decides that he , and not the law , must prevail .
I accuse you , Mr. Bush , of lying this country into war .
I accuse you of fabricating in the minds of your own people , a false implied link between Saddam Hussein and 9/11 .
I accuse you of firing the generals who told you that the plans for Iraq were disastrously insufficient .
I accuse you of causing in Iraq the needless deaths of 3,586 of our brothers and sons , and sisters and daughters , and friends and neighbors .
I accuse you of subverting the Constitution , not in some misguided but sincerely - motivated struggle to combat terrorists , but instead to stifle dissent .
I accuse you of fomenting fear among your own people , of creating the very terror you claim to have fought .
I accuse you of exploiting that unreasoning fear , the natural fear of your own people who just want to live their lives in peace , as a political tool to slander your critics and libel your opponents .
I accuse you of handing part of this republic over to a Vice President who is without conscience , and letting him run roughshod over it .
And I accuse you now , Mr. Bush , of giving , through that Vice President , carte blanche to Mr. Libby , to help defame Ambassador Joseph Wilson by any means necessary , to lie to Grand Juries and Special Counsel and before a court , in order to protect the mechanisms and particulars of that defamation , with your guarantee that Libby would never see prison , and , in so doing , as Ambassador Wilson himself phrased it here last night , of you becoming an accessory to the obstruction of justice .
When President Nixon ordered the firing of the Watergate special prosecutor Archibald Cox during the infamous " Saturday Night Massacre " on October 20th , 1973 , Mr. Cox initially responded tersely , and ominously :
" Whether ours shall be a government of laws and not of men , is now for Congress , and ultimately , the American people . "
President Nixon did not understand how he had crystallized the issue of Watergate for the American people .
It had been about the obscure meaning behind an attempt to break in to a rival party 's headquarters ; and the labyrinthine effort to cover - up that break - in and the related crimes .
But in one night , Nixon transformed it .
Watergate -- instantaneously -- became a simpler issue : a President overruling the inexorable march of the law .
Of insisting -- in a way that resonated viscerally with millions who had not previously understood -- that he was the law .
Not the Constitution .
Not the Congress .
Not the Courts .
Just him .
Just - Mr. Bush - as you did , yesterday .
The twists and turns of Plame - Gate , your precise and intricate lies that sent us into this bottomless pit of Iraq ; your lies upon the lies to discredit Joe Wilson ; your lies upon the lies upon the lies to throw the sand at the " referee " of Prosecutor Fitzgerald 's analogy ... these are complex and often painful to follow , and too much , perhaps , for the average citizen .
But when other citizens render a verdict against your man , Mr. Bush -- and then you spit in the faces of those jurors and that judge and the judges who were yet to hear the appeal -- the average citizen understands that , sir .
It 's the fixed ballgame and the rigged casino and the pre-arranged lottery all rolled into one -- and it stinks .
And they know it .
Nixon 's mistake , the last and most fatal of them , the firing of Archibald Cox , was enough to cost him the presidency .
And in the end , even Richard Nixon could say he could not put this nation through an impeachment .
It was far too late for it to matter then , but as the decades unfold , that single final gesture of non-partisanship , of acknowledged responsibility not to self , not to party , not to " base , " but to country , echoes loudly into history .
Even Richard
Nixon knew it was time to resign
Would that you could say that , Mr. Bush .
And that you could say it for Mr. Cheney .
You both crossed the Rubicon yesterday .
Which one of you chose the route , no longer matters .
Which is the ventriloquist , and which the dummy , is irrelevant .
But that you have twisted the machinery of government into nothing more than a tawdry machine of politics , is the only fact that remains relevant .
It is nearly July 4th , Mr. Bush , the commemoration of the moment we Americans decided that rather than live under a King who made up the laws , or erased them , or ignored them -- or commuted the sentences of those rightly convicted under them -- we would force our independence , and regain our sacred freedoms .
We of this time -- and our leaders in Congress , of both parties -- must now live up to those standards which echo through our history :
Pressure , negotiate , impeach -- get you , Mr. Bush , and Mr. Cheney , two men who are now perilous to our Democracy , away from its helm .
And for you , Mr. Bush , and for Mr. Cheney , there is a lesser task .
You need merely achieve a very low threshold indeed .
Display just that iota of patriotism which Richard Nixon showed , on August 9th , 1974 .
Resign .
And give us someone -- anyone -- about whom all of us might yet be able to quote John Wayne , and say , " I did n't vote for him , but he 's my president , and I hope he does a good job . "
Good night , and good luck .
John Amato : I missed the last few seconds of the video ... And it looks like Bush bypassed the legal requirements fro a commutation ... Who 's surprised ?
How to Ignore Marketing and Become Irrelevant in Five Easy Steps
I have n't blogged in a while .
So much fun stuff going on !
You have no idea .
Fun !
This blog entry is a bit overdue , though , and my muse has n't visited me lately , so I 'll just wing it tonight and hope for the best .
OK .
So branding .
Yeah .
Branding .
A couple weeks ago , I gave a keynote talk at O'Reilly 's OSCON .
Nat Torkington , the world - famous co-author of the Perl Cookbook , was kind enough to invite me to be a keynote speaker .
I do n't know what he was smoking , but it must have been really good stuff .
I 'm still jealous .
But wait , it gets even better .
He had me scheduled at some godawful hour , like 9:45 am or something .
So I naturally assumed -- this being a programmer 's conference and all -- that I was essentially one of those crap garage bands that just barely make the cut for Bumbershoot and get slotted on Friday morning before anyone actually shows up .
Fine .
So I 'm filler .
I can live with that .
In any case I have n't been to Portland in a while ; maybe I can grab some of their famous oysters while I 'm there .
Nat wants a title for my talk .
Crap .
That means I have to commit to something .
Uh .
I 'm going to talk about ... ummm ... not sure .
He says he wants me to be funny .
Just like in Finding Nemo .
" You 're a clownfish !
Say something funny ! "
OK .
Funny .
Oh , and he wants it to be educational too .
Funny and educational .
Hm .
Like slamming your hand in the car door , I guess .
No , on second thought , that 's only funny years later , and only to other people , whereas Nat wants me to be funny , like , right there on stage .
Well , pretty much anything can be funny , as long as it happens to someone else .
Yeah .
Funny happens to other people .
So what 's happened lately to people I know ?
Let 's see ...
I 'd just gotten back from Foo Camp , after all that embarrassing Rails - clone hype ( -- I mean , jeez , it 's about a year premature ; thanks , John ! --) and I saw some interesting talks there .
Any material worth rehashing ?
Oooh , there was that Open Source Attack one .
Yeah , that one .
What was up with that ?
See , like , here 's the deal : Foo Camp is ... hot .
Damn hot .
O'Reilly 's headquarters are in Sebastopol , CA , which is like one stop from Hell 's Gates .
I mean , do n't get me wrong -- Foo Camp was really fun .
Tim O'Reilly is definitely one of the World 's Coolest People just for throwing a big free party and inviting people to come and partake of the free food and open bar and brilliant company .
Hell , it was almost like weekdays at Google .
But if I 'd known how hot it was going to be , I 'd have ...
I 'm not sure what I 'd have done , except maybe bring a pair of shorts and a bigger tent .
Oh , and maybe lost some weight ?
Possibly , possibly .
At any rate , it was hot there , and I was pretty miserable at least half the time , me being from Seattle and all .
I know .
Wuss .
So on the third day , I 'm wandering around , and all the sessions are dying down , but there 's one talk going in the ONLY room that apparently has some form of air conditioning on the ground floor .
It also has network access , so people are in there with their laptops .
Sounds good .
Maybe I can read mail .
So I 'm sitting there minding my own business when I suddenly find myself listening to a talk from the OSI folks called " The Attack on Open Source " .
If nothing else , it was reminiscent of Star Wars , so I listened in .
The gist of their talk is pretty simple : we forgot to trademark the term " Open Source " , blah blah BLAH ; Richard Stallman is n't the creator of Open Source , hah hah HAH ; companies are using our term to apply to closed - source software , wah wah WAH .
What can we do about it ?
Send letters .
That was their solution .
Have all the " real " open - source licensors " federate " ( a nice technical term for a riled - up , impotent mob ) and then send angry letters to offenders , and nice letters to non-offenders .
Or something along those lines .
Who 's up for it ?
Will you help us out ?
They passed around a little pledge - your - support sheet .
I put my name on it , since it seemed like the thing to do at the time .
Plus there were , like , actually cool people in the room , and having my name on the same sheet seemed like the thing to do .
Just in case that little sign - up sheet becomes the next millenium 's Declaration of Independence or something .
I wrote my name kinda big , so I could be , like , John Hancock , except without his overtly phallic name .
Someone at the talk suggested maybe making , like , a new name , one that could be trademarked and protected and stuff .
I forget who suggested it , but they were whipped like a mangy cur for the suggestion , and it died right there .
I almost did too , since the room was still pretty hot , and at Foo Camp when someone 's giving a talk that sucks , it 's kind of hard to escape politely .
Not that their talk sucked , mind you -- it was their conclusion that sucked -- but once you 've passed the 10 - minute mark you 're pretty much stuck until they stop talking .
Me ?
I was all for changing the name .
What the hell does Open Source mean , anyway ?
It seems like the term has been gradually deteriorating since the 1980s when people would release " shareware " , which soon became called " crippleware " , which of course pretty much killed it dead .
Crippleware .
Nasty name .
Nasty marketing tactic .
Brilliant , but nasty .
Shame , I guess .
I 'm not sure why the whole try - before - you - buy concept never made it in software .
Maybe for the same reason runtime - elevatable mountain bike seats never made it in the mountain biking circuit .
When you 're riding a mountain bike , you want the seat low for balance and high for power , so ideally you want it low going downhill and high going uphill .
So someone invented a seat that could change its height while you were riding , and how did it do ?
It failed miserably !
The pro riders took one look at it and said : " hey , nice seat .
I was thinking of getting one for my girlfriend . "
Ouch .
Like I 'm gonna buy one now .
Marketing .
It 's not the banner ads .
It 's what your friends are saying .
So , like , here I am , trying to think of a title for my OSCON talk , and I keep thinking about that " Attack on Open Source " Foo Camp discussion , and the poor sorry OSI folks who are fighting to keep their beach from eroding in the midst of history 's largest tsunami .
Or something .
I mean , if it 's not trademarked , and you can't protect it legally , and it 's just two vanilla words concatenated , then you 're screwed : evil companies can jump on the buzzwagon and say their stuff is " Open Source " , when it is , in fact , proprietary and you can't get the source code .
I mean , who 's to stop them ?
So that 's exactly what 's happening .
At least , so say the OSI folks , and I believe them .
Problem is , " Open Source " has no definition .
There was a certain amount of respectful sour - graping going on at this Foo Camp talk I was at , because ( as they pointed out quite sour - grapey - respectfully ) , Richard Stallman did a bang - up outstanding job of defining what " Free Software " actually means from a philosophical and legal perspective .
It might not be exactly what the OSI folks want , but it 's clear as day .
" Open Source " , on the other hand , means ... uh , it means you take this betrothed , er , beloved ... uh , source ... damn .
It 's like trying to remember the Ten Commandments .
Thou Shalt Not Leave Foo Camp Talks Halfway Through , Lest Thee Not Be Invited Back .
That 's roughly when some random synapse or other fired and reminded me of a book my friends Jacob Gabrielson and Jeff Peterson had been waving in my face about 15 years ago , called The 22 Immutable Laws of Branding .
I do n't know why , but it just popped into my head .
See , they ( the OSI folks , that is ) were breaking not just one , but several of those Immutable Laws .
I 'd read the book one time , fifteen years prior , but you can't fool me : I know what immutable means .
It means you can't mute it .
These laws were just screaming not to be broken .
So I decided , then and there , with me not knowing Jack Squat about marketing , to do my OSCON presentation on marketing .
Yeah .
Well , I knew more about it than YOU do , because I 've read exactly one marketing book , and you 've read exactly zero .
Right ?
( People : when I say " you " , I 'm using the collective " you " , which if " you " will recall , means some fuzzy statistical aggregate .
So please , if " you " want to email " me " about how " you " have actually read TWO marketing books , I would appreciate it if " you " would just keep that wonderful factoid to " your " self .
Thanks ! )
OK , great .
What title to use ?
I 'll be honest .
I confess .
My original title , funny as it was , was not as funny as my beta - tested replacement .
See , I sent Nat the proposed title .
That summed it up pretty well , and the Five Easy Steps part gave me some wiggle room about what specific sub - topics I 'd talk about .
I had no idea what they were , but I needed some Wiggle Room , by which I mean Procrastination Material .
Later , I was driving to Foo Camp ( from the nearest airport , which is conveniently located six hundred miles away ) with my buddy Greg Linden , telling him about my talk - title dilemma , and as I was saying it , it dawned on me that I really needed to make it two easy steps .
If I have to explain why it 's funnier , well , just take my word for it .
It is .
Greg laughed and laughed , and after we had established that he was n't laughing at , say , something funny he'd just thought of , or at a sign we 'd just passed , or my haircut or something , I decided : hey , that 's my new talk title .
So I mailed Nat and Vee and begged them to change it .
And they did !
Now you know how I came up with such a wacky idea for a keynote talk .
The rest is history .
I went to the conference , along with some three thousand other geeks .
It was fun .
I loved Larry Wall 's late - evening talk on Perl 6 .
He 's quite the entertaining speaker .
I even got a chance to talk to him that night at some party we were both invited to .
I was embarrassed , for reasons you Perl folks will likely understand without explanation .
I apologized .
He graciously said it was no big deal .
( Thanks , Larry .
I can die in peace now .
Or someday far from now , preferably . ) I showed up late to my talk , since , hey , I was the crap garage band , remember ?
Whoops .
It turns out Nat had me scheduled LAST .
There were like four or five keynote speakers before me .
Imagine that !
Tim O'Reilly managed to get three thousand programmers to wake up at 7 am .
There must have been some sort of measurable blip on our GNP over the next week .
So I show up with my laptop on Thursday at about 9:00 am , and I walk up to the registration booth hoping I can sneak in without a ticket .
I tell them I 'm a keynote speaker , and ask where I 'm supposed to go .
People start talking into hidden microphones .
" Mr. Yegge is here . "
I look around for my dad , and realize they 're talking about me .
A sharp - dressed dude at the registration booth stands up to take me to who - knows - where .
He walks past me , stops , looks me up and down with the exact same expression the restaurant waiters in Paris used on me , and he says ... ( I 'm not making this up , by the way ... )
" I see you have more of a sense of STYLE than MOST of the people here !
" I laugh uproariously .
Wow .
All I can say in my defense is : it was n't a high bar .
Then he turns on his heel , marches me up to the second floor , and never once looks at me again .
Without looking my way , he marches me through a big crowd that 's listening to the current keynote speaker , some economist who 's ending his talk with " so you all SUCK , and you 're all ASSHOLES too " , or something along those lines .
I 'm not really 100 % listening , but that 's sure what it sounds like .
Note to self : be nice to crowd .
The Style Guy , without looking at me , walks me right past the front row , past the black - velvet - clothed stage and giant blue screens ( of death , as it turns out ) , and right past the curtain in the back .
We go through this weird back - alley hallway reminiscent of the movie Jacob 's Ladder .
The hospital scene .
Yeah , that one .
I start to get kinda nervous .
I 'd made some slides the night before , but this seems a bit more , um , serious than I 'd originally imagined it .
We sneak through another door , and suddenly I 'm behind the stage .
There are two technicians there , and Parisian - Waiter Style Guy hands me off to them .
They whisper at me : " do you have slides ? "
Yes .
" What kinda computer ? " Mac . " Good !
We 'll set you up ! " Yeah .
Some other tech materializes with a microphone and they hook me up .
I accidentally start to straighten up ( I 've been stooping ) , and they all gesture violently at me for me to start stooping again , because if I stand up straight my head gets in the way of the rear projector and everyone in the crowd can see me .
Yikes .
What if the microphone 's already on ?
Oh no , what if I fart ?
Did I fart ?
I 'm not sure .
It 's certainly possible , in theory .
I 'm not accustomed to this show - business stuff .
They hook me up and tell me to bring my laptop to the podium when my talk starts , and then they tell me to go wait in the front row .
On my way out of the weird , tiny little behind - the - stage AV room , they hand me a dongle that says " I stole this " or something like that .
It 's a Mac DVI connector .
They say I need to bring it with me .
OK .
So I sneak out the door and back around the curtain , ducking , and practically crawl to the front row .
I sit down .
The economist finishes reviling the crowd , leaves in a smattering of tentative applause , and some Microsoft dude comes up to talk about how great Microsoft 's open - source contributions are .
That one goes pretty fast .
Suddenly I notice a technician - type dude sneaking up to me .
He whispers that my microphone is n't set up right , and he changes it for me .
Hey , he 's a tech .
He could have said my pilfer grommit was n't connected to my weasel pin , and I 'd believe him .
He fiddles with the thing clipped to my shirt .
After sufficient fiddling , as defined by him , he leaves .
The next guy is from Sweden ( I think ) , and he 's talking about the Pirate Party .
It 's a great talk .
Not only is he a good speaker with a compelling , well - written presentation , but the material itself is also fascinating .
People in the crowd start to pay attention .
I'm not sure when I 'm up , but I see Nat get up there in his shorts and Hawaiian shirt , and he starts talking about the next speaker .
To be safe , I assume it 's me , and I look for my dongle .
Oh god , my dongle is gone .
I swear , I had it before that sneaky technician showed up , and now it 's gone .
Nat talks on , blah blah blah , and I 'm digging frantically through my backpack .
Nothing .
It 's gone .
The technician must have grabbed it inadvertently on his way out .
I vow silently to get up earlier next time .
Nat finishes his preamble , which by the way is brilliant in its simultaneous hopefulness and not - my - fault - if - he - sucks hedging , and it 's time for me to stride confidently up to the stage .
Without my dongle .
I get to the podium , shake hands or something , and a technician materializes with a dongle .
I give him my laptop and hope for the best .
Nat leaves .
A thousand people are looking at me and the technician expectantly .
My slides are n't working .
Cool .
So what would YOU do ?
Here 's what I did : http://blip.tv/file/319044/
Tune in next week for the exciting conclusion of " Hey , you 're a Clownfish !
Say Something Funny !
" I can't wait . :)
Rising mortgage delinquencies are likely to be followed by rising consumer bankruptcies and , with them , the first big test of the federal bankruptcy reform law of 2005 .
Early indications are that low - to middle - income borrowers will be unduly punished .
The new law ’s expensive and cumbersome requirements have already discouraged some hard - pressed homeowners from seeking bankruptcy - court protection , even in the face of dire circumstances such as spiking monthly payments coupled with job loss or medical expenses .
Of the debtors who do enter bankruptcy proceedings , many are required to restructure their debts  negotiating with lenders to lower loan balances and stretch out repayments  rather than being allowed to liquidate them .
But here ’s the trap :
The restructuring process , known as Chapter 13 , prohibits the bankruptcy court from modifying the repayment terms of most mortgages on a primary home .
So even under a restructuring plan , bankrupt homeowners must still repay their mortgages in full or lose their homes .
That lender protection is a holdover from 30 years ago , when mortgage bankers required ample downpayments and most home loans had fixed interest rates .
Because lenders were conservative and stuck to uncomplicated loans , they were shielded from having to take a hit when homeowners filed for bankruptcy .
EVERY year , the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics awards prizes for the best papers presented at its annual conference .
Last year ’s winner in the nuclear and future flight category went to a paper calling for experimental tests of an astonishing new type of engine .
According to the paper , this hyperdrive motor would propel a craft through another dimension at enormous speeds .
It could leave Earth at lunchtime and get to the moon in time for dinner .
There ’s just one catch : the idea relies on an obscure and largely unrecognised kind of physics .
Can they possibly be serious ?
The AIAA is certainly not embarrassed .
What ’s more , the US military has begun to cast its eyes over the hyperdrive concept , and a space propulsion researcher at the US Department of Energy ’s Sandia National Laboratories has said he would be interested in putting the idea to the test .
And despite the bafflement of most physicists at the theory that supposedly underpins it , Pavlos Mikellides , an aerospace engineer at the Arizona State University in Tempe who reviewed the winning paper , stands by the committee ’s choice .
“ Even though such features have been explored before , this particular approach is quite unique , ” he says .
Unique it certainly is .
If the experiment gets the go - ahead and works , it could reveal new interactions between the fundamental forces of nature that would change the future of space travel .
Forget spending six months or more holed up in a rocket on the way to Mars , a round trip on the hyperdrive could take as little as 5 hours .

Below is a rare picture of Hitler briefing his top brass .
For years they claimed to know nothing about the Holocaust .
But now extraordinary secret recordings - made by the British - explode that myth for ever ...
During the latter half of World War II , the British Secret Intelligence Service ( SIS ) undertook a massive clandestine operation of which the full , extraordinary details are only now coming to light .
Between 1942 and 1945 , a section of SIS - known as MI19 - secretly recorded no fewer than 64,427 conversations between captured German generals and other senior officers , all without their knowledge or even suspicion .
The 167 most significant of these are about to be published for the first time .
Together , they provide us with a goldmine of information about what the German High Command privately thought of the war , Adolf Hitler , the Nazis and each other .
Scroll down for more ...
They also explode the post - war claim of the Wehrmacht that they did not know what the SS were doing to the Jews , Slavs , mentally disabled and others among what they termed " untermensch " ( sub- humans ) .
The Combined Services Detailed Interrogation Centre ( CSDIC ) was based in Trent Park , a magnificent estate once owned by the Sassoon family , near Cockfosters in North London .
It was here that German senior officers were brought for internment once they were captured .
Then a huge top - secret operation swung into play , involving several hundred recording technicians , stenographers , transcribers and interpreters , not to mention stool - pigeons and agents provocateurs whose job it was to stimulate conversations between German generals , brigadiers and colonels .
A number of ruses were employed to encourage the Germans to speak to one another in one of the 12 rooms in the common areas of the house that were wired for sound .
Luftwaffe commanders were mixed with Wehrmacht generals ; newspapers and radios were used to pass on snippets of news from the front .
Occasionally , Lord Aberfaldy - a CSDIC agent posing as a welfare officer - would simply bring up subjects that might provoke debate once he had left the room .
The astonishing success of the operation can be measured in the sheer number - and the extreme candour - of the conversations that ensued .
To read the transcripts today is to be reminded of some of the worst horrors of World War II .
Of course , British Intelligence wanted above all to discover operational secrets by eavesdropping on their captives recognising that this method might yield results that direct , face - to - face interrogations would not .
But they also heard evidence of sustained mass atrocities , especially on the Eastern Front .
Attempts to suggest that genocide was solely the responsibility of the SS and Nazi fanatics , and not widespread across the whole Wehrmacht , completely collapse before the evidence of these recordings .
Although most of the generals at Trent Park were captured in North Africa , Italy and France , it is clear they knew perfectly well what was happening throughout the Third Reich and its occupied territories .
Scroll down for more ...
Between 1939 and 1945 , no fewer than 10,191 German and 567 Italian prisoners passed through Trent Park and its two related POW listening centres .
Some of the conversations , originally recorded on gramophone discs , are only half a page in length ; the longest is 22 pages .
Even General Dietrich von Choltitz - who has had the reputation of being a " good " German ever since he refused to carry out Hitler 's orders to destroy Paris - is implicated by these transcripts of killing Jews in the Crimea in 1941 and 1942 .
None of the generals had the slightest idea that they were being listened to .
And it is only now that we can read verbatim what they actually said to one another , giving us an intimate glimpse into the mind of the German High Command as it dawned on them that they were likely to lose the war .
Several of these officers wrote to Churchill towards the end of the war , offering a " renewal " of Germany " in the spirit of Western Christianity " , but the transcripts expose their hypocrisy .
Another example of this was their criticism of Field Marshal Friedrich von Paulus for surrendering Stalingrad - for if they themselves had not all surrendered , they would not have been at Trent Park .
Some of the generals were genuine anti-Nazis , and were delighted when one of their number , Count Claus von Stauffenberg , attempted to assassinate Hitler on July 20 , 1944 , because they believed that his glorious failure would save the honour of the Wehrmacht officer corps .
The contempt that Von Choltitz had for the arch - Nazi General Reinecke , who had helped condemn Stauffenberg after the plot was discovered , is palpable : " Such a common commercial traveller , such a vulgar horrible fellow ! "
Yet these unguarded , seemingly - private conversations do not protect the honour of the German officer corps , since it is obvious that almost all of them knew of the Holocaust , right to the top of the High Command .
General Von Thoma , who commanded a panzer division in Russia before being captured at El Alamein , told the pro-Nazi General Ludwig Cruwell in January 1943 : " I am actually ashamed to be an officer . "
He related how he had spoken to the Army Chief of Staff , General Franz Halder , about the atrocities , only to be told : " That 's a political matter , that 's nothing to do with me . "
So he put his protests in writing to Army commanderin - chief General Walther von Brauchitz , who said : " Do you want me to take it further ?
If you want me to take it further , anything might happen . "
Thoma said of those who believed the Fuhrer was ignorant of what was happening : " Of course , he knows all about it .
Secretly , he 's delighted .
Of course , people can't make a row - they would simply be arrested and beaten if they did . "
The kind of things that were happening to Poles , Russians and especially Jews were common currency in the ' private ' conversations at Trent Park .
In December 1944 , Generalleutnant Heinrich Kittel , commander of 462 Volksgrenadier division , told General - major Paul von Felbert , commandant of Feldkommandantur 560 : " The things I 've experienced !
In Latvia , near Dvinsk , there were mass executions of Jews carried out by the SS .
" There were about 15 SS men and perhaps 60 Latvians , known to be the most brutal people in the world .
I was lying in bed one Sunday morning when I kept hearing two salvos followed by small - arms fire . "
On investigating , Kittel found " men , women and children - they were counted off and stripped naked .
The executioners first laid all the clothes in one pile .
Then 20 women had to take up their position - naked - on the edge of the trench .
They were shot and fell down into it . "
" How was it done ? " asked Felbert .
" They faced the trench , " Kittel replied .
" And then 20 Latvians came up behind and simply fired once through the back of their heads , and they fell down forwards into the trench like ninepins . "
Kittel gave an order forbidding such executions from taking place " outside , where people can look on .
If you shoot people in the wood or somewhere where no one can see , " he told the SS men , " that 's your own affair .
But I absolutely forbid another day 's shooting here .
We draw our drinking water from deep springs ; we 're getting nothing but corpse water there . "
" What did they do to the children ? " asked Felbert .
Kittel - who sounded " very excited " at this point , according to the transcriber - answered : " They seized three - year - old children by the hair , held them up and shot them with a pistol and then threw them in .
I saw that for myself .
One could watch it . "
Another general , General - leutnant Hans Schaeffer , commander of the 244 Infantry division , asked Kittel : " Did they weep ?
Have the people any idea what 's in store for them ? "
" They know perfectly well , " replied Kittel .
" They are apathetic .
I 'm not sensitive myself , but such things turn my stomach . "
Later on , however , Kittel mused : " If one were to destroy all the Jews of the world simultaneously , there would n't remain a single accuser , " and " Those Jews are the pest of the east ! "
" What happened to the young , pretty girls ? " asked Felbert , when the subject turned to concentration camps .
" Were they formed into a harem ? "
" I did n't bother about that , " Kittel answered .
" I only found that they did become more reasonable .
The women question is a very shady chapter .
You 've no idea what mean and stupid things are done . "
In another conversation later that same day , Kittel told Schaefer about Auschwitz : " In Upper Silesia , they simply slaughtered the people systematically .
They were gassed in a big hall .
There 's the greatest secrecy about all those things . "
Later still , he said : " I 'm going to hold my tongue about what I do know of these things . "
He little suspected that his every word was being recorded , transcribed and translated .
The following February , General major Johannes Bruhn , Commander of the 533 Volksgrenadier Division , discussed the Holocaust with Felbert , saying : " I must assume , after all I have read about the Fuhrer , that he knew all about it . "
" Of course he knew all about it , " replied Felbert .
" He 's the man who is responsible .
He even discussed it with Himmler . "
" Yes , " said Bruhn .
" That man does n't care a hoot if your relatives are annihilated . "
" That man does n't care a damn , " agreed Felbert .
The following month , Bruhn - one of the few generals to emerge with credit from these conversations - said he believed that Germany did not deserve victory any longer , " after the amount of human blood we 've shed knowingly and as a result of our delusions and blood lust .
We 've deserved our fate . "
In reply , General - leutnant Fritz von Broich said : " We shot women as if they had been cattle .
There was a large quarry where 10,000 men , women and children were shot .
They were still lying in the quarry .
We drove out on purpose to see it .
It was the most bestial thing I ever saw . "
It was then that General von Choltitz , the " saviour " of Paris , spoke of the time he was in the Crimea and was told by the CO of the airfield from where he was flying : " Good Lord , I 'm not supposed to tell , but they 've been shooting Jews here for days now . "
Choltitz estimated that 36,000 Jews from Sebastapol alone were shot .
" Let me tell you , " General Count Edwin von Rothkirch und Trach told General Bernhard Ramcke on March 13 , 1945 , " the gassings are by no means the worst . "
" What happened ? " asked Ramke .
" To start with , people dug their own graves , then the firing squad arrived with tommy - guns and shot them down .
Many of them were n't dead , and a layer of earth was shovelled in between .
They had packers there who packed the bodies in , because they fell in too soon .
The SS did that .
" I knew an SS leader there quite well , and he said : ' Would you like to photograph a shooting ?
They are always shot in the morning - but if you like , we still have some and we can shoot them in the afternoon sometime . ' "
Three days later , at Trent Park , Colonel Dr Friedrich Von der Heydte told Colonel Eberhard Wildermuth about the Theresienstadt concentration camp in Czechoslovakia : " Half a million people have been put to death there for certain .
I know that all the Jews from Bavaria were taken there .
Yet the camp never became over - crowded .
They gassed mental defectives , too . "
" Yes , I know , " replied Wildermuth .
" I got to know that for a fact in the case of Nuremberg - my brother is a doctor at an institution there .
The people knew where they were being taken . "
" We must uphold the principle of only having carried out orders , " suggested General - leutnant Ferdinand Heim .
" We must stick to that principle if we are to create a more or less effective defence . "
As the war progressed , the Trent Park internees divided between Nazis and anti-Nazis .
Some of the Nazis ' fanaticism was undimmed by the way the war was going .
" What do I care about Good Friday ? " asked General - major Wilhelm Ullersperger , who had been captured during the Ardennes offensive in the last days of 1944 .
" Because a filthy Jew was hanged umpteen years ago ? "
General - major Walther Bruns recalled the attitude of the members of the firing squad who killed thousands of Jews in Riga : " All those cynical remarks !
If only I had seen those tommy - gunners , who were relieved every hour because of over - exertion , carry out their task with distaste , but not with nasty remarks like : ' Here comes a Jewish beauty ! '
" I can still see it all in my memory - a pretty woman in a flame - coloured chemise .
Talk about keeping the race pure .
At Riga , they first slept with them and then shot them to prevent them from talking . "
Meanwhile , Colonel Erwin Josting of the Luftwaffe recalled an Austrian friend being asked by a lieutenant : " Would you like to watch ?
An amusing show is going on down here ; umpteen Jews are being killed off . "
Josting continued : " The barn was full of women and children .
Petrol was poured over them and they were burned alive .
You can't imagine what their screams were like . "
After the publication of this extraordinary , horrific but compelling collection of secretly - recorded conversations , the alibi of the German High Command - that they did not know what the SS were up to , and anyhow they were , as Heim put it , " only carrying out orders " - is shown to be demonstrably false .
To make it all the more powerful , the evidence for this comes not from the prosecution , or from " victors ' justice " as it is sometimes accused of being .
Instead , out of their own mouths , they are condemned before the bar of history .

Our goal , then , should be to drive the price of condoms below zero , by rewarding people who use them .
In other words , we should pay a bounty for used condoms .
The best of all possible bounties would be one that is more valuable to abstemious Martins than to promiscuous Maxwells .
With that in mind , the journalist Oliver Morton has made the marvelous suggestion that if at least some abstemiousness is due to shyness and the inability to find partners ( while the promiscuous have relatively little trouble in this regard ) , then the answer might be to establish a government - funded dating service : bring us a used condom and we 'll get you a date .
The entire problem - along with the entire case for subsidies - would vanish if our sexual pasts could somehow be made visible , so that future partners could reward past prudence and thereby provide appropriate incentives .
Perhaps technology can ultimately make that solution feasible .
( I imagine the pornography of the future : " Her skirt slid to the floor and his gaze came to rest on her thigh , where the imbedded monitor read ' This site has been accessed 314 times . ' " )
Or , as one of my Slate readers suggested , we could have an online service to record negative HIV test results .
You 'd type in your prospective partner 's name and get a response like " Last negative test result 7/4/2006 . "
Or , to protect privacy , you 'd type in not a name but an ID number provided by the partner .
Your screen could show both a test result and a photo to avoid fake IDs .
This strikes me as such a good idea that I can't figure out why nobody 's doing it yet .
Until then , the best we can probably do is to make condoms inexpensive - and get ride of those subway ads .
Addendum
In 1996 , Slate magazine published an abbreviated version of this chapter that generated hundreds of email responses .
Quite a few of those responses were both thoughtful and interesting , and helped me to improve the presentation you 've just read .
Others contained nothing but a line or two of invective .
To those , I usually responded with a short note that read " I 'm sorry , but from the email you sent me I was not able to ascertain at exactly which point you stopped following the argument .
If you can be more precise about where you got lost , I 'll do my best to make it clearer . "
In a remarkable number of cases , I got responses that were both thoughtful and apologetic , and a few of those led to multiround correspondences that taught me something .
Other readers seemed bound and determined to miss the point by miles .
One , brandishing his credentials as a medical doctor , termed the column " particularly unfortunate " and - in a letter that was published in a subsequent issue of Slate - explained why :
" We are at a stage in the HIV epidemic in which heterosexual spread is becoming increasingly significant .
Casual readers ... may justify increasing their sexual - risk - taking behavior .
Unfortunately , failure , lasting in a shortened lifetime , can result from a sexually successful one - night stand .
For an appropriate sequel , the editor of Slate might solicit an article ... defending Russian roulette as statistically OK but cautioning that three loaded chambers is too risky . "
One of the great discoveries of 19th century economics was the principle of comparative advantage , according to which people are most successful when they stick to the things they 're good at .
( It 's actually quite a bit subtler than that , but this oversimplified version suffices for the application I 'm about to make . )
The principle of comparative advantage explains why some people become medical doctors , while other , different , people go into fields ( such as economics ) that require at least a minimal ability to reason logically .
More Nihon nonsense !
Today was the Kanamara festival in Kawasaki city , which basically involves a lot people parading a giant pink penis around the town .
Otherwise known as the “ big metal penis festival , ” the event is traditionally a celebration of fertility .
Among those in attendance were couples hoping for children , bemused locals , and a fair few transvestites .

Below are some photos I took at the event a couple of years ago .

You went out tonight and had yet another dismal failure .
The best thing that can be said about this date is that at least it was mercifully short , so thankfully she did n't have to put up with you for too long .
It 's not that you 're a bad dude .
You 're funny , smart , caring , and ( to my male heterosexual eye ) not that bad looking of a dude .
The problem , roommate , is that you 're just a fucking idiot when it comes to dating .
I 've had to watch this sad charade for over a year now , and I 've had to listen to your sob stories , this constant recounting of how you can't find a nice girl to get into a relationship with .
I understand ; dating is hard .
I 'm no magician myself and do n't claim to be the all - knowing expert of wooing the opposite sex .
I 've tried to help you , but you wo n't listen .
Now I 'm on Craigslist because I just can't stand it anymore .
Roommate , please pull your head out of your ass .
Here are ways you constantly fuck up .
Fix these , and maybe , just maybe , you 'll meet that nice girl you 're looking for .
1. BE ON TIME .
You fucking asshole , you are always late .
ALWAYS .
This is n't a big deal when you 're just meeting up with me or your friends for beers at the bar , but it 's goddamn rude when it 's a girl that you 're trying to impress , especially on the first date .
The message you are sending is that you were doing something more important than making sure that you were on time for your date .
As you get to know her better , maybe this can become one of your cute little " quirks , " but being late right off the bat makes you look like a fucking dickhead .
2. IRON YOUR GODDAMN SHIRT !
You walk out of the house looking like you just pulled your shirt out of the bottom of the hamper .
Come to think of it , maybe you did .
But dude , you look like fucking hell leaving with all of those wrinkles .
Whether you want to admit it or not , she 's going to notice .
If you show up looking like crap ( and late on top of it , fucko ) , again you 're sending the message that you just do n't care that much about trying to make a good impression with her .
Take a look at your date -- unless you 're going out with the neighborhood crack whore , have you noticed that she probably spent more than 5 minutes getting ready ?
If you want her to look good for you , it 's only fair that you look good for her , you inconsiderate bastard .
3. SHAVE .
Just fucking shave .
Your 2 - day growth does n't make you look like a dashing rogue .
It makes you look like a slovenly bastard .
Also , I want you to try an experiment : go to the Home Depot down the street .
By some # 2 sandpaper .
Take it out of the box , and grasp it with the palm of your hand , positioning your arm at approximately a 45 - degree angle .
NOW RUB IT ALL OVER YOUR FUCKING FACE AND SEE HOW MUCH IT HURTS .
Does n't feel too good , does it you stupid son of a bitch ?
That 's exactly what your face feels like to her if , heaven forbid , you actually kiss her .
Now , some girls like the feel of an unshaved face .
Shit , some girls like to be choked while you fuck them in the ass and pretend that she 's an underage ballerina and you 're Superman .
But that does n't mean you should show up to your first couple of dates with a gag ball , an industrial - size tube of K-Y , and a goddamn cape .
Play the percentages : shave until she tells you otherwise .
Asshole .4 . PAY ATTENTION TO THE CONVERSATION .
You always complain about uncomfortable silences .
Well , dickhead , what is it that you 're talking about that leads to silence ?
You 're doing one of two thing : ( 1 ) Talking about stuff that 's boring as hell to most people , that could lead to potential conflicts , or that makes her feel uneasy ( topics in this category include : work , politics , sports , religion and sex ) .
If you get into a relationship , you might have long discussions about any of these topics .
That 's cool , that 's healthy .
But whipping that stuff out on the first date is most likely going to be a conversation killer ; or , ( 2 ) You 're talking about yourself .
You tend to do that a lot .
Shut the fuck up .
It 's about her , not you .
Keep the conversation going by asking her follow - up questions and offering selective tidbits about yourself .
That way , she feels like not only are you interested in her , but also she 's learning about you .
It does n't matter what questions you ask her , just keep her talking .
AND FUCKING LISTEN .
Do n't go on auto - pilot -- she 'll pick up on the fact that you 're not really listening to her right away .
5. SHOW SOME CHIVALRY .
Open doors .
Offer to pay for the bill ( but do n't force it -- she might feel more comfortable splitting the bill with you , because then she wo n't feel like you 're " expecting something " as a reward ) .
Be nice to the waitress .
Do n't look at ANY OTHER WOMEN , no matter how hot they are .
As soon as you check out some other girl 's ass , you 're done .
Save that shit for when we 're out at the bar getting drunk .
Until then , focus on your date .
Flatter her .
This is something we do n't do well in our culture , but find a way to compliment her without coming off like an asshole .
Find something you genuinely like about her ( her outfit , necklace , shoes , whatever ) and tell her .
Stay away from the following areas , though : Boobs , lips , legs , ass , and just bascially her body in general .
Do n't come off as a perv .6 .
MANAGE YOUR EXPECTATIONS .
Dude , she 's not going to fuck you on the first date .
It 's just not going to happen ... and the girl who DOES fuck you on the first date is n't a girl you want to get into a relationship with .
If she 's fucking you on the first date , how many other guys do you think she 's sleeping with ?
You 're not that good looking , charming , or rich .
YOUR ENTIRE GOAL FOR THE FIRST DATE IS TO GET A SECOND DATE .
That is the only way you should measure success .
If you get a kiss after the first date , that 's great ... but the lack of a kiss does n't mean shit .
And guess what ?
Your entire goal for the second date is to get the third date .
It 's ok to ratchet up the physical flirting as the number of your dates increases , but as soon as she feels you trying to sniff out her cooter , you 're done unless she already wants to swallow your Special Swimmers .
That 's all I 've got for right now .
I hope you read this .
I hope you meet a girl who you can have a good relationship with .
I also hope you fucking quit whining about it to me .
Oh , and I need the fucking rent .
Asshole .
Fast Food Items Highest In Trans Fat - The 88 Least Healthy Foods
One of the absolute worst ingredients your food could possibly contain is trans fat .
Maybe you 've heard of it ?
If not , here 's a quick run down of some of the horrible things that studies have shown may be caused by a diet high in trans fat :
Coronary Heart Disease ( Raise bad cholesterol AND lower good cholesterol )
Stroke
Diabetes
There then exists some ( albeit less ) evidence that trans fat may also cause :
Cancer
Obesity
Liver Dysfunction
Infertility
Like I said , it 's one of the worst ingredients your food can contain .
And , guess what ?
Fast food is pretty much the most common place you 'll find this evil type of fat .
Fast food is also the place you 'll find the highest amounts of it .
Knowing this , I looked over the nutrition facts of literally every single item from the menus of McDonald's , Burger King , KFC , A&W , Arby's , Hardee 's , In - N - Out Burger , Jack in the Box , Little Caesars , Papa John's , Pizza Hut , Domino's , Sonic , Subway , Taco Bell , Wendy's , White Castle , Popeyes , Del Taco , Carl 's Jr. , and Dairy Queen to put together a list of the 88 fast food items highest in trans fat .
Keeping in mind just how terrible trans fat is and all of the terrible things it can cause , I have given this the very catchy nickname of " The 88 Fast Food Items Most Likely To Kill You . "
When you look over this list with the understanding that you should be eating 0 grams of trans fat per day , you 'll realize that my little nickname really is n't that much of an overstatement .

* NOTE *
The above list shows every fast food item that contained 4 or more grams of trans fat per serving .
There were TONS of items that contained less than 4 grams ( anywhere from 0.5 to 3.5 ) but I decided on 4 grams as the cut off point for the WORST 88 foods .
3.5 grams of trans fat is still terrible , but the above 88 are the worst of the worst .

Trans Fat FAQ
How much trans fat are we supposed to eat per day ?
The American Heart Association recommends a maximum of no more than 2 grams of trans fat per day .
Not per meal or per food , but per day total .
And , get this .
They also say that there is enough naturally occurring trans fats in some meat and dairy products that most people already reach this maximum 2 grams without the additional consumption of the industrially manufactured trans fats contained in the foods on the above list .
So , to sum up , if you care at all about your health and enjoy being alive , you should be eating 0 grams of trans fat per day .
So does this mean we should never eat fast food ever ?
In a perfect world , pretty much .
I mean , you know it 's junk .
Besides trans fat , there 's the always fun stuff like saturated fat , calories , and sodium to also think about .
It really is the type of food that should never be eaten ... ever .
Sure , there are some better choices you can be making at these types of restaurants .
And , if you 're going to eat this stuff , you should definitely be making those choices .

Google has been getting personal with its users
In a statement , 23andMe said Google , which invested $ 3.9 m ( £ 1.97 m ) , was one of a number of firms that had taken stakes in the company .
It was set up by Anne Wojcicki , who married Google co-founder Sergey Brin earlier this month .
23andMe aims to help consumers understand more about their genetic make - up , such as inherited traits .
Genentech , New Enterprise Associates and MDV - Mohr Davidow Ventures were among the other companies that took stakes in the company .
" Achieving this significant funding milestone enables us to move forward with our core mission of connecting people with their genetic information , " said 23 andMe fellow co-founder Linda Avey .
Getting personal
According to a report in the Financial Times , chief executive Eric Schmidt said Google believes personal information will be one of the firm 's key avenues of future expansion .
" The algorithms will get better and we will get better at personalisation , " he was quoted as saying .
" The goal is to enable Google users to be able to ask the question such as ' What shall I do tomorrow ? ' and ' What job shall I take ? ' "
The group recently relaunched its iGoogle service which allows users to publish their own content on a personalised Google homepage .
News of the investment comes a month after Google bought web advertising network Doubleclick in a $ 3.1 bn ( £ 1.6 bn ) deal .
WHO , WHAT , WHY ?
The Magazine answers ...
Most of us have tried stone skimming - a game sometimes known as Ducks and Drakes - on the beach or by a river .
We might have been pleased with several consecutive bounces ... but 51 times seems impossible .
That 's what 43 - year - old engineer Russell Byars managed on the Allegheny River , near Pittsburgh , in the US .
Luckily , he is happy to share his technique .
Speaking to the BBC , he promises that by following the rules , even the most novice skimmer could achieve an impressive 15 - 20 bounces or more .
1 : Pick flat , oval , palm - sized stones .
Use forefinger and thumb to spin 2 : Throw the stone fast and flat 3 : Stone should strike water at an angle between 10 - 20 degrees
" I always pick out a spot ahead of me on the water where I want the first bounce to be .
Then I sort of push the stone at the water when I throw it down , " he says .
But he confesses himself baffled by some aspects of his throwing technique .
" I have to say I 've watched the video of my throw and I see that I kind of whip the stone and throw it so it looks like I 'm throwing it underhand .
" I have to be honest with you though - I do n't really know how I do that . "
Some of the mystery can be explained by the science - of which there is a surprising amount - into the art of stone skimming .
The size and shape of the stone is key : some people believe it needs to be oval and quite big - about the size of your palm .
This is heavy enough to be immune to breezes and turbulence , but light enough to be thrown with accuracy .
Water drag
The texture of the pebble surface is important too but here the experts are divided : some say that the stone needs to be as smooth as possible in order to skip unencumbered across the water .
Others , like French physicist Lyderic Bocquet of Lyon University , say lots of small pits on the stone surface will reduce water drag in the same way that the dimpling on a golf ball reduces air drag .
Professor Bocquet and his fellow researcher Professor Christophe Clanet from the Institute of Research on Non-Equilibrium Phenomenon in Marseille have sought to deconstruct the serious physics underlying a simple game .
WHO , WHAT , WHY ?
A regular part of the BBC News Magazine , Who , What , Why ?
aims to answer some of the questions behind the headlines
In an article entitled " The mystery of the skipping stone " they answer questions such as why does a stone skip at all ; how many skips can it perform ; and how can the number of skips be maximised .
Using a specially designed catapult , the scientists shot aluminium disks across a pool of water and then filmed the splashes with a high - speed video camera .
After analysing the results , they discovered the optimum speed and angle a stone - thrower would have to attain in order to achieve the perfect skim .
Just why a stone bounces on water is , according to the professors , " easy to identify " .
It 's all down to the conservation of momentum principle , which dictates that as the stone enters the water and pushes some of it downwards , the stone is , in turn , forced upwards .
However , the stone needs to be moving at a certain speed - at least one kilometre an hour - otherwise the stone " surfs " on the water for a short distance , and then sinks .
Spinning the stone is also important - the " gyroscopic effect " ensures stability .
To remain stable , the stone must rotate with a certain minimum rotational velocity - at least once during its " collision time " .
Optimum angle
As " Rock Bottom " already knows , the angle of the throw is crucial .
The professors estimate the optimum angle at which the stone should enter the water to be between 10 and 20 degrees .
Old school : Sting practises the legs - bent technique
He 's very aware that for that record - breaking skim , there 's a need for speed - the faster the better .
Using his research Professor Bocquet has worked out how fast Russell might be throwing his stone .
" Although I do n't know anything about the conditions of this throw , my rough estimate suggests that he has to reach a speed of at least 80 km /h .
This is quite a lot , but still below fast balls in baseball , which can reach to 150 km/h , " he says .
" So I would say it is still possible for someone else to break the record . "
Mr Byars concedes that his strong right arm - he used to be a construction worker - is a big part of his success .
Apart from stretching exercises , he does n't do any special training before an event .
" I might take the dog out a few times before an event and throw some stones .
" That 's it , " he says .
And he 's adamant that his 51 - skip record was not a one - off fluke .
" When I sent the video of the attempt off to the Guinness Book of Records there were three throws with over 40 skips , and two which were over 50 , " he says .
The type of lake / water appears to increase the number of skips too - at Lake Louise in Canada I got about 21 skips , whereas back home at Ullswater I 'm lucky to get 7 !
I wonder if this is due to the suspended particles from the glacier that feeds Lake Louise ?
Sally , Newcastle upon Tyne , England
On holiday recently , I attempted , on a whim , to skim bread which had been compacted into roughly the correct shape .
It was a very reasonable substitute for a stone .
I did n't have the time to test quite how reasonable , but it certainly performed moderately well .
Philip Walker , York , United Kingdom
I note that the record - breaker threw his stones on a river .
My best results ( nothing like so good ) were achieved on a Scottish loch whose waters were glassy - still .
Smaller , lighter stones can be used in these conditions .
Is water turbulence generally regarded as helpful or a hindrance ?
Is it better to throw with , against or across the current ?
Jason Mills , Accrington
I can remember , as a young lad , skimming stones on the beach at Penarth .
I once skimmed a rather large flat slab and as it went out to sea , a swimmer poked his head up from below the water .
( well he could hardly have poked his head up from above the water could he ? )
Anyway , he ducked down to let the stone continue on its way .
A true sportsman !

And no mention of the Dambusters ...

A bipartisan group of Senators has prepared legislation that they want to offer in the next few weeks that would keep US troops in Iraq indefinitely .
What ’s worse , they ’re claiming that the legislation implements the recommendations of the bipartisan Iraq Study Group , when in fact , the legislation codifies George Bush ’s current failed policies in Iraq .
The misnamed “ Iraq Study Group ( ISG ) Recommendations Implementation Act of 2007 , ” is being offered by Senators Ken Salazar ( D - CO ) , Lamar Alexander ( R - TN ) , Bob Bennett ( R- UT ) , Mark Pryor ( D - AR ) , Judd Gregg ( R-NH ) , Robert Casey ( D - PA ) , John Sununu ( R-NH ) and Blanche Lincoln ( D - AR ) .
Probably the most offensive thing about the legislation is that it outright calls for the continuation of the status quo policy of keeping US troops in Iraq until the day that Iraq is 100 % ready to stand on its own – namely , never .
Specifically , the legislation buries a little nugget on page 18 of the bill .
In a section entitled “ Sense of Congress on Redeployment of United States Forces from Iraq , ” the legislation spells out the following preconditions to withdrawing US troops :
1 . A massive list of suggested policies need to first be accomplished before the US withdraws .
These include transferring the Iraqi National Police to the Ministry of Defense , reorganizing the Iraqi security forces , upgrading Iraq ’s police communications equipment , establishing courts , training judges , prosecutors and investigators , drafting oil legislation , implementing metering at the oil pipelines , reorganizing the entire Iraqi oil industry , and more .
But that ’s not all that has to happen before our troops are permitted to withdraw from Iraq .
Oh no .
Read on .
2. Additional Iraqi brigades need to deployed .
Meaning , the exact same policy we have now under George Bush .
No withdraw until the Iraqi security forces are up to par .
And our military people on the ground in Iraq say this could take 40 to 50 years , if ever .
3 . The eventual withdrawal of US forces is “ subject to unexpected development in the security situation on the ground . ”
Meaning , if things do n’t get better , we do n’t leave .
That ’s the current policy .
And things are n’t getting better .
The legislation then says that if ALL of those things I listed above are met , THEN we can possibly consider to maybe redeploy some of the troops next spring , 2008 .
Are they kidding ?
Oh but that ’s not all .
The legislation also says that the Iraq Study Group never ever said that we should actually withdraw from Iraq by next year .
And put aside the fact that the entire legislation is written as a “ sense of the Congress ” – meaning , it has the same legal weight as National Ice Cream Day .
You are witnessing a congressional covering - their - asses of the highest order .
They ’re offering legislation that they claim will get us out of Iraq , that they claim will change the course in Iraq , when in reality the legislation not only reiterates George Bush ’s current plan for Iraq , but the legislation specifically says that we should not leave Iraq until the security situation improves and the Iraqi Army and police forces are fully trained ( some time next century ) .
The Senators are hoping that no one will read the fine print , and their constituents will all be wooed by their grandiose press releases about embracing the Iraq Study Group report .
In fact , in twelve months , if this plan is adopted , more US troops will be dead and dying because Congress did n’t have the backbone to stand up to our incompetent commander in chief .
FOX News ’ Bill O’Reilly has been attacking the liberal blog Daily Kos , and liberal blogs in general , over some extreme comments left by some of our visitors .
It ’s interesting therefore that O’Reilly ’s own Web site contains some of the most hideous hate you ’ve ever seen .
Over the next few hours , we ’ll be documenting some of that hate .
And you ’ll be interested to know that while O’Reilly holds others responsible for the words strangers leave on their Web sites , on O’Reilly ’s Web site , he ’s not responsible at all for the hate and threats his readers leave behind .
And I quote O’Reilly ’s own Web site :
“ BillOReilly.com will not be held liable for any user activity on the message boards .
We do not actively monitor user - submitted content . ”
You see , it ’s okay when he does it .
And with no further ado , examples of BillOReilly.com ’s threats against Hillary .

If Hillary wins , I will be respectful of our leader .
If you could read my thoughts , I would be on the SS [ Secret Service ] watch list .
The only thought that would put you on a Secret Service watch list vis-a - vis the president is a possible threat to their life .
And this :

As a woman , i would open the door for her ….. now , if there was nothing on the other side but empty space and a 50 foot drop into a moat filled leeches and ( gulp ) rats …well , I ca n’t be held responsible .
O’Reilly claimed on TV last night that the hate on his Web site is n’t real , it ’s the work of liberals trying to sabotage him .
Funny , then , that he was all too willing to accept the hate on liberal Web sites as being real enough to report it , on the air , as real .
How do we know that it too is n’t the work of hateful conservatives ?
And more importantly , why do companies like jetBlue associate themselves with people who make threats against Hillary ’s life ?
Hillary is under Secret Service protection .
Members of BillOReilly.com have made what can reasonably be considered to be threats against Hillary ’s life .
Unlike DailyKos or AMERICAblog , or any other liberal blog , in order to post on BillOReilly.com , you need to give them your credit card info .
O’Reilly knows exactly who these people are who are making the threats .
Has he done his moral and legal and patriotic duty and reported the names and addresses of these people ( which he has because he has their credit cards ) to the Secret Service for investigation ?
More to come .
Much more to come .
They form one of the biggest threats to humanity that the modern world has ever faced .
Their numbers continue to grow with no respite in sight .
Together they are a malevolent force , striking fear into the hearts of those who stray into their path of destruction .
They are teenagers -- and there 's no stopping them .
Or is there ?
Long before the term " teen " was coined in the 1950's , and ever since , teenagers have posed a danger to one society or another , mainly in the eyes of those whose own adolescent years are way behind them and who have forgotten what it is like to be driven by hormones and boredom .
What 's fun for them could be torture for sensitive adults
For as long as humans have walked the planet , those who inhabit the 12 - to - 20 age bracket have always been the biggest pains in the collective behind .
Maybe it is because teenagers have consistently been the most awkward , sassy and disrespectful individuals throughout history that adults have started to find ways other than demonizing them and introducing pathetically useless laws to bring them into line .
After thousands of years of back talk , maybe it really is time to say enough is enough .
The Mosquito comes to German man's aid
One German man thought so and discovered what he considered to be the ideal solution to the teenage problem .
Axel Torbecke , a 40 - year - old from Osnabrück , endured a long - running , disruptive dispute with the local teenage posse .
The teens ' drunken and abusive behavior and the garbage - strewn public places they left in their wake slowly ground Torbecke down .
After trying and failing to make any impact with the group or those responsible for them , he took matters into his own hands .
It 's not so funny now , is it teenie ?
Enter " The Mosquito " -- not an anti-adolescent superhero but a teenager - dispersal device invented by a Welshman and manufactured by UK company Compound Security Systems .
Working in much the same way as a dog- whistle , the Mosquito emits a high - frequency tone that only teenagers can hear .
And instead of making the teen coming running obediently towards you , the piercing noise has the opposite -- and desired -- effect .
Torbecke said adults over the age of 25 cannot hear the tone and so can go about their business happily as tearful teens run for cover around and clutch at their bleeding eardrums .
Actually , Torbecke assures those still able to hear him , the Mosquito is totally painless .
Its tones are not intended to inflict injury or pain but are annoying and persistent enough to subtly advise loiterers to move on after about ten minutes .
Much like teenagers themselves , come to think of it .
Balancing quiet nights with human rights abuses
" Hello , is that Amnesty International ?
I 'd like to make a complaint ... "
The use of the Mosquito has yet to make it onto the agenda of the German government .
But in England and Switzerland , where the devices have been widely used , there is some discussion as to whether the Mosquito breaks any human rights regulations .
In Switzerland , politicians have gone so far as to make the first applications to ban the use of the Mosquito on these very grounds .
British civil and human rights group Liberty has called the device " discriminatory and degrading " and is concerned that the high - pitch electronic pulse does not differentiate between young people who are engaged in illegal activity and those who are not .
But as history has taught us about dealing with teenagers : when has that ever been a problem ?
Bomb sniffing dog .
White men dancing to rap music .
One speaker ’s suggestion that there should be a special fast - track line for atheists at airports .
Because , really , are there ever atheist suicide bombers ?
Details ( and more ! ) to come later .
Good night !
Comment Tell A Friend Print Format Save Article Japan and Australia set an outline for their groundbreaking defense pact yesterday and agreed to promote the peaceful use of nuclear energy in the region , saying it was one option to tackle climate change .
Meeting on the sidelines of an Asia - Pacific summit , Japan 's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and his Australian counterpart John Howard backed an " action plan " for their defense agreement signed in March , Japan 's first with a country other than the United States .
The plan includes cooperation in areas such as peacekeeping and counter - terrorism .
" We intend to steadily implement this action plan so that both Japan and Australia can contribute further to the peace and stability of the region , " Abe told reporters .
" We also intend to promote cooperation among Japan , Australia and the United States , " he said .
Japan and Australia held their first ever trilateral summit with the United States on Saturday .
A Japanese official said there was no plan for now to make the three - way talks a regular gathering .
Howard yesterday defended his meeting with US and Japanese leaders as natural for the three countries .
" It 's not something that he has had trouble with in any way , " Howard said .
Howard reiterated an explanation that he had made earlier - that as democracies the United States , Japan and Australia had natural reasons to discuss regional security and that their meeting was not directed at China .
" It is not directed at anybody , " he said .
Saturday 's meeting between Howard , US President George W. Bush and Abe was their first ever discussion of regional security issues .
The leaders talked about China , the Democratic People 's Republic of Korea , India and climate change .
Abe and Howard also signed a joint statement on climate change and energy security , which included a commitment to the peaceful use of nuclear energy , a focus of many countries as they try to curb greenhouse gas emissions .
The agreement , which noted that Japan was one of the largest importers of Australia 's uranium , is seen as ensuring a steady supply of the material for Japan as it scrambles for energy resources .
Australia would also seek Japan 's cooperation in building and operating nuclear power plants in the future .

WHAT SORT OF DESPOTISM DEMOCRATIC NATIONS HAVE TO FEAR I HAD remarked during my stay in the United States that a democratic state of society , similar to that of the Americans , might offer singular facilities for the establishment of despotism ; and I perceived , upon my return to Europe , how much use had already been made , by most of our rulers , of the notions , the sentiments , and the wants created by this same social condition , for the purpose of extending the circle of their power .
This led me to think that the nations of Christendom would perhaps eventually undergo some oppression like that which hung over several of the nations of the ancient world . .
A more accurate examination of the subject , and five years of further meditation , have not diminished my fears , but have changed their object .
No sovereign ever lived in former ages so absolute or so powerful as to undertake to administer by his own agency , and without the assistance of intermediate powers , all the parts of a great empire ; none ever attempted to subject all his subjects indiscriminately to strict uniformity of regulation and personally to tutor and direct every member of the community .
The notion of such an undertaking never occurred to the human mind ; and if any man had conceived it , the want of information , the imperfection of the administrative system , and , above all , the natural obstacles caused by the inequality of conditions would speedily have checked the execution of so vast a design .
When the Roman emperors were at the height of their power , the different nations of the empire still preserved usages and customs of great diversity ; although they were subject to the same monarch , most of the provinces were separately administered ; they abounded in powerful and active municipalities ; and although the whole government of the empire was centered in the hands of the Emperor alone and he always remained , in case of need , the supreme arbiter in all matters , yet the details of social life and private occupations lay for the most part beyond his control .
The emperors possessed , it is true , an immense and unchecked power , which allowed them to gratify all their whimsical tastes and to employ for that purpose the whole strength of the state .
They frequently abused that power arbitrarily to deprive their subjects of property or of life ; their tyranny was extremely onerous to the few , but it did not reach the many ; it was confined to some few main objects and neglected the rest ; it was violent , but its range was limited .
It would seem that if despotism were to be established among the democratic nations of our days , it might assume a different character ; it would be more extensive and more mild ; it would degrade men without tormenting them .
I do not question that , in an age of instruction and equality like our own , sovereigns might more easily succeed in collecting all political power into their own hands and might interfere more habitually and decidedly with the circle of private interests than any sovereign of antiquity could ever do .
But this same principle of equality which facilitates despotism tempers its rigor .
We have seen how the customs of society become more humane and gentle in proportion as men become more equal and alike .
When no member of the community has much power or much wealth , tyranny is , as it were , without opportunities and a field of action .
As all fortunes are scanty , the passions of men are naturally circumscribed , their imagination limited , their pleasures simple .
This universal moderation moderates the sovereign himself and checks within certain limits the inordinate stretch of his desires .
Independently of these reasons , drawn from the nature of the state of society itself , I might add many others arising from causes beyond my subject ; but I shall keep within the limits I have laid down .
Democratic governments may become violent and even cruel at certain periods of extreme effervescence or of great danger , but these crises will be rare and brief .
When I consider the petty passions of our contemporaries , the mildness of their manners , the extent of their education , the purity of their religion , the gentleness of their morality , their regular and industrious habits , and the restraint which they almost all observe in their vices no less than in their virtues , I have no fear that they will meet with tyrants in their rulers , but rather with guardians .
1
I think , then , that the species of oppression by which democratic nations are menaced is unlike anything that ever before existed in the world ; our contemporaries will find no prototype of it in their memories .
I seek in vain for an expression that will accurately convey the whole of the idea I have formed of it ; the old words despotism and tyranny are inappropriate : the thing itself is new , and since I cannot name , I must attempt to define it .
I seek to trace the novel features under which despotism may appear in the world .
The first thing that strikes the observation is an innumerable multitude of men , all equal and alike , incessantly endeavoring to procure the petty and paltry pleasures with which they glut their lives .
Each of them , living apart , is as a stranger to the fate of all the rest ; his children and his private friends constitute to him the whole of mankind .
As for the rest of his fellow citizens , he is close to them , but he does not see them ; he touches them , but he does not feel them ; he exists only in himself and for himself alone ; and if his kindred still remain to him , he may be said at any rate to have lost his country .
Above this race of men stands an immense and tutelary power , which takes upon itself alone to secure their gratifications and to watch over their fate .
That power is absolute , minute , regular , provident , and mild .
It would be like the authority of a parent if , like that authority , its object was to prepare men for manhood ; but it seeks , on the contrary , to keep them in perpetual childhood : it is well content that the people should rejoice , provided they think of nothing but rejoicing .
For their happiness such a government willingly labors , but it chooses to be the sole agent and the only arbiter of that happiness ; it provides for their security , foresees and supplies their necessities , facilitates their pleasures , manages their principal concerns , directs their industry , regulates the descent of property , and subdivides their inheritances : what remains , but to spare them all the care of thinking and all the trouble of living ?
Thus it every day renders the exercise of the free agency of man less useful and less frequent ; it circumscribes the will within a narrower range and gradually robs a man of all the uses of himself .
The principle of equality has prepared men for these things ; it has predisposed men to endure them and often to look on them as benefits .
After having thus successively taken each member of the community in its powerful grasp and fashioned him at will , the supreme power then extends its arm over the whole community .
It covers the surface of society with a network of small complicated rules , minute and uniform , through which the most original minds and the most energetic characters cannot penetrate , to rise above the crowd .
The will of man is not shattered , but softened , bent , and guided ; men are seldom forced by it to act , but they are constantly restrained from acting .
Such a power does not destroy , but it prevents existence ; it does not tyrannize , but it compresses , enervates , extinguishes , and stupefies a people , till each nation is reduced to nothing better than a flock of timid and industrious animals , of which the government is the shepherd .
I have always thought that servitude of the regular , quiet , and gentle kind which I have just described might be combined more easily than is commonly believed with some of the outward forms of freedom , and that it might even establish itself under the wing of the sovereignty of the people .
Our contemporaries are constantly excited by two conflicting passions : they want to be led , and they wish to remain free .
As they cannot destroy either the one or the other of these contrary propensities , they strive to satisfy them both at once .
They devise a sole , tutelary , and all - powerful form of government , but elected by the people .
They combine the principle of centralization and that of popular sovereignty ; this gives them a respite : they console themselves for being in tutelage by the reflection that they have chosen their own guardians .
Every man allows himself to be put in leading - strings , because he sees that it is not a person or a class of persons , but the people at large who hold the end of his chain .
By this system the people shake off their state of dependence just long enough to select their master and then relapse into it again .
A great many persons at the present day are quite contented with this sort of compromise between administrative despotism and the sovereignty of the people ; and they think they have done enough for the protection of individual freedom when they have surrendered it to the power of the nation at large .
This does not satisfy me : the nature of him I am to obey signifies less to me than the fact of extorted obedience .
I do not deny , however , that a constitution of this kind appears to me to be infinitely preferable to one which , after having concentrated all the powers of government , should vest them in the hands of an irresponsible person or body of persons .
Of all the forms that democratic despotism could assume , the latter would assuredly be the worst .
When the sovereign is elective , or narrowly watched by a legislature which is really elective and independent , the oppression that he exercises over individuals is sometimes greater , but it is always less degrading ; because every man , when he is oppressed and disarmed , may still imagine that , while he yields obedience , it is to himself he yields it , and that it is to one of his own inclinations that all the rest give way .
In like manner , I can understand that when the sovereign represents the nation and is dependent upon the people , the rights and the power of which every citizen is deprived serve not only the head of the state , but the state itself ; and that private persons derive some return from the sacrifice of their independence which they have made to the public .
To create a representation of the people in every centralized country is , therefore , to diminish the evil that extreme centralization may produce , but not to get rid of it .
I admit that , by this means , room is left for the intervention of individuals in the more important affairs ; but it is not the less suppressed in the smaller and more privates ones .
It must not be forgotten that it is especially dangerous to enslave men in the minor details of life .
For my own part , I should be inclined to think freedom less necessary in great things than in little ones , if it were possible to be secure of the one without possessing the other .
Subjection in minor affairs breaks out every day and is felt by the whole community indiscriminately .
It does not drive men to resistance , but it crosses them at every turn , till they are led to surrender the exercise of their own will .
Thus their spirit is gradually broken and their character enervated ; whereas that obedience which is exacted on a few important but rare occasions only exhibits servitude at certain intervals and throws the burden of it upon a small number of men .
It is in vain to summon a people who have been rendered so dependent on the central power to choose from time to time the representatives of that power ; this rare and brief exercise of their free choice , however important it may be , will not prevent them from gradually losing the faculties of thinking , feeling , and acting for themselves , and thus gradually falling below the level of humanity .
I add that they will soon become incapable of exercising the great and only privilege which remains to them .
The democratic nations that have introduced freedom into their political constitution at the very time when they were augmenting the despotism of their administrative constitution have been led into strange paradoxes .
To manage those minor affairs in which good sense is all that is wanted , the people are held to be unequal to the task ; but when the government of the country is at stake , the people are invested with immense powers ; they are alternately made the play things of their ruler , and his masters , more than kings and less than men .
After having exhausted all the different modes of election without finding one to suit their purpose , they are still amazed and still bent on seeking further ; as if the evil they notice did not originate in the constitution of the country far more than in that of the electoral body .
It is indeed difficult to conceive how men who have entirely given up the habit of self - government should succeed in making a proper choice of those by whom they are to be governed ; and no one will ever believe that a liberal , wise , and energetic government can spring from the suffrages of a subservient people .
2
A constitution republican in its head and ultra-monarchical in all its other parts has always appeared to me to be a short - lived monster .
The vices of rulers and the ineptitude of the people would speedily bring about its ruin ; and the nation , weary of its representatives and of itself , would create freer institutions or soon return to stretch itself at the feet of a single master .

Protective myelin is stripped away by MS
The team , from the Mayo Clinic in Rochester , hope their work will eventually lead to new treatments .
MS is caused by a defect in the body 's immune system , which turns in on itself , and attacks the fatty myelin sheath which coats the nerves .
The researchers used a human antibody to re-grow myelin in mice with the progressive form of MS .
The findings could eventually lead to new treatments that could limit permanent disability
Dr Arthur Warrington
Mayo Clinic
They told a meeting of the American Neurological Association they hope to begin patient trials after perfecting the technique further in animal tests .
MS affects around 85,000 people in the UK .
Damage to the myelin coating undermines the ability of the nerves to work properly , leading to symptoms including blurred vision , loss of balance and , in some cases paralysis .
Although the symptoms can be managed to some degree , there is currently no way to restore damaged myelin .
Kickstarts repair
Researcher Dr Moses Rodriguez said : " The concept of using natural human antibodies to treat disease of this kind has not yet been tested in humans , but these research findings are very promising " .
His colleague Dr Arthur Warrington said : " The findings could eventually lead to new treatments that could limit permanent disability " .
Myelin repair normally occurs in the body spontaneously , but MS appears to sabotage this mechanism .
The scientists found that a single low dose of the antibody - which was genetically engineered from a single cell - was enough to kick start it into action .
However , they found that the remyelination process reached a plateau after five weeks .
Tests also showed that the antibody worked even when combined with the steroid treatment which is often taken by people with MS .
Helen Yates , of the MS Resource Centre , said the findings were " very good news " .
She said much emphasis in the research community had been placed on the search for a cure for the disease , but myelin repair could potentially help people regain previously lost function .
Dr Laura Bell , of the MS Society , said : " Myelin repair is an exciting avenue of research that holds a lot of promise as an MS treatment .
" This is an exciting study but it is early days - we 'll be keen to see how it works in people with MS . "
Chris Jones , of the MS Trust , also stressed that the work was at a very early stage .
The following correction was printed in the Guardian 's Corrections and clarifications column , Saturday January 13 2007
The emergence of China as a $ 2 trillion economy from such inauspicious beginnings only 25 years ago is such a giddy accomplishment that the temptation to see its success as proof positive of your own prejudices is overwhelming .
And the west 's broad prejudice is that China is growing so rapidly because it has abandoned communism and embraced capitalism .
China 's own claim - that it is building a very particular economic model around what it describes as a socialist market economy - is dismissed as hogwash , the necessary rhetoric the Communist party must use to disguise what is actually happening .
China proves conclusively that liberalisation , privatisation , market freedoms and the embrace of globalisation are the only route to prosperity .
China is on its way to capitalism but will not admit it .
But the closer you get to what is happening on the ground in China , its so - called capitalism looks nothing like any form of capitalism the west has known and the transition from communism remains fundamentally problematic .
The alpha and omega of China 's political economy is that the Communist party remains firmly in the driving seat not just of government , but of the economy - a control that goes into the very marrow of how ownership rights are conceived and business strategies devised .
The western conception of the free exercise of property rights and business autonomy that goes with it , essential to any notion of capitalism , does not exist in China .
The truth is that China is not the socialist market economy the party describes , nor moving towards capitalism as the western consensus believes .
Rather it is frozen in a structure that I describe as Leninist corporatism - and which is unstable , monumentally inefficient , dependent upon the expropriation of peasant savings on a grand scale , colossally unequal and ultimately unsustainable .
It is Leninist in that the party still follows Lenin 's dictum of being the vanguard , monopoly political driver and controller of the economy and society .
And it is corporatist because the framework for all economic activity in China is one of central management and coordination from which no economic actor , however humble , can opt out .
In this environment genuine wholesale privatisation is impossible and liberalisation has well - defined limits , as President Hu Jintao himself brutally reminds us .
The party , he says , " takes a dominant role and coordinates all sectors .
Party members and party organisations in government departments should be brought into full play so as to realise the party 's leadership over state affairs " .
It may be true that party organisations in the provinces ( some with populations bigger than Britain's ) and in the chief cities are jealous of their autonomous local political control , but all retain the discretionary power to do what they choose and override any challenge or complaint from any non-state actor - or , indeed , from state actors if they cross the will of the party .
Absolute power corrupts , and the Chinese Communist party has become one of the most corrupt organisations the world has ever witnessed .
The combination of absolute power and an ideology that palpably no longer describes reality is a virus that is morally and psychologically undermining the regime .
And if the regime wobbles , then its capacity to sustain the unsustainable economic structures will wobble and Leninist corporatism will unravel .
Beijing 's authority could fragment and China 's provinces reassert their destructive independence as they did in the 1910s and 20s , or a new and fiercely repressive regime could try to hold the country together abandoning economic openness and market reforms - and even pick some international fights ( such as invading Taiwan ? ) to rally the country to its side .
It is because this prospect is so real that the task of peacefully moving to a sustainable capitalism , and building the necessary institutions to do it , is so vital for both China and the world .
Ever since the late 1990s the party leadership , then under Hu's predecessor Jiang Zemin , has rightly become more and more preoccupied with how corruption is corroding the party .
" If we do not crack down on corruption , the flesh - and - blood ties between the party and the people will suffer a lot and the party will be in danger of losing its ruling position , or possibly heading for self - destruction , " Jiang declared in 2002 , in his last political report to the National Congress .
High - level officials had been arrested and imprisoned for embezzlement and racketeering ; they included the party secretary and mayor of Beijing , Chen Xitong , a member of the Politburo .
Cheng Kejie , vice - chairman of the National People 's Congress , was executed for taking pounds 2.5 m in kickbacks for arranging land deals and contracts for private business .
In the financial system the highest - profile casualties were three of prime minister Zhu Rongji 's hand - picked " can- do commanders " , selected to sort out the financial crisis of the late 1990s , and one of whom , Li Fuxiang , leaped to his death from the seventh floor of Beijing 's Hospital 304 while under investigation .
To put this in a British context , it is as if the Mayor of London , the speaker of the House of Commons , the chief executive of HSBC , along with a deputy governor of the Bank of England and the deputy chief executive of the Financial Services Authority had all been imprisoned for fraud with one committing suicide .
For all the strengthening of the anti-corruption and Orwellian sounding " Central Discipline Inspection Committee " , corruption remains deeply embedded .
The number of arrests of senior cadres members above the county level quadrupled between 1992 and 2001 , and since then have included a ring of officials in Gansu , one of China 's poorest provinces , caught embezzling pounds 500m .
Four provincial governors and one provincial party secretary have been charged recently - the top posts in China outside Beijing .
And in September 2006 came the arrest of Shanghai party secretary and member of the politburo Chen Liangyu for his involvement in the misappropriation of pounds 206 m of social security funds .
The Chinese economist Hu Angang , in his trailblazing book Great Transformations in China : Challenges and Opportunities , calculates that over the late 90s the cumulative annual cost of corruption was between 13.3 % and 16.9 % of GDP and is still around that level today .
Every incident of corruption - smuggling , embezzlement , theft , swindling , bribery - arises in the first place from the unchallengeable power of communist officials and the lack of any reliable , independent system of accountability and scrutiny .
Corruption has become part of the system 's DNA , now threatening the integrity of the state .
To see how , look no further than the combination of one - party control and corruption and how it deforms the legal system .
The judicial apparatus is politicised from top to bottom .
Every president and vice - president of a court is appointed by the party ; and the courts are funded by provincial governments .
The court bureaucracy works on the same basis as the rest of the government , with a party committee system superintending each rung of the court hierarchy .
Judges often make decisions at the instruction of the committee or government independently of the legal merits of the case .
Many judges still have no formal legal training - the majority are retired army officers , only too ready to do the party 's bidding .
The scale of the corruption is stunning .
In 2003 , 794 judges were tried for corruption ( out of a national total of 200,000 ) .
In 2003 and 2004 , the presidents of the provincial high courts of Guangdong and Hunan were both found guilty of corruption .
When the party does not or cannot influence the judgment in a case , it can use its influence over the police to decide whether to slow down or not enforce the judgment .
Enforcement rates in China are lamentable ; for example , only 40 % of provincial high court decisions are enforced .
The lack of a clear system of property rights , with the party - state claiming particular privileges , can make debt enforcement against state organisations close to impossible .
As a potential watchdog to correct any of this , the media is crippled .
China now has more than 2,000 newspapers , 2,000 television channels , 9,000 magazines and 450 radio stations , but they are all under the watchful eye of the party in Beijing or provincial propaganda departments .
These authorities issue daily instructions on what may and may not be reported ; journalists who digress will be suspended from working or even imprisoned .
China is estimated to have 42 journalists in prison , the highest number in the world .
Editors know roughly how much slack they have ; but recently , under Hu Jintao , there has been a tightening of the leash .
The right to travel independently and report from a non-local city had allowed more aggressive reporting of corruption ; but it has been rescinded .
Some prominent editors have been fired .
For instance , Yang Bin , editor of China 's most forceful tabloid , the Beijing News , was dismissed in 2005 for reporting village protests against unfair confiscation of land .
Other journalists have been prohibited from publishing .
The Committee to Protect Journalists , in its 2005 report on repression of the media , quotes the government - run People 's Daily : " [ During 2004 ] censorship agencies permanently shut down 338 publications for printing ' internal ' information , closed 202 branch offices of newspapers , and punished 73 organisations for illegally ' engaging in news activities ' . "
In February 2006 , three of China 's most distinguished elders - Li Rui , a former aide to Mao Zedong , Hu Jiwei , former editor of the People 's Daily , and Zhu Houze , a former party propaganda chief - published a letter condemning the approach : " History demonstrates that only a totalitarian system needs news censorship , out of the delusion that it can keep the public locked in ignorance , " they wrote .
Far from ensuring stability , they continued , such media repression would " sow the seeds of disaster " .
All this is obvious to western eyes ; what is less obvious is the way the same system of control undermines the economy .
Successful businesses have to be successful in business terms - with managers freely exploiting opportunities , developing products and brands and promoting on ability .
No such autonomy is possible within Leninist corporatism ; party needs come before those of business , enforced by a national system of party committees in every enterprise , finance from state - owned banks and a complex system of accounting and ownership rights that leaves majority ownership of most enterprises with the state .
Private shareholders have very limited ownership rights ; companies ' fixed assets are separated out in company accounts and can still only be legally owned by state and public bodies .
And as MIT economist Yasheng Huang argues , government shareholders interfere , especially if a firm is successful .
Countless Chinese firms , he says , have been driven to bankruptcy or thwarted in their growth ambitions because the government has exercised its ownership privileges to meet party objectives .
In short , the party state is at the centre of a spiderweb of control of the economy , radiating out from the tight ownership and direction of the 57 sectors the party considers the economy 's strategic heart like steel and energy to a more relaxed stance the less important the party considers an enterprise 's activity - such as packaging or hairdressing .
Even they can be controlled if need be .
The general rule is that the more politicised and controlled a Chinese enterprise , the lower its productivity and performance .
Thus the performance of China 's State Owned Enterprises ( SOEs ) , which control two - thirds of industrial assets , has hardly improved during 20 years of reform .
One in three of their employees is estimated to be structurally idle .
SOEs are on a financial edge and barely profitable .
According to one influential estimate , even the tiniest upward movement in interest rates or the slightest decline in sales would mean that 40 % - 60 % of their enormous bank debts would not be serviced , rendering the entire Chinese banking system bankrupt .
They are commercial and business disaster areas .
Even large private companies , although better performing , are still affected .
Davin Mackenzie , managing director of iVentures , which is based in Beijing , says that almost no private company , however well run , wants to leave the opaque , informal world of guanxi personal relationships in which the main aim is to hide revenue , cash , and profits from potential political direction .
The vast majority , he says , run themselves out of the " cash box in the back of the Mercedes " .
Most private Chinese companies have three sets of accounts - one for the banks , one for the tax authorities , and one for management .
Most do not last long ; the average duration is three years .
The law of the jungle prevails : you do what you can get away with .
China is the counterfeiters ' paradise , where intellectual property rights are neither respected nor enforced .
Between 15 % and 20 % of all well - known brands in China are fake ; two - thirds of the imports confiscated by US Customs as fakes were made in China .
Counterfeiting is estimated to represent 8 % of GDP - eloquent testimony to Chinese business strategies and the ineffectiveness of the legal system .
The cumulative result of all this is economic weakness , despite the eye - catching growth figures .
Innovation is poor ; half of China 's patents come from foreign companies .
Its growth depends on huge investment , representing an unsustainable 40 % or more of GDP financed by peasant savings .
But China now needs $ 5.4 of extra investment to produce an extra $ 1 of output , a proportion vastly higher than that in economies such as Britain or the US .
But 20 years ago , China needed just $ 4 to deliver the same result .
In other words , an already gravely inefficient economy has become even more inefficient .
China 's national accounts tell the same story .
Hu Angang calculates that China is now back to the Mao years in term of the inefficiency with which it uses capital to generate growth .
Behind all these problems lie Leninist corporatism .
Capitalism , I contend , is much more than the profit motive and the freedom to set prices which China 's reforms have permitted .
It is a system in which many different actors freely take different decisions according to their best judgment ; some are right and some are wrong , but the system never has to bet on any one being right for everyone - as in an authoritarian system of centralised economic control .
But this economic pluralism is closely intertwined and dependent upon the wider political capacity of different citizens to be able to be part of a public space in which they can debate options and choices .
It is because democracies possess such public spaces that , over decades , even the weakest tend to manage themselves better than authoritarian states .
There is less likelihood of group - think , conformism and top - down plans that militate against good decisions - or of the quick reversal of poor decisions .
This public sphere is a whole network of " soft " independent processes of scrutiny , justification , transparency and accountability that range from a free media to independent justice .
Representative government in which the people regularly vote for their governors is but the coping stone of this structure .
And the processes of scrutiny and deliberation do not stop just with the state - the same processes are extended to capitalism and the market economy , and through having to justify themselves , makes them more honest and better performing .
But none of this can happen if individuals are not free and capable of being involved - and having the capacity , through the independence that property ownership , education , trade union membership and citizenship confers , freely to challenge and change individual policies , whether they are those of the government or the company they work for .
These social processes work best the less social distance there is between people .
The more inequality and the more social distance , the less well these processes of pluralism , capabilities and accountability can function .
And the less well capitalism then functions .
So China leads to an unexpected insight .
Capitalism works best the more inequality is capped - and the more and better developed its democratic institutions .
The west is unforgivably ignorant about China 's shortcomings and weaknesses , which leads it vastly to exaggerate the extent of the Chinese " threat " .
China is certainly emerging as a leading exporter , but essentially it is a sub-contractor to the west .
It has not bucked the way globalisation is heavily skewed in favour of the rich developed nations .
Its productivity is poor ; it lacks international champions ; its innovation record is lamentable ; it relies far too much on exports and investment to propel its economy .
To characterise China as an unstoppable force whose economic model is unbeatable and set to swamp us - the stuff of almost every ministerial and business lobby speech - is to make a first - order mistake .
Rather , the west needs to understand the depth of China 's problems and the possibility , if not probability , of an economic and political convulsion as China seeks their resolution .
What the west must avoid is a position where it forces the Chinese leaders ' hand and China retreats towards economic isolation and freezing the reform process .
The challenge to the global trading and financial system would be profound ; not only would an important source of global demand be scaled back , a key source of financing the US trade deficit would be removed .
China 's progress would be shaken to its core .
The interest of the west is to help China avoid this fate and encourage a peaceful transition to a pluralist China within a legitimate system of accountability ; a country that is comfortable with liberal globalisation and the international rule of law .
To describe the goal of policy in this way is demanding enough ; more demanding still is to execute it .
The simple extrapolations of China 's growth , predicting that it will eventually become a one - party , economic colossus , lead to an alarmist climate in which it is easier to justify trade protection or , in the United States , potential military activism .
Such responses are naive .
We have to play it long , encourage and help to co-manage the change that must come .
Only thus will the world be a safer and still prosperous place .

Senator Vitter admits number on ' DC Madam ' phone records
Josh Catone
Published : Monday July 9 , 2007 Print This Email This
First term Senator David Vitter ( R - LA ) admitted Monday night that his phone number was on the phone records of the so - called " DC Madam . "
" This was a very serious sin in my past for which I am , of course , completely responsible , " said Vitter in a statement .
" Several years ago , I asked for and received forgiveness from God and my wife in confession and marriage counseling .
Out of respect for my family , I will keep my discussion of the matter there - with God and them .
But I certainly offer my deep and sincere apologies to all I have disappointed and let down in any way . "
According to Vitter , his phone number appeared on the phone records of the escort service Pamela Martin and Associates before he ran for the Senate in 2004 .
From 1999 to 2004 , Vitter served as a congressman in Louisiana 's 1st district .
The 46 - year - old politico is also the southern regional chair of Rudy Giuliani 's presidential campaign .
In 2004 , Vitter campaigned with a promise of " protecting the sanctity of marriage , " and was a co-author of the " Federal Marriage Act " that sought to prohibit courts from interpreting same - sex marriage laws .
" This is a real outrage .
The Hollywood left is redefining the most basic institution in human history , " he said then .
Excellent blog post :
So cholera has now reached Baghdad .
That ’s not much of a surprise given the utter breakdown of infrastructure .
But there ’s a reason the cholera is picking up speed now .
From the NYT :
“ We are suffering from a shortage of chlorine , which is sometimes zero , ” Dr. Ameer said in an interview on Al Hurra , an American - financed television network in the Middle East .
“ Chlorine is essential to disinfect the water . ”
So why is there is a shortage ?
Because insurgents have laced a few bombs with chlorine and the U.S. and Iraq have responded by making it darn hard to import the stuff .
From the AP :
[ A World Health Organization representative in Iraq ] also said some 100,000 tons of chlorine were being held up at Iraq ’s border with Jordan , apparently because of fears the chemical could be used in explosives .
She urged authorities to release it for use in decontaminating water supplies .
I understand why Iraq would put restrictions on dangerous chemicals .
And I ’m sure nobody intended for the restrictions to be so burdensome that they ’d effectively cut off Iraq ’s clean water supply .
But that ’s what looks to have happened .
What makes it all the more tragic is that chlorine — for all the hype and worry — is actually a very ineffective booster for bombs .
Of the roughly dozen chlorine - laced bombings in Iraq , it appears the chlorine has killed exactly nobody .
In other words , the biggest damage from chlorine bombs — as with so many terrorist attacks — has come from overreaction to it .
Fear operates as a “ force multiplier ” for terrorists , and in this case has helped them cut off Iraq ’s clean water .
Pretty impressive feat for some bombs that turned out to be close to duds .
Energy : Attitudes to nuclear power are shifting in response to climate change and fears over the security of the supply of fossil fuels .
The technology of nuclear power has been changing , too
Alamy
OVER the next few decades global electricity consumption is expected to double .
At the same time , many power plants in rich countries , built back in the 1960s and 1970s , are nearing the end of their projected lifespans .
Meanwhile , concern is swelling both about global warming , and about the Western world 's increasing dependence on a shrinking number of hostile or unstable countries for imports of oil and gas .
The solution to this conundrum , in the eyes of many governments , is nuclear power .
Around the world , 31 reactors are under construction and many more are in the planning stages .
Some of the most ambitious programmes are under way in developing countries .
Both China and India are building several reactors and intend to increase their nuclear - generating capacity several times over in the next 15 years .
Some countries , such as Turkey and Vietnam , are considering starting nuclear - power programmes , and others , including Argentina and South Africa , plan to expand their existing ones .
The rich world is also re-examining the case for nuclear .
America is expecting a rush of applications to build new reactors in the coming months — the first in almost 30 years .
Britain 's prime minister , Gordon Brown , recently affirmed his support for a new generation of nuclear power plants .
Construction of a new one in Finland , western Europe 's first for 15 years , began in 2005 ; work is just starting on another of the same design in France .
Other European countries that had frozen or decided to scrap their nuclear programmes are rethinking their plans .
There are good reasons for this enthusiasm .
Nuclear reactors emit almost none of the greenhouse gases responsible for global warming .
They are fuelled by uranium , which is relatively abundant and is available from many sources , including reassuringly stable places such as Canada and Australia .
At the moment 439 nuclear reactors in 31 countries supply 15 % of the world 's electricity .
Even without a price on carbon emissions , says Fatih Birol , the chief economist of the International Energy Agency ( IEA ) , the worldwide generating capacity of nuclear power plants will probably increase from about 370 gigawatts today to 520 gigawatts in 2030 .
But if there were a price on carbon dioxide , says Mr Birol , “ it could grow even faster . ”
But there are also good reasons for scepticism .
Nuclear plants are expensive : each can cost several billion dollars to build .
Worse , in the past , ill - conceived designs , safety scares and the regulatory delays they gave rise to made nuclear plants even more costly than their hefty price - tags suggest .
Vendors of new nuclear plants , such as Areva , General Electric ( GE ) , Hitachi and Westinghouse , argue that things are different now .
The latest designs incorporate suggestions from utilities and operators with decades of experience , and should , their creators say , make new plants safer and easier to operate .
They believe the simpler new reactors , with their longer lifespans and reduced maintenance costs , will also improve the economics of the industry .
“ The latest generation of reactors includes important improvements over prior designs . ”
All nuclear reactors rely on nuclear fission , a process that was discovered in the 1930s .
When certain heavy atoms are struck by a neutron , they absorb it , become unstable and split apart .
This results in two lighter atoms , and two or three neutrons are ejected .
The process releases large amounts of energy , much of it in the form of the kinetic energy of the fast - moving fission products .
This kinetic energy is converted to heat as the fission products slow down .
If the ejected neutrons go on to strike other unstable atoms nearby , those too can break apart , releasing further neutrons in a process known as a chain reaction .
When enough of these neutrons produce further fissions — rather than escaping , bouncing off or being absorbed by atoms that do not split apart — the process becomes self - sustaining .
An uncontrolled chain reaction within a large amount of fissionable material can lead to an explosive release of energy , as in nuclear weapons .
But in nuclear reactors , which contain far less fissionable material , the chain reaction and the release of energy are carefully controlled .
War and peace
In 1942 the physicist Enrico Fermi led a group of scientists who built the first nuclear reactor as part of the Manhattan Project — America 's effort to build the first atomic bomb .
Although the reactor was simple in design , it included features that are part of almost every nuclear power plant today .
The reactor core consisted of pellets of uranium fuel inside bricks made of graphite , which served as a “ moderator ” , reducing the speed of the neutrons in order to maximise their ability to cause further fissions .
( Most reactors today use water as the moderator . )
In addition , the set - up included “ control rods ” made of a material that absorbed neutrons .
These rods could be inserted into the core to slow or shut down the chain reaction if necessary .
Although all of this was done with a view to building an effective weapon , the scientists involved always knew that nuclear technologies also had promising peaceful uses .
In 1953 America 's president , Dwight Eisenhower , gave his famous “ Atoms for Peace ” speech before the United Nations General Assembly , in which he called for the controlled application of nuclear energy in a civilian context .
In the mid-1950s the world 's first civilian nuclear power stations appeared in America , Britain and Russia .
America 's first civilian nuclear power plant , of a type called a pressurised water reactor ( PWR ) , was designed by Westinghouse and adapted from the reactors used in nuclear submarines .
Inside a PWR , water — which is kept under high pressure to prevent it from boiling —has a double function .
In a closed “ primary ” loop , it serves as a coolant for the reactor core and as a moderator , to slow down the fast neutrons created during fission .
As the water in the primary loop circulates , it becomes very hot .
This heat energy is then transferred to a secondary loop of water .
The resulting steam is used to spin turbines that generate electricity .
Nuclear 's golden age
In the 1950s the pursuit of atomic energy was viewed as a largely positive endeavour .
In a speech in 1954 before a group of science writers , the head of America 's Atomic Energy Commission , Lewis Strauss , even declared that one day nuclear power would be “ too cheap to meter ” .
By the mid-1960s America's two leading reactor vendors , General Electric ( GE ) and Westinghouse , were involved in an intense competition .
GE began to offer “ turnkey ” contracts to utilities , in which it delivered an entire nuclear plant for a fixed price .
To keep up , Westinghouse followed suit , causing a surge in orders .
But this sales ploy turned out to be a money - loser for both firms in the end .
The boom in reactor construction coincided with the beginnings of America 's environmental movement and a sense of growing unease about nuclear power .
By the early 1970s uncertainties over radioactive - waste disposal , the effects of radiation and the potential consequences of a nuclear accident prompted a backlash .
One frightening scenario was the “ China Syndrome ” : the idea that molten radioactive fuel undergoing a runaway reaction might burn its way through the bottom of the reactor 's pressure vessel and containment structure , and then down into the Earth .
Of course the fuel would never actually reach China , but were it to breach the containment structure , the result could be a huge release of radioactivity .
As electricity demand levelled off and interest rates shot up , applications to build nuclear reactors started to decline , at least in America .
Then in 1979 a serious accident occurred at a plant at Three Mile Island , near Harrisburg , Pennsylvania .
A combination of mechanical failures and operator errors caused a partial melting of the reactor core .
Fortunately the pressure vessel housing the core held , and virtually no dangerous radioactive gases escaped from the plant , says J. Samuel Walker , the historian of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission , the agency that regulates America 's nuclear power plants .
Although the accident nearly killed off America 's nuclear - power industry , it did not harm any people .
But a few years later a true disaster occurred .
In 1986 a reactor at Chernobyl in Ukraine became unstable , and a power surge inside the core led to two explosions that destroyed the reactor and blew its roof off .
As a result , significant amounts of radioactive material escaped into the environment .
About 30 emergency workers died of radiation exposure shortly after the accident .
Thousands more people who lived in contaminated areas developed serious health problems , some of them fatal .
The cause of the accident was found to be a combination of operator errors and inherent flaws in the plant 's design .
Industry insiders pointed out that reactors based on this flawed design had not been deployed in Western countries .
Even so , the accident further undermined public confidence in nuclear power .
Although the nuclear industry faced decline or stagnation in many Western countries in the 1980s , it thrived in one of them : France .
After the oil crisis of 1973 , France decided to pursue the goal of fossil - fuel independence .
With few energy resources of its own , pursuing nuclear power seemed like the best strategy .
All the commercial nuclear plants operating in France today were based on technology devised by Westinghouse , which licensed its PWR design to France in the 1960s .
Today the country has 59 nuclear reactors supplying 78 % of its electricity .
Nuclear has worked well in France in part because it is accepted by politicians and the public alike , so there are few delays due to protests or planning problems .
Elsewhere , these have lengthened the construction period and enormously increased costs .
Once up and running , however , nuclear plants have a distinct advantage over those run on coal or natural gas : they need comparatively little fuel to operate .
Although the price of uranium jumped from about $ 70 per pound in January to about $ 130 in mid-July , operating costs of nuclear power plants have changed very little .
( Construction accounts for as much as three - quarters of the cost of nuclear generation . )
Moreover , the rise in the price has prompted an exploration boom that will ultimately lead to more mines and greater supply .
Uranium is not thought to be particularly scarce — it has simply not been very profitable to look for it recently .
The latest generation of reactors , which evolved from models constructed in the 1970s and 1980s , include important improvements over prior designs .
Westinghouse 's new AP1000 , for example , has “ passive safety ” systems that can prevent a meltdown during an emergency without operator intervention .
If the reactor loses pressure because of a loss of coolant , for example , pressurised tanks deliver water to the core , since the pressure in the tanks is higher than that in the core , explains Howard Bruschi , who has worked for Westinghouse since the 1960s and is now a consultant to the company .
The new reactor 's simplified design also means that fewer motors , pumps and pipes are needed , reducing not only the potential for mechanical errors , but also costs of maintenance , inspections and repairs .
Westinghouse recently agreed to provide four new plants to China .
Soul of a new reactor
Meanwhile , Areva , a French nuclear company , is engineering ever more powerful plants .
Its first reactor , which began operating in 1977 , was rated at 900 megawatts ; its latest model , the evolutionary power reactor ( EPR ) , is a 1,600 - megawatt design .
The company has already begun building two such plants in Europe : one in Finland , which is now expected to start operating in 2011 , about two years late , and another in France .
Both the EPR and the AP1000 , along with GE 's latest design , are among the plants under consideration by American utilities .
A demonstration plant of a completely different type , a “ pebble bed ” reactor , is scheduled to be built in South Africa starting in 2009 .
Based on technology that originated in Germany , its design is unique in several ways .
For one thing , its small size ( 165 megawatts ) should make it comparatively fast and cheap to build ; depending on power needs , several units sharing a single control room could be constructed on one site .
And the uranium fuel is encapsulated in rugged “ pebbles ” , the size of tennis balls , which are designed to withstand a loss of coolant without disintegrating , making the reactor extremely safe .
Andrew Kadak , a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) , who has been developing a smaller , alternative pebble - bed design with his students , is convinced that “ these reactors can not melt down . ”
Even though new designs for nuclear plants may be safer , they still generate toxic waste .
After about three years of use , the fuel is depleted of most fissile uranium but has accumulated long - lived radioactive materials that cannot be burned in conventional reactors .
At the moment most such waste is stored near the plant until it can be moved to a permanent facility .
But no country is yet operating a final disposal site for highly radioactive nuclear waste .
America 's Yucca Mountain repository , for example , is not expected to be ready for use for many years , if ever .
In some countries nuclear waste is “ reprocessed ” — a procedure in which plutonium is separated from the rest of the spent fuel , which can then be made into new fuel .
Plutonium , of course , can be used to make nuclear weapons .
Because of concern over nuclear proliferation , America has not engaged in civilian reprocessing since 1977 .
As part of a new multinational initiative called the Global Nuclear Energy Partnership ( GNEP ) , however , America 's Department of Energy is supporting a type of spent fuel reprocessing which does not separate the plutonium from other highly radioactive materials in the waste , thus making it more resistant to proliferation than traditional reprocessing .
This mixture of plutonium and other radioactive elements could then be turned into fuel suitable for use in “ fast ” reactors .
Most reactors in operation today are called “ thermal ” reactors , because they use a moderator to slow down the neutrons and promote fission .
Fast reactors , in contrast , do not employ moderators and use much faster neutrons to produce fissions .
So they can consume many of the long - lived radioactive materials that thermal reactors cannot .
AP
They do n't build them like they used to
This approach could extract far more energy from a given amount of nuclear fuel while at the same time reducing the volume and toxicity of nuclear waste .
Proponents of fast reactors reckon that most of the remaining waste would need to be stored for only a few centuries , perhaps , rather than hundreds of thousands of years , once the most radioactive elements had been separated out .
According to the Nuclear Energy Institute , a lobby group in Washington , DC , this could mean that America would need only one nuclear - waste repository .
In the long term , a fleet of fast reactors could use nuclear fuel so efficiently that “ for all practical purposes , the uranium would be inexhaustible , ” says William Hannum , a nuclear physicist who used to work at America 's Argonne National Laboratory .
But opponents of this strategy call it a distraction that could hinder the renewal of the nuclear power industry .
For one thing , many new fast reactors and fuel - reprocessing facilities would have to be built , adding billions of dollars to the enormous sums already required for new nuclear plants .
In addition , some of the technologies in question have not been demonstrated on a commercial scale yet .
And the GNEP reverses America 's ban on civilian reprocessing , which critics say could encourage the proliferation of weapons - grade materials .
In the end , the deployment of new nuclear reactors will depend on many factors , including successful waste and proliferation management , improved economics , and perhaps most important , convincing the public that nuclear reactors can be operated safely .
Despite these obstacles , there is an undeniable mood of optimism in the industry .
Whether that will be enough to spark the deployment of the hundreds of reactors that will be needed to help mitigate the effects of global warming remains to be seen , cautions Richard Lester , a professor of nuclear science and engineering at MIT .
Were there to be another disaster like Chernobyl , or a successful terrorist attack on a nuclear plant , all bets would be off .
But for now most people in the industry agree that nuclear power 's prospects look brighter than they have in a long time .
There ’s this dance that entrepreneurs and venture capitalists do when it comes time to negotiate the economic terms of an investment .
And it all revolves around valuation .
The question is what is the fair value of the business ?
This supposedly establishes how much of the company the venture capitalists will own for their investment .
But I think the concept of valuation is often misunderstood by the people engaged in this process .
And it ’s particularly true in early stage investing .
I do not believe that negotiating a valuation on an early stage venture investment has much to do with the current value of the business .
If it did , why would a venture capitalist agree to a $ 10 million value for a business that will lose money for the next 2 - 4 years and has little , if any , revenue ?
The fact is that almost all venture capital deals are done as convertible preferred stock investments .
That means that the money we invest is more like a debt instrument in the event the business does n’t work out very well .
We get our money out before the entrepreneurs do if the deal goes sideways or down .
It ’s only in the event that the deal works out that the percentage of the business ( the thing that valuation is supposed to determine ) matters in terms of how much money we make .
Another important factor to consider is that only a relatively small portion of early stage venture investments really work out in the way they were supposed to when the investment was made .
In my experience , which is based on 17 years in the business and over 100 different early stage investments over that time period , there is a 1/3 rule .
The 1/3 rule goes as follows :
1/3 of the deals really work out the way you thought they would and produce great gains .
These gains are often in the 5 - 10 x range .
The entrepreneurs generally do very well on these deals .
1/3 of the deals end up going mostly sideways .
They turn into businesses , but not businesses that can produce significant gains .
The gains on these deals are in the range of 1 - 2 x and the venture capitalists get most to all of the money generated in these deals .
1/3 of the deals turn out badly .
They are shut down or sold for less than the money invested .
In these deals the venture capitalists get all the money even though it is n’t much .
So if you take the 1/3 rule and add to it the typical structure of a venture capital deal , you ’ll quickly see that the venture capitalist is not really negotiating a value at all .
We are negotiating how much of the upside we are going to in the 1/3 of our deals that actually produce real gains .
Our deal structure provides most of the downside protection that protects our capital .
I think it is much better to think of a venture capital deal as a loan plus an option .
The loan will be repaid on 2/3 of our investments and partially repaid on some of the rest .
The option comes into play in a big way on something like 1/3 of our investments and probably no more than half of all of our investments .
There is more to this whole issue of valuation because there are often follow - on rounds where the deal between the venture capitalists and entrepreneurs gets renegotiated .
I ’ll save that for another post .
