Paul Rahe 's outstanding book can be considered an extended commentary on a famous passage in Tocqueville 's Democracy in America :
Over these [ citizens ] is elevated an immense , tutelary power , which takes sole charge of assuring their enjoyment and of watching over their fate .
It is absolute , attentive to detail , regular , provident , and gentle …
It works willingly for their happiness , but it wishes to be the only agent and the sole arbiter of that happiness .
It provides for their security , foresees and supplies their needs , guides them in their principal affairs , directs their testaments , divides their inheritances …
In this fashion , every day , it renders the employment of free will less useful and more rare ; it confines the action of the will within a smaller space and bit by bit it steals from each citizen the use of that which is his own .
Equality has prepared men for all of these things : it has disposed them to put up with them and often even to regard them as a benefit .
( pp. 187–88 , quoting Tocqueville )
As Rahe abundantly demonstrates , this passage has great relevance to recent American history .
Tocqueville 's comment , he shows , represents the culmination of a line of thought that began with Montesquieu .
Although Montesquieu in the eighteenth century was regarded as a great thinker , he does not figure much today in discussions of political theory .
Most people view him as a figure merely of historical interest .
Rahe shows that the modern view is seriously mistaken : Montesquieu offered a penetrating discussion of the problems of modern political regimes .
Montesquieu in Considerations on the Causes of the Greatness of the Romans and Their Decline rejected both the desirability and possibility of a modern return to the virtue characteristic of classical antiquity , with its preeminent stress on military valor .
The point that Montesquieu intended to make is clear enough .
We should not want to imitate the Romans …
And even if for some perverse reason we wanted to imitate the Romans , he then demonstrates in his Universal Monarchy , we could not succeed .
( p. 7 )
Instead , a commercial society , of which England was the foremost example , offered the best prospects for a flourishing social order under modern conditions .
England , though ostensibly ruled by a king , was in fact a " republic concealed under the form of a monarchy " ( p. 37 ) .
Unlike a genuine monarchy , it aimed at liberty and economic prosperity and demanded no particular virtue from the people .
It by no means followed from the success of English society , though , that the people in it lived in contentment .
Quite the contrary , they found themselves in an anxious state , which Montesquieu termed " inquiétude . "
With characteristic erudition , Rahe traces this notion to the Jansenist Blaise Pascal and his disciple Pierre Nicole .
They held that after the Fall , human beings were in the grip of concupiscence .
Though a malign emotion , it could simulate the effects of the virtues and produce , in unintended fashion , a workable society .
Nicole devoted a seminal essay suggesting that Christian charity is politically and socially superfluous — that , in its absence , thanks to the particular providence of God , l'amour propre is perfectly capable of providing a foundation for the proper ordering of civil society , of the political order , and of human life in this world more generally .
( p. 43 )
Montesquieu , following Montaigne , secularized this notion ; here we have a principal source of Bernard Mandeville 's view that private vices were public benefits and more generally , of the Scottish Enlightenment concept of the unintended consequences of human action .
In the modern world , then , we can obtain a tolerable , though not ideal , order by following the English model .
But a danger threatens this happy outcome : in certain circumstances , the executive might seize control of the reins of power and transform society into a despotic system .
In Montesquieu 's judgment , the legislature within a modern republic would be in serious danger of succumbing fully to executive influence only in the unlikely event that the management of commerce and industry within that republic were somehow , to a very considerable extent , entrusted to the executive .
In such a polity should the populace in general and the middle class in particular ever be beholden to government for their economic well - being , the situation of the citizens would indeed be grim .
( p. 58 )
To prevent this transition to despotism , it is essential to preserve the intermediate powers , such as the nobility and clergy , who can interpose their authority between the central government and the people .
Without these powers , the executive may take control , in the manner just described .
The course of French history prior to the 1789 illustrates an analogous transition , though in a monarchy rather than a republic .
Under Louis XIV and his successors , the power of the nobility to resist royal authority had been suppressed ; the ensuing growth of an all - powerful central state helped bring about the revolution , as a reaction against the state 's excesses .
Malesherbes , a highly placed liberal aristocrat and close reader of Montesquieu , warned Louis XVI of the dangers of undue centralization , to no avail .
In the Grandes Remonstrances of 1775 , Malesherbes and his colleagues on the Cour des aides charged " that the system of administration put in place by Louis XIV and further developed under Louis XV had made of the French monarchy an ' Oriental despotism ' . "
Malesherbes , who was executed under the Revolution for his defense of Louis XVI , was Tocqueville 's great - grandfather , and like his ancestor , Tocqueville continued the line of analysis begun by Montesquieu .
Before turning to Tocqueville , Rahe discusses another figure much influenced by Montesquieu .
Jean - Jacques Rousseau took much of his criticism of bourgeois society from Montesquieu , but his remedy differed entirely from that of his great predecessor .
Rousseau embraced the classical ideal that Montesquieu rejected :
Montesquieu 's description of the ancient republics and his analysis of their character Rousseau thought entirely just , but he did not share the misgivings that had caused the French philosopher to devote so much effort to assessing the virtues and prospects of monarchy and the peculiar form of government found in England .
In fact , the very features of classical republicanism that had occasioned such misgivings on Montesquieu 's part were the features that Rousseau found most attractive .
( p. 120 )
Despite his praise for the ancient city , though , Rousseau as well as Montesquieu doubted whether it would be possible to recreate such a regime in the modern world .
The conditions for doing so were so demanding as to render the task in effect impossible .
As we have already seen , Rahe wishes sharply to contrast the political theory of the modern age with classical republicanism .
He can carry out this endeavor by treating Rousseau as an exception ; but , as one might anticipate , he views with disfavor attempts by J.G.A. Pocock and others in the Cambridge School to find a classical republican tradition at the heart of early modern political theory .
He devotes a mordant note to the view he opposes :
Today , to a remarkable degree , these arguments [ of Rousseau ] infect contemporary scholarship on republican thought before Rousseau , much of which consists in an ill - conceived attempt to read Rousseau 's distinctive vision back into Machiavelli , the republican thought of the English interregnum , and English Whiggery more generally ; for one such attempt , see J.G.A. Pocock , The Machiavellian Moment … and for another , consider the various works by Quentin Skinner . ( p. 310 , note 56 )
Though a close reader of Rousseau , Tocqueville did not share his quixotic admiration for the classical republic .
To the contrary , Tocqueville is for Rahe , " Montesquieu 's heir . "
Like Montesquieu , he deplored the growth of administrative centralism in France .
America , by contrast , was marked by strong emphasis on local institutions and was thus better able than France to reconcile the revolutionary impulse toward equality with liberty .
( Tocqueville was not entirely optimistic about America either . )
Rahe maintains that , despite its ostensible subject , Democracy in America really was intended as an intervention in French politics :
Democracy in America constitutes a muted polemic — designed first and foremost for consideration by his contemporaries .
The warnings that he issued with regard to the propensities inherent in the democratic social condition were directed to them ; and when he singled out various aspects of American life as portents of doom or as harbingers of hope , he nearly always did so with an eye to the presence of the former and the absence of the latter in his native France .
( p. 222 )
Unfortunately , a concerted political movement that began in the nineteenth century and continued in the twentieth has undermined the guards against despotism in America that Tocqueville analyzed .
The progressives demanded efficiency in government and spurned traditional American practices as obstacles on the path to needed reforms .
The foundations for the administrative state were laid … in and after the 1870s and 1880s , in the thinking of a group of exceptional individuals , for the most part university professors , who regarded the separation of powers , the system of checks and balances , the federalist system , and the primacy of local government — the very features in American institutions that had most powerfully elicited Tocqueville 's admiration — as hopelessly archaic .
( p. 244 )
Rahe stresses the role of Woodrow Wilson in the progressives ' takeover of the American system .
Wilson , an ardent admirer of the Prussian administrative state , had no use for Montesquieu .
The notion of checks and balances , he held , reflected an outdated mechanical philosophy .
Biology , not physics , must be our guide ; and an " organic " view of the state must replace limited government .
Rahe also notes that Wilson " gave white supremacy a tremendous boost " ( p250 ) by his patronage of D.W. Griffith 's The Birth of A Nation .
Franklin Roosevelt 's New Deal continued the progressive trend , and Rahe makes an especially valuable point in response to Roosevelt 's proclamation of a second , economic , Bill of Rights in 1944 .
Every item … that Roosevelt denominated a right is , of course , something intrinsically desirable and good ; every item is arguably an element within the " happiness " that the Founding Fathers expected most Americans to pursue .
But in their day , and in Tocqueville 's as well , it was taken for granted that no one had a " right " to such goods …
Moreover , at the time of the founding , Americans believed — and no one more fervently than Thomas Jefferson — that the expansion in centralized administration necessary to guarantee " equality in the pursuit of happiness " and requisite for the provision of such goods was incompatible with the political rights that Roosevelt would later list in his message to Congress .
Tocqueville was of the same opinion .
( p. 261 )
Hayek of course argued to the same effect in The Road to Serfdom , and Rahe 's great achievement is to show that this type of criticism has its origins in Montesquieu and Tocqueville .
He has , moreover , accomplished his task with extraordinary erudition .
This is a major work of scholarship that everyone should read .
Rahe'sMontesquieu
I have noted a few minor points :
When he speaks of Louis XIV 's aspirations for " universal monarchy in Europe " in the War of Spanish Succession ( p. 3 ) , he should , I think , take account of the revisionist scholarship of Mark Thompson on the war .
It is not altogether correct to refer to " the Estates - General in its traditional form as three separate assemblies " ( p. 146 ) ; the three estates had in the past sometimes , but not always , deliberated separately .
Roosevelt was Wilson 's assistant secretary of the navy , not secretary ( p. 252 ) .
The intent of the stimulus program was to pump money into the economy quickly , and many members of Congress said at the time of its passage that speed was of the essence .
But the huge program has been a challenge to administer for both a new administration and for states and local governments grappling with their own fiscal problems .
Some states and cities are beginning to complain that the money has yet to reach them .
Others have been slow to get their paperwork to Washington ; Virginia has yet to send the Transportation Department its list of road projects .
At the same time , some economists have questioned the administration ’s claims that the bill has saved or created 150,000 jobs .
Obama administration officials , however , say the pace of the stimulus program is on schedule , and even if the federal checks are not yet in the mail the effects of the stimulus are beginning to reverberate : the promise of the federal money has been enough to get states to start construction work and to retain some jobs that were in jeopardy .
Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. , who writes in a report on the stimulus bill to be released this week that it remains “ ahead of schedule in most programs , ” said in a telephone interview Tuesday that the bill was helping people grapple with the recession , getting money to the states and into the economy , and laying a foundation for long - term aspirations like high - speed rail .
SAN FRANCISCO ( Reuters ) - California , which is struggling to close a $ 24.3 billion budget gap , faces the prospect of a “ multi- notch ” downgrade in its credit rating if the state ’s legislature fails to act quickly to produce a budget , Moody ’s Investors Service warned on Friday .

Moody ’s decision to place California ’s general obligation debt on alert for a possible “ multi- notch ” downgrade stunned state officials .
The state ’s current A2 credit rating is Moody ’s sixth - highest investment grade and makes California the lowest rated of the 50 states .
The A2 rating is just five notches above speculative status and Moody ’s raised the potential for the rating to tumble toward “ junk ” status if lawmakers fail to quickly produce a budget for Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger to sign .
“ If the legislature does not take action quickly , the state ’s cash situation will deteriorate to the point where the controller will have to delay most non-priority payments in July , ” Moody ’s said in a statement .
“ Lack of action could result in a multi - notch downgrade , ” Moody ’s added .
“ I cannot remember reading a ratings note that raised the specter of a multi - notch downgrade , ” said H.D. Palmer , a spokesman for Schwarzenegger on state finance matters .
“ It ’s another clear warning from the financial markets that there will be substantial and costly consequences if the legislature does not send the governor a budget that he can sign . ”
A downgrade could push California ’s borrowing costs up at time when state officials expect to issue up to $ 9 billion in revenue anticipation notes as soon as possible after a budget agreement is notched -- a deal whose timing is in doubt .
Moody ’s said California ’s leasing debt and other state - related debt are also on review , affecting a total of $ 72 billion of debt .
STATE FINANCES A MESS
Moody ’s cited California ’s expected massive budget gap for fiscal 2010 of more than 20 percent of its general fund budget ; warnings by the state controller that without budget solutions the state will not be able to meet all its financial obligations in July ; continued political stalemate , and the limited options .
Schwarzenegger and lawmakers face the task of closing a $ 24.3 billion budget deficit for the state ’s fiscal year beginning on July 1 .
The gap was opened by the state ’s most severe drop in revenues since the Great Depression , including a steep drop in personal income taxes and sagging retail activity as consumers reined in spending , and the long - running downturn in housing .
Rising joblessness is also weighing on the state .
Its unemployment rate jumped to 11.5 percent in May from 6.8 percent a year earlier , state officials reported on Friday .
The UCLA Anderson Forecast unit said earlier this week that the state economy would grow at more normal levels by the beginning of 2011 , but will not create enough jobs to push the jobless rate below double digits until the end of that year .
Standard & Poor ’s on Monday placed California on review for a possible downgrade , also citing concerns about the state ’s fiscal stress .
Spreads on California general obligation debt have widened as the state ’s budget crisis has worsened .
Since May 1 , the yield on the five - year California GO scale is up 92 basis points , compared with a rise of 41 basis points for the five - year benchmark Municipal Market Data triple - A scale .
The warnings by the rating agencies may scare off some investors from holding the state ’s debt , said Lawrence Glazer , managing partner of Mayflower Advisors in Boston .
“ It appears that California will have some unpleasant decisions ahead of them .
... A scary headline is probably enough to shake some investors out of their positions in the State of California . ”
On the other hand , California ’s strained finances may attract investors looking for risk premium .
“ Some investors will look at buying and getting a yield advantage from California , ” he said .
The difficulties of Palestinian life in the West Bank have been well documented : Israeli military checkpoints , a rising separation barrier and Israeli settlers .
But in this area , the problems are more acute .
The Palestinians , many of them Bedouin , are exceptionally poor , and the land they bought decades ago is under threat by a group of unusually aggressive local settlers .
The settlers have been filmed beating up Palestinians .
Settlers have been killed by Palestinians .
But Mr. Nawi said that the law inevitably sided with the Israelis , and that occupation meant there could be no equity .

“ The settlers keep the Palestinian farmers from their land by harassing them , and then after several years they say the land has not been farmed so by law it is no longer theirs , ” Mr. Nawi said .
“ We are only here to stop that from happening . ”
That is not the view of the settlers .
“ He is a troublemaker , ” asserted Yehoshua Mor -Yosef , a spokesman for Israeli settler communities in the area .
“ It ’s true that from time to time there is a problem of some settlers coming out of their settlements to cause problems .
But people like Nawi do n’t want a solution .
Their whole aim is to cause trouble . ”
True or not , Mr. Nawi is now in trouble .
Having spent several short stints in jail for his activism over the years , he now faces the prospect of a long one .
He is due to be sentenced Wednesday for assaulting an Israeli policeman two years ago during a confrontation over an attempt to demolish Palestinians ’ shacks on disputed land on the West Bank .
The policeman said Mr. Nawi struck him during that encounter .
Mr. Nawi denied it , but in March a judge convicted him .
What is left of the Israeli left is rallying around him , arguing that Mr. Nawi is a known pacifist who would not have raised his hand against anyone .
“ Since I ’ve known the man for decades and seen him in action in many extreme situations , I ’m certain that the charge is untrue , ” David Shulman , a Hebrew University professor and peace activist , wrote in the newspaper Haaretz .
Of Mr. Nawi , he added , “ He is a man committed , in every fiber of his being , to nonviolent protest against the inequities of the occupation . ”
Mr. Nawi attributes his activism to two things : as a teenager , his family lived next door to the leader of Israel ’s Communist Party , Reuven Kaminer , who influenced him .
And he is gay .
Not too long ago , Christopher Hitchens was busying himself justifying George W. Bush , the neocons , and the Iraq war ” er , “ liberation ”  ” on avowedly Marxian grounds .
( It would seem justifying Dubya , Frumy , and Wolfowitz requires some kind to recourse of Marxism . )
And the columnist was rewarded with the warm embrace of the flagship of American conservatism .
In the Age of Obama , Hitch has himself been liberated from the burden of Left - neocon triangulation and can now just write about how much he loves Marx .
And something seems to be in the air .
For just last week , the President of France , Nicolas Sarkozy , who arrived on the scene in 2007 as a Team America neocon idol , has been spied paging through a dog- eared copy of Das Kapital .
( Perhaps now the Maoist French philosopher Alain Badiou might want to rethink his claim that after the election of Sarko , the global human subject ceased to exist . )
This great dialectical reversal , or return to roots , or outburst of honesty , or whatever is happening , portends a coming bombardment of articles and books on why Karl Marx “ matters ” ” perhaps “ now more than ever ”  ” and how the bearded sage has finally been proven right by the collapse of the Lehman Bros. investment bank .
From out the woodwork will come legions of professors with endowed chairs in polysci and “ literature , ”  all eager to exact revenge for the “   End of History ”  triumphalism they had to endure for the past 15 years .
Foreign Policy magazine , the organ of the Carnegie Endowment for Peace , is out in front of the pack on these matters , and so here we go :
The economic crisis has spawned a resurgence of interest in Karl Marx .
Worldwide sales of Das Kapital have shot up ( one lone German publisher sold thousands of copies in 2008 , compared with 100 the year before ) , a measure of a crisis so broad in scope and devastation that it has global capitalism ” and its high priests ” in an ideological tailspin .
Yet even as faith in neoliberal orthodoxies has imploded , why resurrect Marx ?
To start , Marx was far ahead of his time in predicting the successful capitalist globalization of recent decades .
He accurately foresaw many of the fateful factors that would give rise to today ’s global economic crisis : what he called the “ contradictions ”  inherent in a world comprised of competitive markets , commodity production , and financial speculation .
Penning his most famous works in an era when the French and American revolutions were less than a hundred years old , Marx had premonitions of AIG and Bear Stearns trembling a century and a half later .
He was singularly cognizant of what he called the “ most revolutionary part ”  played in human history by the bourgeoisie ” those forerunners of today ’s Wall Street bankers and corporate executives .
As Marx put it in The Communist Manifesto , “  The bourgeoisie cannot exist without constantly revolutionizing the instruments of production , and thereby relations of production , and with them the whole relations of society .
. . .
In one word , it creates a world after its own image .
“ Contradictions ”  inherent in capitalism , eh ?
The author of the above paragraphs , Canadian tenured radical Leo Panitch , doesn ” t exactly explain how our current woes were caused by the immiseration of the working class or a crisis of overproduction , or any of the economic concepts Marx actually wrote about ” suffice it to say that he saw it all coming .
Well … I think Marx is a highly relevant thinker to the present age ”  but then not because the Labor Theory of Value reveals much of anything about the current crisis .
First off , pace Panitch , Marx actually had a great deal of admiration for the bourgeoisie , whom he praised for transforming the means of production ( that is , manufacturing and technology , not exactly the financial instruments of today ’s Wall Streeters . )
Marx dreamed that the world the industrialists made might soon canvas the entire globe , wiping away the last remnants of traditional , pre-modern social orders ” and then , just in time , collapse so that a communistic society could arise .
It ’s a worldview very unlike that of contemporary radicals , or at least the people one meets at WTO and Davos protests , most all of whom view “ capitalism ”  as categorically evil and soul - destroying , and something which , if it ’s not stopped right away , might raise ocean levels to the point that authenticity in the Third World is washed away .
Contempo Marxism ’s milder , more bureaucratic practitioners might only want global capitalism with a human face , not revolution , but they , too , view industrial development as a practice of strictly limited value , and which should be capped and controlled whenever possible .
Marx , on the other hand , is a bright - eyed futurist ( his forecasts of collapse not withstanding ) , and in the few passages in which he describes utopia , it ’s a techno Wonderland in which working people are fishermen in the morning , literary critics by mid afternoon , the division of labor rendered unnecessary .
Marx has more in common with the Silicon Valley guru who waxes lyrical about the revolutionary possibilities of Twitter than he does with the current “ far Left , ”  which has oddly embraced the ascetic ideal and low - flush toilets .
Spiked ‘s Brendan O ” Neill , who can rightly call himself a Marxist , is one of the few on the Left to have properly understood “ austerity chic “  and the life - hating animus behind “ green , ”  a worldview in which ” 
Can I recycle my granny ? ” is a major eco-dilemma .
And pace Panitch again , the heroic , world - transforming bourgeoisie of Marx ’s imagination is not particularly well represented by today ’s Wall Street banksters .
And in turn , the financial instruments that got them in trouble , “ mortgage - backed securities , ”  “ collaterized debt obligations , ”  etc. , are expressions of the absence of capitalism ( as Marx and other Classical economists understood it ) in America rather than its triumph .
To understand this , one should ask why Wall Street needed to cook up a derivatives market for mortgages to finance the housing boom in the first place .
The answer is simply that there was n’t enough real credit .
Capitalism ( before it destroys your soul and disenchants the world ) is about delaying consumption and investing savings ( that is , “ capital ”  ) in future production .
Put simply , you put your money in the bank , which , in turn , loans it out to someone who plans to make stuff .
The problem is that for the past 25 years , Americans ”  rate of personal savings has dwindled to zero , finally going negative in 2005 .
No savings means no capital means no capitalism , and the securitization process was the only way the massive expansion of mortgage credit was possible .
To a large extent , the lack of savings resulted from the fact that prices were inflated upwards at such a clip that wages and salaries couldn ” t keep up .
But much of this has to do as well with America ’s emergence in the twenty - first century as a post - bourgeois social order .
The Protestant Work Ethic of delayed gratification had given way to “  Your Best Life Now ! , ”  saving was replaced with credit - card binging at the megamall .
The middle classes began resorting to house flipping and home - equity loans as sources of income , or as ways of funding their totally awesome lifestyles ; the lower orders were , in turn , funneled into the heavily socialized healthcare industry .
( Between 2001 - 2006 , healthcare added 1.7 million jobs , the rest of the private sector , zippo ; healthcare ’s now the only sector besides government that isn” t shrinking ) .
On the whole , Americans were redeployed into industries that were either financed by massive deficit spending on the part of the government ( healthcare ) or unsustainable government - induced credit expansion ( the housing boom ) .
Or if you were really lucky , you got a job in finance .
As Addison Wiggin has documented , the steady growth of GDP over the past decade was purchased by taking on more and more and more debt : “  Under Mr. Greenspan ’s term , U.S. credit and debt added up to $ 8.505 trillion .
That means it took $ 4.80 of new debt to create one dollar of GDP .
And now , with the burden of U.S. credit and debt up to 9.149 trillion under his successor , Ben Bernanke , it will take more than $ 5 to create one dollar of GDP . ” 
These diminishing returns should be pretty alarming to our government leaders , as in the past months we ” ve added an additional 2 trillion of debt and gotten negative 6 percent GDP growth out the other end .
We ” re only now facing a full - blown economic crisis , but capitalism collapsed quite some time ago .
What has replaced capitalism in America isn ” t quite communism …
But that doesn ” t mean there aren ” t aspects of the American system that wouldn ” t positively recommend themselves to Karl Marx .
Long , long before the TEA party protestors and the Texas governor were outraged over Barack Obama ’s “ socialist ”  tendencies , America had already implemented no less than five of the ten necessary components of a worker ’s social order outlined by Marx and Engels in The Manifesto : the progressive income tax , centralization of credit in the banks of the state ( Federal Reserve System ) , agricultural policy , and compulsory public education .
And Washington now seems close to checking off Numero Uno on the list ”  the abolition of real property rights in land and the “ application of all rents of land to public purposes ”  ”  with its recent intervention in the housing market , breaking contracts that only years before it spurred lenders to make .
Since the fall of the Soviet Union , American “ liberals ”  were referring less often to “ market failures , ”  and instead had begun pursuing what Peter Brimelow has called “ neo - socialism “  : Government wouldn ” t so much correct market inefficiencies as harness capitalism in order to expand “ diversity ”  and equality ” 
 George W. Bush ’s attempt to institute affirmative action in “ subprime ”  mortgage lending being the example par excellence .
Neosocialism .
Retrosocialism .
At this point , it looks like bureaucrats will get to experiment with a little bit of both .
It ’s only dumb Marxists like Professor Panitch who are oblivious to these developments , and instead prattle on about how the Ã¼ber - capitalist USA might , in its moment of crisis , learn something from its intellectual adversary , Karl Marx .
Take , for instance , one of Panitch ’s supposedly “ radical ” 
Marxist proposal , which was “ ironically ”  put forth by an insider of the current financial system :
Ironically , one of the most radical proposals making the rounds today has come from an economist at the London School of Economics , Willem Buiter , a former member of the Bank of England ’s Monetary Policy Committee and certainly no Marxist .
Buiter has proposed that the whole financial sector be turned into a public utility .
Because banks in the contemporary world cannot exist without public deposit insurance and public central banks that act as lenders of last resort , there is no case , he argues , for their continuing existence as privately owned , profit - seeking institutions .
Instead they should be publicly owned and run as public services .
Yet what exactly is “ too big to fail ”  ” or the 96 - 4 % “ public - private partnerships “  
Tim Geithner has invited hedge funds to take part in ” other than a transformation of the financial industry into a sort of public - spirited social service ?
This isn” t to say that certain people don” t profit , mightily , by gaming the bailout system .
But when Ben Bernanke and Hank Paulson sat down former Bank of America CEO Ken Lewis last September and essentially ordered him to purchase Merrill Lynch ” and commit obvious insurance fraud ”  the Fed Chairman ’s and Secretary of the Treasury ’s motives were entirely “ patriotic . ” 
Even if the whole thing amounted to welfare for the rich , and even if massive corruption was inevitable , the pair of bankers were attempting , quite genuinely , to “ save capitalism ”  with a new social program .
In both an expansion of government and a coup d ” Ã©tat by big finance , Wall Street and Washington highjacked one another .
It ’s a transformation that ’s difficult , if not impossible , to undo .
And I seriously doubt it will be before the United States goes the way of the Soviet Union .
George , call the exterminator - we seem to have zombies in the backyard again !

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Americans strongly support fundamental changes to the healthcare system and a move to create a government - run insurance plan to compete with private insurers , according to a New York Times / CBS News poll published on Saturday .
The poll came amid mounting opposition to plans by the Obama administration and its allies in the Democratic - controlled Congress to push through the most sweeping restructuring of the U.S. healthcare system since the end of World War Two .
Republicans and some centrist Democrats oppose increasing the government ’s role in healthcare -- it already runs the Medicare and Medicaid systems for the elderly and indigent -- fearing it would require vast public funds and reduce the quality of care .
But the Times / CBS poll found 85 percent of respondents wanted major healthcare reforms and most would be willing to pay higher taxes to ensure everyone had health insurance .
An estimated 46 million Americans currently have no coverage .
Seventy - two percent of those questioned said they backed a government - administered insurance plan similar to Medicare for those under 65 that would compete for customers with the private sector .
Twenty percent said they were opposed .
President Barack Obama and many Democrats in Congress have argued a publicly run healthcare insurance plan would increase competition and drive down the high cost of care at a time when the U.S. economy is mired in a deep recession .
Republicans argue a public plan would drive insurers out of business and lead to a government - run healthcare system .
Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives suggested this week that all Americans should be able to get insurance regardless of medical history and that coverage should be mandatory for individuals and businesses .
The proposal , contained in the latest House draft of the healthcare bill , would create new insurance exchanges where people shop around for health coverage .
Whether a government - run plan has a role in such an exchange has spurred serious political debate .
Republicans , the minority party in Congress , have proposed more modest healthcare changes , but lack the votes in the House or Senate to push them through or derail the Democrats ’ health reform drive .
They have warned about the expected high cost of restructuring the healthcare system , projected at more than $ 1.5 trillion -- a huge expense for a nation carrying record budget deficits .
The Republicans also hope to gain traction by playing on fears a vast expansion of government could further hurt the economy and reduce the quality of medical care .
The poll found that people were uneasy about heightened government involvement in the healthcare sector , with 77 percent saying they were very or somewhat satisfied with the quality of their own care .
A total of 895 adults participated in the telephone survey , which was conducted from June 12 to 16 and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points .
The FBI e-mail -- dated May 22 , 2004 -- followed disclosures about abuse of Iraqi detainees at Abu Ghraib prison and sought guidance on whether FBI agents in Iraq were obligated to report the U.S. military ’s harsh interrogation of inmates when that treatment violated FBI standards but fit within the guidelines of a presidential executive order .
According to the e-mail , Bush ’s executive order authorized interrogators to use military dogs , " stress positions , " sleep " management , " loud music and " sensory deprivation through the use of hoods , etc. " to extract information from detainees in Iraq , which was considered a violation of the Geneva Conventions .
Bush has never before been directly linked to authorizing specific interrogation techniques at Guantanamo or Abu Ghraib .
Bush has admitted , however , that he personally signed off on the waterboarding of three " high - value " prisoners .
Leopold notes that previously the Bush White House ( in the person of Alberto Gonzales ) stated in 2004 , " The president has not directed the use of specific interrogation techniques . "
But the Senate Armed Services report on Department of Defense treatment of prisoners did note that at the very least it was President Bush himself whose February 7,2002 Executive Memorandum denying al - Qaeda and the Taliban Geneva protections , " opened the door " to torture and abuse of prisoners .
While Jason is writing a news article and can't call Bush and Gonzales liars , I can .
The FBI memo is clear evidence of such an executive order .
The FBI agents are writing for clarification of what constitutes reportable " abuse , " since they have been ordered to report abuse to their superiors .
From the memo :
Our questions relate to the instruction in the EC to report abuse .
The EC states that if " an FBI employee knows or suspects non-FBI personnel has abused or is abusing or mistreating a detainee , the FBI employee must report the incident .
This instruction begs the question of what constitutes " abuse . "
We assume this does not include lawful interrogation techniques authorized by Executive Order .
We are aware that prior to a revision in policy last week , an Executive Order signed by President Bush authorized the following interrogation techniques among others sleep " management , " use of MWDs ( military working dogs ) , " stress positions " such as half squats , " environmental manipulation " such as the use of loud music , sensory deprivation through the use of hoods , etc .
We assume the OGC instruction does not include the reporting of these authorized interrogation techniques , and that the use of these techniques does not constitute " abuse . "
In a posting earlier today , Emptywheel noted that the FBI memo above was also quoted in the Department of Justice Inspector General Report on FBI involvement in detainee interrogations .
Looking at the report , I noticed that there was a follow - up to the agent 's request , which ended up on the desk of the FBI General Counsel , Valerie E. Caproni :
Does it answer his question to say that conduct that is known to be authorized need not be reported ?
Shame on the FBI agents who wrote this memo , and shame on the FBI higher - ups who hid behind terms like " lawful " or " authorized " for what are clearly abusive torture techniques .
While noting they would still report physical beatings , sexual humiliation " or other conduct clearly constituting abuse , " the effect of the Bush EO was to draw indefinable lines between torture and " harsh " abuse .
Apparently these agents were unaware that even " cruel , inhumane , and degrading " treatment is outlawed by both the Geneva Convention and the Convention Against Torture , treaties to which the U.S. is signatory , and are law in the United States .
Clearly , Bush was unaware or uncaring of such facts , having used his attorneys to cook up bogus legal opinions for the ongoing torture he had already ordered .
The consequences of Bush 's torture program are incalculable , from the loss of international trust , to the decay of law , both at home and abroad .
Of course , there is the damage to the tortured themselves .
PHR wrote a great book , Broken Laws , Broken Lives , on how torture affects its victims .
But here , I only want to point out how it affected just one of Bush 's torture victims , Abu Zubaydah , who was waterboarded 83 times , and who was never the Al Qaeda mastermind the administration claimed he was .
He was tortured so he could cough up a ( false ) link between Al Qaeda and Saddam Hussein , in order to provide a cause for war for the bellicose Bush administration .
How 's Zubaydah doing today ?
Years now let out of his CIA prison , and held still at Guantanamo , even months after Obama determined the prison should close , let this description by Joseph Margulies in the Los Angeles Times today on Zubaydah 's current condition serve as an epitaph for this article , if not for this nation 's soul :
Partly as a result of injuries he suffered while he was fighting the communists in Afghanistan , partly as a result of how those injuries were exacerbated by the CIA and partly as a result of his extended isolation , Abu Zubaydah 's mental grasp is slipping away .
Today , he suffers blinding headaches and has permanent brain damage .
He has an excruciating sensitivity to sounds , hearing what others do not .
The slightest noise drives him nearly insane .
In the last two years alone , he has experienced about 200 seizures .
But physical pain is a passing thing .
The enduring torment is the taunting reminder that darkness encroaches .
Already , he cannot picture his mother 's face or recall his father 's name .
Gradually , his past , like his future , eludes him .
If a monarch leader who orders torture cannot be prosecuted for this heinous crime , then what hope is there left for our society ?

The European Commission will proceed with its antitrust case against Microsoft regardless of the announcement late Thursday that the software giant is stripping its browser , Internet Explorer ( IE ) , from the next incarnation of its operating system , Windows 7 , in Europe .
The Commission has accused Microsoft of stealing an unfair advantage for IE by tying , or bundling it in with Windows since 1996 .
[ Microsoft had hoped to avoid further antitrust trouble with its move to sell Windows 7 in Europe without a browser .

Keep up on the day 's tech news headlines with InfoWorld 's Today 's Headlines : First Look newsletter and InfoWorld Daily podcast . ]
Europe 's top antitrust regulator said in a statement released overnight that it " notes with interest " Microsoft 's statement , which was made in a blog post late Thursday in the United States .
But the EC said it would proceed with the case and draw up a remedy that allows computer users " genuine consumer choice . "
" At the level of both computer manufacturers and retail sales , the Commission 's statement of objections ( SO ) suggested that consumers should be provided with a genuine choice of browsers .
Given that over 95 percent of consumers acquire Windows pre-installed on a PC , it is particularly important to ensure consumer choice through the computer manufacturer channel , " the statement said .
Stripping out IE from Windows " may potentially be positive , " the statement said , as this would allow original equipment manufacturers to offer their customers PCs with a browser of their choice , whether it be IE or a rival browser such as Opera , Mozilla 's Firefox , Google 's Chrome or Apple 's Safari .
However , the statement was less positive about the effect on direct sales of Windows to consumers .
" Rather than more choice , Microsoft seems to have chosen to provide less , " it said .
Opera , a Norwegian browser whose complaint to the European Commission at the end of 2007 sparked the antitrust investigation in the first place , welcomed Microsoft 's move but said it was just a step in the right direction .
Its lawyer , Thomas Vinje , who also represents a trade group called ECIS that speaks for software giants IBM , Oracle , and many other Microsoft rivals , said in an e-mail that Microsoft 's action " is an acknowledgement of the validity of the Commission 's case against it . "
Vinje added that stripping out IE from Windows does not go far enough .
" Microsoft must now give users real choice , and not only buyers of new computers , but also existing users .
Microsoft should provide a ballot screen through which both existing users and buyers of new PCs can easily select and get a browser of their choice , " he said .
He also pointed out that Microsoft must be punished for tying IE into Windows for over a decade .
This morning at a breakfast briefing seminar held at the City offices of corporate lobbyists Hanover Communications , Kevin Maguire was the star turn giving the assembled spin-doctors and fee paying clients the benefit of his insight derived from his years of service to Gordon Brown and Damian McBride , the former Downing Street press adviser , who was Kevin ’s long time drinking partner .
When the cappuccino supping Maguire was asked by one of the croissant chewing seminar participants if there was any possible way Gordon Brown could win the general election his smirking reply was :
“ The only way Gordon Brown can win the general election is if Madeleine McCann ’s body is found in David Cameron ’s garage . ”
Kevin has previous for this sort of tasteless innuendo – he was the key source for the Smeargate stories that were intended to be used by Damian McBride , Derek Draper and Charlie Whelan to smear David Cameron , George Osborne ’s wife and other leading Tories .
The sheer hypocrisy of Kevin Maguire is breathtaking .
He talks down to the readers of the Mirror , telling them Gordon can win while at the same time telling high powered corporate insiders that Brown is finished .
The Mirror was at the forefront of the campaign to find Maddy , Maguire just thinks it is a joke .
When Guido contacted our Kev’ this afternoon he made no effort to apologise or express any regret .
A teenage twitcher and a small buff - coloured songbird called the whinchat were the keys that turned the Iron Curtain 's landscape of barbed wire , mined death strips and Kalashnikov - toting border guards into what is probably the most enduring green success story in Europe since the Cold War .
Two decades after its fall , the border between East and West Germany has already become Europe 's biggest nature reserve : an 858 - mile " ecological treasure trove " , no longer the Iron Curtain but the Green Belt , and home to more than 600 rare and endangered species of birds , mammals , plants and insects .
But when its creators mark its 20th birthday this year , they will also be celebrating the fact that 23 European countries are currently engaged in a project to make it nearly five times as long .
" The aim is to turn the Iron Curtain 's entire 4,250 - mile length – extending from the Arctic to the Black Sea – into what is already being called the ' Central European Green Belt ' , " says Dr Kai Frobel , a German ornithologist and conservationist .
He was the man who started it all back in 1970s .
In those days , it seemed impossible that the Berlin Wall might one day fall or that the Soviet empire could crumble .
But that was almost irrelevant to Frobel , now a leading member of the German nature protection group , Bund , but then a teenager from the West German village of Hassenberg , which stood nearly in the Iron Curtain 's shadow .
At 13 , he was an enthusiastic birdwatcher .
Equipped with a pair of pre-war Zeiss binoculars , a green army surplus parka , and heavy gumboots , he used to spend most of his free time in the hilly wooded countryside of his native northern Bavaria looking for new bird sightings , which he would record in his notebook .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Frequently his expeditions would take him close to Bavaria 's heavily fortified border with neighbouring communist East Germany .
" It was only about 400 yards from our village .
I grew up with the Iron Curtain .
For me it was almost normal , " he now recalls .
Frobel was less interested in the politics of the frontier than what it meant for the birds and other wildlife .
For despite its watchtowers , mines , miles of impenetrable fencing and stone - faced guards with orders to shoot would - be escapers on sight , the area was , for the most part , a weird oasis of calm .
The way the Iron Curtain was constructed had much to do with it .
In Germany it ran in a line more than 100 yards further east than the actual East - West border .
Another 100 yards even further east , there was another fence , and behind that , deeper still into the communist part , there was a so - called restricted zone , accessible only to residents , usually with good party credentials , but barred to the rest of the world .
Apart from the death strip , which was kept barren , the Iron Curtain remained almost untouched by human hand , or foot , for its entire 37 - year existence .
It rapidly turned into natural wilderness .
" No fertilisers were sprayed in the border zone .
It was full of small bushes and types of grass that had been wiped out elsewhere as a result of farming on an industrial scale , " says Frobel .
As a result , it was also an Shangri - La for threatened species of birds , mammals , insects and plants .
The whinchats seemed to derive the most profit from this environment .
The buff , black and white coloured songbird ( pictured ) , which is about 4.5 in long , migrates from southern Africa to northern Europe for only four months each summer .
Frobel noticed that the birds were to be found almost exclusively around the Iron Curtain .
" It was extraordinary , " he recalls .
" The whinchats would perform their courtship displays perched on the barbed wire .
When we later carried out a proper study , we found that 90 per cent of the birds ' nesting sites were on border territory . "
At the end of the 1970s , Frobel 's Iron Curtain whinchat study was the winning entry in a nature competition for local school students .
The findings aroused such interest among conservationists , and what was then Germany 's budding Green Party , that the Bavarian government started buying up countryside close to the Iron Curtain to prevent its being developed
By this time , Frobel 's wanderings , often at night , along the western side of the inner German border had turned him into the East German Stasi 's most renowned West German ornithologist .
His reputation grew when he began visiting his East German penfriend Gunter Berwing across the border .
His meetings with similarly minded ornithologists in the East were watched by the Stasi .
After the fall of the Berlin Wall , Frobel got hold of his Stasi file , which was an inch thick and codenamed " Alternative " .
The Stasi concluded that he was " abusing environmental issues to inspire alternative political activities intended to undermine the Warsaw Pact " .
Even in the mid-1980s , Frobel and his East German friends were convinced that they would never live to see the Iron Curtain fall .
" As the only East Germans allowed to travel to the West were pensioners , we calculated it would be at least 40 years before my friends could visit me , " he says .
But of course , the Wall did fall and Germany 's conservationists reacted extraordinarily quickly to ensure its ecological value was preserved .
In December 1989 , barely a month after the Berlin Wall was breached , conservationists from East and West met to hammer out a plan that was to lead to the creation of Europe 's largest and longest permanent nature reserve .
Germany 's Grünes Band or Green Belt stretches along the length of the former Iron Curtain from the Baltic to Bavaria 's borders with the Czech Republic .
It encompasses some 861 square miles and is home to hundreds of rare or threatened species such as the wild cat , black stork and otter .
More than half of Europe 's 25,000 red kites are to be found in Germany and most inhabit the Green Belt .
Up in the hills of Germany 's Thuringian Forest last week , the Green Belt was instantly recognisable because of the rash of bright green - leafed birches that have grown up along it over the past two decades .
The barbed wire and watchtowers of the former death strip have all gone .
The only visible trace is a seemingly endless tank track , constructed from perforated , and now weed - covered , concrete slabs .
An invisible trace is left by the last of the 1.3 million mines that used to litter the area .
The vast majority were removed but the German authorities say they still cannot guarantee that all the Green Belt is completely mine - free .
" This has its positive sides , " says Matthias Fanck , who is showing an exhibition on the Green Belt project in the former border town of Probstzella : " It means that tourists tend to stick to the paths and leave the nature reserve untouched . "
Twenty years on , the Green Belt has become an important part of Germany 's tourist industry .
At strategic points along its route , visitors can call a free mobile phone number and listen to witnesses ' accounts of what the border once was .
" It gives today 's generation of young Europeans an idea of what the Iron Curtain meant , " says Frobel .
And it 's perhaps no surprise that the Green Belt 's logo is a picture of a whinchat , wings outstretched and perched on top of an East German border post .
It 's no secret that , in Texas , " good for big business " often means " bad for workers . "
But this legislative session , there 's some union optimism about the home of tort reform .
Texas AFL - CIO spokesman Ed Sills called it " the first session in a very long time where labor has gotten to defend a lot of things , rather than defending against them . "
That said , the AFL - CIO has still had to fight off some anti-labor legislation .
Nationally , the big question is the fate of the federal Employee Free Choice Act , relaxing some of the extraordinary burdens placed on employees wanting to join a union .
At a state level as well , Sills said his union " killed some anti-Free Choice Act resolutions , " such as House Concurrent Resolution 64 by Rep. Carl Isett , R - Lubbock .
And when House Bill 1042 by Rep. Tan Parker , R - Flower Mound , came up before the House Tech­no­logy , Eco­nomic Development & Work­force Com­mit­tee , the AFL - CIO mobilized .
The bill proposed ending the requirement that the Texas Workforce Commission use contractors offering the prevailing wage rate if it is higher than federal minimum wage .
" We were able to pack the room , and that killed that in the House , " Sills said .
Labor legislation is not just about bills directly affecting the workplace .
Unions are eagerly watching the fate of children 's health insurance reform , while retired state employees and teachers are waiting to see whether the House proposal for a one - time payment ( known as the 13th check ) survives the budget process .
With many union members and nonmembers out of work , much attention was fixed on the ultimately unsuccessful push for unemployment insurance reform .
Senate Bill 1569 , the enabling legislation to get the extra $ 555 million in federal stimulus money , was stuck in House Calendars for a month .
( " Somebody tagged it , I guess , " explained sponsor Rep. Joe Deshotel , D - Beaumont . )
When it finally reached the House floor on May 26 , Republicans killed it by running out the clock for debate – a moot point , since Gov. Rick Perry would probably have vetoed it anyway .
So far , the biggest potential workplace victory could be HB 1657 , spurred by the controversial 2007 decision by the Texas Supreme Court in the case of Entergy Gulf States Inc. v. John Summers .
Summers , a contractor , was injured at an Entergy facility and sued the firm for negligence .
The court ruled against him , interpreting workers ' compensation law in an unprecedented manner to exempt the company from liability .
In the Senate at press time , the legislation clarifies the definitions of " general contractor " and " subcontractor " in workers ' compensation cases , closing the loophole the court had exploited .
It was only a partial victory for labor rights : Rep. Dan Gattis , R - Georgetown , said that while he still counts himself a tort reformer , the justices had clearly violated the legislative intent behind the current rules .
" I can not stand before you and accept a right - wing court making the law any more than I can stand before you and let a left - wing court make the law , " he told his fellow lawmakers .
The biggest defeat for workers ' rights could be over mesothelioma , a rare cancer caused by exposure to asbestos .
Business lobbyists have fought hard at the federal level to limit corporate liability for the disease , and tort - reform mavens like the Texas Civil Justice League and Texans for Lawsuit Reform fought against SB 1123 .
This bill simply provides a new legal standard to prove causation and liability , but after the Senate passed it 19 - 11 on April 20 , it stalled in the House Judiciary & Civil Jurisprudence Committee .
The bulk of workplace legislation focuses on attracting and developing jobs , and Sills lauds the current legislative paradigm : Incentivize to hire ; do n't incentivize to fire .
The principle applies particularly well to green - collar manufacturing .
He explained : " I think part of that is to catch the shift in the economy before it happens .
...
Someone entering business now is going to be the T. Boone Pickens of green jobs . "
He had particular praise for Austin Democrats Rep. Mark Strama and Sen. Kirk Watson , as well as for Sen .
Troy Fraser , R- Horseshoe Bay , for his solar - power incentives in SB 545 .
Although that fell victim to House chubbing , Sills applauded their consensus view that green - collar jobs " can be solid middle - class jobs . "

POP PSYCHOLOGY has long had a term for the political marriage between LGBT people and the Democrats -- it is a dysfunctional relationship .
The Democrats court the votes and money of gays and lesbians , but offer few gains and a stunning share of abuse in exchange .
For those LGBT activists wooed by the Democrats , ditching the more militant strategy that got Democrats swooning in the first place for a do n't - rock - the - boat approach is the price to play in this torturous display of unrequited love .
While we await the decision of the California Supreme Court on whether or not to uphold the anti-gay marriage Proposition 8 on May 26 , it is worth taking stock of the political strategy activists have largely adhered to in recent decades .
Collaboration with the Democrats , the so - called " party of the people , " has impeded progress , not helped it .
Thirty - five years have passed since gay civil rights legislation was first proposed in Congress .
Yet LGBT people remain an unprotected class of citizens by the U.S. Constitution .
Whereas the denial of the rights of gays to work for the federal government , for example , was carried out with the stroke of President Eisenhower 's pen in Executive Order 10450 in 1953 , no such swift action has been taken to overturn decades of institutional discrimination .
A demonstration against Prop 8 in the days following its passage in November ( Brian Cruz | SW )
Since the birth of the modern LGBT movement out of the Stonewall Riots in 1969 , the Democrats before Obama controlled the White House for 12 years under Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton .
For a lot of that time , both houses of Congress were controlled by Democrats as well .
But during this time , as well as under Republican administrations , the Democrats have been opportunist at best , and hostile at worst .
Little compares to the treachery of the Clinton administration .
A masterful public speaker capable of Academy Award - style performances of empathy , Clinton could famously " feel your pain , " but apparently could not alleviate any of it .
Clinton came into office promising an end to draconian laws against gays in the military .
He caved after four days and signed into law what is perhaps the only known order by a commander - in - chief for gays and lesbians to march back into the closet .
While initially perceived as a more benign form of discrimination , his policy -- known as " do n't ask , do n't tell , do n't pursue " -- has allowed for a witch - hunt of tens of thousands of military personnel and the discharge of more than 12,500 LGBT people from the military .
What you can do Supporters of equal marriage equality around the country are planning for either protests or celebrations when the California Supreme Court hands down its decision on Prop 8 on May 26 .
Go to DayOfDecision.com for information on events in your city .
Nearly six years into his presidency , Bill Clinton signed Executive Order 11478 providing partial relief for lesbian and gay federal employees - - not including the 3 million military personnel .
But his action left intact sodomy laws ( not overturned by the Supreme Court until 2003 ) , anti-same - sex marriage legislation ( which he signed ) and the military 's unequal status for LGBT people ( which he introduced ) , and it did n't take up the rights of those who are transgender ( who experience the highest rates of violence , unemployment and discrimination of any sexual minority ) .
All this exposes the severe limitations of the electoral route for winning civil rights for LGBT people .
TODAY , THERE'S something profoundly disturbing about Barack Obama , the son of a Black man and a white woman , using the racial segregationists ' call for " states ' rights " when it comes to same - sex marriage .
All the more so since the California court -- in initially overturning the state 's gay marriage ban in May 2008 and legalizing same - sex marriage until the passage of Prop 8 -- cited as precedent the 62 - year - old decision that overturned anti-miscegenation laws and opened the door for Obama 's own parents ' legal union .

If Barack Obama - - one of the most popular human beings on the face of the planet -- were to use his bully pulpit to push legislation ( or sign an executive order ) that would sweep away all institutional barriers to the freedoms and civil rights of LGBT people , it could be done .
That would be that .
LGBT folks would have formal equality -- as do women and Blacks -- and the state would no longer be able to lend its imprimatur to antigay bigotry .
But this is not going to happen without a massive mobilization of grassroots activists in the streets and sitting in -- to challenge the centers of power , including the Democrats at the helm .
Journalist Matt Bai , writing in the Sunday New York Times , cites a Quinnipiac poll showing that 60 percent of Americans under the age of 34 believe it is discriminatory to deny equal marriage rights -- and concludes that " the gay rights movement ... can now seem obsolete . "
Bai is wrong .
LGBT civil rights activists cannot operate as if we are the only ones trying to shape the debate in this country .
The right wing has proven time and again that it has the money , power and seemingly limitless ability to spew noxious lies in order to get its way .
Thus , opinion polls last fall showed Prop 8 was headed for defeat until the right mobilizaed a public campaign in California to discredit gay marriage as a threat to children and religious autonomy .
There is something tempting about the belief that LGBT civil rights like marriage are inevitable .
After all , even John McCain 's campaign adviser , Republican Steve Schmidt , has come out for gay marriage , and more and more politicians -- including Barack Obama -- stare at their shoes as they mumble that tired line about their belief that marriage is a union between one man and one woman .
Yeah , right .
But the public opinion that is gnawing away at the politicians has n't shifted on its own .
The increasingly positive poll numbers toward sexual minorities is a magnificent expression of how ordinary peoples ' actions , not those of politicians , can alter popular consciousness .
Decades of silence , hostility , equivocation and near paralysis by leading Democrats regarding LGBT civil rights is proof that protest and activism -- not pleading for whittled - down legislation and waiting for politicians -- is the route to progress .
Even in Illinois , the first state to overturn sodomy laws in 1961 , gay politicians like Greg Harris defend tepid , second - class legislation for civil unions over gay marriage as the more " realistic " strategy .
Harris ' bill , called the Illinois Religious Freedom Protection and Civil Union Act , even caves to lie that LGBT people are trying to force religious institutions to solemnize same - sex unions .
No church has ever been required to officiate at ceremonies it does n't agree with , nor will one ever be .
The hand - wringing language in this legislation is unnecessarily apologetic to the right .
In California , the statewide equality group , Equality California , is hemming and hawing over whether to even push for a new pro-gay marriage ballot measure in 2010 in the event that the state Supreme Court upholds Prop 8 .
The organization is wary of harming the Democrats ' midterm election chances , rather than demand they pass civil rights legislation .
Here , it 's useful to remember the words of historian Howard Zinn in a recent speech published at SocialistWorker.org :
Where progress has been made , wherever any kind of injustice has been overturned , it 's been because people acted as citizens , and not as politicians .
They did n't just moan .
They worked , they acted , they organized , they rioted if necessary .
To win equal marriage -- and pursue all other civil rights -- LGBT activists and our allies need to slap the Democrats with divorce papers and organize independently .
As sex advice columnist Dan Savage would put it : DTMFA -- dump the motherfucker already .
The Wikipedia editor in that case was Michael Moss , an investigative reporter at The Times and friend of Mr. Rohde who has written extensively about groups like Al Qaeda and the Taliban .
Like many Wikipedia editors , he adopted a user name that hid his true identity .
“ I knew from my jihad reporting that the captors would be very quick to get online and assess who he was and what he ’d done , what his value to them might be , ” he said .
“ I ’d never edited a Wikipedia page before . ”
With his editors ’ blessing , Mr. Moss had already made similar changes to Mr. Rohde ’s “ topic page ” on The Times ’s Web site , and in both cases he omitted the name of Mr. Rohde ’s former employer , because it contained the word Christian .
The Wikipedia page history shows that the next day , Nov. 13 , someone without a user name edited the entry on Mr. Rohde for the first time to include the kidnapping .
Mr. Moss deleted the addition , and the same unidentified user promptly restored it , adding a note protesting the removal .
The unnamed editor cited an Afghan news agency report .
In the first few days , at least two small news agencies and a handful of blogs reported the kidnapping .
Around that time , Catherine J. Mathis , the chief spokeswoman for the New York Times Company , called Mr. Wales and asked for his help .
Knowing that his own actions on Wikipedia draw attention , Mr. Wales turned to an administrator , one of several who would eventually become involved in monitoring and controlling the page .
On Nov. 13 , news of the kidnapping was posted and deleted four times within four hours , before an administrator blocked any more changes for three days .
On Nov. 16 , it was blocked again , for two weeks .
I know it ’s a tough competition , but this just might be the most hypocritical thing I ’ve seen in the past year :
On Monday , Sens. Jon Kyl ( R - AZ ) , Mitch McConnell ( R - KY ) , and Pat Roberts ( R - KS ) introduced the “ Preserving Access to Targeted , Individualized , and Effective New Treatments and Services ( PATIENTS )
Act of 2009 , ” a new bill prohibiting Medicare or Medicaid from using “ comparative effectiveness research to deny coverage . ”
How bad is it ?
Let me count the ways .
1. Politicians who rail against wasteful government spending are taking action to prevent the government from reining in … wasteful spending .
2. Politicians who warn that the burden of entitlements is killing the federal budget are stepping in to block … the single most painless route to reducing the growth of entitlements .
3 . They ’re doing it in the name of avoiding “ rationing of health care ” … but they ’re specifically addressing taxpayer - funded care .
If you want to go out and buy a medically useless treatment , Medicare wo n’t stop you .
4 . These same politicians are , of course , opposed to efforts to expand coverage .
In other words , it ’s evil for government to “ ration care ” by only paying for things that work ; it is , however , perfectly OK , indeed virtuous , to ration care by refusing to pay for any care at all .

When they complain about our efforts , you know our efforts are working because they 're getting attention in the local districts of these elected officials .
And elected officials HATE nothing more than local attention on what they 're NOT doing for their constituents in Congress , and the amount of money they 're taking in to obstruct REAL health reform !
Here 's some more of that whining from these politicians to go with your cheese on toast this morning :
One Democratic strategist who is working full - time on health reform was apoplectic over what he called wasted time , energy and resources by the organizations .
The strategist , who asked for anonymity because he was criticizing colleagues , said : " These are friends of ours .
I would much rather see a quiet call placed by [ Obama chief of staff ]
Rahm Emanuel saying this is n't helpful .
Instead , we try to decimate them ? " .....
Wyden is sanguine about ads in his home state intended to pressure him to embrace a liberal bill .
" I get an election certificate from the people of Oregon , " said Wyden , whose bipartisan health bill picked up its 14th co-sponsor last week .
" As far as these ads are concerned , I pay them no attention . "
Trust me , Wyden 's paying attention .
And he 'll pay even more attention when we lay down the grassroots smackdown on politicians like him , Snowe , Baucus , Conrad , Landrieu , Hagan , and others who refuse to support what a bipartisan majority of Americans support -- a strong public option to keep private insurers honest and make health coverage affordable .
These Senators need to know that their electoral chances rest upon passing REAL health reform with a strong public option , and that we have a very long memory as progressives when it comes to re-election and they swoop back here on Dailykos , ask us to act as ATMs for them , and go campaigning for them .
They just might not get that from us at all .
It 's why I 'm glad organizations like Moveon.org , HCAN , Democracy for America , and SEIU are taking a hard line on this issue .
It 's time that progressive groups drew the line in the sand , and that line in the sand is a strong public option in health reform .
Also , here are the principles of the Public Option Whip Tool because as Jane Hamsher says , we could have 105 Democrats today who support a public option , but we need 40 progressive Democrats who WILL vote against any bill that does n't have a public option that is :
Available nationwide on day one and accountable to Congress and the voters
We need to find out these 40 progressive Democrats in the House , and make them the power players in asking them to vote against any bill that comes out of the Senate , which would be Max Baucus 's precious little Finance Bill , that does n't include a strong public option .
It 's why I want you to use the Public Option Tool next week to call your progressive Members of Congress and find out where they stand .
The public option is the line in the sand for me , and it needs to be the line in the sand for 40 progressive Democrats as well !
Also , want to bring some serious local grassroots smackdown on Senators like Baucus , Wyden , Conrad , Lincoln , Landrieu , Hagan , and Feinstein ?
Let me tell you how we can do this .
We 're going to use President Obama 's website , Organizing For America , to accomplish the greatest smackdown of all time this weekend .
I want you to sign up with Organizing For America this weekend .
Once you 've signed up with OFA , I 'd like you to go to the Health Care Action Center and take a look around .
The most important tool we 'll be using in the Health Care Action Center . will be the " Contact People Near You " phonebanking tool .
This is the action item agenda with the " Contact People Near You " phonebanking tool below :
Sign up with Organizing For America .
Go to the Health Care Action Center and click on the " Contact People Near You " phonebanking icon to the left of the screen , near the bottom of the page .
Select your state from the drop - down menu .
This is where the fun action comes in !
Let 's say , you select Montana from the drop - down menu .
It takes you to a new webpage where it has a red icon that says " Make Calls Now " with a list of 25 supporters to call .
It asks you to make a report after the call , and gives you talking points .
In my opinion , these are weak talking points since it does n't mention the public option , so I 'll be fixing that a bit .
So what we 'll be doing is calling 25 people , asking them if they support President Obama 's health care plan , which includes a public option to help keep private insurers honest .
Then we 'll tell them to call their Senators , such as Max Baucus , Conrad , Hagan , and others , to ask them to support the public option in President Obama 's health care plan .
That 's what we 'll be doing --- bringing down the grassroots smack - down at a local level by calling people in these Senators ' states .
Here are the talking points for each of the states below that you can use when calling supporters from your call list .
I 'll use Montana as an example first .
Montana
Hi , is [ person 's name ] home ?
My name is [ blank ] , and I 'm a volunteer with Organizing for America , the grassroots organization formed to continue bringing the change we worked for during President Obama 's campaign .
How are you today ?
( Wait for response and make sure to engage in a conversational manner ) .
As you might know , Organizing for America was formed after the campaign to support the President 's agenda for change .
Recently , President Obama laid out the three core principles for real health care reform in America which has to reduce costs — such as rising health care costs which are crushing the budgets of governments , businesses , individuals , and families , and they must be brought under control .
Secondly , real health care reform must guarantee choice in that every American must have the freedom to choose their plan and doctor – including the choice of a public insurance option which helps keep private insurers honest and lowers the cost of the monthly premiums that we pay .
The public option will be available nationwide , available on day one , and is accountable to Congress and the voters .
Third , it must ensure quality care for all in that Americans must have quality and affordable health care .
The need for action in reforming our health care could not be greater ; the costs for premiums are rising 4 times the rate of wages and families and small businesses can no longer afford their existing health care plan .
If health care reform is going to be passed it cannot wait another year .
For American families , the status quo is unacceptable .
Do you support these principles for health reform ?
I also would like to ask you to call your Senator , Max Baucus , at ( 202 ) 224-2651 on Monday to ask him to support President Obama 's health reform by helping pass a strong public option which keeps private insurers honest .
Here 's the list of states that we should call that presently have Senators that are threatening to block President Obama 's health reform , which includes a strong competitive public option to keep insurers honest .
So , when you use the " Contact People Near You " phonebanking tool on OFA and use the generic talking points which I provided , I want you to choose one of these states to call and to have the phone number of the Senator ready on hand to give to the local person you 're talking to when you ask that person to call his or her Senator to support the public option in President Obama 's health reform bill .
California -- Senator Dianne Feinstein ( 202 ) 224-3841 Louisiana-- Senator Mary Landrieu ( 202 ) 224-5824 Montana-- Senator Max Baucus ( 202 ) 224-2651 Nebraska--Senator Ben Nelson ( 202 ) 224-6551 North Carolina -- Senator Kay Hagan ( 202 ) 224-6342 North Dakota-- Senator Kent Conrad ( 202 ) 224-2043 Oregon -- Senator Ron Wyden ( 202 ) 224-5244
Hope you 'll be signing up with OFA this weekend to bring some serious smack - down at the grassroots level to these corporate Senate Democrats !
Please recommend this diary so others can see the phone numbers and call !
Also , please ASK PRESIDENT OBAMAto help hold the line for us on the public option !
He 's having an online townhall on Wednesday , and I 'd like you to ask him why Senators are so opposed to the public option when a majority of Americans are in favor of the public option to keep insurers honest and make health care affordable .
You can ask President Obama this on Youtube here .
You can even ask President Obama on Twitter with this hashtag # WHHCQ .
You can go to Facebook and ask him questions there .
UPDATE : Also , check out my diary from the other day , which was front - paged at FireDogLake today !
Many thanks to Jane Hamsher !
LONDON ( Reuters ) - British Airways , which reported a record annual loss last month , said on Tuesday it had asked its staff to work for free as part of the company ’s battle for “ survival ” in tough market conditions .

The appeal to its British - based employees , which featured in the company ’s staff magazine , asks workers to volunteer for between a week and a month in unpaid leave or in unpaid work .
Chief Executive Willie Walsh , who along with the chief financial officer Keith Williams has promised to work for nothing in July , said the idea was part of BA ’s across the board cost - cutting measures .
“ Many of you from across the airline are stepping up to help the company , ” Walsh said .
“ I am looking for every single part of the company to take part in some way in this cash - effective way of helping the company ’s survival plan .
It really counts . ”
BA , Europe ’s third - biggest airline by revenue , posted annual operating losses of 220 million pounds ( $ 362 million ) and scrapped its dividend in May , saying it had suffered from a downturn in air travel and forecast no immediate revival .
It said 1,000 employees had volunteered to take part in a Business Response Scheme launched at the time which allowed staff to take a month ’s unpaid leave or to switch to part - time contracts .
Walsh , who earned 735,000 pounds a year , was one of those to sign up .
The new measure , which is designed to be more flexible , would not be compulsory but the company was instead encouraging staff to “ play their part , ” a spokeswoman said .
Other companies have launched similar schemes in response to the global aviation crisis , including Cathay Pacific , where the majority of its workforce has signed up , BA said .
Last week , the company said it was in discussions with its pilots about taking pay cuts .
Walsh has also said there would be more redundancies after reducing BA ’s headcount by 2,500 since March last year .

North Korea insists it has a right to nuclear weapons North Korea says it has staged a " successful " underground nuclear test , prompting international condemnation .
The state says it was more powerful than the previous one in October 2006 .
A number of external agencies have confirmed a powerful explosion took place , suspected to be associated with a nuclear test .
US President Barack Obama described the North Korean action as a threat to international peace .
Crisis talks were being held in South Korea .
An emergency session of the UN Security Council is being convened by Russia , which currently occupies the council 's rotating presidency .
BBC world affairs correspondent David Loyn says North Korea appears to have moved from a posture of negotiation to confrontation over the nuclear issue .
' Safeguarding sovereignty '
An official communique read out on North Korean state radio said another round of underground nuclear testing had been " successfully conducted ... as part of measures to enhance the Republic 's self - defensive nuclear deterrent in all directions " .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
It said the test had been " safely conducted at a new high level in terms of explosive power and control technology " .
The test would " contribute to safeguard the sovereignty of the country and the nation and socialism " , the communique said .
The North gave no details of the test location , but South Korean officials said that a seismic tremor was detected in the north - eastern part around the town of Kilju - the site of North Korea 's first nuclear test .
The US Geological Survey said a 4.7 - magnitude quake was detected at 0054 GMT , 10 km ( six miles ) underground .
Geological agencies in both South Korea and the US said the tremor indicated a nuclear explosion .
David Loyn , BBC world affairs correspondent Understanding the motivation behind the actions of this most secretive of powers is never easy , but North Korea does now appear to have moved from a posture of negotiation to confrontation .
Two years ago North Korea agreed to close its main nuclear plant at Yongbyon and reveal its nuclear assets .
But it has since refused to allow in inspectors , and has now withdrawn from all negotiations .
Monday 's tests come a little over a month after a test of a long - range missile that threatened Asia and could have reached the US .
Neither pressure nor the offer of a large aid package have worked .
When it meets later on Monday , the UN Security Council will issue a strong statement of condemnation .
President Obama is threatening action , but there are very few options left short of war .
In quotes : Reaction to N Korea test North Korea : engage , appease , oppose ?
Russian news agencies quoted the defence ministry as saying said its systems had detected a blast of " between 10 and 20 kilotons " - making it much bigger than the 2006 test , which the US said was less than a kiloton .
Hours after the explosion North Korea test - fired three short - range missiles , South Korea 's Yonhap news agency reported .
Pyongyang has so far not commented on Yonhap 's reports .
The US state department said it was still analysing the available data from the test .
But in a strongly worded statement , President Obama said the North 's pursuit of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles threatened peace and was in " blatant defiance of the United Nations Security Council " .
" The danger posed by North Korea 's threatening activities warrants action by the international community .
We have been and will continue working with our allies and partners in the six - party talks as well as other members of the UN Security Council in the days ahead , " his statement said .
A spokesman for the South Korean President Lee Myung - bak said the test was a " grave challenge " to international non-proliferation efforts , while Japan 's Chief Cabinet Secretary Takeo Kawamura said any nuclear test by the North would be " unacceptable " .
Both have formed crisis management teams , and said they would ask for action from the UN Security Council .
The UK Prime Minister , Gordon Brown , said he condemned the test " in the strongest terms " and said it would " undermine prospects for peace on the Korean peninsula " .
South Korea 's stock market fell 4 % on the news , over fears that regional tensions would rise .
Rocket condemnation
The North says it remains under military threat from its historic rival , South Korea , and South Korea 's allies , primarily the US - citing such examples as the annual US - South Korean military exercises undertaken in South Korea .

N Korea a problem for Obama Timeline : North Korea
It says it is entitled to retain a military deterrent .
Last month , Pyongyang pulled out of six - party talks on its nuclear programme , in protest against international condemnation of its test - firing of a rocket on 5 April .
The UN Security Council adopted a statement calling on North Korea to comply with a 2006 resolution banning missile tests .
Pyongyang says its rocket carried a satellite , but several nations viewed it as cover for a missile test .
The six - party talks - involving the US , China , Japan , Russia and the two Koreas - have stalled over the failure of Pyongyang to verify the shutdown of the Yongbyon nuclear plant .
North Korea had agreed to dismantle the facility as part of an aid - for - disarmament deal and , in response , the US removed North Korea from its terrorism blacklist .
But the North now believes it is no longer bound by its previous bilateral agreements with the US and agreements under the six - party talks , reports the BBC's John Sudworth in Seoul , South Korea .
He says the North , which already faces a stringent sanctions regime , probably thinks it has little to lose .

Cetta responded to my recent Bloggers Block post with this request :
I ’d really like to see you try to rationalize the supposed power of the occult , without anything to balance it out ( like say , Christianity , or even just God in general ) .
I think this is a really good request–its something I have been mulling around with for quite some time - you see , I experienced a lot of things that most Christians had barely even heard of - very real things that are difficult to reconcile without having some semblance of faith .
So here I will attempt to do that .
What Cetta knows , that a lot of my readership will not know , is that I was an exorcist just a few years ago .
Without giving away far too much detail , I performed the ritual of exorcism with many clients under a lot of different situations and ailments .
Sometimes the event itself was rather dramatic .
IE : convulsions , vomiting , hearing the voices of the “ evil spirits ” speaking etc — almost anything you would see in The Exorcist or The Exorcism of Emily Rose movies .
All this , along with my own very radical experiences with the “ holy spirit ( or ghost as you pantycostals say ) ” like speaking in tongues , being “ slain in the spirit ” , visions , dreams , prophesying , and etc .
Cetta wants to know ;
How does one , once he loses his faith , reconcile those events ?
Warning : May be triggering past this point - if you have experienced emotional trauma or are undergoing any sort of exorcism or therapy for ritual abuse or other reasons .
The “ Gifts of the Spirit ” , in most cases , can very easily be dismantled .
I ’m not saying some very real phenomena do not happen at any point - but the vast majority of the “ tongue talking ” and being slain in the spirit and such can be reliably connected to ones expectations .
Franz Mesmer discovered the trait of Animal Magnetism , for me explaining many of the Benny Hinn figure heads as mangetists and hypnotists .
Tongues is often magnetic mimicry rather than a genuine experience — one proof of that is that i still speak in Tongues frequently , as it is one of the few things that calms my nerves–should an unbeliever be able to do such things if they come from the holy spirit alone ?
What then of exorcism and possession ?
Dr. Stephen Diamond has a great article on that very subject here , validating the ideas I have been pondering on this issue since my deconversion :
“ But the term possession is seldom mentioned in the psychiatric and psychological literature .
Instead , we speak of obsession , which has similar intrusive , involuntary , egodystonic qualities .
Or we refer to “ multiple personality disorder ” ( dissociative identity disorder ) , in which one or more sub- personalities temporarily take possession of the person against his or her will .
Or we diagnose bipolar disorder in those possessed by mania , irritability or melancholy , and intermittent explosive disorder to describe someone repeatedly possessed or overtaken by uncontrollable rage .
It must be admitted that the archetypal phenomenon known historically as “ possession ” persists today in differing forms and varying degrees .
The only difference is the way in which we now attempt to explain and treat it . ”
Many times , possession comes about through trauma — just like Dissociative Identity Disorder —
In my experience , the more physically attached the trauma ( ie through constant violent rape ) is the more likely there is to be a violent Daimon associated with it .
The more emotional the trauma , the more likely the exorcism will be accompanied by other emotional blocks ( Alter ego ’s often do this in the DID patient , preventing the therapist from finding the root of a feeling or emotion by bringing up false personalities or distractions to the therapy session or exorcism ) .
I posit that most of the exorcisms I encountered , most of which were with clients that were deeply connected with the Occult , were only exorcisms because my understanding of the Problem was that it was demonic rather than ego .
Either way the problem is the same — but the understanding of the problem determines how one approaches it and therefore comes by ways of fixing it .
A person with a spiritualistic background is much more likely to seek exorcism over psychotherapy because of their understanding of the “ spiritual ” world and the mind .
Also , exorcism is going to work better for the spiritually minded individual in most circumstances because they BELIEVE in what is occurring …. your mind can be just as easily healed by the act of having a demon expelled as it can by having an ego ( alternate identity ) reintegrated into the whole mind — in fact it is much easier for those that believe in the demonic .
There is a lot more i could say on this subject–but then I think I would be skirting the lines of reality and comfort for me a bit too much .
I would like to open up the comments for comments AND Q&A — please feel free to ask anything you like — make sure you leave an email though .
The government of India has signed an agreement with the One Laptop Per Child ( OLPC ) project and will purchase 250,000 of the organization 's XO laptops .
The machines will be distributed to students throughout the country .
India 's decision to embrace OLPC is a bit unexpected in light of the country 's past antagonism towards the project .
OLPC is a nonprofit organization that builds low - cost education laptops to sell in bulk to governments of developing countries .
The project , first unveiled in 2005 , has faced many challenges and has been forced to significantly cut staff and reduce the scope of its vision .
Despite these setbacks , the program is still marching on and continuing to sell units as it works on an updated model and an innovative next - generation version .
OLPC launched a pilot program in India in 2007 with 20 XO laptops at a school in Khairat - Dhangarwada village in the state of Maharashtra .
Although the pilot program was successful , the country 's Ministry of Human Resource Development ( MHRD ) was highly skeptical about OLPC , and expressed concerns about the health implications of prolonged laptop use among students .
The MHRD later reversed its views about the health implications of youth computing and launched its own dubious program to build a competing $ 10 laptop .
Unsurprisingly , the $ 10 laptop never materialized .
When the country finally unveiled its highly ambiguous plans for its $ 10 " Sakshat " computing initiative earlier this year , it was revealed that the device would not be a laptop and would cost significantly more than $ 10 to produce .
India has finally decided to adopt OLPC after all , despite the government 's previous skepticism and plans for building its own technology .
PC World , which spoke with OLPC India CEO Satish Jha , reports that the laptops will be sent to 1,500 schools .
Jha hopes to ship 3 million laptops in India this year .
PC
World also says that a small roll - out will be taking place in Sierra Leone , where a human rights group is paying to deploy 5,000 XO units .
OLPC recently announced a hardware bump and plans to drop AMD chips in favor of the VIA C7 - M .
The update will also boost system memory to 1GB and internal storage to 4GB .
Prototype boards are expected to emerge in May .
It 's unclear if the order placed by India is for the current hardware or for the updated version .
OLPC is also working on a more ambitious 2.0 model which is expected to land in 2010 .
In total sales and deployed units , OLPC still lags behind Intel 's competing Classmate PC initiative .
India 's purchase of 250,000 XO units will help OLPC recover some lost credibility .
It demonstrates that major buyers still believe that the program is viable and that the laptops deliver reasonable value .
Bill Gates recently bought the rights to a series of lectures by legendary Caltech physicist Richard Feynman .
The former Microsoft head 's purchase shows that the cultural and scientific legacy of Feynman remains strong even 21 years after his death .
The lectures , given in 1964 as part of Cornell University 's Messenger Lecture Series , were filmed by the BBC , who had retained the rights since .
Gates purchased the lectures for an undisclosed amount .
But what would the former Microsoft head want with the copyright to lectures by the revered physicist ?
In a recent interview with the CERN Bulletin , Gates said that his only plan is to make the footage freely available to the public .
Add to that Gates ' reverence for Feynman , and it makes sense .
The lectures are only the latest addition to Gates ' personal collection of Feynman - related material , which includes original manuscripts of some of Feynman 's best known work .
" I have heard that Gates really respects and admires Feynman .
They exchanged a few calls back in the 1980s , " said author and cognitive neuroscientist Al Seckel , who became a close friend and student of Feynman's .
Feynman is perhaps best known for his series of autobiographical books and for the transcriptions of lectures he gave as a faculty member at Caltech , The Feynman Lectures on Physics .
California - based photographer Joe Decker , who took several classes from Feynman while studying for a mathematics degree at Caltech , remembers Feynman as being unparalleled as a teacher .
" Feynman had an uncanny ability to convey the essence of an idea , " Decker said .
" That , in addition to his incredible abilities of storytelling ... was why he was so incredibly loved . "
Although Gates has yet to announce how the lectures will be made available , anyone too anxious to wait can catch segments on YouTube .
The lectures are also available in Feynman 's book The Character of Physical Law .
Update : The Messenger lectures are now available online .

An MTA worker busted after taking a photo of a subway train slammed the city with a $ 2 million wrongful - arrest lawsuit yesterday .
Robert Taylor , 31 , an MTA station agent and train buff , says he spent three hours locked up at a station house after cops arrested him in February at the Freeman Street station in The Bronx because he had taken a shot of a train pulling in .
The charges were eventually dismissed .
A transit spokesman said that the law against taking such photos was overturned many years ago , but that officers can challenge anyone taking pictures in nonpublic or sensitive areas .
Prime Minister of the dissolved Hamas - led government in Gaza , Ismail Haniyya , instructed the Interior Ministry and the heads of the security forces to ensure claim with Israel , and to prevent any actions that could lead to renewed violence .
Taher Al Nunu , spokesperson of the government in Gaza , reported that Haniyya issued “ clear and direct orders ” to the security forces to ensure calm in the coastal region and to coordinate their efforts with all factions in Gaza to ensure calm with Israel is maintained .
The statements of Al Nunu came after Haniyya held a meeting with his government , the leaders of the security forces , police heads and a number of ministers of his Gaza - based government .
Also , Haniyya informed the ministers on the contents of a letter send by the Egyptian leadership stating that Israel might be planning a new offensive against the Gaza Strip .
He said that it is essential to maintain dialogue with Egypt and with all Palestinian factions , adding that Hamas and other factions in Gaza are not interested in any military escalation .
Haniyya demanded the International Community to act against the Israeli violations and attacks against the Palestinian people , and to act on ending the illegal Israeli siege on Gaza .
ED DAMER , Sudan 
Even as it receives a billion pounds of free food from international donors , Sudan is growing and selling vast quantities of its own crops to other countries , capitalizing on high global food prices at a time when millions of people in its war - riddled region of Darfur barely have enough to eat .
Here in the bone - dry desert , where desiccated donkey carcasses line the road , huge green fields suddenly materialize .
Beans .
Wheat .
Sorghum .
Melons .
Peanuts .
Pumpkins .
Eggplant .
It is all grown here , part of an ambitious government plan for Sudanese self - sufficiency , creating giant mechanized farms that rise out of the sand like mirages .
But how much of this bonanza is getting back to the hungry Sudanese , like the 2.5 million driven into camps in Darfur ?
And why is a country that exports so many of its own crops receiving more free food than anywhere else in the world , especially when the Sudanese government is blamed for creating the crisis in the first place ?
African countries that rely on donated food usually cannot produce enough on their own .
Somalia , Ethiopia , Niger and Zimbabwe are all recent examples of how war , natural disasters or gross mismanagement can cut deep into food production , pushing millions of people to the brink of starvation .
Chris Brown pleaded guilty to assaulting Rihanna and the two were ordered to stay away from each other , in a deal that keeps the singer out of prison but requires him to clean up graffiti or roadside trash .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Brown 's plea to a felony charge will subject him to substantial scrutiny by probation officials , and the judge 's order rules out any short - term prospects for reconciliation with his pop diva girlfriend as well .
The guilty plea came before a preliminary hearing was scheduled to start .
The hearing had been billed for weeks as a public face - off between the pair , with Rihanna set to testify against her one - time boyfriend .
Instead , Brown averted the potentially damaging meeting by entering a plea that will subject him to probation for the next five years as well as force him to perform six months of community service .
Mark Geragos , Brown 's lawyer , said the plea represented the singer taking responsibility for his actions — which included beating , choking and biting Rihanna during a fight early Feb. 8 , according to police .
After Brown left the courtroom , Rihanna entered and was addressed by Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Patricia Schnegg , who explained to the Barbados - born singer that she had issued a stay - away order .
Rihanna had not been seeking such an order , but the judge imposed one anyway .
The order requires that Brown and Rihanna stay at least 50 yards ( 45 meters ) from each other , except at industry events when the distance is reduced to 10 yards ( nine meters ) .
The judge also told Rihanna it is not a one - way order — and that she , too , should not get any closer to Brown than the order allows .
" This is a kid who 's never been in trouble before , " Geragos said after the hearing .
" He embraces this as a chance to get the message out that domestic violence will not be tolerated .
He wants to get his life back on track . "
Brown will be formally sentenced on 5 August .
Schnegg accepted Brown 's plea , but expressed some concerns because Brown is not a California resident .
She said Brown likely will be allowed to do his service in his home state of Virginia , but she did not want him to spend his time at churches or community centers .
Instead , Schnegg ordered Brown to get his hands dirty by doing work equivalent to what he would do in California — clean up grafitti or roadside trash .
She also said he 'll have to return to California every three months and attend domestic violence counseling .
Sandi Gibbons , a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles County district attorney 's office , said the terms were in line with what others receive when they are charged with similar crimes and have no prior criminal history .
Brown spoke softly throughout the hearing as he waived his rights and told the judge he understood the gravity of his plea .
" I think it 's commendable you took responsibility for your conduct , " Schnegg told Brown .
She said she hoped " the terms and conditions of your probation will have some meaning . "
Rihanna spoke briefly , too , telling Schnegg she understood the terms of the stay - away order and that after Brown 's sentencing she might ask for its terms to be loosened .
Rihanna , 21 , recorded one of 2007's most popular songs with " Umbrella " and has numerous other hits .
Her looks have made her a cover girl for magazines , as well as a pitchwoman for Cover Girl cosmetics .
The deal provides an end to a case that sparked intense media interest and severe backlash against Brown .
Sponsors and radio stations dropped him , and the singer had to cancel several high - profile appearances , including a performance at the Grammys .
The singer once known for his squeaky - clean image now has a substantial blemish on his record .
Brown , 20 , rose to fame after the 2005 hit " Run It ! "
He was nominated for a Grammy for " No Air " with Jordin Sparks and named Billboard 's top artist in 2008 .
Intense media coverage led to Rihanna being identified as Brown 's victim mere hours after the attack .
Within weeks , a photo of the singer and model 's bruised and battered face was posted on celebrity gossip site TMZ .
The posting sparked an investigation by the Los Angeles Police Department into whether one of its own officers leaked the photo to the Web site .
Brown 's attorney unsuccessfully argued the leak hurt Brown and that he should be granted access to LAPD 's investigative files .
Brown recently proclaimed in a video posted to YouTube that he was " not a monster . "
Even after Monday 's hearing , lawyers for Brown and Rihanna refused to discuss the status of the pair 's relationship .
Brown was arrested hours after police say he hit and threatened Rihanna after leaving a pre-Grammy party in Los Angeles .
He was later charged with felony assault likely to produce great bodily harm and making criminal threats .
If convicted , the singer faced sentences ranging up to nearly five years in prison .
After an inital retreat from the public eye , both musicians have gradually appeared in public more frequently .
Lately they have been photographed separately , including at a National Basketball Association finals game between the Orlando Magic and Los Angeles Lakers .
But neither has been able to shake the stigma of the court case and return to their usual jobs — making music .
The logistics of Brown 's sentence may make it difficult to get back to his job .
" It amounts to a very sweaty house arrest , " said Loyola University Law School Professor Stan Goldman , who was in the courtroom .
" You have to have the discipline to show up several times a week .
How many times will this interfere with a record date or an appearance ? "

But in the coverage of the protests in Iran this month , some news organizations have adopted a different stance : publish first , ask questions later .
If you still do n’t know the answer , ask your readers .
CNN showed scores of videos submitted by Iranians , most of them presumably from protesters who took to the streets to oppose Mahmoud Ahmadinejad ’s re-election on June 12 .
The Web sites of The New York Times , The Huffington Post , The Guardian newspaper in London and others published minute - by - minute blogs with a mix of unverified videos , anonymous Twitter messages and traditional accounts from Tehran .
The blogs tend to run on a separate track with more traditional reporting from the news organizations , intersecting when user videos and information can be confirmed .
The combination amounts to the biggest embrace yet of a collaborative new style of news gathering  one that combines the contributions of ordinary citizens with the reports and analysis of journalists .
Many mainstream media sources , which have in the past been critical of the undifferentiated sources of information on the Web , had little choice but to throw open their doors in this case .
As the protests against Mr. Ahmadinejad grew , the government sharply curtailed the foreign press .
As visas expired , many journalists packed up , and the ones who stayed were barred from reporting on the streets .
Girl 's strip search ruled unconstitutional Privacy

School officials violated the rights of a 13 - year - old girl by strip - searching her to look for prescription - strength ibuprofen , the U.S. Supreme Court said Thursday in an unexpected 8 - 1 ruling that bolsters students ' privacy rights .
The ruling moves most of the nation a step closer to California , where a 1988 state law prohibits school employees from conducting strip searches .
The court appeared to leave the door open for the searches in some circumstances - but not when school officials are looking only for painkillers and have no evidence that a student is hiding them under her clothing .
The ruling , written by Justice David Souter , said authorities in a Safford , Ariz. , middle school had grounds to search eighth - grader Savana Redding 's backpack for pills , based on a fellow student 's allegation that the girl was supplying them , but not to have a nurse search under her bra and underpants .
" What was missing ... was any indication of danger to the students from the power of the drugs or their quantity , and any reason to suppose that Redding was carrying pills in her underwear , " Souter wrote in what may have been his last significant opinion .
He is retiring after the 2008 - 09 term ends Monday .
Although school officials have more leeway than police to conduct searches , Souter said the Constitution 's Fourth Amendment still requires educators to show a reasonable suspicion that a student is concealing contraband .
Justice Clarence Thomas , in a vehement dissent , said courts should stop interfering with school officials and leave them free , under a centuries - old standard , to act with the same authority as a parent to search or discipline students .
Such a constitutional interpretation is needed " to keep the judiciary from essentially seizing control of public schools , " Thomas said .
He said parents who object to a school 's treatment of their children can ask their school board or legislature to change the rules , " send their children to private schools or home - school them , or they can simply move . "
The ruling came from a court that has construed students ' rights narrowly in some areas , including speech , and appeared ready to take the same step for drug - related searches at a hearing in April .
Souter told a lawyer during the session that he would " rather have the kid embarrassed by a strip search ... than to have some other kids dead because the stuff is distributed at lunchtime . "
Others made similar comments , and Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg , the court 's only woman , told a USA Today reporter later that some of her male colleagues did n't seem to understand the situation from a 13 - year - old girl 's perspective .
" I wanted to make sure no other person would have to go through this , " Redding , now 19 , said Thursday in a statement released by her lawyers at the American Civil Liberties Union .
In an earlier court affidavit , she said the search was " the most humiliating experience I have ever had . "
The case dates to October 2003 , when the assistant principal at Safford Middle School pulled Redding out of class , brought her to his office and showed her four ibuprofen pills of 400 mg each , twice the dose of an over - the - counter Advil .
School rules banned the pills on campus .
Redding denied she was distributing the pills and agreed to a search of her backpack , which found nothing .
The administrator then sent her to the office of the school nurse , who told her to remove her clothes and pull out her bra and underpants for a further search , which again found no pills .
Her mother then sued the district and everyone involved in the search .
Thursday 's ruling upheld a decision by the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco that a strip search of a student for an everyday painkiller crosses constitutional boundaries .
The Supreme Court ruled 7 - 2 that individual school officials were immune from damages because the girl 's rights had not been clearly established at the time of the search .
But the justices said Redding could seek damages against the school district if she can show the search was conducted under district policy .
More than two weeks after Iran 's disputed presidential election , the Guardian Council - its highest electoral authority - is due to give its definitive verdict on the poll .
Meanwhile , opposition leader Mir-Hossein Mousavi has again refused to support the Council 's plan to hold a partial recount of the votes .
Mr Mousavi wants a re-run of the vote , but said on Saturday that he would accept a review by an independent body .

Here ’s an entertaining / instructional cellphone video that shows one of the Zetas ’ more preferred torture methods in action .
It is called the tablazo .
I wrote about it a few months back :
It comes from the word “ tabla , ” or “ board . ”
The kidnappers usually have this specially crafted wooden board , a two - by - four with a handle for grip and holes drilled into the main body for less wind resistance .
They drop your trousers , bend you over and hit you continuously with the wooden board till your ass turns to purple mush and you are left looking like some diseased red-assed baboon .
( The cops here like to use the tablazo , too . )
This particular vid you ’ll be watching is very recent and has been making its way around my town of Monterrey .
It ’s a gentle warning to all the neighborhood kids , I guess .
And seems to say , “ Hey , do n’t get any funny ideas if you work for us you little bitches .
Or else you ’re gonna be in a world of pain .
Or worse . ”
The footage shows a few Zetas errand boys that had been stealing from their bosses being taught a lesson with a tablazo .
I guess the kids were n’t stealing very much .
They get off pretty light , considering all the nasty shit the Zetas could have done to make their life a living hell .
Shit , it ’s pretty obvious that the bosses are just having a little fun fucking with them , scaring the youngins shitless .
The beating is not even half the bloody carnage one could whip up all over your back , legs and ass with a prolonged tablazo beating .
It ’s a little grainy , but it ’s the real thing .
Enjoy .

Following an item published on 15 May on the NRG website , B'Tselem and the Association for Civil Rights in Israel have called on the chief of staff and the judge advocate general to order a Military Police investigation .
The item , " A Blow is Sometimes an Integral Part of the Mission , " by Roi Sharon , presented segments of the testimonies of Col. Itai Virob , commander of Kfir Brigade , and of Lt. Col .
Shimon , commander of Shimshon Battalion , before a military court , which painted a harsh picture of deliberate use of violence against Palestinians .
The testimonies clearly indicate that orders the two commanders issued included permission for extensive use of violence and injurious , even lethal means , against Palestinians , and harassment .
The two explained that sweeping permission was given to forces under their command to use direct physical violence " to extract information , " and as part of what is referred to as " interrogation . "
In part of his testimony , Col. Virob stated that :
The mission is to try to upset the equilibrium of the neighborhood , village , or particular location , to get information [...] or to cause a hostile entity inside the village to make mistakes as a result or in reaction to actions of our forces , and thus disrupt his activity and expose it .
The acts of disruption can be done at a number of levels .
The first is entering the village .
Jeeps speed to the entrance of the village .
Sometimes , just entering the village disrupts the perpetrator .
The second way is to use pressure , throwing stun grenades , breaking into a number of houses or institutions in the village , arresting residents , seizing areas on rooftops , and the like [... ]
We will detain , interrogate and use suitable pressure on every person to get to the one terrorist .
Of all the means of pressure that we use , the vast majority are against persons who are not involved .
This is true of the checkpoints , of combing whole neighborhoods , and also of questioning passersby [...]
Standing them against the wall , pushing , a blow that does n't cause injury .
These are things that certainly are commonly used in an attempt to accomplish the mission .
Discretion is dictated by the suspicion that terrorist actions or a disturbance of the peace is taking place [...]
Searching for an address can lead to use of pressure on an innocent bystander , search for weapons , a suspicion of threat to a force on a traffic artery .
There is a difference between going to a village where there is n't a threat and you do n't suspect anything , and going on a mission given you , where aggressiveness toward every one of the residents in the village is common . "
Lt. Col . Shimon also testified to the permission to use force :
When these people are interrogated , they might be put up against the wall , and cuffs or flannel [ cloth blindfold ] might be put on them , and it might be - I rely on the commanders ' judgment - that somebody gave a slap or blow to try to extract information [...]
There are no exercises , nothing written .
You enter , speak with residents , and if you feel a shirt being grabbed , shouting , and there is something suspicious - sometimes , when you live the field , this is the feeling - they feel that this is a guy they can get information from , and sometimes , to achieve this , they use force . "
These orders , which indicate routine use of violence and potentially injury - causing , including lethal , means against civilians , and harassing them , are patently illegal .
Complaints regarding military conduct of this kind have been filed in the past , but are usually denied by the military establishment .
In light of the grave suspicions arising from the details published in the item , B'Tselem and ACRI call on the chief of staff and the judge advocate general to order an immediate Military Police investigation against Col. Virob and Lt. Col. Shimon , and to direct the investigators to investigate whether other commanders gave similar orders .
In addition , the organizations demand that the chief of staff publish clear directives to all soldiers to ensure that military forces in the West Bank cease these practices .

Advertisement A man found in a car in Birmingham city centre with his hands tied and canisters attached to his body had been kidnapped , police have revealed .
West Midlands
Police said the man had been put in the car and told it contained a bomb .
Chief Supt Tom Coughlan said the man was removed in a seven hour operation and taken to hospital .
Several homes were evacuated and trains using New Street Station were delayed when a 500 m police cordon was set up .
The incident started just before 1030 BST when a lorry driver called the emergency services after spotting the man , described as Asian by police , in a car at the junction of Clarel Avenue and Landor Street , Saltley .
His hands were tied and gas canisters were inside the two - door vehicle .
' Reprehensible ' action An Army bomb disposal team , fire crews and paramedics were called to the scene along with negotiators with West Midlands Police .
Mr Coughlan said officers were initially unable to say whether the man , in his 30s and from Birmingham , was conscious and whether he was there by choice or the victim of crime .
After the man was released Mr Coughlan said police were treating it as a criminal investigation .
" The man appears at this stage to have been placed in the car against his will possibly with a view to scaring him .
" He has been told there was a bomb in the car with him . "
Experts were trying to establish the nature of the device placed in the car , he said .
" The canisters appeared viable but until they have been properly assessed then we cannot know for sure how serious this threat was , " he said .
" This action is reprehensible .
It has placed the victim , members of the public and the emergency services at risk , " added Mr Coughlan .

The Normal Bacterial Flora of Humans ( page 1 )
( This chapter has 5 pages )
© Kenneth Todar , PhD
The Normal Flora
In a healthy animal , the internal tissues , e.g. blood , brain , muscle , etc. , are normally free of microorganisms .
However , the surface tissues , i.e. , skin and mucous membranes , are constantly in contact with environmental organisms and become readily colonized by various microbial species .
The mixture of organisms regularly found at any anatomical site is referred to as the normal flora , except by researchers in the field who prefer the term " indigenous microbiota " .
The normal flora of humans consists of a few eucaryotic fungi and protists , but bacteria are the most numerous and obvious microbial components of the normal flora .
Figure 1 . Gram stain of a species of Micrococcus , commonly isolated from the skin and nasal membranes of humans .
The predominant bacterial flora of humans are shown in Table 1 .
This table lists only a fraction of the total bacterial species that occur as normal flora of humans .
A recent experiment that used 16S RNA probes to survey the diversity of bacteria in dental plaque revealed that only one percent of the total species found have ever been cultivated .
Similar observations have been made with the intestinal flora .
Also , this table does not indicate the relative number or concentration of bacteria at a particular site .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The 88 - year - old white supremacist charged with killing a guard at the Holocaust Memorial Museum left a note proclaiming President Obama a tool of " Jew owners , " according to court records released Thursday .
Writings attributed to James von Brunn and a biography appear on the Web site Holy Western Empire .

James von Brunn remained in critical condition in a Washington hospital after being shot by other security guards at the museum Wednesday .
A notebook found in his car after the shooting declared , " You want my weapons -- this is how you 'll get them , " according to investigators .
" The Holocaust is a lie .
Obama was created by Jews .
Obama does what Jew owners tell him to do .
Jews captured America 's money .
Jews control the mass media .
The 1st Amendment is abrogated -- henceforth , " von Brunn wrote , according to an FBI agent 's affidavit .
Previous online postings attributed to James von Brunn promoted the claim that Obama has no valid U.S. birth certificate , a debunked theory rejected by U.S. courts and refuted by a certified copy of his birth certificate from the Hawaii Department of Health .
A November 2008 post that appeared under von Brunn 's name declared , " There is no Obama documentation -- no records -- no paper trail -- none -- this is no accident .
It is being done on purpose with Media help -- but to serve whom & why ??? "
Von Brunn has been charged with murder in the shooting death of museum guard Stephen Tyrone Johns , 39 , and could face the death penalty .
Von Brunn has been living with his son and his son's girlfriend in an apartment in Annapolis , Maryland .
The FBI affidavit states he moved in about two years ago , bringing with him two rifles -- one a .22 - caliber , the type used in Wednesday 's shooting , and a .30 - caliber .

Scott Aulbach , the son's former roommate , said von Brunn " did n't like anything about the government " and " was really prejudiced against blacks and Jews . "
But Aulbach said he was " floored " when he heard the elderly white supremacist was the suspect in the museum attack .
" I knew the guy , and I heard some of the things he had said and some of the things he did in his past , but I never would have expected this to happen , " he said .
" I mean , it 's a tragedy . "
But Jesse Demolli , who once exhibited some of von Brunn 's paintings in his Maryland art gallery , said he was not surprised by the news .
" He was crazy .
He was a lunatic .
He was scary as hell , " Demolli told CNN affiliate Bay News 9 in Tampa , Florida .
He said about eight years ago , another gallery referred von Brunn to him .
Demolli said von Brunn 's paintings consisted largely of portraits of Native Americans .
He hung about a dozen of the works for about three days , and said von Brunn called every day to find out whether anything had sold .
After three days , he said , von Brunn accused him of not doing enough to sell the paintings , telling him he " really needed money . "
Demolli said he gave the man $ 20 , which he immediately used to buy beer and cigarettes and returned to the gallery , where he quickly began to disparage residents of the surrounding neighborhood , which was largely African - American .
" Then he started talking about the gas chambers , and I said , ' Jim , that 's it .
That 's it .
Time out . '
I told him to get out of my gallery , and I started taking his paintings down , " Demolli said .
As he removed the last painting , he said , von Brunn opened his jacket to show him a pistol .
" He said he really liked me and today is my lucky day , and he left , " Demolli said .
" He was a crazy , racist man . "
Von Brunn 's ex-wife said she was in a " state of shock " over the shootings .
The woman , who asked not to be identified , said she did not know about her husband 's anti-Semitic views until " a few years " into their marriage , and said she " was in total disagreement with his views . "
She told Bay News 9 that his views were part of the reason their marriage broke up , which she said happened " over 30 years ago . "
" I can't tell you what was in his mind .
I have no idea , " she said .
Von Brunn grew up in St. Louis , Missouri , attended Washington University there and graduated in 1943 with a degree in journalism .
He joined the Navy the same year , became an officer and served in torpedo boats in both Europe and the Pacific , according to Navy records .
In July 1945 , just before Japan 's surrender , he became skipper of a PT boat .
He worked in advertising after the war , and described himself as an artist before his arrest Wednesday .
But by the 1970s , he had become a " hardcore neo - Nazi , " according to Heidi Beirich , a researcher for the Alabama - based Southern Poverty Law Center .

Von Brunn served a federal prison term for a 1981 attempt to kidnap members of the Federal Reserve 's board of governors , triggered by anger at what he called the " treacherous and unconstitutional " acts of an institution he called Jewish - controlled .
David Gletty , who infiltrated white supremacist groups for the FBI , said younger members of the movement considered von Brunn " a POW " for his prison time .
" That 's a badge of honor to these people , " Gletty said .
" They look up to that as if , you know , if you 're military , you get the badges of honor , like the Medal of Honor and so on . "
Von Brunn 's
Web site promoted his book , " Kill the Best Gentiles , " in which he claimed the Jewish - led " Illuminati " and Jewish figures such as Sigmund Freud and Karl Marx worked " to destroy Western civilization and the Aryan nation that created it . "
Postings attributed to him on other Web sites declared both Christianity and the Holocaust " hoaxes , " and announced that " Hitler 's worst mistake " was " he did n't gas the Jews . "

For the next installment of the Terminator franchise , Hollywood might skip the polymimetic liquid alloys — they 're so 2003 — and turn to the laboratory of Ray Baughman , who has created a next - generation muscle from carbon nanotubes .
Baughman and his colleagues have produced a formulation that 's stronger than steel , as light as air and more flexible than rubber — a truly 21st century muscle .
It could be used to make artificial limbs , " smart " skins , shape - changing structures , ultra - strong robots and — in the immediate future — highly - efficient solar cells .
" We can generate about 30 times the force per unit area of natural muscle , " said Baughman , director of the NanoTech Institute at the University of Texas at Dallas .
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TD5LOaLjLlQ
Carbon nanotubes have fascinated material scientists since the early 1990s , when researchers started to explore the ultra - light , ultra- strong cylindrical molecules .
Though bulk manufacturing difficulties have slowed the development of commercial applications , carbon nanotubes are already used in bicycle components , and in prototypes of airplanes , bulletproof clothing , transistors , and ropes that might someday be used to tether a space elevator .
( On a historical note , carbon nanotube - infused steel was used to made Damascus blades , renowned as history 's sharpest swords , though the technique has been lost . )
Baughman became interested in carbon nanotubes while designing artificial muscles from energy - conducting polymers .
He figured he could do the job better with linked carbon nanotubes .
First he made haphazard tangles of fibers activated by charged liquids .
Then he experimented with more structurally - consistent configurations , and other methods of delivering the charge .
His latest muscle , described Thursday in Science , is made from bundles of vertically aligned nanotubes that respond directly to electricity .
Lengthwise , the muscle can expand and contract with tremendous speed ; from side - to - side , it 's super - stiff .
Its possibilities may only be limited by the imaginations of engineers .
" This apparently unprecedented degree of anisotropy " — direction - dependent physical properties — " is akin to having diamond - like behavior in one direction , and rubber - like behavior in the others , " wrote John Madden , a University of British Columbia material scientist , in an accompanying commentary .
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmS0Q7jTPskBaughman's muscles rely on the tendency of an electric charge to make carbon nanotube fibers repel or attract each other , depending on their configuration .
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-zXKrBoJGsNatural muscles , said Baughman , contract at a maximum rate of 10
percent per second .
In the same amount of time , his latest nanotube sheaths can contract by 40,000 percent .
Because it responds to an electrical current rather than ion movement in electrolytic liquids , it 's far more efficient than his old formulations .
The nanotube bundles retain their properties at temperatures ranging from the - 320 degree Fahrenheit of liquid nitrogen to the 2800 degree Fahrenheit melting point of iron .
The first applications , said Baughman , will likely be as wrappers for solar cells , with nanotubes conducting electricity and rapidly changing shape in order to produce optimally light - sensitive arrangements .
" We 've characterized the activity and performance , " he said .
" Now we want to use them . "

In about1700 B.C. a Babylonian poem treats of a mysterious affliction which overtook a righteous man of Babylon , and has been compared with the book of Job :
1 . I advanced in life , I attained to the allotted span :
Wherever I turned there was evil , evil -- Oppression is increased , uprightness I see not .
I cried unto god , but he showed not his face .
5 . I prayed to my goddess , but she raised not her head .
The seer by his oracle did not discern the future ;
Nor did the enchanter with a libation illuminate my case ; I consulted the necromancer , but he opened not my understanding .
The conjurer with his charms did not remove my ban .
10 .
How deeds are reversed in the world !
I look behind , oppression encloses me Like one who the sacrifice to god did not bring , And at meal - time did not invoke the goddess Did not bow down his face , his offering was not seen ; 15 .
( Like one ) in whose mouth prayers and supplications were locked , ( For whom ) god 's day had ceased , a feast day become rare , ( One who ) has thrown down his fire - pan , gone away from their images .
God 's fear and veneration has not taught his people
Who invoked not his god when he ate god 's food ; 20 .
( Who ) abandoned his goddess , and brought not what is prescribed , ( Who ) oppresses the weak , forgets his god Who takes in vain the mighty name of his god ; he says , I am like him .
But I myself thought of prayers and supplications -- Prayer was my wisdom , sacrifice , my dignity ; 25 .
The day of honoring the gods was the joy of my heart
The day of following the goddess was my acquisition of wealth
The prayer of the king , that was my delight , And his music , for my pleasure was its sound .
I gave directions to my land to revere the names of god , 30 .
To honor the name of the goddess I taught my people .
Reverence for the king I greatly exalted , And respect for the palace I taught the people ;
For I knew that with god these things are in favor .
What is innocent of itself , to god is evil !
35 .
What in one 's heart is contemptible , to one 's god is good !
Who can understand the thoughts of the gods in heaven ?
The counsel of god is full of destruction ; who can understand ?
Where may human beings learn the ways of God ?
He who lives at evening is dead in the morning ; 40 .
Quickly he is troubled ; all at once he is oppressed ;
At one moment he sings and plays ;
In the twinkling of an eye he howls like a funeral - mourner .
Like sunshine and clouds their thoughts change ;
They are hungry and like a corpse ; 45 .
They are filled and rival their god !
In prosperity they speak of climbing to Heaven Trouble overtakes them and they speak of going down to Sheol .
( At this point the tablet is broken .
We do not know how many lines are wanting before the narrative is resumed on the back of the tablet )
Into my prison my house is turned .
Into the bonds of my flesh are my hands thrown ;
Into the fetters of myself my feet have stumbled .
...............................................................................................
5 . With a whip he has beaten me ; there is no protection ;
With a staff he has transfixed me ; the stench was terrible !
All day long the pursuer pursues me ,
In the night watches he lets me breathe not a moment ;
Through torture my joints are torn asunder ; 10 .
My limbs are destroyed , loathing covers me ;
On my couch I welter like an ox ; I am covered , like a sheep , with my excrement .
My sickness baffled the conjurers ,
And the seer left dark my omens .
15 . The diviner has not improved the condition of my sickness -
The duration of my illness the seer could not state ;
The god helped me not , my hand he took not ;
The goddess pitied me not , she came not to my side ;
The coffin yawned ; they [ the heirs ] took my possessions ; 20 .
While I was not yet dead , the death wail was ready .
My whole land cried out : " How is he destroyed ! "
My enemy heard ; his face gladdened ;
They brought as good news the glad tidings , his heart rejoiced .
But I knew the time of all my family ; 25 .
When among the protecting spirits their divinity is exalted .
A third tablet is considerably broken but the parts which are legible are as follows : .......................................................................... ...........................................................

15 . The unrelieved headache which had overwhelmed the heavens
He took away and sent down on me the evening dew .
My eyelids , which he had veiled with the veil of night
He blew upon with a rushing wind and made clear their sight .
My ears , which were stopped , were deaf as a deaf man's -- 20 .
He removed their deafness and restored their hearing .
My nose , whose nostril had been stopped from my mother 's womb --
He eased its deformity so that I could breathe .
My lips , which were closed -- he had taken their strength --
He removed their trembling and loosed their bond .
25 .
My mouth which was closed so that I could not be understood ---
He cleansed it like a dish , he healed its disease .
My eyes , which had been attacked so that they rolled together --
He loosed their bond and their balls were set right .
The tongue , which had stiffened so that it could not be raised 30 .
[ He relieved ] its thickness , so its words could be understood .
The gullet which was compressed , stopped as with a plug --
He healed its contraction , it worked like a flute .
My spittle which was stopped so that it was not secreted --
He removed its fetter , he opened its lock .
............................................................................ ...................................................................
" To him , as with Job , the providence is inexplicable .
He like Job , charges his god with inscrutable injustice .
The chasm which often yawns between experience and moral deserts was as keenly felt by the Babylonian as by the Hebrew . "
" Here the parallelism with the book of Job ends .
The two works belong to widely different religious worlds .
Job gains relief by a vision of God-- an experience which made him able to believe that , though he could not understand the reason for the pain of life or its contradictions and tragedy , God could , and Job now knew God ( Job 42:4 - 6 ) .
Tabu -utul - Bel , on the other hand , is said to have gained his relief through a magician . "

Just when it looked like things could n't get any worse for San Diego suburban congressman / right - wing lunatic / bribe - taker Randy " Duke " Cunningham , up pops convicted felon and Cunningham " business associate " Thomas Kontogiannis .
At least in this case Cunningham was n't arranging no - bid contracts for his criminal pal to sell military equipment to the Pentagon ( like in the other case he 's involved with ) .
In this case Cunningham was peddling a pardon from his pal George Bush to a crook who cheated the NYC public school system .
In October , 2002 the Congressman 's bud Kontogiannis ( of whom Cunningham 's sleazy lawyer said " Duke 's business dealings with Mr. Kontogiannis have been entirely proper and any suggestion to the contrary is simply false " ) pleaded guilty in a bid-rigging , bribe and kickback scheme .
Sounds like he and " Duke " were made for eachother .
And he bought ole " Duke 's " crappy old boat -- worth $ 200,000 tops -- for $ 600,000 .
Is that a great way to pay someone off with a $ 400,000 bribe or what ?
This seems to be ole " Duke 's " modus operandi .
Oh , and Kontogiannis arranged for the financing of " Duke 's " $ 2.5 mansion .
No one has indicated whether or not Bush was in on the scheme and if he was getting any of the cash in return for the upcoming pardon .
Thomas Kontogiannis and eight others are accused of using staged sales , straw buyers and inflated appraisals on two tracts of land in East New York and Queens to defraud Washington Mutual Bank and DLJ Capital , a Credit Suisse subsidiary .
The scheme unfolded between 2001 and 2003 , according to a release issued by Brooklyn acting U.S. Attorney Benton Campbell .
Kontogiannis , 60 , is serving an eight - year federal prison sentence for laundering bribes paid to former Rep. Randy " Duke " Cunningham ( R - Calif . ) .
He also pleaded guilty in 2002 to being part of a bid-rigging and bribery scheme involving New York City Board of Education computer contracts in Queens .
Other defendants in Thursday 's case include John Michael , Elias Apergis , Steven Martini , Nadia Konstantinadou , Stefan Delgiannis , Ted Doumazios , Edward Hogan and Jonathan Rubin .
In the late 70s I was so smitten by the energy and revolutionary zeal of punk rock that I decided to start a magazine .
Some friends at Warner Bros gave me so advice .
In defining ourselves -- as well as a new genre -- we'd have to not just talk up the music and artists we loved , like the Clash , Ramones , Talking Heads , Pistols and Buzzcocks but also differentiate them by blasting away at the worst of the " old wave . "
I picked all the easy targets : Journey , Foreigner , REO Speedwagon , Styx , Kansas ... Almost 3 decades later I started DownWithTyranny and I still remembered their advice .
In place of Journey , Foreigner , REO Speedwagon and Styx we had Duke Cunningham , Bob Ney , Jack Abramoff and Thomas Kontogiannis .
( Kansas was replaced by ... well , Kansas , of course . )
We eagerly reported on all their crimes and eventually all 4 were sentenced to prison , to be replaced by equally horrible characters , from Karl Rove , Scooter Libby , Jerry Lewis and Mean Jean Schmidt to more recent demons like Michele Bachmann , Jeffereson Beauregard Sessions III , Virginia Foxx and Paul Ryan .
Anyway , this morning I was surprised when I noticed a large number of Germans on the site , having come by way of the Germanpointing toas a place to read about Thomas Kontogiannis .
I was busy with President Obama 's speech in Cairo and did n't pay it much mind .
At least not until this evening when I came across a Reuters story , Nine accused of $ 92 million U.S. mortgage fraud scheme Staring in July of 2005 we did a couple dozen posts mentioning Kontogiannis , all of them mentioning that he is a Republican criminal of the first order tied with the sleaziest politicians in our system .
What first attracted me to his story was how he paid Duke Cunningham $ 400,000 as a middleman to buy him a presidential pardon from George W. Bush .
It always amazed me that the Justice Department never followed up on that .
It was n't til a few years later that we learned exactly what the Bush Justice Department had turned into .
It got worse from there and even included unproved treason allegations featuring a secretive trip to Saudi Arabia with Cunningham , another GOP crook , Ken Calvert , and Ziyad S. Abduljawad , a naturalized American of Saudi origin living in San Diego .
In mid-2007 Kontogiannis pleaded guilt to some bribery charges involving Cunningham .
Exactly one year ago he was sentenced to 8 years in prison and fined a million dollars .
Read the 42 comments at the post announcing that .
I guess we all had reason to believe that Kongtogiannis had left the national stage , right ?
I mean , he 's in prison .
But yesterday he was back in the papers , along with 8 others indicted on charges of conspiring to defraud Washington Mutual Bank and Credit Suisse in a $ 92 million mortgage fraud scheme .
Kontogiannis was the leader of the pack The North Country Gazette has the most detailed coverage and points out that Kontogiannis could get 30 years added to his 8 year sentence .
He 's still got $ 50 million in property and that could be subject to forfeiture .

British inventor Josh Silver began working on eyeglasses that can be tuned by the wearer in 1985 .
His goal is to bring better vision to a billion people worldwide who cannot afford , or do n't have access to , an optometrist .
He has devised a pair of glasses which rely on the principle that the fatter a lens the more powerful it becomes .
Inside the device 's tough plastic lenses are two clear circular sacs filled with fluid , each of which is connected to a small syringe attached to either arm of the spectacles .
The wearer adjusts a dial on the syringe to add or reduce amount of fluid in the membrane , thus changing the power of the lens .
When the wearer is happy with the strength of each lens the membrane is sealed by twisting a small screw , and the syringes removed .
The principle is so simple , the team has discovered that with very little guidance people are perfectly capable of creating glasses to their own prescription .
Silver 's goal is to distribute a billion pairs of his adaptive glasses to poor people by 2020 .
Already , 30,000 pairs have been given out in 15 countries .
Her hope is to get the cost of manufacturing each pair down to a dollar each .
Walmart takes a lot of heat for its alleged effects on wages , employment , labor standards , and community quality - of - life .
In research we ’ve worked on over the last few years , my co-authors and I have examined the merits of these claims and have found that a lot of this heat is undeserved .
Rigorous empirical research shows that Walmart creates jobs and lowers prices .
Research also shows that Walmart does not lead kill small businesses ( though this claim has been brought into question ) or generally reduce “ quality of life ” within a community .
One area in which Walmart should be viewed with skepticism , however , is their pursuit of subsidies from the local governments with which they do business .
While these subsidies and tax breaks allegedly create jobs and tax revenue , they reward political savvy rather than productivity .
This tilts the economic playing field in favor of large corporations with armies of lawyers and against small entrepreneurs .
While working on some Walmart - related research last summer , I was given an article about a multi-million dollar package of tax breaks and subsidies given to Walmart to develop a distribution center in Lewiston , Maine .
According to the Walmart Subsidy Watch website ( www.walmartsubsidywatch.org, maintained by the organization Good Jobs First ) , the package included millions of dollars in tax increment financing incentives , over three hundred thousand dollars worth of free land , and $ 2.7 million in infrastructure improvements .
While one can debate the various merits and demerits of tax increment financing , free land and infrastructure amount to giveaways that reduce Walmart ’s costs of doing business at the expense of the company ’s competitors .
These policies distort economic activity and create waste , on net , but they are likely to remain popular among local governments competing to “ create jobs ” and attract revenue - producing benefits .
For politicians , large installations like Walmart Distribution Centers , automobile factories , and pro sports franchises are attractive because they are very large , very visible , and very easy to take credit for .
It might also be easier to collect taxes from a single large taxpayer than from innumerable smaller firms , but this remains an open question .
Subsidies do not create wealth .
They transfer wealth from one entity to another — in the case mentioned here , these subsidies transfer wealth from the taxpayers of Maine to stockholders of the world ’s largest corporation .
Further , the possibility of subsidy gives companies incentives to direct resources away from their core business — providing a wide selection of goods at low prices , in Walmart ’s case — and toward unproductive “ rent - seeking , ” which is the term economists and political scientists use to describe the hunt for special privileges from the government .
Subsidies create large , easy - to - identify changes in the distribution of economic activity , but they do not create net new economic activity .
We would all be better off if governments let us keep our money instead of taking it and giving it to other people .
if you ’re doing some interesting things with Linux , Linux Plumbers is really interested in hearing you talk about it .
But you have to submit your talk by June 15th .
Next week , we ’ll dive headlong into the first ever Open Source Bridge conference .
But that does n’t mean Portland ’s open source event fun is over for this year .
We ’ve got Linux Plumbers Conference and LinuxCon coming up in September .
September ?
Why am I talking about it now , then ?
Well , if you ’re doing some interesting things with Linux , Linux Plumbers is really interested in hearing you talk about it .
But you have to submit your talk by June 15th .
And you ’ll be joining some ridiculously cool speakers already on the docket :
We have an exciting program shaping up !
Tutorials include an advanced git tutorial from Linus Torvalds .
Keynotes include Vivek Kundra , Federal CIO , live via video with real time Q&A ( invitee , to be confirmed ) , and Keith Packard , Intel , X Window guru .
Sounds interesting , does n’t it ?
Well , get your topic together , then .
Here ’s some guidance on the type of talks they ’re seeking .
The perfect Plumbers topic would feature a real problem whose solution requires the relevant community members to get together face to face , preferably producing a solution during the conference itself .
This of course requires buy - in from maintainers and other high - profile people active in the area .
Now that you ’ve got your idea , go to Linux Plumbers Conference and submit your proposal .
( Which will be a joy , because they ’re running the awesome Portland - grown OpenConferenceWare . )
Good luck !
I ’m looking forward to hearing you speak in September .

Comic book based tattoos are decidely geeky , and there ’s certainly no shortage of Wolverine tattoos , but for the love of adamantium , could someone please fill us in on this one ?
There ’s got to be a good story behind it .
UPDATE : The artist of this tattoo is Chris Yoakum out of Urban Body .
Apparently the story is :
He got this tattoo for his sister who died .
They used to play with their toys together as kids .
Ok so she did n’t die , she just went to study abroad for a year .
Either way the best part is he has Magneto on the other side .
Two more shots from Chris ’s portfolio :
Editor 's note : Below is an excerpt from Larry King 's autobiography , " My Remarkable Journey , " published by Weinstein Books and available at bookstores nationwide .
Larry King anchors " Larry King Live at 9 p.m. ET on CNN .
Larry King recalls a much - needed win at the track during one of the lowest points of his life .
I was thirty - seven years old .
( In 1971 ) .
I had no job .
I had a couple hundred thousand dollars in debts .
And a four - year - old daughter .
I 'd take Chaia to our secret park on our visiting days .
That 's when the pain cut the deepest -- looking at my daughter and knowing I had no way to support her .
Things got bleaker and bleaker .
I became a recluse .
By late May , I was down to forty - two dollars .
My rent was paid only until the end of the month .
I locked myself in my apartment wondering how bad things could possibly get .
Pretty soon I would n't even be able to afford cigarettes .
I remembered a night when I was a young man in New York , alone , cold , and without cigarettes or the money to buy them -- I had smashed open a vending machine to get a pack .
A friend called up and told me to start living like a human being again .
He invited me to the track .
I had nothing better to do , and I figured it would be good therapy to get out and have lunch with a friend and watch the horses come down the stretch .
I 'll never forget that day .
I put on a Pierre Cardin jeans outfit that had no pockets and drove to Calder Race Course .
I can still see the horses warming up before the third race .
There was a horse called Lady Forli -- a filly running against males .
Normally , female horses do n't beat males .
We 're talking cheap horses .
I scanned the board and saw that she was 70 - 1 .
But my eyes really opened when I looked at the racing form .
Racetrack people talk to each other .
So I turned to the guy next to me and said , " You know , this horse , three races back , won in more or less the same company .
Why is she 70 - 1 ? "
" Well , " the guy said , " there 's a couple of new horses here . "
" Yeah , but she should be , like , 20 - 1 . Not 70 - - 1 . "
Screw it .
I bet ten dollars on the horse to win .
But I kept looking at the horse .
The more I looked at this horse , the more I liked it .
So I bet exactas .
I bet Lady Forli on top of every other horse and below every other horse .
Now I had what 's called a wheel .
Larry King 's life in pictures »
I kept looking at the horse .
Wait a minute , I told myself , I 've got four dollars left .
I have a pack of cigarettes .
I 've gotta give the valet two bucks .
That still leaves me with money to bet a trifecta .
My birthday is November 19 .
Lady Forli was number 11 .
So I bet 11 to win , 1 to place , and 9 to show .
Now I had bets in for 11 on top , 11 on bottom , and 11 to win .
And I had a trifecta -- 11-1-9 .
When the race began , I had two dollars left to my name -- and that was for the valet .
They broke out of the gate .
The 1 broke on top , the 9 ran second , and the 11 came out third .
The 11 passed the 9 , passed the 1 , and they ran in a straight line all around the track .
There was no question about it .
The 11 won by five lengths .
The 1 was three lengths ahead of the 9 .
I had every winning ticket .
I had it to win .
I had the exacta .
I had the trifecta .
I collected nearly eight thousand dollars .
Eight thousand dollars !
It had to be one of the happiest moments of my life -- certainly the most exciting .
But I had no pockets .
So I stuffed all the money in my jacket .
It was bundled up .
I did n't know what to do with it .
I ran out of the track .
The valet attendant came over and said , " You leaving so early ? "
" Yeah . "
" Bad day , Mr. King ? "
I tipped him fifty dollars .
The guy nearly fainted .
I had to go somewhere , to stop and make sure it was real .
I drove to a vacant lot , which is now called Dolphin Stadium .
I parked among the weeds and opened up my jacket .
All the money spilled out .
I counted out about seventy - nine hundred dollars .
I paid my child support for the next year .
I paid my rent for a year .
I bought twenty cartons of cigarettes and stacked them up in my apartment , and I filled the refrigerator .
Up to that point , that may have been the happiest moment of my life .
Now , today , if I go to the track and win $ 8,000 , it 's very nice , but it wo n't affect my life one iota .
It 's nice to win .
But when you really need it ...

In a much anticipated episode of the O'Reilly Factor , Bill O'Reilly addressed the murder of George Tiller , whom he frequently referred to as " Tiller the Baby Killer , " decrying the use of violence for political purposes and lashing out at those on the " far left " who dare to criticize him .
In the " Talking Points " segment at the top of his show , O'Reilly immediately condemned Tiller 's murder saying that " anarchy and vigilantism will destroy a society " and that the act was a " clear thing Americans should condemn . "
But once O'Reilly got the formalities out of the way , he wasted no time blasting anyone who dared to implicate him in any of this .
" When I heard about Tiller 's murder I knew that pro-abortion zealots and Fox News - haters would blame us for the crime . "
He went on to call out a laundry list of " vicious individuals " for implying that his incendiary rhetoric towards
Tiller may have inspired the violence , among which were Arianna Huffington , Markos Moulitsas of Daily Kos ( naturally ! ) , former 60 Minutes producer Mary Mapes , he said that Helen Kennedy of the New York Daily News lied when she said O'Reilly was guilty of " rants " against Tiller , and " far left columnist " Mike Hendricks of the Kansas City Star .
He closed by saying that the " far left is exploiting , EXPLOITING , the death " of Dr. Tiller for political gain , and then reminded viewers that Tiller was responsible for destroying " 60,000 fetuses who will never become American citizens . "
So yeah , Bill O'Reilly gave everyone pretty much exactly what they expected tonight — - A load of BS .
UPDATE : Later in his show O'Reilly had two abortion opponents on the show to back up his claim that " the far left is exploiting this , trying to shut guys like me up . "

Several people I know have a treadmill in the garage or basement of their home .
They bought it with great visions in their head of walking every day , but after the newness wore off , the treadmill began to gather dust – then it was folded up and put into storage .
One reader of The Simple Dollar invested almost $ 1,000 in pans for her kitchen .
Six months later , she ’s still mostly using the microwave and the pans are gathering dust .
One of my friends bought a netbook recently , thinking she ’d use it all the time to keep up with her email better for her online business .
It ’s still in her purse , but she claims to have only used it three times in the last month .
Instead , she still uses her cell phone .
I myself have done this .
Take Wii Fit , for example .
When I bought it , I thought it ’d be great for establishing a simple cardio exercise routine .
I do use it , but instead it just comes out once a week to play mini - games on .
Each of these purchases is essentially the same story .
You have a behavior you want – a fitness routine , cooking good food at home , keeping more up - to - date with email – but you ’re having some difficulty establishing it .
So you make a big , splashy purchase in order to kick - start things – and then you find that did n’t do the trick either , and you ’re left with a lot of money sunk into something you do n’t really need .
Many people have stories like this ( in fact , share yours in the comments ! ) .
Why is it so prevalent ?
I think there are at least three reasons .
First , we have the best of intentions .
Most of us do actually strive to improve ourselves , but lives are complicated .
Almost every moment is a balance of different things – the things we want to do , the things we should be doing , and so on .
It ’s often hard , even with the best of intentions , to push another routine in there , especially a time - intensive one .
Second , advertising appeals to those intentions .
We see ads for exercise equipment , think about our goals , decide that “ we could do that for twenty minutes a day , ” and order the equipment .
A good ad is designed to do that – prey on a notion already in our head and transform it into a purchase .
Third , a new routine is perilously hard to establish .
You have to make yourself do it every day , at least for the first month or two .
It does n’t come naturally .
Add these all up , and buying a piece of equipment in order to jump - start a new routine is almost always a complete waste of money .
Instead , I propose some new rules for a new routine .
First , figure out a very simple routine – do n’t dive in with a complex one .
Walk for fifteen minutes a day .
Practice the guitar for fifteen minutes .
Cook one meal a day – and keep it a fairly simple one .
Check your email three times a day .
Check Twitter three times a day .
Second , try establishing the routine with minimal equipment .
Do n’t go buy a treadmill or new running shoes .
Instead , go outside and walk every day for fifteen minutes – go around the block three times or so .
Do n’t go buy a netbook – instead , try checking your email on the equipment you already have .
Do n’t go buy $ 1,000 worth of pans – instead , buy one low - end pot and one low - end skillet and try making some very simple dishes every day .
Do n’t go spend $ 3,000 on an electric guitar – get an old acoustic one to practice on and see if it sticks .
Third , make room for the new routine .
In other words , find an unhealthy routine and minimize it .
Cut your television viewing down to an hour a day – or less .
Trim down your internet usage if you use it excessively .
Stop going out to eat so often – cut it down to once a week .
All of these choices free up time – and that free time can easily be filled by your new routine .
Finally , make reminders .
Leave your equipment out where you ca n’t miss it .
Put your guitar in your favorite chair .
Sit your jogging shoes there .
Keep your pans right out on the stove .
Leave recipes out where you can find them .
In short , make your new routine screamingly obvious at all times , giving you the best chance possible to make the leap to maintain it .
Good luck on the new routines in your life .

This newly - released image shows the sun rising over Spaceport America .
It has n't been built yet , but construction starts this Friday .
It will be the beginning of the real future , the stuff dreams are made of .*

Spaceport America will be the first spaceport in history , and it will host commercial operations by private space travel companies , like Virgin Galactic .

I 'm sure that — in a few centuries — this structure will be buried under multiple layers belonging to another huge structure : A giant spaceport — one of many in the world — in which massive spacecrafts will be lifting off and arriving from trips from the Moon , Mars , Titan , and Europa .
Or at least , I hope that 's what will happen .
* Apparently , the stuff dreams are made of look like vaginas from the air .
Rubber vaginas .

This is a super easy recipe for veggie soup that is 100 % vegan and only requires a little prep work , a crock pot and about 8 hours of waiting ( and enjoying the aroma while it cooks ) .
Here 's what I put in my crock pot :
1 stalk of celery , chopped
2 large onions , chopped
1/2 to 3/4 head of cabbage , chopped *( or buy a package of pre-cut stir fry veggies that includes cabbage , as shown in photo )
6 - 8 carrots , sliced
10 - 12 Baby Dutch Gold Potatoes , cubed ( any potatoes will work , but I love the way these cook down - if you do use larger potatoes , cut the quantity accordingly )
1 can stewed tomatoes
32 ounces vegetable broth
1 cup water
olive oil
spices , seasoning , pepper to taste
Cut veggies and layer them in the crock pot .
Drizzle olive oil as you go & sprinkle seasonings , pepper , spices atop the oil .
Mix together so it starts blending nicely .
Add can of stewed tomatoes , veggie broth and water .
** I usually add more water as the day progresses and it cooks down ( depends on how thick you want it ) .
Cook on high for 7 - 8 hours or until veggies are soft to your liking ( I keep my crock pot on the high / 4 hour setting all day .
It clicks off at 4 hours & I turn it back to the 4 hour mark at that time ) .
Serve with bread or biscuits .
Biscuits shown were easily made with Bisquick ( which is vegan ) just use soy milk instead of cow 's milk to keep it that way .
Enjoy !
In Crock Pot , right before cooking Finished !
Enjoy !
You could be the next “ Will It Blend ” but if nobody knows about you , then it does n’t matter how creative and awesomely original you are .
One of the most important factors in social media is the promotion of your content , and this often leads to annoyance .
There are many annoying social media habits , but perhaps the most annoying come from the promotion of social media .
Avoid the following social promotion pitfalls to become a less annoying ( and more effective ) user :
The Impersonal Users .
If asking for a favor , make it personal .
Social media is supposed to be all about relationships , yet so many people are lazy and make things impersonal .
Great , I ’m glad you found my IM name in my social profile , but my full name is n’t ‘ Can you Digg this for me , ’ so find some manners and use them .
This is the same for all social mediums .
Instead of direct messaging “ friends ” and telling them to share something in 140 characters , take the time to chat with them on IM , talk about the story in mind , and inquire if they would be interested in passing information along to their friends .
The more time and genuine effort that you out into something , the better it will come out – I guarantee it .
The Crazed Cross Promoters .
Did you just send your Digg account page via StumbleUpon ?
Did you send me a message on Mixx that included a link to Propeller ?
These types of actions can really annoy users and garner you more negative votes than positive votes .
People join StumbleUpon because they want to find quality new stories , not see your Twitter name .
By all means , use social badges on your site to spread love , but if you are trying to use one social medium to force users into a social media marathon , you are trying too hard .
The One Way Streeters .
These people are the most obvious annoyances on social networks , as you simply have to look at the number of times that they have asked you for a vote in comparison to the number of times you have sent something to them .
If this is a one way street , you have found yourself a “ one way streeter . ”
Guess what ?
If you IM multiple Reddit stories to friends who are n’t asking for anything from you , there is a good chance that they are avoiding them all together or downvoting you .
Try to keep an even ratio of stories with your friends , as it is the courteous thing to do .
Nobody likes that guy who always needs something in real life – and they do n’t on social networks either .
The Always An Emergency Users .
These users embody the little boy from “ The Boy Who Cried Wolf ” to the fullest .
If every tweet is followed with PLS RETWEET and every message sent is of high importance , it all loses meaning .
If I wrote this entire post in bold , no words would stand out .
The same is true with social media ; if you say that something is important , it better well be or when there is really a wolf nobody will be listening .
The Convenient Users .
Even worse than the one way streeters , these users only show up when they need something , but you could n’t even find them if you needed something .
These users pop on to Instant Messenger to drop you a link and then vanish in under a nanosecond .
You may catch them DMing you on Twitter and then not using the service or even checking messages for weeks .
If you have something that you want to share that badly , at least stick around and hear what your “ friends ” have to say about it , let alone being visible or active when they have something for you .
The Total Spammers .
These users may be the most annoying for the sole reason that they know how annoying they are , and yet they do n’t care … at all .
You can find them IM - ing you tens of links to stories to vote on , or showing up in your inbox after they figured out your email name and added you to their promotion list or worse yet – hacking your account to share their content .
Social media users report spam , and these users are just helping to dig themselves into their own graves .
At the end of the day , social media is truly about being social – so try to translate your manners online and you will stay off this list ( and boost your success ! )

One New York Daily News columnist summed up Cheney ’s supposed TKO this way : “ The key to Cheney ’s powerful performance : facts , facts , facts . ”
But the facts , as usual , were wrong .
Image Frank Rich Credit ...
Fred R. Conrad / The New York Times
At the McClatchy newspapers ’ Washington bureau , the reporters Jonathan S. Landay and Warren P. Strobel detailed 10 whoppers .
With selective quotations , Cheney falsified the views of the director of national intelligence , Adm. Dennis Blair , on the supposed intelligence value of waterboarding .
Equally bogus was Cheney ’s boast that his administration had “ moved decisively against the terrorists in their hideouts and their sanctuaries , and committed to using every asset to take down their networks . ”
In truth , the Bush administration had lost Osama bin Laden and his deputy , Ayman al - Zawahri , not least because it started diverting huge assets to Iraq before accomplishing the mission of vanquishing Al Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan .
That decision makes us less safe to this very minute .
You can find a link to the complete Landay - Strobel accounting of Cheney ’s errors in the online version of this column .
The failure of much of the press to match their effort has a troubling historical antecedent .
These are the same two journalists who , reporting for what was then Knight Ridder , uncovered much of the deceit in the Bush - Cheney case for the Iraq war in the crucial weeks before Congress gave the invasion the green light .
On Sept. 6 , 2002 , Landay and Strobel reported that there was no known new intelligence indicating that “ the Iraqis have made significant advances in their nuclear , biological or chemical weapons programs . ”
It was two days later that The Times ran its now notorious front - page account of Saddam Hussein ’s “ quest for thousands of high - strength aluminum tubes . ”
In the months that followed , as the Bush White House kept beating the drum for Saddam ’s imminent mushroom clouds to little challenge from most news organizations , Landay and Strobel reported on the “ lack of hard evidence ” of Iraqi weapons and the infighting among intelligence agencies .
Their scoops were largely ignored by the big papers and networks as America hurtled toward fiasco .
Another reporter who was ahead of the pack in unmasking Bush - Cheney propaganda is the author Ron Suskind .
In his 2006 book on the American intelligence matrix , “ The One Percent Doctrine , ” Suskind wrote about a fully operational and potentially catastrophic post - 9/11 Qaeda assault on America that actually was aborted in the Bush years : a hydrogen cyanide attack planned for the New York City subways .
It was halted 45 days before zero hour  but not because we stopped it .
Al - Zawahri had called it off .
When Bush and Cheney learned of the cancellation later on from conventional intelligence , they were baffled as to why .
The answer : Al - Zawahri had decided that a rush - hour New York subway attack was not enough of an encore to top 9/11 .
Al Qaeda ’s “ special event ” strategy , Suskind wrote , requires the creation of “ an upward arc of rising and terrible expectation ” that is “ multiplied by time passing . ”
The event that fits that bill after 9/11 must involve some kind of nuclear weapon .
“ What are the lessons of this period ? ” Suskind asked when we spoke last week .
“ If you draw the wrong lessons , you end up embracing the wrong answers . ”
They are certainly not the lessons cited by Cheney .
Waterboarding has n’t and is n’t going to save us from anything .
The ticking time - bomb debate rekindled by Cheney ’s speech may be entertaining on “ 24 ” or cable - news food fights , but is a detour from the actual perils before the country .
“ What we ’re dealing with is a patient foe who thinks in decades while we tend to think more in news cycles , ” Suskind said .
“ We have to try to wrestle this fear - based debate into something resembling a reality - based discussion . ”

Lack of original ideas leaves societies vulnerable to environmental upheaval , model suggests .
Copycats may have caused the demise of the Maya civilization .
Wikimedia Commons
The capacity to learn from others is one of the traits that have made humans such a global success story .
Relying on it too much , however , could have contributed to the demise of past populations , such as the Maya of southern Mexico in the eighth and ninth centuries and Norse settlers in Greenland 1,000 years ago .
Over-hunting , deforestation and over - population are well - worn routes to societal collapse .
Now , Hal Whitehead of Dalhousie University , Halifax , Nova Scotia , Canada , and Pete Richerson of the University of California , Davis , have modelled how different learning strategies fare in different environments .
They found that conformist social learning — imitating and emulating what the majority are doing — may also cause the demise of societies .
When environments remain stable for long periods , behaviour can become disconnected from environmental demands , so that when change does come , the effects are catastrophic1 .
Environments often change in unpredictable ways and over timescales from the seasonal to millennial .
Rainfall and temperature change both seasonally and annually ; populations of predators , prey and pests rise and fall ; soil conditions change .
Behaviour that is genetically determined can adapt to environmental change by the slow process of natural selection , but only when that change is also slow .
Rapid change puts a premium on the capacity of individuals to learn through exploration and experience , and to adapt their behaviour accordingly .
Figuring things out for yourself can be time - consuming , however , and a waste of time when others around you have already acquired the relevant knowledge .
Once individual learning is common , the less costly strategy of conformist social learning can get a foothold .
The road to oblivion
Previous models have suggested that evolution will favour a mixture of the two strategies , in which individual learning is used in some circumstances and social or cultural learning in others .
This means that populations retain the ability to learn new solutions to emerging problems but also benefit from the low cost of spreading these solutions through social learning .
Unlike previous models , Whitehead and Richerson 's have explored how the different kinds of learning fare in ' red - noise environments ' — when environmental variation is concentrated in large and infrequent changes , a pattern they say is characteristic of many historical records .
" During long periods with only modest amounts of change , conformist social learning is a more successful strategy than costly individual learning , " says Richerson .
In red -noise environments , this advantage remains true in the short term but can lead to long - term problems .
" The mix of individual and social learning that evolves during quiet periods in red - noise environments tends to have too little individual learning to cope with rarer big changes , " he says .
“ People might find it difficult to believe that humans would do something so stupid as to copy themselves to extinction , but in my view that may rely on an overly rosy view of human omnipotence . ”
Luke Rendell
University of St Andrews
These results might explain some well - known historical crashes , say the authors .
Mayan civilization famously went into free fall some 1,200 years ago — the cessation of temple building shows this — and was plausibly driven by a combination of ecological change and cultural inertia .
Similarly , Norse settlers in Greenland around AD 1000 were culturally conservative , carrying on much as they had in Scandinavia .
They failed to adapt to an increasingly harsh environment or adopt the more effective behaviour of the Inuit , and eventually died out , possibly as a result of malnutrition .
Luke Rendell , a biologist at the University of St Andrews , UK , says the role of conformism in population collapse is plausible , even if surprising .
" People might find it difficult to believe that humans , in all their complexity , would do something so stupid as to copy themselves to extinction , but in my view that may rely on an overly rosy view of human omnipotence , " says Rendell .
" What matters to most people is how they are doing as individuals right now , and longer - term considerations are very easily pushed down the priority listing . "
Prizing innovation
Whitehead and Richerson 's models highlight the perils of cultural conformism in red -noise environments , particularly when populations are small , but also show how other styles of learning can mitigate the problems .
For instance , ' prestige bias ' means that people only copy successful role models , rather than simply imitating what everyone else is doing .
ADVERTISEMENT
" Societies should promote individual learning and innovation over cultural conformity , and the models for social learning should be individuals who have demonstrated that they understand how to live with the current environmental trends , " says Whitehead .
The validity of these prescriptions may , however , turn on further work .
" We lack empirical data on human behaviour with which to test these models , " says Rendell .
" Once we know more about how humans really employ learning strategies , we will be in a better position to evaluate the relevance of models like these to our own history and to our present . "

The idea of a Topic Maps file system is not new .
Robert Barta presented one such at TMRA 2008 , and Inge Henriksen is also working on one .
However , I had my own take on this that I wanted to realize for several years .
The starting point was the Mac screensaver which shows all photos from a given directory as a kind of slide show .
I 've set it to the root folder I store my photos in , but then it shows all photos , which is not always that pleasant when you 're on a projector in a meeting , for example .
But then I thought : I have all these photos in a topic map , and the topic map knows which photos are private and which are not .
So a file system based on the topic map would let me control whether or not to hide private photos .
And , I realized , it would let me do other things , like only showing photos from Norway , or only beer photos , or only photos of a specific person .
So this sounded like a cool thing to do .
I quickly figured out that FUSE would let me do this , but then there was the issue of how to access it from some programming language with a good Topic Maps engine .
After various tries with Ontopia , TM ++ , gcc setup , and so on , eventually I got a combination that worked : fuse .py and mappa .
That took about two years .
Then one Friday evening over three beers I wrote the file system .
The basic idea is dead simple : I mount the topic map on an empty directory somewhere on the disk , and then a structure from the topic map appears in that directory .
The top level consists of one folder for each topic type in the topic map , and the names of the folders are the names of the topic types .
This is what 's shown in the screenshot below :
Then , inside each topic type folder is objects representing the topics of that type .
These fall into two categories : topics which have a subject locator , and topics which do n't .
The former are represented as files containing whatever the subject locator refers to .
The latter are represented as folders .
The contents of the folders are all associated topics which have subject locators .
The screenshot below shows the contents of the " Location " folder :
If we pick one location , say " Albert Memorial " , and open it , we get :
The file names are the name of the topic , plus the last part of the subject locator .
The date modified is the date modified of the file referred to , and the same with the size .
Opening a file gives the expected result .
Switching the directory view to cover flow produces :
So there you have it .
The file system is completely generic , in that it does n't depend on any specific ontology .
You can mount any topic map and get a sensible result .
If you want to try , go here , and click " tmfs " .
Note that you 'll need to install a few components to get it to work .
So far , the most fun application of it has been to set the Mac screensaver to show only photos of my 10 months old daughter , and then show it to her .
She finds this incredibly exciting , and starts waving her arms about , shrieking , and wants to climb into the computer .
So far I 've found that it 's best to only show it to her for a couple of minutes at a time to avoid getting her too excited .
If you 're wondering where the privacy feature went the answer is that it 's not implemented yet .
I also want to do other things , like turn occurrences into files , add support for modifications , and so on , but so far there has n't been time .
I wrote this article over 10 years ago .
I thought it would be very interesting to post again to see how many of these services are still alive and going over 10 years later .

The US International Trade Commission has ruled that some Sharp LCD displays violate a patent owned by Samsung and should be banned from being imported into the US .
Although , it is probably nothing to get overly excited about .

While the ruling would effect a large segment of Sharp 's product line — including Aquos .
Sharp will no doubt appeal the ruling , and it is subject to review by President Obama over the next 60 days .
Much like the Vizio ban , it probably wo n't matter all that much in the end .

Edgar Miranda , the Machu Picchu Mayor , is requesting the neighboring communities ( such as Santa Teresa , Ollantaytambo , Urubamba and Cusco ) to join this campaign .
“ The norm aims to promote the sale of drinks in returnable glass bottles and the use of water bottles , ” explained municipal authority Miriam Valenzuela .
The town ordinance will come into effect on August 23rd , so the sale and consumption of beverages in disposable plastic bottles will be strictly forbidden to avoid pollution in the area .
The Municipality of Machu Picchu has banned the use of plastic bottles in the area , because the amount of the disposed bottles easily reaches 1 ton each month , generating a serious environmental issue .

Jennifer Love Hewitt writing a Relationship Advice Book
Jennifer Love Hewitt is now writing a book entitled “ The Day I Shot Cupid ” .
“ I thought it was time to share the real story of what I ’ve learned navigating the dating waters . ”
Hewitt says in a statement from Voice publishers .
“ Hopefully , in addition to having a good laugh , women reading this will learn from some of my hard lessons . ”
Guys who were romantically linked to the actress include John Mayer , Carson Daly , Ross McCall and her Ghost Whisperer co-star Jamie Kennedy .
According to a press release , the 30 - year - old actress “ will reveal a surprisingly wicked sense of humor as she explores the new landscape of modern dating and offers up a wide range of practical tips , from text - flirting and IM - ing to what men and women really want , and how to start over after a breakup . ”
The Day I Shot Cupid will hit stores on March 2010 .

Michael Beline was hurrying to his job as an elementary teacher in Durham Region .
Christine Bedford , a customer service representative , was also on her way to Track 4A .
She had a fresh coffee in her hand .
Suddenly , the two strangers were together in the crowd .
Beline thinks he might have cut ahead of her .
What he remembers is her angry voice , saying , " Do n't you f--- ing cut me off . "
He turned toward the voice and the woman threw the contents of her coffee cup in his face .
" I suffered second - degree burns , " the 30 - year - old Annex resident said of the April 9 , 2008 incident .
" I even had burns at the tip of my eyelids .
It was quite severe . "
Yesterday Bedford , 58 , pleaded guilty to assault causing bodily harm , reduced from the aggravated assault charge she originally faced .
" It was just an impulsive act , " her lawyer , Stephanie Heyens , told the court , stressing that her client has no criminal record .
Provincial Court Justice Bruno Cavion was not impressed .
" Either she 's insane or she 's evil , one or the other , " he said , demanding further explanation for Bedford 's conduct .
Heyens said the victim probably jostled Bedford or cut her off .
" She acted in an irrational manner " and is remorseful , Heyens said .
Court was told Bedford has two grown children and works on the phone in customer service at a pharmaceutical company .
" She deals with people ? " asked the judge incredulously .
" She is quite well - known for her ability to deal with people on the phone , " Heyens said .
The judge accepted a joint recommendation from Heyens and prosecutor Meghan Scott for a suspended sentence , 12 months probation and restitution of $ 1,500 – part of which will go to Beline .
Cavion ordered Bedford to pay $ 500 to a hospital of her choice to make up for the " aggravation " caused to the one that treated Beline .
Beline told court he continued on his way to work after the attack , but a colleague on the train persuaded him to seek medical attention .
He was treated at Ajax and Pickering hospital , where Durham police interviewed him and took photos of his injuries .
" I lost two layers of skin .
My summer was ruined , " he said , adding he had to wear a wide - brimmed hat and drop out of dragon boat races .

Iran is now saying that Neda was killed because she was mistaken for the sister of an Iranian " terrorist . "
A
photograph
of Neda Agha -Soltan on CNN.com shows a beautiful young woman with shining hair and a winsome smile unfettered by the traditional Islamic garb worn by women in the Middle East .
I 've seen many women who look like Neda since February , 2007 when I met my first Persian .
I was at the office of the New York Sun when I kept getting a call from a mysterious man who insisted on meeting me in person .
He told me he was referred by a writer who writes for the New York Times and that he wanted to give me an important story .
I checked out the writer who confirmed that she felt the Sun would be a better fit - in other words , this was not something the Times would be interested in but she thought it was worth exploring .
It turns out the gentleman was an Iranian dissident and he wanted me to know what was going on in Iran because no one in the media wanted to publicize it .
Frankly I was fascinated by what I learned and wrote :
" There are , in fact , two Irans , and the lesser known one to most Americans is undergoing a renaissance that the ruling Iranian mullahs fear the most .
If the Persians are awakened to their identity as children of Cyrus the Great , who wrote mankind 's first charter of human rights , these oppressive regimes will topple domino - style .
Besides Iran , the Persian heritage is embedded in Iraq and Afghanistan , and were it to be rekindled , a revolution unheard of in scope could occur . "
My new friend and former Muslim , whom I will call Babak Iran , told me that Korans are being burned in Iran , and that there is a strong movement toward the philosophy of Zoroastrianism .
This man showed me the pendant he now wears , a symbol of the ancient religion ( it is older than Judaism ) .
This symbol , carried by many of the parade marchers in New York City , can be seen at persianparade.org .
Slide # 24 in the 2009 parade is where one can see many beautiful Persian women like Neda .
The Persian Renaissance , known as Anjomane Padeshahi Iran , was spearheaded by a charismatic leader , Dr. Froud Fouladvand who tried to offer Iranian people the reason to fight by awakening their semi- dormant national identity , an identity that was overshadowed by radical Islam .
He is believed to have been captured and executed by the Islamic government in Iran .
It has been said that perhaps President Obama 's March speech to Iran is what has fueled the current unrest , and when I look back at what my Iranian friend said in March , that may be true -- not because he inspired it , but because he angered the Persians .
I asked Babak Iran if the Farsi subtitles of Obama 's speech were accurate .
He assured me that while the translation was accurate , the message itself had infuriated the Iranian people who are not in league with the mullahs who wish to destroy their Persian heritage .
I had his permission to provide my readers with his reaction :
" I can tell you that Iranians are infuriated with the message , as am I .
Iranians do not think that the Islamic regime of Iran is their government .
They look at it as an occupying army of Muslim killers determined to destroy what Muhammad and his killers could not do for 1400 years .
The mullahs have done all they can to prevent people from celebrating the norooz and a dozen other celebrations such as Charshanbeh soori ( the fire festival ) for the last 30 yeas .
They hate and try to destroy the Iranian culture , like they did in all other previously known Muslim countries .
But the more they try to stop the many celebrations in Iran the more the people resist . "
My friend also sent further evidence and quotes that the mainstream media and our government obviously have ignored .
" ... we do not worship Iran we worship Allah , for patriotism is another name for paganism , I say let this land ( Iran ) burn .
I say let this land go up in smoke , provided Islam emerges triumphant in the rest of the world . "
Ruhollah Musavi Khomeini
" We are from the tribe of Quraysh and our supporters are Arabs and our enemies are Iranians .
It is clear that any Arab is better than and has higher standing than any Iranian and any Iranian is worse than our worst enemy . "

" Alicia , Islamic Tazi Mullahs want nothing more than the destruction of Iranian culture .
To call the mullahs leaders of Iran is an insult to Iranians and their culture .
The term Islamic and republic are not compatible -- for Islam gets its authority from Allah and Sharia law and the republic from the people .
To say " Iranian election " like the western media does is an intellectual crime against the Iranian people .
The prerequisite of an election is the freedom for people to choose their candidates and not a handful of fascistic Mullahs .
Any negotiations with Tazi Mullahs occupying Iran , is an attempt to further defraud the great people of Iran - and the people know it .
Obama , should have directed his message to the people rather than legitimizing the Mullahs by calling them leaders . "

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - U.S. wireless carriers Verizon Communications and AT&T took issue with assertions that they colluded in setting prices for text messages , saying on Tuesday that prices for most customers had fallen and the market was competitive .
Sen .
Herb Kohl , chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee ’s antitrust subcommittee , said he was concerned that the four largest cell phone companies doubled their text message rates from 10 cents in 2006 to 20 cents in 2008 .
“ These sharp price increases raise concerns .
Are these price increases the result of a lack of competition in a highly concentrated market ? ” he asked , adding that the subcommittee had urged the Justice Department to scrutinize any future mergers or allegations of anticompetitive practices in the industry .
But the general counsels of both Verizon and AT&T argued that the price increases affected 1 percent of text messages sent because most consumers bought volume plans that lowered the per-message cost .
“ The faulty notion that prices for text messaging have risen derives from an unduly narrow interest in the trend of a single pricing option for text messaging services , the pay - per-use option , when the vast majority of AT&T ’s customers do not choose that option , ” said Wayne Watts , general counsel of AT&T .
Watts and Randal Milch , general counsel of Verizon Communications , said that about 17 percent of their customers were on a plan that had them paying for each text message .
They also each denied that their companies colluded on pricing .
“ The market evidence shows fierce competition across the wireless market , ” Milch said .
" Ultimately this is explained by females using sex as a way of testing males , " said Dr Sykes .
" The one that can keep them most satisfied will be the biggest , strongest , healthiest , and crucially will have the best genes .
Essentially whoever stimulates them gets to father the most children .
It 's a novel excuse for infidelity when you say you 're doing it for the kids ! "
Strafversetzt wegen guter Noten Grundschul - Rebellin erhält Courage - Preis
Ihr Fall machte Furore : Die Lehrerin Sabine Czerny wurde von bayerischen Schulbehörden strafversetzt - wegen guter Noten und spannenden Unterrichts .
Jetzt hat die Lehrerin , die zu wenig Fünfen gab , einen Preis für Zivilcourage erhalten .
Andrew Sullivan highlights a steaming pile of hypocrisy over at the New York Times :
Here we have it in broad daylight : the New York Times ’ cowardice in the face of its own government .
In an obit today , the editors manage to use the word “ torture ” .
It ’s in an obit .
The obit runs : Col. Harold E. Fischer Jr. , an American fighter pilot who was routinely tortured in a Chinese prison during and after the Korean War , becoming — along with three other American airmen held at the same prison — a symbol and victim of cold war tension , died in Las Vegas on April 30 .
He was 83 and lived in Las Vegas .
The cause was complications of back surgery , his son Kurt said .
From April 1953 through May 1955 , Colonel Fischer — then an Air Force captain — was held at a prison outside Mukden , Manchuria .
For most of that time , he was kept in a dark , damp cell with no bed and no opening except a slot in the door through which a bowl of food could be pushed .
Much of the time he was handcuffed .
Hour after hour , a high - frequency whistle pierced the air .
After a short mock trial in Beijing on May 24 , 1955 , Captain Fischer and the other pilots — Lt. Col. Edwin L. Heller , First Lt. Lyle W. Cameron and First Lt. Roland W. Parks — were found guilty of violating Chinese territory by flying across the border while on missions over North Korea .
Under duress , Captain Fischer had falsely confessed to participating in germ warfare .
You will notice how the NYT defines torture when it comes to foreign governments – isolation , sensory deprivation , sleep deprivation .
Much milder than anything the US did to one of its own citizens , Jose Padilla .
But the parallel is almost perfect : these are , after all , the exact Chinese Communist techniques that were reverse engineered from the SERE program .
So you have a perfect demonstration of the NYT ’s double - standard .
If Chinese do it to Americans , it ’s torture ; if Americans do it to an American , it ’s “ harsh interrogation . ”
Does Jill Abramson really expect us to take this lying down ?
Following on his post above , Sullivan writes an email to the Times to express his shock at their not following company policy :
Mr. Hevesi , I was dismayed to see in your obit of Col .
Fischer the description of his detention in a Chinese prison as ‘ torture ’ .
As I ’m sure you ’re aware , there is a debate throughout our country as to which interrogation techniques constitutes torture .
What you may not be aware of is that your paper has already declared its position in that debate : Undecided .
I will refer you to Clark Hoyt ’s April piece titled ‘ Telling the Brutal Truth ’ , in which Washington editor Doug Jehl was quoted saying “ I have resisted using torture without qualification or to describe all the techniques .
Exactly what constitutes torture … has n’t been resolved by a court . ”
He then added “ On what basis should a newspaper render its own verdict , short of charges being filed or a legal judgment rendered ? ”
Your article made no mention as to whether Col .
Fischer ’s interrogator , Chong , was either charged or convicted of torture .
As such , in order to help the Times retain its ’ consistency , I request that you change every instance of ‘ prisoner ’ in your article to ‘ enemy combatant ’ and change ‘ torture ’ to ‘ enhanced interrogation techniques ’ .
I ’d also think it to be prudent if you could also expand the scope of the obit to better flesh out the background of Chong , the interrogator .
Perhaps describe the pressure he was under from his superiors to produce intelligence about germ warfare from Col .
Fischer as a way to explain his heavy - handedness .
To my mind , it seems like the Times has n’t fully appreciated how the torture debate has shifted .
Most of the serious people in the GOP have shifted away from the question of “ Did we torture ? ” and are now pushing the question “ Did torture work ? ”
This is analogous to a criminal defendant shifting their defense from “ I did n’t kill that guy ” to “ Well , I killed him but he was calling me names ! ”
As a final thought , I think we need to dream up a new - and - improved euphemism squad .
If “ torture ” is going to be “ enhanced interrogation technique ” , why stop there ?
Let ’s change “ murder ” to “ enhanced life - ending procedure ” and “ robbery ” to “ harsh property acquisition mechanism ” .

Part 4 : What Type Of Training Do I Need ?
By Matthew C. Keegan
Time for some training !
So , you are not sure what type of training you will need or how it compares to the commercial side of aviation .
For starters , there are some very big differences .
Please be aware that the Federal Aviation Regulations ( FARs ) do not require that a flight attendant be assigned to an aircraft with fewer than 20 seats onboard .
With that being said , it is a good idea -- regardless of federal regulations -- for the person who is in charge of the cabin area to have adequate training .
How To Become A Corporate Flight Attendant :
Taking The First Step What Types Of Jets Will I Be Flying ?

What Type Of Training Do I Need ?
How Should I Craft My R�sum� ?
Tips On Finding Work
There are quite a number of programs out there that train or claim to train business flight attendants .
Some programs are excellent while others are awful .
Caveat emptor -- let the buyer beware -- is the siren call for all of you seeking training .
Do not be lulled by a low price as anyone can say they offer training , but will it get you work ?
Will it be recognized by the companies doing the hiring ?
Is the program accepted by the FAA ?
These are some of the things you need to uncover as you do your research .
While commercial carriers generally offer training that can last as long as six weeks , your training will be no longer than 5 or 6 days .
That 's it !
However , those days will be jammed pack and may include the following topics and exercises : food handling and service ; emergency training including in - flight emergency , CPR / AED training ; extensive classroom time to include : decompression , hazardous materials , firefighting , passenger briefings , ditching , and more .
Some programs include make - up consultations , food and wine pairing , r�sum� writing , interviewing and marketing exercises , and other topics .
While each can be helpful consider how much of the program 's schedule is geared toward core topics vs. peripheral issues .
Who do I recommend ?
Well , that is a touchy subject .
As mentioned previously , training is not a legal requirement therefore program curriculum can vary widely .
When talking with training operators , be prepared to ask a lot of questions , read their website , obtain their literature , and shop wisely .
The two longest running and most well know programs are operated by FlightSafety International and FACTS / AirCare ; most charter and private operators prefer their training .
Alteon Training , LLC is a Boeing training company that started cabin attendant training in 2003 while Beyond and Above Corporate Flight Attendant Training got started in 2002 .

DARTMOUTH -
The ducklings were barely 2 weeks old when their mother was run over and killed earlier this month by a motorist in a parking lot at the Dartmouth Mall .
The 12 orphans have found temporary shelter at a Westport farm , and the man who allegedly ran over their mother June 13 could face several charges , including animal cruelty , animal control officer Sandra Gosselin said in an interview at the farm yesterday .
The New Bedford District Court will call a closed - door clerk magistrate ’s hearing , in which the police and the potential defendant will present their cases , said Gregg Miliote , spokesman for Bristol District Attorney C. Samuel Sutter .
The clerk magistrate will determine whether there is probable cause to file a criminal complaint , Miliote said .
“ If the clerk [ magistrate ] finds that this was enough to bring a criminal complaint , then we will absolutely prosecute [ him ] , ’’ Miliote said .
According to a court clerk , the date for the hearing had not been set by yesterday afternoon .
The New Bedford Standard - Times reported yesterday that police said a 25 - year - old Acushnet man ran down the mother duck .
He did not stop his 2003 Kia Spectra after the incident and left the mall soon afterward , the paper said .
The newspaper also reported that the man later explained to the police that he left because a witness started yelling at him and he did not want a confrontation .
Police , who have not released the man ’s identity , did not return repeated calls yesterday .
Meanwhile , the ducklings are being cared for by Christine A. Ponte and her husband , Joseph S. Ponte , who own the Westport farm .
In another six weeks , when they are stronger and ready to fly , the couple will release them into the wild , they said .
The ducklings seem comfortable in their new home , which they share with a baby deer named Lucky .
The dozen feathery brown ducklings move together as a group , often climbing on top of one another and looking around curiously .
At a glance they look identical , but some are just slightly smaller and tend to follow the biggest one , pecking at one another .
At night they sleep in a cozy room with a heat lamp .
They are growing by the day , almost like weeds , Christine Ponte said .
She feeds them and pets them and cleans their cage , but also makes sure she does not grow too fond of them .
“ I gave them a new life and a new start , ’’ she said .
“ I try not to interact with them .
. . .
I want them to just go back where they belong . ’’
Ponte said she could not believe someone would want to hurt the creatures intentionally .
“ How can you do something like this ? ’’ she said .
“ A lot of people do it and think it ’s OK to do it for fun . ’’
“ Some people are n’t in their right minds , ’’ Gosselin agreed .
In her 15 - year career , she said , she has seen only one case in which a group of young people intentionially injured some mallards .
“ People just need to slow down when it comes to the wildlife , ’’ Gosselin said .

I ’m a big advocate of much strengthened financial regulation .
One argument I do n’t buy , however , is that we should try to shrink financial institutions down to the point where nobody is too big to fail .
Basically , it ’s just not possible .
The point is that finance is deeply interconnected , so that even a moderately large player can take down the system if it implodes .
Remember , it was Lehman — not Citi or B of A — that brought the world to the brink .
And as far as I know , there never was a time when policymakers could have viewed the collapse of a major money center bank with equanimity .
They certainly were worried about systemic risk in 1982 , when I had something of a front - row seat .
There were fears that the Latin debt crisis would take down one or more money center banks — Citi , or Chase , say .
And policy was shaped in part by the desire to make sure that did n’t happen .
Bear in mind that this was in the days before the repeal of Glass - Steagal , before finance got so big and wild ; the New Deal regulations were mostly still in place .
Yet even then major banks were too big to fail .
So I think of the pursuit of a world in which everyone is small enough to fail as the pursuit of a golden age that never was .
Regulate and supervise , then rescue if necessary ; there ’s no way to make this automatic .
Apologies for straying from the usual technology - related matters on this blog , but having woken up this morning and being confronted with a barrage of posts on Twitter like this one ( " Okay people ... what happened there ?
I turn my back for 5 minutes and the North of England goes fascist . " ) , and general despair and fist - shaking at the people of Yorkshire and Humber or indeed NW England , let 's just look at the stats , taken from the BBC website .
In the two regions where a BNP MEP was returned , the actual number of people voting BNP has gonesince 2004 .
In Yorkshire and Humber , their vote shrank from 126,538 to 120,139 .
In NW England , it was down from 134,959 to 132,094 .
The reason the BNP got in was the massive slump in turnout that depressed the votes for the major parties and increased the BNP 's percentage share of the vote overall : turnout was down from 42.6 % to 32.3 % in Yorkshire and Humber , and down from 40.9 % to 31.7 % in NW England .
It was notable last week that people on Twitter were becoming irate because of the constant badgering of other users to ask them to vote .
While the BNP vote increased in the UK overall – indeed , it increased in every other region than the two that actually returned MEPs – people were right to badger .
Because the BNP 's new European statesmen exist purely because of disillusionment with Labour , Lib Dems and Tories .
The security operation at this week 's G20 summit was thrown into chaos last night when it emerged that the entire network of central London 's wireless CCTV cameras will have to be turned off because of a legal ruling .
The Department for Transport ( DfT ) has ruled that Westminster council 's mobile road cameras - a third of the authority 's CCTV network - " do not fully meet the resolution standards required " and must be switched off by midnight tomorrow .
The blackout begins on the eve of the summit , when world leaders arrive in the capital and protesters take to the streets .
The council only discovered last week that images from its newly installed £ 15 m traffic cameras do not meet the quality required under the Traffic Management Act , which comes into force on 1 April .
In an urgently drafted letter seen by the Guardian and hand - delivered to the transport secretary , Geoff Hoon , on Friday , the council warns its entire network of wireless cameras will need to be shut down unless the minister finds a way to give special dispensation .
" This would have a serious impact on our ability to manage our road network safely , as well as impeding our community protection efforts , " the letter states .
It adds : " We are seeking authorisation from DfT as a matter of urgency to enable Westminster to continue using its digital CCTV network . "
The 60 cameras in question use the latest digital technology and transmit images using Wi-Fi .
While they are primarily for traffic enforcement , according to the council the cameras are " an essential additional tool " to tackle crime and disorder , and have been fixed to strategic locations across the capital ahead of the summit .
The 24 - hour live footage from the cameras , which monitor roads around the West End , Belgravia , Trafalgar Square , Knightsbridge , Oxford Street and London 's main bridges , is also accessible to police and the intelligence services .
A further 160 " permanent " CCTV cameras run by the authority are unaffected .
However , security officials believe a shutdown of the mobile road cameras could hamper the G20 security operation , which will require police to secure the safe passage of dozens of motorcades carrying delegations VIP diplomats and leaders .
" Frankly , it could n't have come at a worse time , " a source said .
" These are not just parking enforcement cameras , they 're for public order and we 've got the G20 world leaders coming .
This is a complete disaster . "
Under the legislation , traffic cameras must be capable of recording at 720 x 576 pixels , an analogue broadcast standard .
Westminster 's wireless network of road cameras , introduced last year , is the only fully digital traffic enforcement system operating in the UK , and is regarded as one of the most advanced in the world .
But its picture quality is only 704 x 576 pixels .
The DfT 's enforcement branch , the Vehicle Certification Agency , has ruled it does not comply with the law .
DfT lawyers were last night frantically exploring a way to exempt Westminster from the legislation .
A department statement said : " To ensure local authorities have a fair and transparent way of detecting unlawful drivers , any recording device must meet minimum requirements . "
The council last night confirmed that - barring an 11th - hour U - turn - it would have to switch off the network tomorrow to comply with the act .
Danny Chalkley , the council 's cabinet member for environment and transport , said in a statement : " The DfT 's position is ludicrous and stuck in the dark ages .
" [ This ] could result in millions of pounds of taxpayers ' money being needed to replace the current cameras , all because of a tiny difference in image resolution on the TV screen . "

Are you a timeshare owner looking for some timeshare relief ?
No matter the reason , getting rid of a timeshare right now can be a real nightmare !
There are plenty of ways that seem like possible solutions to your timeshare problem , but especially in this economy , many of them frankly do not pan out .
So , go with a sure thing on your first try and stop wasting valuable time and money .
The first thing you realize when you attempt to rid yourself of your timeshare is how difficult it is to do it on your own .
Yet , many agents and listing companies over - promise and under - deliver on the high fees they charge .
Even most charities will not take a timeshare any longer .
They are finding them just as hard to move as anyone else , and they certainly do not want to get stuck with maintenance fees that they cannot afford .
There are more and more developers who are renting their unused timeshare inventory for less than owners ’ annual maintenance fees .
This discovery has outraged a great deal of owners .
First , the resort itself competes against the owners for renters with discounted rates .
Secondly , owners are forced to lower their rent to match offers .
Lastly , when you take into account the fact that people can rent significantly cheaper than they can buy , it makes sense that selling a timeshare is a problem .
Similarly , you will find that even people who like the idea of timeshares are n’t buying them anymore .
With the downturn in the economy , traveling is quickly becoming a luxury .
While we travel to see relatives and loved ones , we are forgoing the leisure destinations .
Therefore , across the board , owners are trying to get rid of their timeshares .
Competition for the rare buyer is fierce .
Unless you can offer something that thousands of others do not , you will not get a deal .
So if listing your timeshare does n’t work , donating it does n’t work , and you ca n’t even rent it , what ’s left ?
There is hope .
Use Timeshare Relief !
We ’ll transfer the timeshare out of your name so that you will never have to pay another maintenance fee again .
What ’s more we guarantee this timeshare transfer transaction to our clients .
Unfortunately , we cannot accept timeshares that are not paid in full .
Other qualifications may apply .
But call or contact us immediately before another maintenance fee or special assessment bill hits your mailbox !

The issue of getting rid of a timeshare can really weigh you down , so take action today .

Nintendo Rejected New Technologies From Microsoft And Sony
According to a Financial Times report this week , Nintendo toyed with technologies similar to Project Natal and the Sony wand announced at E3 and rejected them , citing better results from Nintendo ’s own accelerometers .
Nintendo apparently made experimental games using hardware rigs that were similar to those from Sony and Microsoft .
Financial Times says this is Nintendo ’s way of throwing the gauntlet at the feet of it ’s two competitors .
I say it ’s more like a schoolyard insult from a company that sees its highly successful strategy adapted to fit the more hardcore consoles .
Nintendo has sold some 50 million units worldwide , compared to 30 million 360s and just 23 million PS3s .
As Nintendo president , Satoru Iwata , says , “ Companies whose people said that motion - sensing would n’t work are now proposing motion sensors . ”
Will they be able to top the Wii ?
Despite what FT says , Mr. Iwata seems nervous , and a little confused “ Until they say when they ’re releasing it , how much it costs and what software it comes with , we wo n’t know whether that is the route we should have taken . ”
So Nintendo rejected the technologies because the Wii had a better solution , but it ’s still potentially a route Nintendo should have taken ?
Sounds like Nintendo dumped a hot girl , found out about her incredible new boyfriend and stands waiting for the wedding vows to make an objection .

The most pirated acts are likely to be the most popular , finds the study File - sharing sites help make popular acts more popular , finds a study .
The research , by industry body PRS for Music , showed the most pirated pop songs tend to be those at the top of the music charts .
There was little evidence that file - sharing sites helped unsigned and new bands find an audience , it found .
It suggests file - sharing sites are becoming an alternative broadcast network comparable to radio stations as a way of hearing music .
Long tail
The study , carried out by Will Page , chief economist at the PRS , and Eric Garland , head of media tracking firm Big Champagne , looked at patterns of music usage among file - sharers .
It aimed to see if that pattern of use had any lessons for the way music is marketed and sold .
Many have claimed that the unprecedented amount of choice on the web would give rise to new models of music distribution .
This " Long Tail " argument , say the authors , claims : " If you offer people more choice , and help them make that choice , they will take that choice . "
Action against pirate sites has not stopped swappers , said the study .
If true , this could mean that music makers should focus attention away from a few popular acts towards the mass of bands with smaller , dedicated followings .
However , found the pair , usage on file - sharing sites closely mirrors that on legitimate music sites .
There was no evidence of the Long Tail operating .
The authors wrote : " Much of the volume ( sales or swaps ) is concentrated amongst a small proportion of the available tracks . "
The reason for this , claim the authors , is that there is too much choice on file - sharing sites .
The breadth of music available means that people do not have time or do not want to search through it all or listen to it all for the tracks that they might like .
Instead their searches are constrained by what they see in the media , and what their friends are listening to .
They said : " After taking into account some geographic differences , the top of the many music charts , from licensed and unlicensed venues , are markedly similar . "
They added that BigChampagne had never seen a big hit on the pirate networks that was not also a top seller in the licensed world .
Mr Page and Mr Garland suggest that file - sharing sites are reinforcing divisions in the music world and only making the popular more popular .
Despite this , the report said , the fact that music was free on file - sharing networks meant people did occasionally listen to bands they had never heard of before .
By contrast , on sites where people have to pay to listen they only download the tracks they know they want .
" If the sellers sell it , it might never be bought ; but if the swappers offer it , at least one person will likely take it , " said the study .
Given this , said the authors , it might be worth music companies regarding file - sharing sites as comparable to radio and TV as a broadcast network .

Shell House Design
This Spiral House design by Senosiain Arquitectos was patterned after a shell .
Imagine being a chil raised in this structure , a fairy tale wonderland of
architectural and interior design delights .
President Obama will name former astronaut Charles F. Bolden Jr. as NASA administrator , according to three congressional sources .
If confirmed by the Senate , the retired Marine Corps general would be the first African American to head the agency .
The timing , the sources said , is keyed to the landing of the shuttle Atlantis , which remained in orbit Friday because of bad weather but will return today or Sunday .
The sources were called Friday and briefed by the White House , which would not comment for this article .
The president will also announce that his campaign space advisor , Lori Garver , will be Bolden ’s deputy , the sources said .
Bolden would take over an agency in flux , one that needs to redefine its mission , adapt to budget realities and reestablish a sense of purpose to satisfy a chief executive who has called it “ adrift . ”

Obama will make the announcement less than a week after the two men met in the White House for an interview that included frank discussions about Bolden ’s ties to NASA contractors and his opposition to future budget cuts that Obama has suggested may be necessary .
In picking Bolden , who could not be reached for comment , the president will throw his support behind a man who flew more than 100 combat missions during the Vietnam War before joining NASA for four shuttle flights , including two as commander .
Bolden , 62 , would be the second astronaut to lead NASA .
But Bolden was not Obama ’s first choice .
Earlier this year , the president favored one of his campaign supporters -- retired Air Force Gen. J. Scott Gration -- but Gration was rejected by opposition on Capitol Hill .
Foes in Congress , including Sen. Bill Nelson ( D - Fla. ) , also sank the bid of Steve Isakowitz , an Energy Department official .
Nelson has been Bolden ’s biggest champion .
The two men flew together aboard a shuttle mission in 1986 .
Nelson ’s office could not be reached for comment .

Bolden won praise Friday as a strong leader , but agency watchers were concerned that he lacks a close relationship with Obama .
NASA ’s previous administrator , Michael Griffin , was an outsider to the White House .
Since he resigned in January , Griffin has complained that during his time at NASA he was never able to get around the “ unnamed staffers ” in the Office of Management and Budget who regularly cut the agency ’s programs .
“ Clearly , Bolden does not have the relations with the president that Gration has , ” said Roger Launius , a curator at the National Air and Space Museum in Washington .
“ What Bolden has is a very strong understanding of NASA culture . ”
There also have been concerns about Bolden ’s ties to NASA contractors , including a brief stint in 2005 as a lobbyist for Minneapolis - based rocket company Alliant Techsystems Inc. and more recently as a board member for Rancho Cordova , Calif . - based GenCorp Inc .

These connections could hinder Bolden ’s ability to lead the agency as NASA makes the transition from the shuttle -- due to retire in 2010 or 2011 -- to its next manned - spaceflight vehicle , called Constellation .
Constellation , which consists of the Ares I rocket and Orion capsule , has had technical problems , is billions of dollars over budget and wo n’t fly before 2015 .
Bolden ’s past work for Constellation contractors could run afoul of tough ethics rules Obama instituted when he took office .
The executive order says appointees cannot “ participate in any particular matter . . . that is directly and substantially related to [ a ] former employer or former clients , including regulations and contracts . ”
Until March 2008 , Bolden served on the board of directors for GenCorp , whose Aerojet subsidiary makes propulsion systems and maneuvering engines for the shuttle and Constellation ’s Orion capsule .

Bolden ’s nomination was viewed by many as a step to stabilize an agency that has lacked an administrator since Jan. 20 .
Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski ( D - Md. ) , who chairs a subcommittee that oversees NASA ’s budget , cited Bolden ’s biography .
“ We think that Mr. Bolden has a very hefty background .
He has a compelling personal story , ” she said Thursday .
Born in segregated South Carolina , Bolden attended high school in Columbia before graduating from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1968 .
As a military aviator , he earned several honors , including the Distinguished Flying Cross .
Bolden also flew on the 1990 shuttle mission that deployed the Hubble Space Telescope .

Q : We have had our dog Schageh for about three years now , and he is still fearful , even of us .
He was in the shelter system for about a year before we got him .
He is more confident when the other dogs in the house are near us , but does n’t like to be by people [… ]
Two weeks ago , we started hearing rumors that Supreme Court Justice David Souter would be retiring at the end of the current term .
Last night , those rumors were confirmed :
WASHINGTON — Justice David H. Souter plans to retire at the end of the term in June , giving President Obama his first appointment to the Supreme Court , four people informed about the decision said Thursday night .
Justice Souter , who was appointed in 1990 by a Republican president , the first George Bush , but became one of the most reliable members of the court ’s liberal wing , has grown increasingly sour on Washington and intends to return to his home state , New Hampshire , according to the people briefed on his plans .
One official said the decision might be announced as early as Friday .
The departure will open the first seat for a Democratic president to fill in 15 years and could prove a test of Mr. Obama ’s plans for reshaping the nation ’s judiciary .
Confirmation battles for the Supreme Court in recent years have proved to be intensely partisan and divisive moments in Washington , but Mr. Obama has more leeway than his predecessors because his party holds such a strong majority in the Senate .
On that note , the Legal Times Blog has this early take on who might be on Obama ’s short list :
During the presidential campaign in 2007 , Obama made that point when he said , “ Sometimes we ’re only looking at academics or people who ’ve been in the [ lower courts ] .
If we can find people who have life experience and they understand what it means to be on the outside , what it means to have the system not work for them , that ’s the kind of person I want on the Supreme Court . ”
That said , most of the names that have been mentioned as possible Obama nominees do have judicial or academic experience .
Some of those names : — Sonia Sotomayor , a Hispanic female who sits on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit . — Elena Kagan , the former dean of Harvard Law School who is less than two months into her tenure as the first female U.S. solicitor general .
— Harold Koh , the former Yale Law School dean and an Asian - American , whose nomination as State Department legal adviser is pending .
— Kathleen Sullivan , the former Stanford Law School dean and a partner in the New York office of Quinn Emanuel Urquhart Oliver & Hedges . — Diane Wood , a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit . — Kim Wardlaw , a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit who is Hispanic .
— Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick , a former assistant U.S. attorney general for civil rights who is African - American .
The conventional wisdom is that Souter ’s retirement is n’t that big a deal because his replacement is unlikely to change the ideological balance of the Court , but Ilya Somin points out that this is n’t necessarily the case :
It ignores the fact that the newly appointed justice will likely serve for many years to come , during which time the composition of the rest of the Court will change .
Today , the average Supreme Court justice serves for over 26 years .
Over such a lengthy tenure , there is likely to be turnover among the other justices , and the current appointee ’s ideology may have a major impact on the balance of power over the long run even if its immediate effect is insignificant .
For example , let ’s assume that Justice Souter ’s replacement always votes exactly as Souter himself would have .
So long as the rest of the Court remains the same as today , nothing will change .
However , if Obama is then able to replace even one of the five more conservative justices , the balance of power would become very different than it would have been had Souter been replaced by a more conservative justice than himself .
What would have been a 5 - 4 conservative majority will become a 5 - 4 liberal one .
Justice Antonin Scalia , for example , is 73 and could eventually be replaced by a liberal Obama appointee – especially if Obama wins reelection in 2012 .
Moreover , Souter ’s replacement will likely serve for decades to come .
So Scalia ’s possible replacement by an Obama appointee is just one of many events that could happen during the tenure of Souter ’s successor that could make his or her ideology extremely important .
Somin is , of course , correct that , in the long term , the Justice that replaces Souter will have some impact on the Court , but , as a I noted when discussing the initial Souter retirement rumors two weeks ago , the short - term is an entirely different story :
Souter is n’t the only Justice who could be close to retirement .
John Paul Stevens is 88 and has been on the Supreme Court for 34 years ; although he was appointed by a Republican he has drifted to the left of the Court ever since and would likely be more comfortable having his replacement named by a Democrat .
Additionally Ruth Bader Ginsburg is 76 and has recently not been in good health .
Of course , all three of these Justices could resign this year and their replacements would not have any real impact on the balance of the Court .
The truly significant resignations would come from Anthony Kennedy , who is 73 , and Antonin Scalia , who is 73 .
Nonetheless , it ’s entirely likely that Barack Obama will have the opportunity to name two or three new Supreme Court Justices before his first term is over .
And if he ’s re-elected in 2012 , there could be two or even three more on top of that .
In the long run , that will be what really matters .
C/P : Below The Beltway
IMPORTANT – Whether you are a tournament , league , casual , novice or just a sales clerk trying to gain Product Information and Experience , if you take your time , and go through this section very slowly , digesting everything , you will increase your skill level a full two levels or more !
So take this very seriously .
PERFORMANCE
Personally , I ’m an extremist when it comes to doing well at something , but I ’m lazy at practicing .
I play to win , I hate to lose , but I ’m a good loser .
I do many things well at a high skill level .
Besides darts , I also play chess , table tennis and pool .
It ’s tough to find the time to do anything , let alone practice multiple sports .
How do I get away with it ?
I ’ve learned a secret that helps tremendously in reducing the amount of the down - time ( practice ) needed to achieve the desired higher skill levels .
SECRET
The secret is to become a copycat .
It does n’t sound too appealing , but it ’s extremely effective in a short amount of time .
If someone is the world ’s greatest tennis player and I made it a point to mimic , copy , imitate , duplicate everything that they do , I probably still would n’t be as good as they are , but I ’d be pretty dam good just the same .
Once you have a grip on everything involved and have control , you then can fine tune their style into a style that you ’ll find more comfortable .
Do n’t try to imitate the better players , instead , imitate the best player .
Study everything that they do , no matter how small it is .
Analyze it to the max .
If you ’re unfamiliar with the top level of professional darts players today , the man you really want to emulate is a guy from England by the name of Phil Taylor
This guy is unconscious !
He ’s won the World ’s Championship 12 times and of those 12 , 10 of them were in a ROW !
Need I say more ?
Incidentally , there currently is Professional Darts on TV ; unfortunately , the times are odd hours so you ’ll have to “ tape - it . ”
Check your cable ’s Listings Guide weekly by doing a day by day search for “ darts ” under the “ theme ” search .
The listings for the entire following week come out on Sunday .
This just in , the Professional Darts Corporation ( PDC ) now has their Website ( www.planetdarts.co.uk) set up so that viewers , who pay either a monthly or annual fee , can view professional darts matches from previous and also current tournaments , as well as tournament boards in progress , live commentary , interviews and classic footage of previous match highlights .
You can find it by searching Google for “ DartsTV ” .
This will be a huge boost to darts popularity !
Ok , let ’s get on to the basics .
Keep in mind that no matter what you do , it ’s an “ ART . ”
Everything you do is a “ SCIENCE . ”
The more you think about it and the more you do it , the more accomplished you will become .
Be persistent and unsatisfied .
The BASICS :
STANCE / ANGULATION BREATHING TECHNIQUE GRIP THROWING RHYTHM DOMINANT EYE SIGHTING FEEDER HAND AIMING
The TOOLS :
VISUALIZATION MUSCLE MEMORY MATH SITUATIONAL ANALYSIS
Prelude :
Anytime , I repeat , ANYTIME , you do something differently for the very first time , it will feel funny , awkward , unusual , strange , etc .
It ’s ok .
This is expected , but the more you not only practice this change , the more common and natural it will feel .
This is what practice is all about .
It ’s about incorporating beneficial changes into your shooting technique through conditioning
If you get a customer saying that to you after they tried a suggested change that you just made , you should just sooth them and tell them that the feeling is just a part of the adjustment period .
Darts is a game of adjustments just like bowling .
The better players will make and fine tune these adjustments all the time !
Always , if something is working well , do n’t change a thing .
If things are n’t working , do something different , immediately !
Simple , but changing is difficult .
The BASICS :
STANCE / ANGULATION
Logically the basics start from the foundation of your feet upward .
What dictates where you plant your feet to begin with , is the imperative need of a fully extended arm and shoulder , directly out from your face , which is looking squarely at the dartboard , with your head at about a 30 - 40 degree angle to your shoulder line and also directly in front of your dominant eye .
Your shoulders need to be angled so that your “ sight - line ” ( the line of your vision as you are looking at your target ) should be just in front of your shoulder .
It ’s a MUST that your dart is shot from directly in front of your dominant eye .
Any other position will result in total inconsistencies .
Many players make the mistake of standing at the oche ( throwing line ) with their shoulders parallel with the oche .
In this stance , you might be steady , but either you ’re arm extension will be stunted by the position of your shoulder or your darts will always veer to the side that you ’re throwing from ( right handed thrower ’s darts will veer to the right , lefty ’s to the left ) .
When you are putting yourself in position for the first time , do n’t stand at the oche with your foot parallel to the oche .
This stance is too unnatural and it is a stance that stimulates body movement .
Try to think “ natural ” all the time .
When you walk up to the oche , the way to set yourself up for a particular shot is to first turn your face directly at the target and then turn your body so you get the natural angle to produce maximum arm extension .
A HUGE mistake by many people here is that some shooters will stay in the exact same spot on the oche for shooting every target .
This does nothing but crucifies yourself .
You have just complicated the variations of the ways to throw a dart by a hundred fold .
People have a “ natural ” straight line that they throw on to .
Being able to throw on a straight line is 50 % of the battle in darts .
If you can do that , you will be able to comfortably focus on the remaining 50 % horizontal planes , which is much easier .
Posture is a part of your stance .
If you ’re stance is awkward , your posture will equally be uncomfortable because they are connected .
When people are uncomfortable they tend to shoot too quickly , and then the control does n’t materialize .
Once you do n’t feel the control , it registers psychologically , confidence is deflated and then the only thing that can help is luck , which never happens often enough .
The biggest question about posture is : Can leaning help ?
We all have to answer this question to ourselves .
If leaning to your desired extension produces any movement in your body through the act of shooting , it then , is not a good thing .
What I do for “ body control ” is that once I get to my positional stance , I make it a point to keep the end of my nose , perfectly still .
The rest of the body just seems to tag along .
It works for me .
Try it .
Also what you might want to try is leaning slightly .
Pretend that the dartboard is directly in front of you just out of arms length and that at the end of your follow through , by leaning slightly , you will be able to physically push the dart into the board as if it were a thumbtack .
With this method , your groupings will become more centrally positioned .
BREATHING TECHNIQUE
In only one practice session , you can pull up your skill level , one full level if you do this .
If for just one practice session , you spend a good hour plus on being consistent with this proper breathing technique and incorporate it into your practice session , it will be cemented in solidly .
Do not aim at a specific target .
Just limit your throwing to three horizontal level areas of the board , the trip 16 / trip - 15 / level , the bull level and the trip / 12 - trip /18 level .
Always start at the bottom and work upwards .
This breathing technique will solidify your body internally .
It ’s necessary for foundation , control and consistency .
It joins with your stance and posture in harmony for a necessary foundation .
This breathing technique will allow you to throw the dart at the point in time where your body is most still .
The three worst times to throw a dart are while :
1. Holding Your Breath –
This produces tension which actually is movement .
2. Exhaling –
This is definite movement , lungs , tissue , muscles , nerves , etc .
3. Inhaling – The same as above .
CORRECT EXECUTION
From a normal breathing pattern , exhale to your fullest until your exhale stops .
It is from this point in time , after the end of the exhale , until you begin to inhale that there is a 2 to 3 second gap where you are actually not breathing and your body is ultimately STILL .
It is within this time that you should throw your dart .
GRIP
This is the most complicated topic in darts .
Everyone ’s fingers are different and everyone ’s darts are almost equally different .
In a nutshell I can tell you three beneficial things :
1 . Your index finger and thumb need to have an opposing grip .
In other words , these two fingers need to be the last two fingers to leave the dart , and most importantly , SIMULTANEOULSY !
If you have your fingers staggered , not opposite each other , the dart , when it leaves your fingers , will be moving from side to side , fishtailing , as the dart is coming off your fingers .
2 . The next thing that would be beneficial is that you will find more control on the dart if these two fingers are just slightly behind the balance point .
To find the balance point , stick out a finger and try actually balancing a dart on your finger .
For a test , try firmly holding the nose of the dart , and then try moving the back of the dart side to side .
It moves easily .
The same thing will happen gripping too much to the back of the dart .
So if you ’re in the middle , the dart will come off your fingers in a very controlled fashion .
3 . Lastly , our dart ’s ergonomics design , allows a naturally grip release with the proper grip , and also , due to the pivoting action of the forearm from the elbow , a person receives more consistent releases ( control ) if they angle the point of their dart , instead of directly at the target , instead , point it at 11 o’clock , about one half inch away from the center of your target .
In essence , a dart does n’t actually go straight .
It curves slightly to the right , if you ’re throwing with your right hand , and the opposite for a lefty .
What also contributes to this affect is that there ’s much more skin surface area on the thumb as compared to the side of the index finger .
MAJOR FAULT : If you hold the dart in your hand , by your finger tips ( the very ends of your fingers ) , you will struggle forever .
Your real motor skills come from the meaty areas of your fingers .
For the thumb , it would be , on the front of your thumb naturally , and opposite the base of your thumbnail and for the index finger , it would be just below the second knuckle .
To test this out get a long bolt with a matching nut .
Try to put on and take off the nut as fast as you can just using your thumb and index finer .
This will show you where your controls are .
THROWING RHYTHM
Having a good rhythm will increase your probabilities of having successful throws and it will increase your confidence level .
On the other end of the spectrum , if you ’re playing 501 and you have 123 left , and your mind goes blank , you ’re going to take more time than you usually do and that will detrimentally affect your throwing accuracy .
Your rhythm is also tied into your breathing technique , so when you ’re practicing your annual breathing technique , also be conscious of your throwing rhythm .
You must maintain your throwing rhythm always .
DOMINANT EYE
Typically if you are either a normal right handed or left handed person , and you do n’t do anything else with your “ other ” hand , then the chances are that your normal eye ( right - right and left - left ) will be your dominant eye .
However , if you do other things with your other hand , things might happen and this might be the reason why you ’re having a difficult time .
ASCERTAINING YOUR DOMINANT EYE
You can determine your dominant eye simply .
Look at an object , any object .
Keeping one of your eyes open ( take turns ) while you close the other .
Of the two variations here , the one variation where there is “ NO CHANGE ” to the object visually , will be the “ tell ” for the dominant eye .
The eye being tested , was the eye that remained open .
SIGHTING
In billiards , being a one planar game , it is relatively easy to become consistent in shot making due to the concept of the “ Proportion ” Sighting and Aiming System .
With darts , it ’s a very difficult game .
There ’s very few perfect games .
True control in darts comes from the “ sight line ” that is coming from your eyes to your target .
This is your life line .
Once your dart and hand go off that perspective , you ’re success is going to crash and burn , big time !
For consistency , you need to aim down your sight line in much the same manner that a marksman sites down the barrel of his gun .
There is a high percentage of people that have a major fault in sighting .
Their mistaken impression is that their vision is just that , their vision .
What they do n’t realize is that their vision is actually working as an invisible guide for their hand and arm to follow .
You might be one of these people yourself .
Many of these people shoot the dart from everywhere but from the point where they should be shooting it from , which is directly in front of your dominant eye .
They shoot the dart from the side of their head or off the top of their head , or from a lower position in front of their chin .
These methods need to be eliminated forever if you want success to come to your door .
FEEDER HAND
The “ Feeder Hand ” feeds the darts to your throwing hand .
Do n’t take this hand for granted .
This hand if NOT used beneficially , can eliminate any chances for you to be successful at darts .
In analyzing this functioning situation you first need to understand that this hand needs to be “ ever ready ” in its tasks .
It ’s not just good enough to pass the dart , but what is important , is that for consistency ’s sake , the dart should be in the exact same position in relationship to it ’s flight every time .
This can be accomplished prior to walking up to the throwing line .
The correct method to hold the darts is by the VERY ENDS of the points .
Why is this ?
Well , the more you cover the darts with your feeder hand , the more time it ’s going to take for you to pass the dart .
Fumbling usually occurs .
This will interrupt your throwing rhythm .
Even though Phil Taylor is the best dart player that will probably ever be , his one flaw is his feeder hand .
If you watch him on a match on TV , notoriously he drops 2 or 3 darts per match .
You think he ’s nervous ?
Not one bit .
The second thing you should do with this feeder hand is to position the darts so that they are almost directly under your throwing hand .
This is important because it prevents your throwing hand and arm from making any lateral movements , which could affect your throw .
Keeping it straight , keeps it safe .
Lastly , very few people do this correctly .
If you hold your feeder arm loosely at your side , it will produce movement which will affect your balance .
Try this .
Stand at the line as you would if you are shooting .
Now take your feeder hand and slowly raise it out to your side .
The result will be that you will lose your balance to that side .
The solution is to physically pull your arm into your side so that the inside of your forearm is somewhat attached to your stomach area .
Once you make this adjustment , the control will come .
AIMING
Novices have a difficult time having success mostly because they DO NOT hold their dart in front of their dominant eye when shooting .
How can you aim IF you do n’t have something on your sight line that will help you to fine tune the alignment of the dart to your target ?
If you do n’t have the dart in front of your dominant eye , then you really are n’t aiming at all !
If you are n’t aiming , then what you are doing is guessing and hoping .
Common sense ?
YES !
When the dart is properly positioned it allows you to gain control and consistency by following your sight line to your target with your dart .
If you find that using the dart does n’t work , then try using the inside of your thumb , next to your dart , as a guide to your desired target .
Think of this situation as similar to bowling .
Bowlers use the arrows that are on the lanes as a guide to roll their balls onto the desired paths .
Most professional bowlers never look at the pins until the ball is off and away .
Correlation !
The TOOLS :
These are just a handful of the different tools you could use or be doing to improve your performance levels .
If you have an idea for a tool , think about it .
Dwell on it .
Zone out on it .
Everything in this world today started as a dream .
Use your creativity and think outside the box !
Bring it to fruition !
VISUALIZATION
For those of you with an aptitude in spatial relations , this is pretty easy .
The rest of you will have to work for this tool , but it ’s worth it .
Basically , visualization is the skill of imaging a 3 - dimensional object as if it were real .
By being able to do this , you can put an imaginary dart in a specific spot in your target , complete with the angulation of the dart .
Once you do this , your mission , is to connect the real dart in your hand with the imaginary one that ’s already in the dartboard , almost totally displacing it .
Naturally we are n’t talking about shooting the dart out of a gun .
What you are trying to do is to put the real dart onto the exact trajectory that the imaginary dart would have taken to arrive at its exact position .
Basically , that ’s it .
It does work and lots of shooters use this !
It takes time , but if you have all of the other BASICS down pat , this will be next in your bag of tricks .
MUSCLE MEMORY
Most everyone is familiar with this term .
Muscle memory is developed through repetitiveness .
We all know what it feels like to do something that we ’ve done before .
The goal behind this concept is to simply duplicate that same action .
In darts , we all typically shoot the same shots over and over again .
It just becomes second nature to hit these targets , so we try to repeat the same actions that we did before when we ’ve hit our targets .
SITUALTIONAL ANALYSIS
It ’s important to be proficient at shooting , but it ’s clearly not enough .
Not only do you have to focus on the shooting , but you have to clearly handle the pressure , the scoring , the environment surrounding you as well as what your intended future targets will be .
There will be many variations of any and all of these factors .
What will increase your success , will be ample amounts of experience in all situations , whether it ’s pub darts , leagues or tournaments .
If you think you ’re “ not good enough ” for any of these areas of competition , you ’re selling yourself short .
This is where you need to be , no matter what skill level that you might be .
If you love playing darts , just do it !
MATH
Math is as much a part of the game of darts as throwing the darts .
Developing your math skills takes time .
To get yourself started on the “ MATH TRAIL , ” do yourself a huge favor and any chance you get , you need to be keeping score for other people ’s dart game .
Knowing the numbers will allow you to keep and also improve your rhythm at the throwing line .
They will make you more confident contribute to improving your skill level .
It ’s a must !

Shahid Malik says he has " done nothing wrong " Allegations about MPs ' allowances are to be examined by a panel of police officers and lawyers amid growing calls for action over the expenses scandal .
They will decide whether individual complaints merit a criminal inquiry .
Meanwhile another Labour MP , David Chaytor , has been accused of claiming mortgage interest for a property on which the mortgage had been paid off .
Earlier junior minister Shahid Malik stood down pending an inquiry into his expenses .
He has defended his actions .
On Friday evening Mr Malik 's Dewsbury Constituency Labour Party gave its unanimous support to the MP , saying his " integrity is completely intact " .
Due to the increase in ... allegations [ we have ] decided to convene a panel to assess allegations ... to decide whether criminal investigations should be started
Crown Prosecution Service / Metropolitan Police statement
Calls to prosecute expenses MPs Expense row minister steps down The Daily Telegraph has alleged Mr Chaytor , MP for Bury North , received nearly £ 13,000 for a flat in Westminster that had been paid off in 2004 .
The BBC has been unable to speak to Mr Chaytor who is reportedly on a trip to the US , but the Telegraph quotes him as saying there had been an " unforgivable error in my accounting procedures for which I apologise unreservedly " .
He said he would immediately arrange repayment to the fees office , according to the paper .
Former minister Elliot Morley was this week suspended from the Parliamentary Labour Party after claiming £ 16,000 expenses for a mortgage he had already paid off .
Situation ' spiralling '
MPs from all parties have repaid thousands of pounds for claims made , in the week since the Daily Telegraph began publishing details of expense claims .
On Friday the Metropolitan Police Service ( MPS ) and Crown Prosecution Service ( CPS ) said the panel would hold its first meeting on potential criminal investigations next week .
The Met said it had held meetings with the CPS about expense allegations before the newspaper began its campaign , but had now decided to act .
Please turn on JavaScript .

" Due to the increase in subsequent allegations received by the MPS , the Commissioner and Director of Public Prosecutions have jointly decided to convene a panel to assess allegations in order to decide whether criminal investigations should be started , " a spokesman said .
Many
MPs felt events were now " spiralling out of control " , said BBC political correspondent Jo Coburn .
While it was known the complaints made to police could come to nothing , it came as " little comfort " to MPs returning to their constituencies on Friday , she added .
Also on Friday , Tory leader David Cameron abandoned his party political broadcast for the European Parliament Election , and instead broadcast an apology over the expenses issues , which included a pledge to " sort it out " .
Luxury items Liberal Democrat culture spokesman Richard Younger - Ross , Tory MP Nadine Dorries and former long - serving Labour MP Tam Dalyell are also among the latest MPs to feature in the Telegraph .
Mr Younger - Ross , who represents Teignbridge in Devon , said he had repaid more than £ 4,000 claimed for mirrors , a hi-fi , and a £ 1,475 chest of drawers for his rented London flat .
It 's just like the financial crisis , there are now toxic assets in the system and the whole system is tainted by it
Lord Falconer
Mr Younger - Ross said he was given no advice on how to spend his allowances for living in London , except that it should not include luxury or antique items .
Writing in her blog , Ms Dorries rejected a string of allegations about her expenses .
The paper said she had " admitted " only spending free weekends and holidays in the property she calls her main home .
Instead , the paper said , she spent most of her time in a rented house in her constituency for which she claimed £ 18,000 second home expenses over two years .
She also denied allegations she had tried to claim on her second home allowance for a hotel room just before Christmas and another on New Year 's Eve .
As well as Mr Morley being suspended and Mr Malik stepping down , a senior adviser to Mr Cameron , Tory MP Andrew MacKay , was forced to relinquish his post after the party said claims he had made towards his second home were " unacceptable " .
Police investigation Tam Dalyell told the BBC he was " entirely relaxed " about allegations in Saturday 's Daily Telegraph that he attempted to claim £ 18,000 for bookcases , two months before he retired from Parliament in 2005 .
The former father of the House said he had needed somewhere to store all the books he would be taking from his Commons office - including many years ' worth of Hansard records .
Tam Dalyell said he submitted a claim for £ 18,000 for bookcases
He said he submitted the receipt for £ 18,000 to the Commons fees office and asked how much they thought it would be fair to claim - eventually , he said , they paid about £ 7,800 towards the bookcases .
The news that police and lawyers are to begin looking into the expenses allegations follows growing calls for a non-internal inquiry .
The Mayor of Middlesbrough and former senior police officer Ray Mallon has called for probes into potential fraud .
And the TaxPayers ' Alliance has complained to police about Elliot Morley 's mortgage interest claims .
The campaign group joined forces with the Daily Mail newspaper to raise funds for private criminal prosecutions of MPs , if the authorities failed to act .
' Call election ' - poll Former MP Martin Bell has said corruption is endemic in the Commons and has called for " by- elections , de- selections maybe even prosecutions " over the expenses controversy .
Interviewed for the BBC's Politics Show on Sunday , the ex-Tatton MP said Commons Speaker Michael Martin was part of the problem and " had to go " .
Lord Falconer - Lord Chancellor under Tony Blair - said the situation for the whole parliamentary system was dreadful and every politician was to blame .
" We may not individually be people who have abused the expenses system , but it 's just like the financial crisis , there are now toxic assets in the system and the whole system is tainted by it , " he said .
Meanwhile one poll conducted for the BBC has suggested nearly two in three voters believe a general election should be called as soon as possible , following the controversy .
The ComRes survey for BBC Two 's Daily Politics found 65 % agreed .
A similar number - 64 % - said they believed politicians " named and shamed " should be forced to quit Parliament .
On the upcoming European elections , 28 % said they were less likely to vote as a result , while 25 % said it had made them more eager to cast their ballot , and 47 % said it would not affect their decision .
ComRes spoke to 1,011 voters between May 13 and 14 .

Celian Noumbiwe was operated on in 2007 at a doctor ’s surgery in Reading but later his parents opened his nappy and found a “ huge amount ” of blood .
Recording a narrative verdict , the Berkshire Coroner criticised the lack of advice given to the couple on postoperative care , noting that the emergency number given to them did not work .
After the surgery , Carole Youmby and her partner , Monthe Bautrel , originally from France , were encouraged to leave the surgery with the baby within ten minutes when he should have been observed for longer , the court was told .
Ms Youmby said that she had been told that the child ’s nappy should not be changed for four hours .
After calling the emergency number several times , the couple decided to call their GP in the morning .
The next day , February 22 , 2007 , the child was taken from his home in Slough to the nearby Wexham Park Hospital where he died in his mother ’s arms .

Klaus Lackner , a professor at Columbia University who is developing the tree , met with U.S. Energy Secretary Steven Chu last month to talk about the concept .
In an interview with CNN , Lackner said the synthetic tree is " several hundred times better at collecting CO2 " than windmill generators .
Lackner says that for every 1,000 kilograms of carbon dioxide collected , the tree emits just 200 kilograms .
This ratio is more than enough to warrant the relatively high cost of building the trees ( about the same as a new automobile ) or retrofitting coal plants .
June 19 , 2009  --
What 's the murder capital of the nation ?
That depends on who does the counting .
Until this month , that dubious distinction for 2008 fell on Baltimore .
But then , Detroit 's police department conceded the city had 339 murders in 2008 rather than 306 -- making Detroit the deadliest city in the nation .
The disclosure followed newspaper reports that the city had consistently underreported its murder rate , leading to accusations that Detroit , along with other cities , was gaming the system to make the city appear safer .
" Figures do n't lie , but liars sure do figure , " former North Carolina Attorney General Rufus Edmisten , who used to announce that state 's crime statistics , told ABC with a chuckle .
Was Detroit gaming the numbers to avoid an unpopular title ?
It 's a common practice , Edmisten said .
" You have a lot of numbers manipulated , depending on what you want to achieve , " he said .
" If you need more help you say how bad things are .
On the other hand no public official wants to say we 're No. 1 in the number of murders . "
According to the FBI , the total number of murders Detroit reported last year is 306 .
That put Detroit behind Baltimore in per-capita murders , at 36.9 murders per 100,000 residents .
But Detroit Police Department spokesman Rod Liggons says that number undercounts the total .
" Three - thirty - nine is our actual number , " Liggons , who did not immediately return a call from ABC , told The Baltimore Sun .
The higher number pushes Detroit 's rate to 37.4 murders per 100,000 residents , making Detroit the deadliest city with more than 500,000 residents in the nation .
Abbe Smith , director of the Criminal Justice Clinic at Georgetown University Law School , agreed .
" I 'd bet you this is highly politicized , " Smith told ABC News , " especially that in places like Detroit , that are hard - hit by the recession , would do what they could to interpret the statistics in ways that are not quite so damning . "
Murder Statistics Hard to Game for Detroit , Other Cities
But experts say homicide statistics are harder to game because there are few alternatives in a violent death , such as suicide or accidental death .
" Homicide is one of the more accurate crime statistics versus sexual assault , versus prop crimes , etc , " said ABC News Consultant Brad Garrett , a former FBI agent .
In the 1990s , Philadelphia police routinely downgraded rapes to lesser crimes and portrayed the results as drop in crime , The Philadelphia Inquirer reported .
Detroit 's disclosure came after an analysis of homicide cases by The Detroit Free Press found the city was undercounting homicides , in violation of FBI standards .
The Free Press analysis found that among the deaths not considered a homicide were a fatal stabbing and a fatal beating .
City officials have acknowledged that the department uses a different standard than the FBI , based on prosecutors ' reports -- which are generally stricter because they assign intent -- rather than medical examiners ' conclusions .
FBI guidelines say that " agencies must report the willful killing of one individual by another , not the criminal liability of the person or persons involved . "
That is the standard cities should use , ABC's Garrett said .
" It should be uniform , " Garrett said of homicide statistics .
" They should be following the same rules to make it accurate . "
Detroit is n't the only city that 's had trouble with crime statistics .
A recent audit of police practices in Atlanta , funded by the Atlanta Police Foundation , found that the " broken police department " routinely underreported crime , especially as the city prepared to welcome tourists for Atlanta 's 1996 Summer Olympics .
Ever want to just pack up and move … your country ?
If you have n’t heard by now , President Mohamed Nasheed of the Maldives insists buying a new homeland may be the only option for the 300,000 islanders who selected him last year as the country ’s first democratically - elected leader .
That ’s because nightmarish climate change could drown the emerald chain of 1,200 islands and 26 coral atolls that make up the territory located 435 miles southwest of Sri Lanka in the Laccadine Sea of the Indian Ocean .
Location , location , location .
Yes , that ’s the draw to this magnificent tourist escape , as well as the exact cause of the looming threat of a paradise lost under rising waters by the year 2100 , as forecast by the United Nations .
The ground level averages 1.5 m above sea level and the highest point is at 2.3 m – which is the lowest high point in the world , according to Wikipedia .
So , what ’s a new leader to do ?
Shop and save .
“ We can do nothing to stop climate change on our own and so we have to buy land elsewhere , ” Nasheed told the British Guardian after taking office .
“ It ’s an insurance policy for the worst possible outcome .
After all , the Israelis [ began by buying ] land in Palestine . ”
The President told the Guardian that even a “ small rise ” in sea levels would inundate large parts of the archipelago .
Maldivian President Mohamed Nasheed ( right ) and Vice - President Hamid Ansari in Male
All eyes are on this rising star of Asia and his plan to set aside a portion of the Muslim country ’s billion - dollar annual tourist income to invest in a new home , perhaps in Sri Lanka , India or Australia .
The Maldives is an unbelievably exclusive travel destination with spectacular resorts visited by the rich and famous .
It ’s where Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes went on their honeymoon ; they rented a boat and just sailed around the atolls .
No cameras can get to you there .
It ’s as far away as you can get .
And naturally , those running the resorts do well as everything costs a fortune .
The Four Seasons resort at the Maldives is one of many ultra luxury hotels
Speaking out against the government once cost a fortune in terms of freedom for Nasheed , who was arrested and sentenced to prison several times for his political activism , which included writing a popular magazine called Sangu .
Having ascended to power he is wasting no time advocating for his people , including unveiling a plan last month to make his country a carbon - neutral nation within the next 10 years .
According to The Observer , the plan developed by British climate change experts Chris Goodall ( author of Ten Technologies to Save the Planet ) and Mark Lynas seeks to establish a near - zero carbon economy by eliminating all fossil fuel use on the Maldive archipelago by 2020 .
Instead , it is calling for clean electricity to power homes , businesses and vehicles .
Features of the bold initiative include a new renewable electricity generation and transmission infrastructure with 155 large wind turbines , half a square kilometre of rooftop solar panels , and a biomass plant burning coconut husks .
Battery banks would provide back - up storage for when neither wind nor solar energy is available .
As Goodall put it : “ We do n’t want to pretend that this plan is going to be easy to implement .
There will be hiccups , and electricity supply will occasionally be disrupted .
But we think that building a near - zero - carbon Maldives is a realistic challenge .
Get it right and we will show the apathetic developed world that action is possible , and at reasonable cost . ”
Norway also wants to be zero- carbon by 2030 , but The Observer says the Norwegian plan lets a good percentage of global emissions to be offset by investments in forestry schemes abroad .
Meanwhile , Lynas believes Nasheed is on the “ front line of climate change ” as the Maldives is the most vulnerable country in the world .
“ It is a poor country , but here we have a government that is throwing down the gauntlet to the rich , highly polluting countries , ” he said .
The price is huge , said to be about $ 110 m a year for 10 years , but could pay for itself in time as the nation will no longer rely on imported oil products for electricity generation , transport and other functions .
As Nasheed sees it , it ’s a small price when you consider the alternative of watching rich polluting world powers ruin your land .
“ Climate change is a global emergency , ” he reminds us .
“ The world is in danger of going into cardiac arrest , yet we behave as if we ’ve caught a common cold .
Today , the Maldives has announced plans to become the world ’s most eco-friendly country .
I can only hope other nations follow suit . ”
Since 2000 , Florida has been synonymous with badly run and undemocratic elections .
This distinction has not come to it by chance .
Many of the state ’s election officials and legislators work hard to keep eligible voters from casting ballots .
The Florida Legislature is at it again , threatening to pass new rules that would make it harder for eligible voters , especially those from minorities and those who are poor , to register and vote .
Republican state legislators , who are behind the latest bills , want to make it illegal for anyone to get within 100 feet of a line of voters .
That provision would criminalize election protection programs , in which nonpartisan volunteers make themselves available outside of polling places on Election Day to ensure that eligible voters know their legal rights and are able to cast ballots .
The legislation would also impose onerous and unnecessary rules on voter registration drives , including a requirement that registration forms must be turned in within 48 hours .
Grass - roots voter registration drives play an important role in getting poor and minority voters registered .
If this legislation passes , however , many groups may stop registering voters rather than risk jail sentences or fines .
The elderly , a sizable voting bloc in Florida , would also be hard hit .
They would no longer be able to use photo IDs issued by retirement centers or neighborhood associations at the polls .
That would be a serious hardship for the many elderly people who do not have driver ’s licenses .

Pete decries ' Christian Left ' ;
And evangelicals wonder why so many have ' left Christianity ' ?!
by Jeremy Hooper
Tit :
" I think there are Christians who struggle with the sin of homosexuality -- but proud homosexual Christians ?
That 's an oxymoron to me in the same way as I would say proud adulterous Christians , " he adds .
" And so , I think we have to be very careful because I see the tactic of the Emergent Church and the Christian left is to start talking more and more about ' gay Christians , ' and what they end up doing is demonizing the so - called ' Religious Right ' and saying that the Religious Right is all wrong in the way it has talked about homosexuality . "
- Peter LaBarbera , to One News Now
Tat :
" Seriously , dude ?
You see MORE Christians as the faith community 's major negative ?
And you think that the best way to evangelize is to cast stones at anyone who is n't Jesus -y enough for your own personal liking ?
And you blame the shunned folks for ' demonizing ' the religious right , when you are the one who is working to demonize them out of existence ?
Well thank you for coming back for a follow - up interview Mr. LaBarbera , but I think my communications department is going to go in another direction .
My assistant , Father Time , will now see you out . "
- God , to a queer - obsessed follower
Your thoughts
Hey Jeremy , tell God , Petey does have a hobby .
That 's how he got his nick - name ! ;o )
Posted by : Scott | Jun 29 , 2009 7:53:07 PM
Yeah , I called Pete once and found out that his fall back reason that homosexuality is a sin is that it is adultery - seriously .
This guy thrives on the attention he gets from his bullshit and , frankly , we left Christians wish that he would stop identifying himself as Christian -- cause I have never talked to a less Christ - like person .

I am a proud Christian gay man .
The good news is that militant anti-gay activist and unrepentant homophobe LaBarbera is not God , nor does he speak for God , nor does he decide who has a relationship with God nor does he determine who God loves .
Homophobia is a sin like lying , stealing and murder .
God hates sin .
The Bible makes it clear in more than one place that revilers ( such as Mr. LaBarbera ) are going to hell .
Instead of attacking gay people for their faith , he needs to seek deliverance from his sin of homophobia .

Adultery ?
Oh , because it 's sex outside of marriage ?
But if gay couples could get married , they would n't be adulterers .
So he 's opposed to letting gay couples get married because he would n't be able to use the fact that they can't against them .
Posted by : Bill S | Jun 30 , 2009 7:16:42 PM
I can assure Mr. Labarbera that there are indeed happy , content , and saved gay christians .
I am one but i seriously doubt that is anything but a christian in name only .
Real Christians , gay or straight do not lie , do not deny anyone of their rights , does no harm to another person but only shows love and compassion to that person .
These " christians " do none of that .

— Nearly 5,000 unemployed workers will lose their benefits this month , and that number will likely increase as the year goes on .
David Clegg , deputy chairman of the North Carolina Employment Security Commission , said Friday that by mid-June , 4,936 people will have maxed out their benefits .
State law and the federal stimulus act allow for 79 weeks of coverage .
More On This
" Your first cohort of those individuals who in large numbers are going to come to the end of that period is going to start occurring now and will increase in number over the next 120 days , " Clegg said .
By October , the number of people no longer eligible for unemployment could be as high as 375,000 .
The ESC , however , said that estimate is based on a a worst - case scenario of no one being able to find work .
"
We hope that a recession is going to not outlast their benefits if they 're actively seeking work , " Clegg said .
According to numbers last month by the ESC , the state unemployment rate is at 10.8 percent , 1.4 percent higher than the national average .
National numbers released Friday show that the U.S. unemployment rate reached 9.4 percent in May , the highest in more than 25 years .
New state numbers will be released in two weeks , and Clegg said he expects that number to be higher than last month , partly because of an influx of college graduates .
Speaker ’s Chair ( Parliamentary Copyright )
mySociety has today emailed ( and in one case , posted ) a set of 3 Principles which we believe it is important that all candidates for Speaker endorse , before the election of a new Speaker by MPs .
1. Voters have the right to know in detail about the money that is spent to support MPs and run Parliament , and in similar detail how the decisions to spend that money are settled upon .
2. Bills being considered must be published online in a much better way than they are now , as the Free Our Bills campaign has been suggesting for some time .
3 . The Internet is not a threat to a renewal in our democracy , it is one of its best hopes .
Parliament should appoint a senior officer with direct working experience of the power of the Internet who reports directly to the Speaker , and who will help Parliament adapt to a new era of transparency and effectiveness .
We will be posting the status of requests on the likely candidates web pages where we expect large numbers of people to see them before the vote in late June .
We have also taken the unusual step of allowing possible candidates to leave a statement of up to 150 words on the principles .
( NB no candidates have actually declared at this stage , so we are starting with the BBC ’s list of possibles )
Rationale
mySociety helped lead the campaign back in January to prevent the last ditch attempts to conceal MPs ’ expenses .
We did so not because , like the newspapers , we wanted to revel in embarrassment and scandal , but because we believe that in the Internet age , the only way for our democracy and government to thrive is if they are open and connected to the net as the rest of us expect them to be .
The dramatic events seen in Parliament in recent days vindicate the view that secrecy breeds poor policies and seeds untrustworthy behaviour in the weaker willed .
Furthermore , more than a simple attitude of openness is required of the new Speaker : the public needs a genuine will to push for technological reform using the power of the Internet that will take both open - mindedness and a willing to tread on toes , especially in some parts of the unelected establishment .
Case in point :
Over the last two years we have been trying to persuade Parliament to acknowledge that the way it publishes its Bills online is hopelessly inadequate for the Internet age .
The campaign has faltered , despite multi partly endorsement from 140 MPs and a campaign membership of thousands .
To see why , just take a look at this colourful and error - crammed internal email that we uncovered using the Freedom of Information Act , published for the first time today .
The new Speaker will have a tough job on their hands to overcome resistance of this kind .
The best thing we can do is help the new Speaker , whoever they are , assume their new job with a clear mandate from the public , as well as from members .
Act !
That is why , as a final part of this call , we are asking you , our community , to write to your MP today to let them know that you expect them to vote for a candidate that has endorsed the principles above .
Your voices to your own constituency MPs can resonate in a way that no blog post or newspaper article ever can .
Go to it .
The conceit of the new Disney / Pixar cartoon epic , Up , is that an old guy 's house gets attached to a bunch of helium balloons which lift it up out of the city and on a wonderful adventure .
That got Wired Science thinking : Could that actually work ?
And if so , how many balloons would you need ?
We called Wolfe House Movers , which specializes in moving old structures and had Kendal Siegrist , a manager , take a look at the images from the movie to see how much the house might weigh .
" A building like that , you 'd figure right around 100,000 pounds , " Siegrist said .
Then we did some calculations .
Air weighs about 0.078 pounds per cubic foot ; helium weighs just 0.011 pounds per cubic foot .
A helium balloon experiences a buoyant upward force that is equal to the air it displaces minus its own weight , or 0.067 pounds per cubic foot of helium balloon .
One more simple calculation — 100,000 pounds divided by 0.067 pounds per cubic foot — and you 've got that it would take 1,492,537 cubic feet of helium to lift the house .
Of course , you 'd need some more balloons to keep getting it higher , but that 's our minimum .
Now , let 's assume you 've got a bunch of spherical balloons three feet in diameter .
They 've got a volume in 14.1 cubic feet , so you 'd need 105,854 of them filled with helium to lift the house .
Eyeballing the cluster of balloons above the house in Up , let 's say on average , it 's 40 balloons across and deep and 70 balloons tall .
Do the math and there could be 112,000 balloons in there .
" That 's a great idea , " Siegrist said , laughing .
" I 'd love to do that with the balloons . "
Cluster Ballooning fans actually do this sort of thing , but with people in harnesses , not enormous houses , and they generally use a lot less balloons .
They tend to use bigger balloons , say , six feet in diameter .
You 'd only need 13,208 of those .
But even if you could get the balloons and one hell of a strong cable , could a house be pulled from the top like that ?
" If you go try picking it up , depending on what you 're doing , you can , " Siegrist said , " but for the most part , you want the house to bear the weight on its foundation . "
The way real , professional house movers like to do it is to get into the house 's basement and lift from below .
" The theory of our business is to replace the foundation with steel beams and then the steel beams can be transported wherever you need to , with the house just getting a free ride , " he said .

[ Haskell - cafe ] HaRe ( the Haskell Refactorer ) in action - short screencast
I 've heard that many Haskellers know HaRe only as a rumour .
It has been many years since the original project finished , and HaRe has n't been maintained for quite some time , so just pointing to the sources is n't quite the right answer .
The sources are still available , and build with GHC 6.8.3 ( I had to fix one lineending issue on windows , iirc , and copy one old bug fix that had n't made it into the latest release ) , but there is currently noone with the time or funding for maintenance , fixing bugs , making releases , or ironing out practical issues .
If anyone would provide funding , people to do the work could be found , but the effort would probably be better spent on reimplementing the ideas in a GHC / Cabal environment ( instead of the Haskell ' 98 environment targetted by our " Refactoring Functional Programs " project ) .
If you 've got the funding , please get in touch - even a three month run could get something started at least !-)
In principle , the project experiences and lessons learned are quite well documented at the project site http://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/projects/refactor-fp/ but that does n't give anyone an idea of what working with HaRe was like .
With the recent interest in screencasts , I thought I 'd make a little demo , for archival purposes .
Nothing fancy , using only features that were already present in HaRe 0.3 ( end of 2004 ) , and not all of those , on a tiny 2 - module example ( screenspace is a bit crowded to keep the text readable on YouTube ) .
I hope it might give a rough idea of what the papers , slides and reports are talking about , for Haskellers who were n't around at the time :

For the old HaRe team , Claus -------------------
YouTube video description : HaRe - the Haskell Refactorer ( a mini demo ) [ 4:10 ]
The Haskell Refactorer HaRe was developed in our EPSRC project " Refactoring Functional Programs " http://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/projects/refactor-fp/
Building on Programatica 's Haskell - in - Haskell frontend and Strafunski's generic programming library , it supported module - aware refactorings over the full Haskell ' 98 language standard .
Interfaces to the refactoring engine were provided for both Vim and Emacs ( this demo uses HaRe via GVim on Windows ) .
While HaRe has continued to see occasional contributions by students and researchers , who use its Haskell program transformation API as a platform for their own work , it is not currently maintained .
As the Haskell environment marches on , this demo is meant to record a snapshot of what working with HaRe could be like when it still built ( here with GHC 6.8.3 ) .
The lessons learned ( note , eg , the preservation of comments , and the limited use of pretty - printing , to minimize layout changes ) are well documented at the project site , and should be taken into account when porting the ideas to the GHC Api , or other Haskell frontends .

It was unclear whether all three would be the subject of bar association referrals .
One person who saw the report said it did not recommend bar action against Mr. Bradbury .
Mr. Bradbury , and lawyers for Mr. Yoo , now a law professor at Berkeley , and for Mr. Bybee , now a federal appeals court judge in Nevada , all declined to comment Tuesday , saying Justice Department rules require confidentiality for ethics reviews .
The work of other lawyers in the counsel ’s office was also questioned in the report , the officials said , but none are believed to be the subject of disciplinary recommendations .
The report reaches no conclusions about the role of lawyers at the White House or the C.I.A. because the jurisdiction of the ethics unit does not extend beyond the Justice Department .
The draft report on the interrogation opinions was completed in December and provoked controversy inside the Bush administration Justice Department .
But criticism of the legal work in the memos has intensified since last month when the Obama administration disclosed one previously secret opinion from 2002 , drafted mainly by Mr. Yoo and signed by Mr. Bybee , and three from 2005 , signed by Mr. Bradbury , which for the first time described the coercive interrogation methods in detail .
Michael B. Mukasey , attorney general when the draft report was first completed , was said by colleagues to have been critical of its quality and upset over its scathing conclusions .
He wrote a 10 - page rebuttal to its findings , and , in his farewell speech to employees , warned against second - guessing the legal work of the department ’s lawyers .
Several legal scholars have remarked that in approving waterboarding , the near - drowning method Mr. Obama and his aides have described as torture , the Justice Department lawyers did not cite cases in which the United States government previously prosecuted American law enforcement officials and Japanese World War II interrogators for using the procedure .
In a letter on Monday , the Justice Department advised two Democratic senators on the Judiciary committee , Richard J. Durbin of Illinois and Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island , that the former department lawyers who wrote the opinions had until May 4 to submit written appeals to the findings .
LOS ANGELES -- Manny Ramirez joined a growing lineup of All - Stars linked to drugs Thursday , with the dreadlocked slugger banished for 50 games by a sport that cannot shake free from scandal .
The Los Angeles Dodgers star said he did not take steroids and was prescribed medication by a doctor that contained a banned substance .
" It 's a dark day for baseball and certainly for this organization , " Dodgers general manager Ned Colletti told reporters on the field at Dodger Stadium .
" This organization will never condone anything that is n't clean . "
The commissioner 's office did n't announce the specific violation by the 36 - year - old outfielder , who apologized to the Dodgers and fans for " this whole situation . "
However , testing by Major League Baseball showed that Ramirez had testosterone in his body that was not natural and came from an artificial source , two people with knowledge of the case told ESPN's Mark Fainaru - Wada and T.J. Quinn .
The sources said that in addition to the artificial testosterone , Ramirez was identified as using the female fertility drug human chorionic gonadotropin , or hCG .
The sources said Ramirez was suspended for using hCG because baseball had documentation to prove his use of the drug .
A Major League Baseball source said Ramirez 's representatives indicated they would fight a suspension for using artificial testosterone .
Ramirez , in a statement issued by the players ' union , said : " Recently , I saw a physician for a personal health issue .
He gave me a medication , not a steroid , which he thought was OK to give me .
There ’s nothing like travelling abroad to make you see your home country with new eyes .
While your first fascination with everything new and different in the foreign land may enventually be replaced by homesickness , you always want to bring back a souvenir , a little bit of the best of where you ’ve been .
C# is my home country these days , but I ’ve been vacationing in F# .
There ’s a lot there that ’s absolutely brilliant , like currying and partial application , workflows , and option types ( no more NullReferenceExceptions ! ) .
But one of the first things I fell in love with in the language was pattern matching .
Pattern matching in F# ( and its ancestors ML and OCaml ) is something like switch / case on steroids .
Here ’s a simple example of a switch / case in C# :
int i = 2 ; switch ( i ) { case 0 : Print ( " zero " ) ; case 1 : Print ( " one " ) ; case 2 : Print ( " two " ) ; default : Print ( " some other value " ) ; }
Here ’s what the same logic would look like in F# :
let i = 2 match i with | 0 -> Print ( " zero " ) | 1 -> Print ( " one " ) | 2 ->
Print ( " two " ) | _ ->
Print ( " some other value " )
You can probably infer what ’s going on .
Pretty similar to our familiar switch / case .
It checks each value and executes the clause on the right the first time it finds a match .
The _ bit on the last line is equivalent to default in a switch / case : it always gets matched if we get that far .
Basic stuff , but pattern matching can do so much more .
Before I can explain that , though , we ’ll need to take a little side trip to see another F# feature : discriminated unions .
Discriminated Unions
Where C# has enums , F# has discriminated unions .
The main difference between the two is that each value in the union can have additional data fields .
Imagine you want to enumerate the different kinds of image macros :
enum ImageMacro { Lolcat , Lolrus , ORlyOwl }
Pretty basic .
Now if it ’s a lolcat , we also want to note the text of the caption , and if it ’s a lolrus , we want to note how many buckets it has .
In C# , we ’d have to ditch the enum and resort to a class hierarchy :
abstract class ImageMacro { } class Lolcat : ImageMacro { public string Caption ; public Lolcat ( string caption ) { Caption = caption ; } } class Lolrus : ImageMacro { public int Buckets ; public Lolrus ( int buckets ) { Buckets = buckets ; } } class ORlyOwl : ImageMacro { }
Classic OOP design , and it gets the job done .
In F# , you can simply add fields to a discriminated union and accomplish the exact same thing :
type ImageMacro = | Lolcat of string | Lolrus of int | ORlyOwl
The “ of string ” says that when you make a Lolcat ImageMacro ( and only a Lolcat ) that you must also provide a caption .
Likewise , the “ of int ” says that a Lolrus needs a number of buckets .
Pattern Matching Discriminated Unions
These two features , pattern matching and discriminated unions , go together in F# like gondolas and striped shirts .
Each is much less awesome without the other .
Now let ’s get back to pattern matching and see something it can do that a switch / case definitely can’t .
Given our above ImageMacro type , let ’s say we want to print it out :
let image = Lolcat ( " I made you a cookie " ) match image with | Lolcat ( caption ) ->
Print ( " Lolcat says ' " + caption + " ' " ) | Lolrus ( buckets ) ->
Print ( " Lolrus has " + buckets + " buckets " ) | ORlyOwn -> Print ( " O RLY ? " )
Now that ’s pretty nice .
Not only does it switch on what kind of image macro it is , it also pulls out the data associated with each one ( “ destructures ” in the local parlance ) .
This would definitely be nice to have in C# .
A Little Souvenir : Pattern .
Match
So can we bring discriminated union pattern matching back to C# ?
Since C# does n’t have discriminated unions , we ’ll have to make it work with the little inheritance tree up there .
Here ’s what I got :
ImageMacro image = new Lolcat ( " I made you a cookie " ) ; Pattern .
Match ( image ) .
Case < Lolcat , string > ( c =>
Print ( " Lolcat says ' " + c + " ' " ) ) .
Case < Lolrus , int > ( b =>
Print ( " I has " + b + " buckets " ) ) .
Case < ORlyOwl > (( ) =>
Print ( " O RLY ? " ) ) ;
A little strange , but not too bad .
Looks kind of like a switch / case but switches based on type .
For Lolcat and Lolrus , we pull out the caption and number of buckets .
How does this work ?
Let ’s build it from the bottom up .
Case ( )
A single case in our pattern matcher needs to specify three things : the type being selected ( Lolcat , Lolrus , etc. ) , the field (s ) to pull out ( if any ) , and the action to perform when the case is successfully matched .
Let ’s start with the simplest possible system : one that can only match a single value based on type , with no fields .
Here ’s the basic class :
public class Matcher < T > { public Matcher ( T value ) { mValue = value ; } public void Case < TCase >(
Action action ) { if ( mValue is TCase ) action ( ) ; } private T mValue ; }
The action being passed in is a delegate , and we construct it using C# 3.5 ’s handy lambda notation .
For the ORlyOwl , it ’s :
( ) => Print ( " O RLY ? " )
Aside from being a nice clean notation , the other nice thing about lambdas ( and anonymous delegates ) is that they can access variables defined in the outside scope .
This lets our Case clauses do everything a regular case can do in a vanilla switch / case .
Chaining Cases Using a Fluent Interface
What we have so far is simple , but it only lets us select a single case .
To be able to chain multiple cases together , we ’re going to use something the hip kids are calling a “ fluent interface ” .
The basic idea is to make methods return this so that you can call multiple methods on the same object by chaining .
Them ( ) .
Like ( ) .
This ( ) :
public Matcher < T > Case < TCase >(
Action action ) { if ( mValue is TCase ) action ( ) ; return this ; }
Preventing Multiple Matches
There ’s a problem here .
A pattern should only match the first successful case .
If we just allow arbitrary chaining , it would be possible to have multiple matches .
Here ’s a solution :
public virtual Matcher < T > Case < TCase >(
Action action ) { if ( mValue is TCase ) { action ( ) ; return new NullMatcher < T >( ) ; } return this ; }
Now when we have a successful match , instead of continuing the fluent interface and returning this , we return a NullMatcher <T >
As you can probably guess , that class has the same methods as Matcher < T > , but never actually matches :
public class NullMatcher < T > : Matcher < T > { public override Matcher < T > Case < TCase >(
Action action ) { return this ; } }
Extracting Fields
So far , we ’re up to being able to do this :
Pattern .
Match ( image ) .
Case < Lolcat > ( caption => Print ( " Lolcat says '? ' " ) ) .
Case < Lolrus > ( buckets =>
Print ( " Lolrus has ? buckets " ) ) .
Case < ORlyOwl > (( ) =>
Print ( " O RLY ? " ) ) ;
The last remaining step is to pull out the caption and buckets from the Lolcat and Lolrus types .
We ’ll do this by overloading Case ( ) :
public virtual Matcher < T > Case < TCase , TArg >( Action < TArg > action ) { IMatchable < TArg > matchable = mValue as IMatchable < TArg > ; if ( ( matchable != null ) && ( m Value is TCase ) ) { action ( matchable .
GetArg ( ) ) ; return new NullMatcher < T >( ) ; } else { return this ; } }
What this does is both check the type and see if it implements IMatchable < T > .
This little interface just lets a class expose a field for pattern matching .
( We could also do this using reflection .
That would free us up from having explicitly implement pattern matching support in classes , but would also incur a performance penalty and bind the pattern matching to the internals of the matched classes . )
Here ’s the interface and it ’s implementation in our macro classes :
interface IMatchable < TArg > { TArg GetArg ( ) ; } class Lolcat : ImageMacro , IMatchable < string > { public string Caption ; public Lolcat ( string caption ) { Caption = caption ; } string IMatchable < string >. GetArg ( ) { return Caption ; } } class Lolrus : ImageMacro , IMatchable < int > { public int NumBuckets ; public Lolrus ( int numBuckets ) { NumBuckets = numBuckets ; } int IMatchable < int >. GetArg ( ) { return NumBuckets ; } }
I ’m using explicit interface implementation here , because users only really care about using GetArg ( ) when they ’re doing pattern matching .
Otherwise , there ’s no reason to make it a visible part of the class ’s interface .
Pattern
We ’ve built back almost up the to the top .
The last little bit left is the simplest :
Pattern .
Match ( image )
Pattern is simply a static class with one method Match ( ) :
class Pattern { public static Matcher < T > Match < T >( T value ) { return new Matcher < T >( value ) ; } }
The Pattern class exists simply because C# requires all functions to be in a class .
However , constructing Matchers through Match < T > does have one nice side - effect : it lets the compiler infer the type parameter so you do n’t have to explicitly write it out like you would when calling a constructor .
With this little bit in place , we ’ve reached our goal of being able to get something like matching discriminated unions working in C# :
Pattern .
Match ( image ) .
Case < Lolcat , string > ( c =>
Print ( " Lolcat says ' " + c + " ' " ) ) .
Case < Lolrus , int > ( b =>
Print ( " I has " + b + " buckets " ) ) .
Case < ORlyOwl > (( ) =>
Print ( " O RLY ? " ) ) ;
But Wait , That ’s Not All !
This is only the beginning of what we can do with our little matching class .
Here are a few other things the full code lets you do :
Extracting Multiple Fields
In the example above , we only pull a single field out of a given case .
F# supports multiple fields as well , as does the Matcher class ( up to four ) :
Case < Loldog , string , int > ( ( caption , dogs ) =>
Print ( " ' " + caption + " ' , says " + dogs + " hotdogs " ) ) .
Default Case
It ’s also useful to have a default - like case that will always succeed if reached :
Pattern .
Match ( image ) .
Case < Lolrus , int > ( b =>
Print ( " I has " + buckets + " buckets " ) ) .
Default ( ( ) =>
Print ( " Default " ) ) ;
Equality Matching
Another way to match values is if they are equal .
We can do this generically since Equals ( ) is part of the .NET framework .
Pattern .
Match ( " a string " ) .
Case ( " not " , ( ) =>
Print ( " should not match " ) ) .
Case ( " a string " , ( ) =>
Print ( " should match " ) ) ;
The example here uses strings , but this works with any type as long as it implements Equals ( ) correctly .
Matching on Any Predicate
As you can see , there are a bunch of different ways users may want to match data , and it ’s futile to try to bake all of them into the class .
The most obvious solution then is to simply let users pass in an arbitrary predicate ( a predicate is a function that returns a bool ) and have the match succeed based on that :
Pattern .
Match ( 123 ) .
Case ( value => value < 100 , ( ) =>
Print ( " less than 100 " ) ) .
Case ( value => value > 100 , ( ) =>
Print ( " greater than 100 " ) ) ;
You ’ll note that in the final code below , all of the other matching types are built on top of this .
Returning a Value
F# , unlike C# , treats everything as an expression , even flow control statements like if / then and match .
This means a match can return a result :
// F# : let is
Two = match 2 with | 2 -> true | _ -> false
where in C# you ’d have to do an assignment :
// C# bool is Two ; switch ( 2 ) { case 2 : is Two = true ; default : is
Two = false ; }
Our pattern matching class can do this too , even within C# :
bool is Two = Pattern .
Match < int , bool >( 2 ) .
Case ( 2 , true ) .
Default ( false ) ;
Conclusion
They say you never know your home until you travel abroad .
I ’ve been enjoying F# a lot , but C# still feels more comfortable to me .
However , it ’s always useful to see how other languages solve problems , and see what new techniques can be brought home with you .
While our pattern matching class is n’t quite as clean in C# as it is in F# , I think it ’s a useful tool in its own right .
If you ’d like to play with it , I ’ve put it up on bitbucket .
Have fun !

On Friday Rush Limbaugh compared Obama Supreme Court nominee Sonia Sotomayor to white supremacist and former KKK member David Duke .
Of course , this outraged Duke who claimed that Sotomayor is the real racist .
Here is the video of Limbaugh :
Advertisements
Duke first blasted Limbaugh , “ Limbaugh , a recent addict to illegal drugs , has no business making personal attacks against me for my past .
I have consistently supported true equal rights , stating again and again that I support the best - qualified person regardless of race in hiring and promotions . ”
Later Duke claimed Sotomayor is the real racist , “ Once again , the hypocrisy is clear .
Imagine if a White nominee for Supreme Court Justice said that he believed
White judges would be more likely to reach better decisions than Black or Mexican judges .
He would not have a chance in hell to be confirmed to the Supreme Court .
Why should she ? ”
We now have a former Grand Wizard of the KKK claiming that he is less of racist than Sotomayor .
Does everyone now understand why these attacks have no credibility , and not a single Republican Senator will echo them ?
Rush Limbaugh has now moved so far to the right that he is David Duke country , and even Duke does n’t want him there .
There is a certain level of humor and absurdity to this whole thing .
It is obvious is still a white supremacist and racist .
He has the history and website to prove it .
Duke ’s whole ignore that whole KKK thing , I really do support equality , is an absolute lie , but Rush is out there appealing to the GOP base , which currently appears to be evangelicals and white supremacists .

This is the second post of my pre-RailsConf series of blog posts on Rails application performance optimization .
I 'll be presenting at RailsConf about this and many other aspects of performance optimization on May 6th , so you 're welcome to join me at RailsConf and please watch for more performance - related articles in this blog .

We saw lots of synthetic benchmarks proving that alternative ruby implementations ( namely the only two finished ones - JRuby and Ruby 1.9 ) are faster than good old 1.8 aka MRI .
But nobody so far ported the production application to prove they are faster in the real world conditions .
We did .
" Ruby 1.9 is 2 x faster than 1.8 .
But the real world improvements are even better . "
" Ruby 1.9 is 2 x faster than 1.8 .
But the real world improvements are even better . "
We ported Acunote - our online enterprise project management and Scrum software to both JRuby and Ruby 1.9 and ran our set of performance benchmarks .
We have 30 benchmarks that check the server response time for most typical user requests .
We use those benchmarks to check for performance regressions , and this time we used them to check the Acunote 's performance with alternative rubys .
There 're four common request types for Acunote , ones that primarily involve date / time operations , rendering , numerical calculations and ActiveRecord / database operations .
Here are the timings for four requests , one for each type :
Acunote Benchmark Request Time , sec Improvement 1.8.6 JRuby 1.2.0 1.9.1 JRuby 1.9.1 Date / Time Intensive 1.23 0.58 0.53 2.1x 2.3x Rendering Intensive 0.61 0.44 0.30 1.4 x 2.0x Calculations Intensive 2.57 1.79 1.33 1.4 x 1.9x Database Intensive 5.58 4.63 3.29 1.2x 1.7x
Here are those timings expanded with rendering and database time :
Acunote Benchmark Request Time / Rendering Time / DB Time , msec 1.8.6 JRuby 1.2.0 1.9.1 Date / Time Intensive 1230 / 0 / 65 580 / 1 / 45 530 / 1 / 37 Rendering Intensive 610 / 328 / 33 440 / 273 / 45 300 / 197 / 37 Calculations Intensive 2570 / 380 / 38 1790 / 215 / 54 1330 / 204 / 39 Database Intensive 5580 / 529 / 700 4630 / 209 / 1321 3290 / 221 / 685
As you can see from the table , Ruby 1.9 is 2 x faster than 1.8 .
But the real world improvements are even better .
Ruby 1.9 eliminates performance bottlenecks that were present in 1.8 , e.g .
Date class , numerical and string computations , template rendering .
It lets us write more complex systems in Ruby than were ever possible before .
In the immortal words of Avi Bryant , it lets us add a whole ' nother level of turtles .
The performance improvement from JRuby is not as substantial , but it 's still 1.5 x faster .
One of the reasons for JRuby being slower than 1.9 is PostgreSQL JDBC driver and not - working " fast " mode .
Want to know why 1.9 and JRuby are so much faster ?
Are there any other improvements and regressions with alternative Ruby's ?
What happened to the garbage collection performance ?

( CNN ) -- Millvina Dean , believed to be the last survivor of the Titanic , has died at 97 , her friends confirmed Sunday .
Millvina Dean was just an infant when the RMS Titanic sank .
Dean was just an infant when the RMS Titanic -- publicized as " practically unsinkable " and the largest passenger steamship at the time -- struck an iceberg on the night of April 14 , 1912 , during its maiden voyage from Southampton in southern England to New York .
The ship sank less than three hours later , killing more than 1,500 people .
Brian Ticehurst , a friend of Dean , said she died at 8 a.m. Sunday .
Dean was hospitalized a few days ago for medical complications before returning to the Woodlands Ridge Nursing Home in Southampton , said Charles Haas , a friend and president of the Titanic International Society based in New Jersey .
A nurse at the home declined to comment on Dean 's passing .
Haas said Dean 's last public appearance was at the British Titanic Society 's convention in April , which she attended with her longtime companion , Bruno Nordmanis .
" She only visited a short while , but she wowed everybody with her charm , " Haas told CNN .
" She seemed in good spirits . "
Haas noted that Dean 's death fell on May 31 , exactly 98 years after the Titanic was launched .
The doomed ship , not yet completed , was launched on May 31 , 1911 , in Belfast .
Watch ' Titanic ' survivor discuss artifacts »
While Dean 's survival brought her celebrity - like status in some circles , she was 8 years old before she knew she was on the fateful ship .
Dean , along with her young brother and mother , survived the sinking of the Titanic , but her mother did n't tell her about it until years later , Haas said .
Although she did n't have memories of the historic and tragic event , Dean , who never married or had children , became a larger presence for Titanic enthusiasts and historians over the past three decades .
" Having gone through that disaster she was given extra years and an extra dose of vitality , " said Haas , who recalled escorting Dean to a Titanic society gala a few years ago .
Dean became the last known Titanic survivor after Barbara Joyce Dainton died in October 2007 .
The last American survivor , Lillian Asplund , died in May 2006 .
Dean 's death leaves only artifacts and videotaped interviews with survivors to " speak to us about the Titanic , " Haas said .

Professional practice in a mature engineering discipline is based on relevant scientific theories , usually expressed in the language of mathematics .
A mathematical theory of programming aims to provide a similar basis for specification , design and implementation of computer programs .
The theory can be presented in a variety of styles , including 1 .
Denotational , relating a program to a specification of its observable properties and behaviour .
2 . Algebraic , providing equations and inequations for comparison , transformation and optimisation of designs and programs .
3 . Operational , describing individual steps of a possible mechanical implementation .
This paper presents a simple theory of sequential non-deterministic programming in each of these three styles ; by deriving each presentation from its predecessor , mutual consistency is assured .
Structure 09 Google has questioned Microsoft 's entire approach to online infrastructure , while taking some wonderfully sly shots at the company 's new decision engine search engine .
The undeniable highlight of Thursday 's cloud - happy Structure 09 conference was Vijay Gill , Google senior manager of engineering and architecture .
As he described how Google 's famously distributed infrastructure shames the Redmond competition , he would occasionally point his audience to relevant online materials using a deadpan line that put Microsoft 's incurable Mountain View envy is sharp relief .
" If you Bing for it , " he would say , " you can find it . "
Yesterday afternoon - as part of a panel discussion on the infrastructure philosophies of Google , Microsoft , and other web giants - Gill took the conference stage alongside Najam Ahmad , Redmond global networking services general manager .
Ahmad spent several minutes describing Microsoft 's approach to boosting the worldwide performance of its myriad web services , before Gill calmly undercut just about everything Ahmad said .
" The challenge that we end up with is similar to what Yahoo ! has , " the Microsoftee said .
" The set of applications we have is tremendous .
We have all sorts of applications on our network , and we can't really come up with one solution that actually works - or even one set of KPIs [ key performance indicators ] that works .
Some services are very stateful , like Messenger , and some are very stateless .
" What we end up with is really varied mixture of KPIs and solutions in terms of building performance . "
As an example , he said , Microsoft is working to juice the performance of its Virtual Earth mapping service using so - called " edge technologies " - a combination of Akamai - like CDN ( content delivery network ) tools and actual code that runs at the edge of the network .
" We 're looking at a mixture of approaches and trying to solve problems for specific applications and types of applications , " he said .
At which point , Gill piped up to explain - in his matter - of - fact monotone - why Microsoft 's philosophy is fundamentally flawed .
He pointed his audience to a blog post where an online real estate outfit called Redfin says it recently ditched Microsoft Virtual Earth for Google Maps .
Yes , Redfin believes that Google gives better performance .
" Our approach is a little more absolute than [ Microsoft's ] , " Gill said .
" Not only does getting to the end user have to be fast , but the back - end has to be extremely fast too ... [ We are ] virtualizing the entire fabric so you get maximum utilization and speed on a global basis as opposed to local fixes - putting one service in a data center , for example , in Denver .
" You want to figure out how you want to distribute that across the entire system so you get it as horizontal as needed , which is essentially the definition of cloud computing . "
You can take issue with his terminology .
But his argument is sound :
While Microsoft is struggling to separately hone performance for each and every application , Google can uniformly juice speed across its entire portfolio .
The secret to Google 's success , Gill said , is not in the company 's mystery data centers , but in its software infrastructure , including GFS , its distributed file system ; BigTable , its distributed database ; and MapReduce , its distributed number - crunching platform .
" [ Data centers ] are just atoms , " he said .
" Any idiot can build atoms together and then create this vast infrastructure .
The question is :
How do you actually get the applications to use the infrastructure ?
How do you distribute it ?
How do you optimize it ?
That 's the hard part .
To do that you require an insane amount of force of will . "
He 's the one with the force of will .
Gill and his architecture team are charged with strong - arming Google developers into writing their applications to what is an extremely restrictive set of distributed platforms .
" We have a set of primitives , if you would , that takes those collections of atoms - those data centers , those networks - that we 've built , and then they abstract that entire infrastructure out as a set of services - some of the public ones are GFS obviously , BigTable , MapReduce . "
Notice he said some of the public ones .
It would seem that Google 's working on other distributed platforms it 's yet to share with the rest of the world .
The likes of GFS and MapReduce were discussed in Google research papers back in 2004 , and they soon gave rise to Hadoop , an open - source distributed platform now used by Yahoo ! , Facebook , and others .
Actually , Microsoft uses Hadoop .
But that 's only because it recently purchased the semantic search startup Powerset .
Not only is open - source slow to reach the Microsoft back - end , but so is , well , the cloud .
" Microsoft has various vertical lines of business that use various portions of infrastructure from soup to nuts , " Google 's Gill said .
" Our guys are more horizontally distributed .
Pretty much every service runs on GFS as a baseline system .
" If we make a minor change to , say , disk storage to get a three per cent gain , and we roll that out to the GFS library , suddenly the entire base of applications stored on GFS sees that gain . "
The trouble , he says , is getting developers to use the thing .
" People are lazy .
They say ' I do n't want to design my applications into this confined space . '
And it is a confined space .
So you need a large force of will to get people to do that . "
Gill acknowledges that data - center design plays its own role in all this .
But he insists it's not the " key part , " and when asked to discuss Google 's data center operations , he demurred , pointing his audience to a now famous Google paper called The Data Center as a Computer .
" If you Bing for it , " he said , " you can find it . " ®
Update
Vijay Gill has responded to your story with a blog post , saying that " Google does not mock Bing . "
" I was n’t mocking Bing when I said ' Bing for it , you can find it . '
I meant that seriously , in the spirit of giving props to a competitor , and a good one at that , " he wrote .
Old TVs and computers often get dumped at the side of the road A study on recycling suggests Britons are the worst in Europe when it comes to recycling electrical equipment .
Computer manufacturer
Dell found that fewer than half of UK residents regularly recycled old hardware , compared with more than 80 % of Germans .
Within the UK , the Welsh are the worst when it comes to recycling technology ; almost 20 % have never done so .
It is thought the UK creates enough electrical waste each year to fill Wembley Stadium six times over .
Environmental consultant Tony Juniper said that lack of awareness was a serious issue .
PERCENTAGE WHO DO NOT RECYCLE E-WASTE Wales : 19 % North - West England 17 % North - East England 15 % East Midlands 15 % London 13 % Scotland 13 % East of England 11 % South - West England 11 % West Midlands 10 % South - East England 9 % Northern Ireland 7 % Source : Dell " Governments in every country need to make the disposal of old electrical equipment as accessible and commonplace as recycling old paper , plastics and glass , " said the former Friends of the Earth director .
In early May , mobile operator 02 looked at what electrical equipment was inside a typical home .
It found that there was an average of 2.4 TVs , 1.6 computers , 2.4 games consoles , 3 mobile phones , and 2.2 MP3 players .
Historic legislation Introduced by the European Commission in 2002 , although not coming into force in the UK until January 2007 , the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive ( WEEE ) was European legislation designed to " reduce the amount of electrical and electronic equipment being produced and to encourage everyone to reuse , recycle and recover it " .
Jean Cox -Kearns , recycling manager with Dell , told the BBC that one of the reasons Britain lagged was because other countries had implemented the WEEE directive two years before .
" The UK had historic legislation that they had difficulty in implementing , " she said .
There are concerns that many items that are disposed of - especially computer equipment - still work but have been rendered obsolete by new technology .
A number of charities actively collect IT equipment so it can be used in the developing world .
Ms Cox -Kearns acknowledged that was preferable to recycling , although she did have reservations .
" I agree we should maximise the use of computer equipment .
However , we need to find out what happens to the equipment after they [ the recipients ] are finished with them , otherwise it is effectively dumping . "

The mandatory blacklist and computer games
The Goverment 's mandatory Internet - censorship policy was , of course , always justified as a child - protection measure .
Protecting young kids as they use the Internet , or , as the political tactics of the day dictate , cracking down on illegal child - abuse material on the Internet .
A cursory analysis of the scheme shows that neither is achievable , but the scheme continues to gather momentum even as public opposition grows .
The leaking of the ACMA blacklist caused significant embarrassment , containing as it did a broad range of harmless and controversial material .
As a result , the Government has since that time been presenting the blacklist as an " almost exclusively RC - only " list ; that is , that it will contain only material that would be Refused Classification by Australia 's Classification Board .
The implication is that such material would only contain shocking content that would be highly illegal , such as child abuse or violent pornography .
In fact , material could be refused classification for a variety of reasons such as " providing instruction in criminal activity " , such as euthanasia .
It 's legal to view most RC content , except as specifically outlawed by statues combating child abuse material .
Our concerns about the scheme were heightened by a recent clarification by a Government spokesperson on the list concerning video games .
In Australia , there is currently no R - 18 + category for video and computer games , with MA - 15 + instead being the highest category .
This means that any video game containing material deemed too confronting for a minor is refused classification .
The Government has now confirmed that web sites dealing with games that are mature or unrated will be subject to blacklisting :
The Government is considering mandatory ISP level filtering of Refused Classification content as identified by the ACMA complaints mechanism .
This could potentially include URLs of websites which make available Refused Classification computer games such as web - based flash games and downloadable games , if a complaint is received and the content is determined by ACMA to be Refused Classification .
Computer games that exceed an MA15 + rating are deemed to be Refused Classification as there is no R18 + or X18 + rating for computer games in Australia .
This is alarming for many reasons .
Computer games that are downloaded or are predominantly online are not usually rated in Australia .
This would include simple Flash - based web games , but also online games like World of Warcraft , EVE Online or Second Life whose content is substantially or primarily user - generated .
Because an environment like Second Life is so vast , it can and will contain material created by adults and for adults , causing it fall afoul of the MA - 15 + rating .
Thus , secondlife.com could end up on the blacklist , with no method of review or appeal .
It would simply be banned for all Australians , even though the program and its contents would still be entirely legal to own and use in Australia .
This shows just how broad the new censorship scheme is , and how easily it can be expanded .
How does preventing adults from viewing sophisticated adult content in a virtual world help the Australian public ?
That 's a question our elected representatives have not answered .
If you find this alarming , you may want to contact them and demand an explanation .

The Society broke away from the Vatican in 1970
The Vatican has banned a small group of breakaway traditionalist Catholics from ordaining more priests and deacons .
The Society of St Pius X ( SSPX ) , which split from the Vatican in 1970 , plans to ordain more than 30 men in June .
But in a statement , the Vatican said sect members were not entitled to exercise their ministry and that any ordinations would be " illegitimate " .
In January this year , Pope Benedict XVI revoked the 21 - year excommunication of four bishops in the Swiss - based group .
The decision provoked an angry reaction as one of the SSPX members , Bishop Richard Williamson , is a known Holocaust denier .
The Pope defended the move by saying it was important to ensure the unity of the Catholic Church .
But instead of returning to the Church as the Vatican had hoped , SSPX has announced the new ordinations , planned to take place in Switzerland , Germany and the US , says the BBC's David Willey in Rome .
The situation is embarrassing for the Vatican , with no easy way to prevent the Pope from losing face if - as seems likely - the ordinations go ahead , says our correspondent .
SSPX was founded by a French archbishop , Marcel Lefebvre , in 1970 as a protest against the Second Vatican Council 's reforms on religious freedom and pluralism .
It claims to have almost 500 priests as members and says it is active in more than 60 countries .
George W. Bush led the United States into war in Iraq on the grounds that Saddam Hussein might give his country ’s nonexistent weapons of mass destruction to terrorists .
Now , Bush ’s successor is perpetuating the war in Afghanistan with comparably dubious arguments about the danger posed by the Taliban and al Qaeda .
President Barack Obama insists that the U.S. mission in Afghanistan is about " making sure that al Qaeda cannot attack the U.S. homeland and U.S. interests and our allies " or " project violence against " American citizens .
The reasoning is that if the Taliban win in Afghanistan , al Qaeda will once again be able to set up shop there to carry out its dirty work .
As the president puts it , Afghanistan would " again be a base for terrorists who want to kill as many of our people as they possibly can . "
This argument is constantly repeated but rarely examined ; given the costs and risks associated with the Obama administration ’s plans for the region , it is time such statements be given the scrutiny they deserve .
Multiple sources , including Lawrence Wright 's book The Looming Tower , make clear that the Taliban was a reluctant host to al Qaeda in the 1990s and felt betrayed when the terrorist group repeatedly violated agreements to refrain from issuing inflammatory statements and fomenting violence abroad .
Then the al Qaeda - sponsored 9/11 attacks -- which the Taliban had nothing to do with -- led to the toppling of the Taliban ’s regime .
Given the Taliban ’s limited interest in issues outside the " AfPak " region , if they came to power again now , they would be highly unlikely to host provocative terrorist groups whose actions could lead to another outside intervention .
And even if al Qaeda were able to relocate to Afghanistan after a Taliban victory there , it would still have to operate under the same siege situation it presently enjoys in what Obama calls its " safe haven " in Pakistan .
The very notion that al Qaeda needs a secure geographic base to carry out its terrorist operations , moreover , is questionable .
After all , the operational base for 9/11 was in Hamburg , Germany .
Conspiracies involving small numbers of people require communication , money , and planning -- but not a major protected base camp .
At present , al Qaeda consists of a few hundred people running around in Pakistan , seeking to avoid detection and helping the Taliban when possible .
It also has a disjointed network of fellow travelers around the globe who communicate over the Internet .
Over the last decade , the group has almost completely discredited itself in the Muslim world due to the fallout from the 9/11 attacks and subsequent counterproductive terrorism , much of it directed against Muslims .
No convincing evidence has been offered publicly to show that al Qaeda Central has put together a single full operation anywhere in the world since 9/11 .
And , outside of war zones , the violence perpetrated by al Qaeda affiliates , wannabes , and lookalikes combined has resulted in the deaths of some 200 to 300 people per year , and may be declining .
That is 200 to 300 too many , of course , but it scarcely suggests that " the safety of people around the world is at stake , " as Obama dramatically puts it .
In addition , al Qaeda has yet to establish a significant presence in the United States .
In 2002 , U.S. intelligence reports asserted that the number of trained al Qaeda operatives in the United States was between 2,000 and 5,000 , and FBI Director Robert Mueller assured a Senate committee that al Qaeda had " developed a support infrastructure " in the country and achieved both " the ability and the intent to inflict significant casualties in the U.S. with little warning . "
However , after years of well funded sleuthing , the FBI and other investigative agencies have been unable to uncover a single true al Qaeda sleeper cell or operative within the country .
Mueller 's rallying cry has now been reduced to a comparatively bland formulation : " We believe al Qaeda is still seeking to infiltrate operatives into the U.S. from overseas . "
Even that may not be true .
Since 9/11 , some two million foreigners have been admitted to the United States legally and many others , of course , have entered illegally .
Even if border security has been so effective that 90 percent of al Qaeda ’s operatives have been turned away or deterred from entering the United States , some should have made it in -- and some of those , it seems reasonable to suggest , would have been picked up by law enforcement by now .
The lack of attacks inside the United States combined with the inability of the FBI to find any potential attackers suggests that the terrorists are either not trying very hard or are far less clever and capable than usually depicted .
Policymakers and the public at large should keep in mind the words of Glenn Carle , a 23 year veteran of the CIA who served as deputy national intelligence officer for transnational threats :
" We must see jihadists for the small , lethal , disjointed and miserable opponents that they are . "
Al Qaeda " has only a handful of individuals capable of planning , organizing and leading a terrorist operation , " Carle notes , and " its capabilities are far inferior to its desires . "
President Obama has said that there is also a humanitarian element to the Afghanistan mission .
A return of the Taliban , he points out , would condemn the Afghan people " to brutal governance , international isolation , a paralyzed economy , and the denial of basic human rights . "
This concern is legitimate -- the Afghan people appear to be quite strongly opposed to a return of the Taliban , and they are surely entitled to some peace after 30 years of almost continual warfare , much of it imposed on them from outside .
The problem , as Obama is doubtlessly well aware , is that Americans are far less willing to sacrifice lives for missions that are essentially humanitarian than for those that seek to deal with a threat directed at the United States itself .
People who embrace the idea of a humanitarian mission will continue to support Obama 's policy in Afghanistan -- at least if they think it has a chance of success -- but many Americans ( and Europeans ) will increasingly start to question how many lives such a mission is worth .
This questioning , in fact , is well under way .
Because of its ties to 9/11 , the war in Afghanistan has enjoyed considerably greater public support than the war in Iraq did ( or , for that matter , the wars in Korea or Vietnam ) .
However , there has been a considerable dropoff in that support of late .
If Obama 's national security justification for his war in Afghanistan comes to seem as spurious as Bush 's national security justification for his war in Iraq , he , like Bush , will increasingly have only the humanitarian argument to fall back on .
And that is likely to be a weak reed .
The meanings of technologies are changing by every upcoming year .
The modern technological gadgets are not only limited with smart phones , laptops , media players , iPod , but they are getting beyond it with great speed .

You have to hand it to the tabloid headline writers at the New York Post :
They know nothing if not how to turn the tiniest spark into a five - alarm conflagration .
" Fear grips Google , " the Post blared on Saturday .
Why ?
Well , the introduction of Microsoft 's much - ballyhooed search engine , Bing , has Google so gobsmacked as to shake company co-founder Sergey Brin from his slumber to lead an internal effort aimed at assessing and countering the threat , according to an anonymous Google " insider . "
By Sunday -- and based on little more than the Post 's say - so -- a CNET headline asks : " Does Microsoft 's Bing have Google running scared ? "
See ?
" Fear grips Google . "
And this morning we have a merry band of copycats ( mostly ) numbering nearly 100 .
Did you hear me ?
" FEAR GRIPS GOOGLE ! "
But what did the Post 's unnamed source actually say ?
Here 's the heart of it :
" New search engines have come and gone in the past 10 years , but Bing seems to be of particular interest to Sergey , " said one insider , who spoke on the condition of anonymity .
The move by Brin is unusual , as it is rare these days for the Google founders to have such hands - on involvement in day - to - day operations at the company , the source added .
So a frontal assault on Google 's primary business by the world 's largest and most successful software company is " of particular interest to Sergey ? "
Get out .
And he 's not just interested but has rolled up his sleeves ?
That 's not even news , never mind " Fear grips Google . "
Even with the Medicare drug benefit , even with the prevalence of low - cost generics , even with loss - leader discounting by big chains , many Americans still find themselves unable to afford the prescription medications that manage their life - threatening conditions .
In downtrodden communities like Rocky Mount , where unemployment has doubled to 14 percent in a year , the recession has heightened the struggle .
National surveys consistently find that as many as a third of respondents say they are not complying with prescriptions because of cost , up from about a fourth three years ago .
Many customers at Almand ’s Oakwood neighborhood store , particularly those too well off for Medicaid but unable to afford insurance , simply pick and choose among risks .
They weigh not taking maintenance medications against more immediate needs like shelter and food .
The pharmacists see it every day .
About eight months ago , they stopped automatically preparing refills for regular customers because they found that more than half were not being collected and had to be restocked .
One recent Wednesday , James S. Crawford , newly discharged from the hospital after his third heart attack , fanned six green slips across the counter as if showing a hand of cards .
There were a pair for high blood pressure , one each for angina , cholesterol , and acid reflux , and a renal vitamin for his kidney disease .
“ I need to know the prices , ” he said .
Young men run the highest risk of dying because of their drinking Alcohol may have caused the death of twice as many Scots as previously thought , an NHS study has found .
Researchers used a new method of calculating alcohol - related deaths which is said to more accurately reflect the damage done by drinking .
They estimated that 2,882 deaths - one in every 20 - could be attributed to alcohol in 2003 .
More than a quarter of deaths in men aged between 35 - 44 were caused by alcohol , the study found .
The deaths of a fifth of women in the same age group were also attributable to alcohol .
The NHS Scotland research team used data compiled during the Scottish Health Survey of 2003 for their analysis .
To have one in 20 Scots dying from alcohol - related causes is a truly shocking statistic
Nicola Sturgeon
Health Secretary
They identified 53 different causes of death , ranging from stomach cancer and strokes to assaults and road deaths , in which alcohol played a part .
Jack Law , the chief executive of Alcohol Focus Scotland said : " It is particularly concerning to note that over 1000 Scots under the age of 55 died because of alcohol .
" The evidence shows that the most effective way to reduce consumption , and consequently harm , is to increase the price of alcohol .
" Introducing a minimum price per unit of alcohol would increase the price of the cheapest , most harmful drinks which appeal to heavier drinkers e.g. strong white ciders and cheap spirits .
" Minimum pricing would save lives as well as saving the taxpayer hundreds of millions of pounds in NHS , crime and employment costs . "
Similar studies have already been carried out in countries including England , the US , Canada and Australia , but the method has never been used before in Scotland .
Previously , official figures only counted the more obvious " wholly - attributable " categories of death , such as alcoholic liver disease .
The study estimated that one in ten men and one in 20 women were admitted to hospital for alcohol - related conditions , which the researchers said placed a " considerable burden " on the health service .
Deaths caused by alcohol were proportionately higher in younger people , who tended to die from acute consequences such as injury , whereas older people were more likely to die from illness or disease .
Men were more likely than women overall to die an alcohol attributable death , while cancer accounted for just over a fifth of all alcohol attributable deaths .
However , the report also estimated that low levels of alcohol consumption actually protected nearly 1,500 people from deaths caused by conditions such as coronary heart disease .
Chronic conditions
But it warned that drinking even small amounts still increases the risk of contracting cancer and other chronic conditions .
Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said the figures showed that alcohol was killing one Scot every three hours on average , and proved alcohol abuse was the biggest public health challenge the country faced .
She added : " This research shows that alcohol misuse is taking an even higher toll on Scotland 's health than previously thought .
" To have one in 20 Scots dying from alcohol - related causes is a truly shocking statistic .
Drinking alcohol is part of Scottish culture , but it 's clear that many people are drinking too much and damaging their health in the process .
" The Scottish Government has made crystal clear our determination to get to grips with it . "
Kate Macaulay , of nursing union RCN Scotland , said the statistics highlighted the need to take " urgent action " to reduce rates of alcohol consumption in Scotland .
" We welcome the measures that the Scottish Government is proposing to reduce excessive consumption if they result in lower levels of alcohol misuse and better public health , " she added .
" All of the practical measures that are being put forward by the Scottish Government must be matched by educational and health promotional work from the earliest ages right through to older adults if we are genuinely going to tackle this growing health time bomb . "

A 10 - year - old photograph of North Korean leader Kim Jong - il 's heir apparent Jong - un at the age of 16 was published in the Mainichi Shimbun newspaper on Sunday .
The Japanese daily said the photo was taken in June 1999 , when Jong - un , then at junior high school in Switzerland under the assumed name Park Un , posed with his classmates .
The paper said Jong - un was in Bern from the summer of 1996 until January 2001 .
He originally studied at Bern International School , which his older brother Jong - chol ( 28 ) , also attended .
But Jong - un transferred to a public school there a few months later .
His teacher at the time said Kim Jong - un " came to the teacher 's room one day and said he was going back to his home country tomorrow and did not show up the next day . "

Comedian Wanda Sykes performed at the annual White House Correspondents Dinner , and while she did a great job poking fun at the Obama ’s some her best material was reserved for Sean Hannity and his offer to be waterboarded for charity .
Check out the video .
Here is the video :
Wanda joked , “ Sean Hannity said that he was going to get waterboarded for charity for our armed forces .
He has n’t done it yet I see .
Talking about he can take a waterboarding , please , ok you might be able to get waterboarded by somebody he knows and trusts , but let somebody from Pakistan waterboard him , or let Keith Olbermann waterboard him .
He ca n’t take a waterboarding .
I can break Sean Hannity by giving him a middle seat in coach . ”

Notice that a minority in the crowd groaned over her Rush Limbaugh jokes , and calling Rush the 20th hijacker maybe went a little too far , but nobody seemed to fear or respect Sean Hannity .
It is obvious that Hannity ’s offer to let himself be waterboarded has literally become a joke .
I would n’t trust Olbermann to waterboard Hannity because he would definitely use “ harsh interrogation tactics . ”
I thought Wanda Sykes was very good at the dinner .
Her humor about Obama was funny , but she is right it is tough to make fun of the guy .
He does n’t present as easy of a target as Clinton and the Bushes did .
The White House Correspondents
Dinner is a tough gig for comedians because it is a bipartisan audience that sometimes causes them to tone their act down too much .
Sykes worked a lot cleaner than usual , but she still was funny , which is n’t always a given with modern comedians .
It ’s the first Friday in June , which means it ’s National Doughnut Day !
UPDATE : Both Dunkin Donuts and Krispy Kreme are giving away free doughnuts today .
Here ’s a brief history of National Doughnut Day as per Wikipedia :
National Doughnut Day started in 1938 as a fund raiser for the Chicago Salvation Army .
Their goal was to help the needy during the Great Depression , and to honor the Salvation Army “ Lassies ” of World War I , who served doughnuts to soldiers behind the front lines in France .
Soon after the US entrance into WWI in 1917 , the Salvation Army sent a fact - finding mission to France .
The mission concluded that “ huts ” that could serve baked goods , provide writing supplies and stamps , and provide a clothes - mending service , would serve the needs of US enlisted men .
Six staff members per hut should include four female volunteers who could “ mother ” the boys .
( The canteens / social centres that were established by the Salvation Army in the United States near army training centers were called “ huts ” . )
About 250 Salvation Army volunteers went to France .
Because of the difficulties of providing freshly - baked goods from huts established in abandoned buildings near to the front lines , two Salvation Army volunteers ( Ensign Margaret Sheldon and Adjutant Helen Purviance ) came up with the idea of providing doughnuts .
These are reported to have been an “ instant hit ” , and “ soon many soldiers were visiting Salvation Army huts ” .
Margaret Sheldon wrote of one busy day “ Today I made 22 pies , 300 doughnuts , 700 cups of coffee . ”
A legend has spread that the provision of doughnuts to US enlisted men in WWI is the origin of the term doughboy to describe US infantry , but the term was in use as early as the Mexican - American War of 1846 - 47 .
The 62nd Cannes Film Festival opened with the first animated film to be given such an honor , the digital 3 - D Up from Pixar / Disney .

impassioned , passionate , ardent , fervent , fervid , perfervid mean showing intense feeling .
impassioned implies warmth and intensity without violence and suggests fluent verbal expression .
an impassioned plea for justice passionate implies great vehemence and often violence and wasteful diffusion of emotion .
a passionate denunciation ardent implies an intense degree of zeal , devotion , or enthusiasm .
an ardent supporter of human rights fervent stresses sincerity and steadiness of emotional warmth or zeal .
fervent good wishes fervid suggests warmly and spontaneously and often feverishly expressed emotion .
fervid love letters perfervid implies the expression of exaggerated or overwrought feelings .
perfervid expressions of patriotism
Did You Know ?
The adjectives " fervent , " " fervid , " and " perfervid " all derive from the Latin verb fervēre , meaning " to boil , " and suggest a bubbling up of intense feeling .
" Fervent " was the first to enter the English language in the 14th century .
It stresses sincerity and steadiness of emotional warmth and zeal , as in " Her colleagues expressed fervent good wishes . "
The next to emerge was " fervid " in the late 16th century .
It too suggests warmth but adds an element of spontaneity and feverishness .
A lover might write a fervid billet - doux to his beloved , for example .
With its first known appearance in print dating back only to 1833 , " perfervid " is a relative newcomer to English , but it implies the most extreme or exaggerated expression of emotion .
Its intensity comes from " per - , " a prefix meaning " thoroughly . "

Microsoft and online retailers last week kicked off Windows 7 sales in the U.S. , Canada and Japan , taking pre-orders at prices discounted by as much as 58 % and zooming to the top of Amazon. com 's sales .
The upgrade for Windows 7 Home Premium , priced at $ 49.99 , immediately stormed to the top of Amazon.com 's bestseller list .
The $ 99.99 Windows 7 Professional Upgrade held the No. 2 spot in software , while Windows 7 Ultimate Upgrade , a $ 219.99 package that has not been discounted , claimed No. 4 as of Friday afternoon .
Microsoft officially announced the limited - time deal Thursday , although details had leaked earlier this month when the Engadget site published a Best Buy memo that spelled out the prices and start date .
The discounted prices are good from today through July 11 in the U.S. and Canada , or " until supplies last , " Microsoft noted in fine print .
Pre -order prices will cease after July 5 in Japan .
Customers in the U.K. , France and Germany will be offered similar pre-order discounts starting July 15 .
Microsoft declined to get more specific than " until supplies last " when asked today what cap it has in mind for Windows 7 discounted pre-orders .
Prices , and the amount of the price cuts from Microsoft 's suggest list , vary by country .
In the U.S. , Home Premium has been discounted 58 % , while Professional has been reduced by 50 % .
Canadian users get a 50 % discount on both editions , but Japanese customers receive a 53 % discount on Home Premium and only 45 % off Professional .
In the U.S. , Windows 7 upgrades are available from Microsoft 's own online store , as well as from Amazon.com , Best Buy , Frys , Newegg , Office Depot and Tiger Direct .
Canadians can pre-order the OS from Microsoft , Amazon.com , Best Buy , Future Shop , London Drugs , Staples and The Source .
Most are throwing in free shipping , and saying that they will deliver the operating system on Oct. 22 , the date Microsoft has set for Windows 7's launch .
Only Microsoft 's online store is taking orders for downloadable copies of the new operating system as well as shrink - wrapped editions .
The company adds an additional $ 14.99 to the price if customers want a physical disc as well as the download , however .
According to Microsoft , the Windows 7 upgrades can be purchased and used by users currently running Windows Vista , Windows XP and the even - older Windows 2000 .
For the latter two operating systems , however , Windows 7 must be done as a " clean install " that deletes all data and applications ; users must back up data before the move to Windows 7 , then restore the data and resinstall all applications .
Only Vista users can do an " in-place " installation that leaves data , Windows settings and applications intact .
Although some analysts have slammed Microsoft for setting Windows 7 Home Premium 's upgrade at $ 120 , they have applauded the pre-order discounts .
" The $ 49 initial price is a nice reward for loyal customers , " said Michael Gartenberg , an analyst with Interpret , in a blog post yesterday .
" But the ' real ' upgrade pricing is way off for what the market will likely bear , especially during these economic times . "
This story , " Windows 7 Pre-Orders Dominates Amazon Sales " was originally published by Computerworld .
So what does it feel like to write something that will inspire audiences for generations ?
Apparently it feels like another day at the office , as it turns out some of the greatest works of all time were n't intended to be classics ... and often were just dashed off for the hell of it .
6 Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas
It changed a generation .
It was supposed to be a report on a motorcycle race .
The Impact :

When Hunter S. Thompson 's Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas stumbled into the American literary scene in 1972 it was almost immediately embraced as a new classic , and has been screaming incoherently at the other classics and eating all the shrimp at their parties ever since .
It is the tale of two barely fictionalized versions of Thompson and prominent civil rights attorney Oscar Zeta Acosta ( you can see him here in a yellow fishnet t- shirt ) who leave a swath of destruction and crumpled plastic baggies across the desert .
It 's a manic and increasingly frustrated search for the American Dream in a world where Richard Nixon is President ; JFK , MLK and Jimi Hendrix are dead and this is considered an appropriate way to dress :

Really ?
' Slack Power ' is a better slogan than ' Once You Go Slack ' ?
Really ?
Some of you may be more familiar with Terry Gilliam 's film version of the novel , the poster of which is immediately recognizable to anyone who has ever spent more than five minutes inside a college bookstore .
While there , you 'll also find comics starring the character based heavily on Thompson , Spider Jerusalem
But it All Got Started
When ...
Appropriately enough , the entirety of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas came to be because Thompson was on assignment from Rolling Stone to report on some retarded dirt bike race in the middle of the crappy desert .

Thompson spent so much of his time summing up the post - hippie zeitgeist that folks tend to forget that he got his start as a sports writer , and remained one up until his death ( his suicide note was famously titled Football Season is Over . " )
Over for YOU , anyway !
Thompson , never one for deadlines , responsibilities or coherence , started sending his bosses pages ripped out of his personal journal .
Go ahead , try that at your job , see how it goes .
Especially if your journal includes paragraphs like this :
" The sporting editors had also given me $ 300 in cash , most of which was already spent on extremely dangerous drugs .
The trunk of the car looked like a mobile police narcotics lab .
We had two bags of grass , 75 pellets of mescaline , five sheets of high - powered blotter acid , a saltshaker half - full of cocaine , and a whole galaxy of multi-colored uppers , downers , screamers , laughers . . . and also a quart of tequila , a quart of rum , a case of Budweiser , a pint of raw ether and two dozen amyls . "

But , if you 're Hunter S. Thompson , your editor sends it off for immediate publication and you become the voice of your generation .
The lesson ?
Contrary to what your parents told you , drugs and motorcycle racing go together beautifully .
In a country like Iran , the government rules the media .
The Media can only report what they are allowed to report , once the news passes the official censors .

A note on the Tor Project :
This is the manner in which our friends in Iran have been communicating out of the country .
The concept of Tor , is basically a secure mini-internet inside the internet , allowing access to otherwise blocked sites .
Joining the project takes installation if a bit of software on your computer , allowing the Tor network to use part of your internet connection for communications out of secure countries , like Iran .
joining the Tor project increases capacity of the network , and allows more information to flow in and out of Iran .
If you set your computer to stay out of hibernate mode , and leave it on , and connected to the internet , you are helping our friends in Iran while you sleep .
If you turn your computer off , or disconnect from the internet , the system automatically routs around your “ node ” or “ relay ” , allowing the system to work without your participation , just a bit slower .
Most users will not notice the TOR connection ’s use of bandwidth or computer resources on their systems .
The Tor network needs our help and resources .
Not money , just unused bandwidth and a bit of your computer .
A Tor Bridge is a connection that you supply to the Tor network , allowing someone in Iran to use your connection as the first link in the Tor chain .
These are sent into Iran by specific means , by a few individuals , to a few individuals inside Iran .
These are not published in a mass manner , this makes your connection worthless , as it can now be easily blocked or monitored by the bad guys in the Government .
The need for bridges is constant , as protesters are captured , their internet history is searched , the old bridges are identified and blocked from Iranian access , they are worthless .
If you set up a “ bridge ” there are ways to get the information to those that need it at the anonygreen site below .
There are sources for more information on the Tor project , and how you can help !
Start here :
Though we have re-formatted this page , if you are looking for some of the older posted lists , they are still here , they have been given pages .
That last load of about 7000 emails about overloaded us !
The InformIran plan will work , and in worldwide large numbers , it will beat the censors and inform our friends in Iran .
Tell your friends about his program , and re-tweet it .
We are constantly adding new email addresses and fax numbers to the lists .
Sorry , they are a bit sloppy , but this is about quantity , not looks .
Let ’s say you send 100 emails with 2 articles attached , and 50 get through .
That means that there are at least 100 news stories in circulation because of you .
Now , what if each story went through 10 hands ?
Now it is a thousand .
And of each of them passed it through 10 more hands ?
10 , 000 people know more about what is going on in their country because of YOU !
What if they tell 10 friends , yes , that is 100,000 people , and now you have started your own sea of green !
Our friends in Iran are being arrested probably really tortured , and killed .
We can send a few faxes and emails into Iran for them .
News and information is essential in a part of the world where everything is censored , and this is a way around the censors !
Send in images via .pdf or .jpg attachment .
When sending .pdf or .jpg attachments , use file compression .
Digitally make the file smaller to enable faster loading on the other end .
See the Comments Section for Strike info in Farsi and English
Posting got way out of hand !
There are now multiple pages on this site , with the email only listings .
Please use them as replacements for the massive long list that will remain until 06.23.09
Those that can communicate out if Iran are limited to talking with a close circle of friends that they can trust .
Mass blanketing of emails and faxes will get real information into the hands of everyday Iranians , and let them know just what the world knows about things in Iran .
This may empower more Iranians to take to the streets , and join the movement .
If the news gets into the hands of a hardliner , the fact that they did not contain all of the atrocities in the streets may convince them to switch sides , and go green , or at least be a bit easier on our friends in Iran , knowing that the world is indeed watching .
We need to get printable information from the outside world circulating in Iran !
They can forward the emails , or print them and circulate them by hand , or toss them into the crowds !
The plan is to send enough material into Iran that even if a secretary picks up a fax , she can read a bit of information before she passes it on , or tosses the fax .
Pick some numbers or addresses , and get yourself some Iranian Pen Pals !
Most of these email addresses are businesses , and they have the opportunity to forward the email to others or keep it , either way they will have REAL INFORMATION from the outside world !
There is a time for unsolicited emails , and this is it !
Iran has blocked most of the reliable news sources from the outside world , so all the typical Iranian knows is what the government tells them .. and those are government lies !
Iran barely has an internet , No YouTube , no CNN , BBC , FoxNews , NBC ..
They only have Twitter because of extraordinary efforts to keep it open .
You name it , if it is a block able site , they block it to control what the people know .
The world has thousands of videos , tens of thousands of articles , and millions of Twitterers .
Iran has no news that is not approved , and any news of an uprising is not approved !
This is a great way to irritate the Iranian Government , they cannot stop all of this information at the border !
ReTweet this site , Facebook it , Digg it , Delicious it , whatever you can do to get your others involved .
This is a lot to do for a few people , but a little for each to do when there are hundreds involved .
Phone , fax and email work , though !
They can not shut down the entire internet without closing businesses across the country .
The email plan is to get enough emails into the queue that when they have email service , emails will get through to those that can share the information inside the country of Iran
If you are fluent in Farsi , obtain anything you can from University sites , or other public sites , and post them into the comments section !
This is all about getting so much information into Iran that the censors cannot catch it all !
There are all sorts of online fax services that offer free trials , and sure would be worth a try for a few sends to Iran !
We need to get news INTO Iran , so they know just what all we know , and how big the news really is , worldwide !
Here is a starter list , of Phone , Fax , and Email contact info that I found .
It does not really matter HOW the information gets in , just that it does .
These lists get posted as we get them , there are several lists to be used :
There are page links at the top of this page to each of the posts that were on this main page .
It got out of control , and we re-located the various lists to separate pages .
If you have an email address bot , trawl Iranian Websites for email addresses , and add them to the list as a comment !
If you get an email or fax list from any of your contacts , DO NOT PUBLISH IT .
You have just found a set of your own contacts , or send it privately to a friend or two for help !
Keep these people as safe as you can !
Reminders :
See the suggested header and subject line here .
Use Credible Source Articles !
An article from “ joes blog ” does not quite have the same impact as CNN , BBC , or FoxNews !
Need a bulk email program ?
Many offer free trials , some are free !
Photos fax poorly , fax in article texts !
Emails with links will not work , the site will be blocked .
So , paste the article , photo or text into your email with the source credited .
You can probably also attach articles to the emails as a .pdf .
For free web to pdf conversion click here .
If you have several emails that bounce back , it could be your country or email provider being blocked .
Do n’t worry about that , send more articles to the contacts that you were successful with .
They have no news , and the more they get the better !
Language does not matter , a large percentage of Iranians are multi lingual , and English is big .

" I want to build a spacecraft and crash it into the moon .
Do n't worry , it will only cost me $ 80 million . "
I doubt that is exactly how the conversation behind the idea for NASA 's LCROSS project was presented .
But in essence , that is what is going to happen later this summer .
The LCROSS mission is designed to slam the expended upper stage of a Cenatur rocket into the south pole of the moon in the hopes that in the debris field from the resulting crater , we 'll see signs of water .
A sheparding craft will drift behind the spent rocket and analyze the dust up .
The shepard will also carry a camera , so it will be able to record the impact of the rocket , as well its own demise as it too crashes into the moon .
Check out a cool animation of the mission here .
Short of landing a rover with analyzing equipment at the poles , this is an efficient way of determining whether water lies within the regolith .
As NASA makes plans to return to the moon and potentially establish a permanent base , finding a local source of water would be a boon for a human outpost .
The LCROSS spacecraft will be launched along with the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter on a single rocket ( similar to the ESA 's Herschel and Planck dual payload launch this past May ) on June 17th .
Just after achieving orbit , the two spacecraft will go their separate ways .
LRO will gather data and map the moon for over a year , orbiting at just over 30 miles above the surface , while LCROSS loops around the Earth preparing for its big show .
The exact date for the impact is still in the works , so watch for updates on the LCROSS Twitter page .
NASA is also encouraging ground - based observers to turn their lenses toward the moon on the day of the impact .
While no one is sure how bright the explosion will be , we may well get a visual surprise .
So if you have one , break out your scope and settle in for the potential fireworks .
Or contact your nearest observatory and find out if it is hosting any special LCROSS events .
Wow .
Iran had a rock - em , sock - em presidential debate yesterday between the two top candidates for the job , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Mir-Hossein Mousavi .
Say what you will about Iran , but it ’s difficult to imagine another country in the Middle East , except Israel ( and possibly Iraq ) , where this sort of public confrontation could take place … and it sounds as if Ahmadinejad got the better of it .
Mousavi made the sort of points that might register with a western audience : Ahmadinejad had alienated the world with his extreme public statements , especially his denial of the holocaust .
Iran had suffered as a result , in economic terms and in international repute .
But Ahmadinejad made the sharper , populist–if inaccurate–appeal : Mousavi represented the Tehran establishment , which was getting rich at the expense of average Iranians .
He launched a direct attack on Hashemi Rafsanjani , whom he defeated in the 2005 .
This sort of attack is unprecedented in Iranian politics–and it may indicate desperation on Ahmadinejad ’s part .
He ’s been trailing in recent polls .
But it also may indicate why Ahmadinejad succeeded in 2005 and has been something less than a comfortable presence for the ruling Mullahs : he presents himself as an average guy , a populist , a man of faith–and a fighter .
Mousavi , by contrast , is an artist and architect who allows his wife , a prominent academic , to sit next to him at campaign rallies .
Hmmm .
Sounds familiar , does n’t it ?
( Although there ’s no evidence that Mousavi wind - surfs or speaks French . )
update : Nazila Fathi of the New York Times scores the debate in favor of Mousavi and makes an important point :
Mr. Ahmadinejad ’s remarks seemed to suggest a deepening divide between the president and a number of influential leaders , including some conservatives who belong to a faction that has supported Mr. Ahmadinejad .
Those conservatives , including Rafsanjani , are close advisers to the Supreme Leader .
Which raises the question :
If Ahmadinejad wins the election , despite this opposition , will he have a power base that begins to challenge the existing structure of the government ?
Pharmaceutical and health product companies , like the insurance industry , strongly oppose any proposal to create a public health insurance option , fearful that private insurers would be marginalized and government price controls would limit what the industry can charge for its products .
And with drug companies as the No. 1 all - time spender on lobbying , at $ 1.6 billion since 1998 , Congress is bound to at least entertain their concerns .
As an alternative to the public plan , representatives of the pharmaceutical industry want to see Medicaid , which provides insurance to poor families , expanded to cover more low - income workers .
This would mean more people could afford drugs and medical devices , increasing the industry 's target market .
Similarly , the industry supports the mandate that all Americans purchase health insurance , boosting the industry 's customer base by millions .
The pharmaceutical industry agreed Saturday to spend $ 80 billion over the next decade improving drug benefits for seniors on Medicare and defraying the cost of President Barack Obama 's health care legislation , capping secretive negotiations involving key lawmakers and the White House .
'' This new coverage means affordable prices on prescription drugs when Medicare benefits do n't cover the cost of prescriptions , '' Sen .
Max Baucus , chairman of the Senate Finance Committee , said in a statement announcing the accord .
... Baucus ' announcement said drug companies would pay half of the cost of brand - name drugs for seniors in the so - called doughnut hole -- a gap in coverage that is a feature of many of the plans providing prescription coverage under Medicare .
Other officials said wealthier Medicare beneficiaries would not receive the same break , but there was no mention of that in the statement .
" I was having dinner last night with some new friends here in Annecy , France ... they say that if what was happening in America with social services like healthcare , Medicare and Social Security was happening to them in France that citizens here would be flocking to the streets with rocks .
They pressed me on why Americans do n't do more to collectively show their displeasure with these and other things , I 'm embarrassed to say I could n't give them a good answer .
Maybe we 're too busy worrying about stuff like Jon and Kate or which politician is having an affair ...?
Or is it our corporate media is doing too good a job at distracting us with crap like that while those in power loot the place ? "
Last week the fine folks at OpenSecrets.org took a little look at the efforts Big Pharma has made to influence members of Congress to back the drug industry agenda .
Their first two paragraphs go a long way towards explaining a theme being aggressively pushed today by corporate shill Max Baucus ( DLC - MT ) .
Today ' sseemed to laud Baucus ' claim that a deal he claims to have made with these money - grubbers ( headed by spectularly corrupt former Congressman Billy Tauzin ) this is somehow a good thing .
If you do n't look too deeply it evenlike a good thing .
Baucus may be from Montana but he's as slick as a stick of olio .
That 's their sop to kill the public option ?
I 'm glad Baucus is so happy .
The people of this country want the same health care he and his family get from the federal government with our taxes .
Baucus is the third highest paid of all the members of Congress on Big Pharma 's payroll ( $ 1,078,605 ) , beaten only by two other anti-reform fanatics , Orrin Hatch ( R - UT - $ 1,547,963 ) and Arlen Specter ( R - D - PA - $ 1,171,366 ) .
Big Pharma 's other most bribed members of the House of Lords are Richard Burr ( R- NC - $ 912,497 ) and John McCain ( R - AZ - $ 877,965 ) .
All of these crooks are die - hard opponents of the public option that the public is clamoring for Yesterday I sent out this tweet I was inundated with e-mails from people wanting to know where they could sign up for the revolution .
Forget Enghelab Square ; we should all meet in front of Baucus ' house ( either in Helena or Inside the Beltway ) .
Bruce Wheeler is an American in Europe right now .
Please read his response : Mack Jepsen was even more to the point : " 75 % of Americans want the public option ; if we do n't get it , it will definitely be time to ' discuss ' the options left available . "
Mack 's right and many of us are confused about Barack Obama 's role in all this -- confused and eager for clarification .
OK .
But let 's not give up yet .
Help with Blue America 's Campaign For Health Care Choice .
If that fails , then let 's examine the options of how to deal with these crooks .

It ’s early days and this is n’t meant to be a carefully considered review of Wolfram ’s “ computational knowledge engine ” .
Rather , I just want to point out , for the benefit of anyone who might not yet know , that one small part of what it does is genuinely useful in a certain circumstance that comes up from time to time .
Suppose that for some reason you want a list of primes , or to know to 100 decimal places , or the 100th power of 2 .
Previously I would have used Google for the first two , banking on someone somewhere having put the information online , and I might have struggled to understand just enough Mathematica to do the third .
( However , I have just discovered that powers of 2 can also be found quite easily with the help of Google , so a more complicated example might be needed . )
Anyhow , with Wolfram Alpha one can type in some reasonable text such as “ The first hundred powers of 2 ” or “ pi to 100 places ” and it works out what you mean and gives you the answer .
That alone wo n’t change my life , but it is convenient and it will occasionally help me with things like preparing lectures for a general audience , which I think is just about enough to make it worth it to me to bookmark the site , though I have n’t yet done so .
It will also sketch graphs and simplify mathematical expressions without one having to learn any special language to put them in — you just guess what to write and if your guess is n’t too perverse it can work out what you mean .
What else does it do ?
Typing in “ father of Barack Obama ” gives “ Wolfram| Alpha is n’t sure what to do with your input ” .
Just typing “ Barack Obama ” gives you his full name and his date and place of birth .
Typing “ England ” gives you various basic facts about England .
Typing “ capital of Uruguay ” gives you Montevideo and various facts such as its population , current weather , etc .
After noodling about like this for a short time , I did what any non -saint would do and typed in my own name .
To be precise , I typed in “ Gowers ” .
The result was “ Wolfram| Alpha is n’t sure what to do with your input ” , together with the helpful suggestion that perhaps I had meant “ powers ” .
I think that gives a fairly good idea of what it does and what it does n’t do .
Perhaps one should regard the latter as a truly positive and innovative aspect of Wolfram Alpha : a New Kind of Search Engine ( or whatever it should be called ) that does n’t waste hours of your time by tempting you to look yourself up .

I have a new favorite comic , and it ’s called The System .
You should be reading it .
Background
Previous stories about hexavalent chromium contamination
Five current and former Oregon Army National Guard soldiers filed suit Monday against a war contractor that they say knowingly exposed them to a cancer - causing chemical in Iraq .
The suit alleges that managers from Kellogg , Brown & Root , or KBR , of Houston knew before the Oregon Guard arrived at the Qarmat Ali water treatment plant in May 2003 that the site was contaminated by hexavalent chromium , a highly toxic and long - identified carcinogen .
The plaintiffs allege the company either failed to do the required testing a month before the Guard arrived or destroyed the records to conceal the contamination .
KBR also discounted soldiers ' and civilians ' bloody noses and other symptoms of exposure as sand allergies .
The Oregon Guard had been assigned to protect civilian employees working at the treatment plant , a key component of Iraqi oil production .
In a written statement Monday , KBR director of communications Heather L. Browne said the company appropriately notified the Army Corps of Engineers , which oversaw the contractor 's work .
" KBR has provided the results of environmental testing and assessments to the U.S. Military and will continue to fully cooperate with the government on this issue , " she wrote .
" KBR did not knowingly harm troops . "
According to the suit filed in U.S. District Court in Portland , KBR 's health safety manager in southern Iraq knew in May 2003 the plant was contaminated with sodium dichromate , a corrosion fighter that is almost pure hexavalent chromium .
( The military believes Saddam loyalists opened and scattered bags of it as they fled the plant . )
Plaintiffs allege that KBR managers repeatedly told U.S. and British soldiers there was no danger , even after blood tests on civilian workers later confirmed elevated chromium levels .
The suit says the five plaintiffs developed symptoms of hexavalent chromium poisoning and continue to suffer breathing problems , stomach and esophageal ulcers and headaches , and face a greater risk of cancer and impact on their offspring .
The Oregon troops served with the 1st Battalion , 162nd Infantry Division that rotated through duties guarding civilians at Qarmat Ali from April to June 2003 .
Four of the plaintiffs -- Larry Roberta , of Aumsville , Scott Ashby of Lake Oswego .
Rocky Bixby of Hillsboro and Matthew Hadley of Aloha -- completed their Guard obligation and are civilians .
Capt .
Charles Ellis of Junction City remains with the Guard and is deploying to Iraq with the 41st Infantry Brigade in July .
Last month , Roberta and Ashby testified before the Oregon Legislature , which is considering a bill to set up a small fund to help exposed soldiers who develop cancer .
Attorneys for the soldiers , David Sugerman of Portland and Michael Doyle of Houston , said they expect several West Virginia National Guard members who served at the Iraqi water plant to file a similar suit .
Last year , 16 Indiana National Guard members who replaced the Oregon troops at Qarmat Ali and 10 civilian contractors who worked at the facility also sued KBR .
Under federal rules , civilians working on military bases are limited in their ability to sue employers , and that case has been in a confidential arbitration .
Since news coverage by The Oregonian in January , more than two dozen Oregon veterans have asked to be placed on a registry and more than a dozen have reported health issues to the National Guard or VA , mostly breathing problems .
The Oregon Army National Guard is still asking soldiers who may have served with the 1 - 162 to contact the Guard at 503- 584-2285 or the Portland Veterans Administration at 800-949-1004 , ext. 52852 , for more information on registering their exposure .

Girls as young as 11 will be able to ask for the morning - after pill by text message as part of plans to halt the rise in teenage pregnancies .
From July , girls at secondary schools will be able to text requests for emergency contraception if they have had unprotected sex , or if they fear condoms or other forms of protection have failed .
The scheme , in Oxfordshire , has been introduced after a jump of almost 10 per cent in the number of girls aged 18 and under getting pregnant in the county .
Easy as a text : Girls could get the pills from their school nurse ( posed by models )
Girls at four schools in Oxford and two in Banbury will be able to use a new number to text a school nurse for advice on sexual health and contraception .
The nurse may then invite them in to their in - school office to collect a morning - after pill - or will point them in the direction of a local GP or primary care centre which will be able to provide one if the school is closed .
It is designed to make it easier for girls to get emergency contraception and advice even when school is closed .
The scheme , which could be copied by other areas of the country if successful , has been attacked by family campaigners who say it will encourage promiscuity and could lead to a further rise in the teenage pregnancy rate .
Latest figures show that 42,900 girls aged under 18 fell pregnant in 2007 - the highest in Western Europe .
Father John Saward , a priest at SS Gregory and Augustine Roman Catholic Church in Oxford said : ' I think it 's horrendous .
Presenting this as a programme will encourage promiscuity in children . '
And Norman Wells of charity Family and Youth Concern said : ' Oxfordshire PCT is sadly mistaken if it thinks a text service to help teenage girls get the morning - after pill through the school nurse seven days a week and 52 weeks a year will reduce the teenage pregnancy rate .
School staff should be encouraging young people to respect and confide in their parents , not undermining them . '
Conservative health spokesman Andrew Lansley said : ' The morning - after pill should only be for emergencies , and certainly not so routine that schoolgirls can just text for it .
' This runs the risk of encouraging unprotected intercourse . '
But teenage mother Laura Cross , 18 , from the Oxford suburb of Barton , said : ' I think it 's a good idea .
I know people who have fallen pregnant because they 're too embarrassed to have the morning - after pill .
' If someone is embarrassed they would rather text than approach someone directly .
Teenagers do n't want to admit they are having sex because they are afraid their parents will find out . '
The service is being introduced jointly by Oxfordshire County Council and Oxfordshire Primary Care Trust after the number of teenage pregnancies in the county rose from 320 in 2006 to 350 in 2007 .
Council chiefs refused to reveal which schools were involved as it might attract ' unhelpful attention ' .
Over the past seven years , a total of 1,130 morning - after pills have been given to teenagers at the county 's 14 Bodyzone clinics , confidential drop - in centres run by the PCT .
Oxfordshire PCT said child protection staff would become involved if any child aged between 11 and 13 asked for contraception .
Sarah Breton , lead officer for projects between the county council and Oxfordshire PCT , said : ' This will provide an extra level of contact for those young people who think they have taken a risk and do n't want to approach a doctor or a pharmacist , but can text a health nurse and ask what they can do .
' Our commitment is to reduce the number of teenage conceptions in Oxfordshire so we 're looking at the most effective ways of doing that . '
County councillor and mother - of - four Louise Chapman , cabinet member for children , young people and families , first fell pregnant when she was a teenager .
She said : ' There 's no intention on our part to undermine parents , and we would encourage young people to speak to their parents about their situation .
' The nurses are not just there to give out contraception willy - nilly .
If you live in the real world this is happening and we'd be foolish to think there was something we could do to stop young people having sex . '
A spokeswoman for the PCT said : ' We have n't worked out the detail of the logistical process of how it will work .
The scheme will not start until the summer .'
A spokesman for the Family Planning Association said : ' This text service is an innovative approach that should help young people access , not just emergency contraception , but also sexual health advice from trained health professionals .
' Providing young people with confidential and high quality contraceptive services is an important and effective part of the strategy to reduce teenage pregnancies . '
Silence Is The Enemy June 1 , 2009
This morning begins a coordinated blogospheric effort to draw attention to the ongoing horror of mass rape of women and girls in Liberia , which continues despite the end of civil war :
Jackie is too young to remember the 14 - year civil war in Liberia , from 1989 to 2003 , when as many as three - fourths of women were raped .
Jackie ’s world is one of a bustling , recovering Liberia with a free press and democratically elected leaders .
Yet somehow mass rape survived the end of the war ; it has been easier to get men to relinquish their guns than their sense of sexual entitlement .
So the security guard at Jackie ’s school , a man in his 50s , took the little girl to the beach where , she said , he stripped her and raped her .
Finally , he ran off as she lay bleeding and sobbing on the sand .
Mass rape and torture of women and girls also continues in the Congo :
Nothing I have heard or seen compares with what is going on in the Democratic Republic of Congo , where corporate greed , fueled by capitalist consumption , and the rape of women have merged into a single nightmare .
Femicide , the systematic and planned destruction of the female population , is being used as a tactic of war to clear villages , pillage mines and destroy the fabric of Congolese society .
In 12 years , there have been 6 million dead men and women in Congo and 1.4 million people displaced .
Hundreds and thousands of women and girls have been raped and tortured .
Babies as young as 6 months , women as old as 80 , their insides torn apart .
What I witnessed in Congo has shattered and changed me forever .
I will never be the same .
None of us should ever be the same .
A number of bloggers are coordinating our efforts to call attention to this horrible situation and mobilize activism and financial support to end systematic mass rape in Africa .
Here are some things you can do :
(1) Visit the blogs of Isis the Scientist , Tara Smith ’s Aetiology , and Sheril Kirshenbaum ’s The Intersection .
They will be donating their revenues for page views to Doctors Without Borders , and they will be posting on an ongoing basis about this situation .
(2) Donate to Doctors Without Borders , who are leading the effort to provide medical treatment to women and girls who have been grievously harmed .
(3) Write to your representatives and senators in Congress to urge them to use the diplomatic power of the United States to end this horrible situation .
You can use this directory to obtain the contact information for your representative and senators by typing in your zip code .
(4) You can blog about this yourself to call attention to our efforts .
UPDATE : A Facebook page has been created to help with coordinating our efforts .
UPDATE 2 : Here is a more complete list of science blogs that are donating their revenues for this month to Doctors Without Borders .

March 9 , 2009  -- For Carol
Poe , obesity is the most painful problem in the world .
She tried everything from dieting to bariatric surgery to reduce her body weight .
As these methods continued to fail , Poe , tired of being morbidly overweight , underwent the most radical treatment ever devised for obesity -- brain surgery .
Poe is the second person in the United States to undergo deep brain stimulation for weight loss .
In deep brain stimulation , electricity is introduced to specific parts of the brain that are believed to control specific behaviors , in Poe 's case , feelings of hunger and satisfaction .
" So what they 're going to do is ... insert needles into the part of my brain that controls the food , " Poe , 60 , said before the surgery .
" And then they 'll put wires underneath my scalp , and it 'll go down on each side of my clavicle , [ where ]
I 'll have a battery pack . "
Now 5 feet 2 inches and 230 pounds ,
Poe , a married mother of two , said that at her heaviest she weighed about 490 pounds .
" When you 're heavy and you walk down the street … everybody looks at you and they 're snickering and they 're laughing , " she said at her home in Morgantown , W. Va .
" When you go on an airplane and everybody looks to see if you 're going to be able to sit in a seat … the weight has just taken over my life . "
During the surgery , the team of doctors would target Poe 's brain as opposed to her stomach .
" I 've just known in my heart that there had to be something else .
That there had to be something , " she said before the procedure .
" I 've tried everything else .
I 've tried all the fad diets .
I 've tried liquid protein .
I 've tried Redux , Fen -Phen .
I 've had a stomach bypass .
I 've tried the Atkins diet .
I 've tried them all .
And it 's not coming off .
So I really believe that it 's got something to do with the brain . "
Deep brain stimulation has already proved successful in the treatment of neurological conditions such as Parkinson 's disease and epilepsy -- eliminating or reducing the tremors and ticks .
Surgeons believe the procedure is effective in treating behavioral problems , such as obsessive compulsive disorder and depression , and now hold hopes about using it to fight obesity .
Neurosurgeons from West Virginia University Hospital are leading the way with a Food and Drug Administration approved study of deep brain stimulation for the treatment of obesity .
" This is not for overweight patients .
It 's for obese patients , " said Dr. Julian Bailes , chairman of West Virginia University 's department of neurosurgery , acknowledging that currently two - thirds of the American population is overweight .
" Remember that obesity itself will reduce your life expectancy maybe 20 years .
It 's associated with many other diseases : diabetes , heart disease and others .
So it 's a real problem .
...
We think our responsibility as physicians who maybe have a better understanding than most is to look at the potential and sort of the intervention of the brain . "
Only patients who 've tried every other treatment , including bariatric surgery , qualify for the study .
And all must undergo a detailed psychiatric evaluation .
" She has a good profile , " Bailes said of Poe .
" She 's failed the best surgery that we know of , which is gastric surgery .
...
So I think it is the best chance for them , for her . "
Skeptics may wonder if deep brain stimulation is a drastic medical treatment for a behavioral problem , but Bailes believes " there is a medical issue of obesity . "
" I believe that many people have done everything they can , " he said .
" And maybe there 's some predisposition .
Maybe there 's some effect that the brain cannot control exactly what we consume . "
There are risks associated with the surgery -- from infection and hemorrhaging , and in the most extreme cases ( less than 1 percent ) paralysis or death .
Bailes said the FDA had been " appropriately scrutinizing " the study .
" For some , it may seem radical that elecrodes should be put in the brain , that someone should be doing brain surgery for obesity .
But I think we 've gotten through that and we are very happy to be able to do the first series of patients here , looking at the effects and possible benefits .
" This is a frontier of medicine , a frontier of neurosurgery , a frontier of neurological disease , to be able to generate tiny pulses of electricity in these deep nuclei of the brain , and to see what effect they may have on behavior , including in this case the behavior of eating and the issue of uncontrolled appetite . "
Since there are no pain receptors in the skull or brain , Poe required only a topical anesthetic wash applied to her scalp .
She was awake throughout the surgery .
" I 'm excited about being awake .
I want to be awake , " she said .
" Because if I 'm awake , I 'll know everything that 's going on . "
The neurosurgeons , Drs. Michael Oh and Donald Whiting , drilled about 10 centimeters into Poe 's brain , on both hemispheres , through a pathway of tissue that does not affect other functions .
When they reached a point in the hypothalamus , which controls the stomach , a wire was introduced that would ultimately carry an electrical impulse .
The plan was to alter the level of electricity that 's generated by that region naturally , thereby giving Poe the sensation of feeling full .
Oh followed the surgery on a computer , which helped the surgeons find the point at which they 'd introduce electrodes .
" Although we are applying this technology for obesity , there are certainly many more possibilities in the near future that are going to be available for people with many neurodegenitive disorders , " Oh said .
Controlling the Body With the Brain
To some extent , the surgeons are able to evaluate patients ' reactions during an awake surgery and talk to them .
" During this procedure , when we have the electrode in this target , we will be asking her about stimulation - induced responses , whether she has a feeling of hunger whether she has any memory responses , " Oh explained .
During the surgery , the surgeons can actually provoke a reaction to this electrical current and control the current by adjusting the amount of electricity applied .
Once they get a successful response , doctors " implant a permanent generator , and they have this constant electrical current to that part of the brain , " Oh said .
Poe said the procedure did n't hurt but found the stabilization device the doctors put on her head uncomfortable .
" It 's just real tight , " she said .
" Like your head is in a vice . "
After about an hour of the most delicate movements , doctors believed they 'd reached the precise spot .
When the electrical current was first introduced , doctors asked Poe if she felt hungry or full , and also whether she felt hot or cold .
" I 'm getting warm now , " she said .
" Yeah , I was cold . "
The tested electricity was lowered .
Poe was unaware of when the doctors signaled for a change in the electrical current , so she could n't play into what she believed they might want to hear .
" Tell me if that changes anything , " said Whiting .
" Yeah , I 'm cooled off , " said Poe .
" I really am .
Yeah , I am pretty cool . "
The so - called thermostat of the brain , where we get our sense of temperature , is right next to the region where the stomach is also controlled .
Poe said she felt fine , and even at a moment like that , her favorite beverage came to mind .
" I sure could use a Pepsi , though , " she said .
" I told him to find the Pepsi button .
He must have found it .
Woo ! "
Almost miraculously , doctors were controlling Poe 's stomach through her brain .
" And then they started to turn it up , and I had to tell them if I felt anything different .
Like I started getting real hot .
And then I felt like I was going to throw up , " Poe said later .
" They knew exactly every pinpoint , " she said .
" It was like they knew my body .
They knew how my body was reacting to everything , and they knew what to do to make it back where it should be . "
The surgery lasted three hours .
Poe remained in the hospital , and two pacemaker - type devices were implanted into her chest to control the amount of voltage that is sent to her brain .
" You want to do a touchdown end - zone dance , because it was exactly what we wanted to get with the location and the voltage , " said Whiting immediately after the surgery .
Whiting also discussed why maintaining a constant dialogue with Poe was so important .
For more than 40 minutes , doctors kept talking , asking Poe repeatedly how she was feeling .
" She wants to … theoretically give us the answers we want to hear and what we want to is without her knowing [ is ] change parameters to see if it was consistent , " Whiting explained .
" And in fact there were some things early on that were n't consistent , and we knew they were n't for real , but the nausea findings were very consistent so we very well [ could ] prove that they were for real . "
Creating 'a Sensation of Fullness '
In the months ahead , the voltage going into Poe 's brain will be turned on and then increased over time .
" She got a nausea feeling at higher voltages , " said Whiting .
" Our ideal plan would be to set the electrical setting at just below that threshold of nausea where she does n't really feel any different but still readjust her weight thermostat so that she can metabolize better and actually eat less if that 's what it takes . "
The morning after surgery , Carol was irrepressible .
" I did n't think I 'd feel this good today , " she said .
" I really feel good .
I could go home if they'd let me , because I 'm that confident about it .
I do n't worry about going home and something happening .
" I think the best part of the surgery was the fact that I was awake .
" And I got to hear everything that was going on .
I could hear the drill drilling into my head , and I thought , ' Oh my God . '
And it was like a big bunch of pressure , like when you push down on something .
I could feel all the pressure .
And then I could actually feel the drill going through the bone into where it wanted to be . "
Bailes is confident that there will be positive results for Carol Poe .
" Well , we hope her sensation is a sensation of satiety , a sensation of fullness , a lack of compulsion to consume excess calories , " said Bailes .
" And a sensation again of satisfaction , of not having … the feeling we need to eat some more when we know we do n't . "
Three weeks after the surgery , the voltage inside Poe 's brain pacemakers was turned on .
According to doctors , it will be several months before any weight loss is noticeable once the voltage is increased to the level required .
Yet four weeks after the surgery , Poe said she 's already lost three pounds .
" When I eat , I get full faster , " she said .
" I just do n't have the cravings like I used to have . "
And she said she no longer has the urge to consume a whole liter of her favorite drink -- Pepsi -- every day .
As part of the study , Poe must keep a meticulous journal of everything she consumes , and doctors will carefully track her progress .
If this proves to be the solution to what has been a lifelong struggle for Carol Poe , her surgical team believes it could and should become widely available , targeting the brain for the benefit of the body .
" If I have a craving it 's just a little craving and it's not just a craving to keep eating and eating and eating it , " she said .
" My body feels different .
I feel like I am more , I 'm more satisfied as far as food goes .
And … I feel better . "
" This may be the tip of the iceberg , " said Bailes , " And again open the door for clever people and brilliant researchers to look at what the other applications could be .
I think we can't forsee some of those now . "

Congratulations on reaching the 800th issue .
It is not easy these days for independent left journals to sustain themselves , when they are so badly needed .
Look forward to hearing about the 1000th .

As so much of the corporate media becomes a parody of itself , the agents of power not of people , we need the view from ground more than ever and Green Left Weekly more than ever .
-- John Pilger , journalist and documentary maker
For the most up - to - date list of solidarity messages , please visit Green Left Weekly 's greetings page .
June 28 , 2009 --
The need for a radical green and left alternative to the monopolised corporate media is even greater today than when the first issue of Green Left Weekly came out in February 1991 .
From the outset we knew this non-profit project could survive only with the dedication and support from those inspired by a vision of democratic and ecologically sustainable socialist change .
GLW has generated a dedicated following from socialists , militants and activists throughout the world , as the many heartfelt solidarity messages below prove .
( They include well - known figures such as Noam Chomsky , John Pilger and , as well as lesser known but equally important activists in the social change movements in Australia and around the world , and of course some of our subscribers -- the backbone of the GLW project . )
In our first issue we said we ’d reject any corporate funding because “ we are after a better class of investors — those interested in investing in a better world ” .
GLW is proud to be part of the struggle for a safe climate future — a world free of racism , war and exploitation .
We ’ll continue this struggle , but to do so we need your ongoing support .
Thousands of volunteers have written for , donated to and helped distribute GLW on street corners and at protests over the years , and via the internet throughout the world .
The world today is a dangerous place but global corporate tyranny and environmental degradation and inperialist aggression are being met with growing resistance , most vitally across Latin America led by the Venezuelan , Bolivian and Cuban revolutions .
GLW is an important hub of this resistance .
This is the fundamental reason why GLW has come this far .
But it does n't explain how we have survived .
GLW was launched at a moment of extreme capitalist triumphalism .
Socialism was seen by most people to have failed in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe .
The left around the world went into retreat .
Many left parties collapsed or were dissolved .
Many left activists dropped out of activity through demoralisation or opted for a less radical politics .
Some in Australia became part of the problem and joined Australia 's alternate party of the corporate rich , the Australian Labor Party .
Others settled for the safer and more respectable road of green parliamentarism .
The initiators of GLW — the members of the Democratic Socialist Perspective and the socialist youth organisation Resistance , and a range of independent activists — opted for a different path .
We decided to produce a paper that would be a voice for the “ left of the greens and the greens of the left ” .
We recognised that the ecological crisis was part of the crisis of capitalism and that there was no fundamental solution to it in a society which places capitalist profit above social and environmental survival .
That insight is becoming more and more accepted as the escalation global warming crisis looms larger and more and more young activists accept that we must change the system to change the climate .
GLW has always sought to be a vehicle to bring the left together , and create an alternative to the two - capitalist - party system .
When it was born , GLW was promoting a number of left unity project .
Today it is an enthusiastic supporter of the Socialist Alliance , which has gathered to together hundred of socialists from across the left spectrum to fight to build such a vitally needed left political force .
We have a lot of people to thank for GLW 's success , especially the many people who have written articles , drawn cartoons , taken photographs , donated money and helped distribute the paper .
But two groups have been crucial to GLW 's survival : the members of the Democratic Socialist Perspective , Resistance and the Socialist Alliance , who have done some of the hardest — and at times tedious — work to ensure that the last 800 issues were produced and distributed .
If there was any doubt about the value of left and green activists continuing to organise in a serious and professional way , GLW 's 800th issue should banish it .
GLW is proud to be part of the struggle for a safe climate future — a world free of racism , war and exploitation .
We ’ll continue this struggle , but to do so we need your ongoing support .

Those of us at Monthly Review would like to reach out our hands in solidarity with our comrades at Green Left Weekly in celebration of its 800th issue .
In addition to being Australia ’s leading radical paper , the GLW has become a global voice for 21st century socialism : Marxist , ecological , anti-imperialist , anti-racist , feminist , and in solidarity with revolutionary struggles throughout the world .
As so much of the corporate media becomes a parody of itself , the agents of power not of people , we need the view from ground more than ever and Green Left Weekly more than ever .

In Pakistan , every week , we ’ve read Green Left Weekly since 1998 when we came in contact with the DSP .
It brings news and views of the progressive and labour movement of Australia and internationally .
The international coverage of GLW is unprecedented .
We have learned a lot and many of Labour Party Pakistan international policies are based on the information in GLW .
The coverage of Venezuelan events is our sole source of information regarding the ongoing revolutionary processes in the region .
Our congratulations to the staff and comrades associated with GLW on the printing of the 800th edition .
A great revolutionary task is fulfilled by the comrades of DSP and GLW by printing the paper regularly .
We also want to congratulate all who stand in the streets and markets of Australian cities to sell the paper regardless of brutal weather conditions .
Farooq Tariq , Labour Party Pakistan spokesperson
We congratulate Green Left Weekly for the publication of your 800th issue !
For years GLW has provided readers with news and analysis on the development of people ’s struggles in Australia as well as all over the world .
We hope comrades who have worked hard to get GLW for the past 800 issues will continue your great effort to spread the revolutionary messages through every publication of GLW to inspire people to continue our fight against capitalism , imperialism and oppression .
Best wishes and keep up the great work !

The Partido Lakas ng Masa sends warm and fraternal greetings for the 800th issue of Green Left Weekly .
Our comrades are grateful to GLW for providing the Australian and international left with an eyewitness account of the launch of this new anti-capitalist , socialist party project in the Philippines .
This is a continuation of the excellent coverage in GLW of the political developments in the revolutionary movement in the Philippines over several decades .
The contributions that GLW makes to the international revolutionary movement are many .
On this occasion we would like to especially commend GLW for a non-sectarian reporting of national and international political developments .
In this , I think , GLW sets a standard and an extremely important example for the international left .
This non-sectarian approach is reflected in the reporting of small developments and major revolutionary developments , such as Venezuela ’s Bolivarian revolution .
We think that this is an essential element of making GLW the great paper that it is .
We congratulate the dedicated group of revolutionaries who continue to work on the paper today : the editors and the writers , the sales organisers and the sellers and those who raise the funds to keep the paper going .
Launched in 1990 , the 800th issue represents just under two decades of revolutionary work .
As we mark the 800th issue , we are looking forward to celebrating the 20th anniversary of the paper with you in 2010 .
Mabuhay Green Left Weekly !
Reihana Mohideen , for the Executive Committee Partido Lakas ng Masa ( Philippines )
We would like to convey our hearty congratulations to Green Left Weekly on the publication of its 800th issue .
GLW has become an indispensable resource for analysis of socialist and liberation movements .
We look forward to its continuing leadership as new openings appear for rebuilding the socialist movement worldwide .

Congratulations to Green Left Weekly for a decade and a half of exemplary leftist journalism !
Based on my own experience in Indonesia , I do n’t think that it ’s too much to say that GLW has played an important role in shaping activists into real internationalists .
GLW has presented open - minded yet sharp critical analysis of important issues that instills in its readers a sense of solidarity with the oppressed anywhere in the world .
We in PRD regularly discuss what ’s in the latest GLW to look for an alternative view outside the dubious and often misleading mainstream media reporting .
In this “ battle of ideas ” against the prevailing neoliberal world - view , we are constantly in need of leftist literature as a source of discussion and inspiration .
GLW has been and still is one of our main references .
Thank you for your contribution to our ammunition of ideas , and keep up your good work of spreading the seeds of revolution and internationalism .
Itu tidak sia-sia [ That is not in vain ] .
Data Brainanta , Peoples Democratic Party ( Indonesia )
What about Green Left Weekly and what is to be done !
It should be acknowledged that GLW is one of the strong and brave progressive media outlets of our era .
With its attractive appearance and high quality content , it continually revitalises revolutionary agents and actors .
The most important thing is that GLW continually spreads progressive views from the people ’s movements as well as raising many of the world ’s most fundamental issues .
All of this is in order to achieve our primary aspiration , that is true and total democracy , which we , with resolution , call “ for a true socialist world ! ” — this is possible and now is in the process of approaching !
Based on these important factors and remembering that GLW is now approaching its 800th issue , it is appropriate that we give congratulations to GLW for its remarkable achievements during this time and continue the struggle until we achieve victory .
For GLW ’s activists , continue your monumental work through this remarkable media , continue to cover even more of the progressive ideas and actions of the people ’s movement .
Continue to increase the quality of coverage of the fundamental world issues , so that the people ’s awareness continues to awaken and lead in the front line of the universal people ’s mobilisations , in particular the oppressed people ’s mobilisations for a world that is truly just — that is a truly socialist world .
A luta continua !

I would like send revolutionary greetings to Green Left Weekly on the occasion of your 800th edition .
More than ever , as the capitalist system goes deeper into crisis , workers across the world need weapons such as Green Left Weekly , in our fight against the ruling elites .
Here in Venezuela , where the private media have been responsible for attempted coups , and continues to conspire against the people , we know all too well the importance of alternative media .
Through your bureau in Caracas , and the delegations of Australians to Venezuela , we know that you are playing an important role in spreading the truth about our revolutionary process .
Thank you for the solidarity you have shown to the Venezuelan revolution , and in particular the Venezuelan working class , who today are at the forefront of the fight for a socialist world .

Congratulations to Green Left Weekly on reaching its 800th edition !
This is a remarkable achievement , and an example for revolutionary socialists everywhere .
I have been a correspondent for GLW at times , writing about politics in the United States , and I hope to continue whenever the editors wish .
In international solidarity and a common anti-imperialist stance ,
Barry Sheppard , United States
I congratulate Green Left Weekly on its 800th issue .
In an era of increasing concentration of the corporate media , the existence of a vibrant , alternative voice such as GLW is essential .
Its coverage of issues , both national and international , is first - class as is its interpretation and analysis of the events on which it reports .
I look forward to its 1000th edition .
Sylvia Hale , MLC , Greens member , NSW parliament
Many socialists in the 20th century gave insufficient attention to ecology .
Green Left Weekly is to be commended for consistently linking socialist endeavour with environmental struggles and climate change .
Jack Mundey , former NSW president of the Builders Labourer Federation
Congratulations and a hearty ‘ thankyou ’ to the comrades producing GLW !
Not only does GLW keep us in touch with the struggles for justice and a different society in Australia and elsewhere , but it also analyses the world around us , which is essential for these struggles .
In particular , the reports from the office of the GLW in Venezuela are invaluable .
Socialist Alliance is privileged to have the regular column ‘ Our Common Cause ’ in GLW .
The paper plays a powerful role in our struggle for socialism .
I ’m proud to be selling it .
Comradely greetings and Viva GLW !
Bea Bleile , Socialist Alliance national co-convener
We as the Tamil Youth Organisation ( TYO ) express our solidarity with Green Left Weekly and express our desire to continue to work with them in highlighting to the world issues that are fundamental to the basic human rights and dignity of human beings .
We express our gratitude to GLW for its accurate and well researched articles detailing the suffering of the Eelam Tamils and their constant desire to be free from state sponsored terrorism and guaranteed their right to self - determination .
GLW has been a beacon of hope to those minorities whose plight is often ignored and / or overlooked by the mainstream media and for this due credit must go to this publication .
On behalf of TYO , I would like to congratulate you on reaching this milestone and we encourage you to continue your efforts in reporting down the path less travelled .
Adrian Francis , Tamil Youth Organisation
Congratulations on your 800th issue !
I ’ve been a loyal supporter and reader of GLW since its very first issue .
I find GLW ’s analysis of world events outstanding .
Its coverage of Australian politics , especially of working - class struggles and the battles of Aborigines against racism and for full equality , has many parallels to what working people and national minorities face in the United States .
I look forward to reading GLW each week and urge others to use your excellent website .
Malik Miah , an editor of Against The Current , a US socialist magazine published by Solidarity .
800 issues of Green Left Weekly , that ’s impressive .
Not so much because of the years gone by ( other publications have lived longer ) , but rather because of the stature of the paper .
People like me in Socialist Worker - New Zealand like GLW .
We really like it .
Yes , it ’s readable .
And yes , it ’s informative .
But it ’s more , much more .
GLW has that X - factor : a geo-strategic broadness combining internationalist vision , inclusive leftism and eco-social clarity .
And that ’s what makes it inspirational .
So hats off to all the grassroots activists whose true grit has shaped that X - factor .
Socialist Worker - New Zealand comes from a different left tradition than the publishers of GLW .
Therefore , according to leftist myths , we ’re supposed to keep our distance from each other .
What rot !
We confront similar ruling elites trashing our people and our ecology .
We share similar histories of resistance from below .
Along with others on the global left , we represent the face of the future , so long as we combine together for the sake of the future of humanity and our habitat .
Flaxroots Maori in Aotearoa / New Zealand are inheritors of a collectivist tradition that bolsters the ethics of socialism .
The Maori phrase for “ stay strong ” is “ kia kaha ” .
So , comrades , I finish with these words : Socialist Worker - New Zealand says kia kaha to a beaut paper !
Grant Morgan , Socialist Worker - New Zealand
Congratulation to Green Left Weekly on its 800th issue .
This is an astonishing achievement .
GLW blazed a trail internationally in making the ecological crisis central to revolutionary perspectives — something much more controversial 19 years ago than it is now .
And GLW ’s main backer , the DSP , also blazed a trail in its understanding of one of Lenin ’s key ideas — in the long term , the future of humanity will be settled in Asia .
GLW has always paid special attention to the development of the revolutionary movement on that continent .
As world capitalism sinks deeper into crisis , GLW remains an essential resource and reference points for militant socialists in Australia and worldwide .
Phil Hearse , Socialist Resistance , London
For many years , GLW has been for me a lively and informative window on Asian struggles .
Unfortunately , in France and in Europe , there is little knowledge of Asia and little sustained solidarity with people struggles in Asia .
To inform and mobilise on these issues is a must .
We try our best to do so through the bilingual website of Europe solidaire sans frontières ( ESSF ) and the newly launched electronic bulletin of the ‘ Asia Group ’ of the New Anticapitalist Party ( NPA ) in France ( it is the first time such a bulletin is produced , while there has been one on Africa for long in the LCR ) .
GLW and Links coverage of Asian issues help us a lot in bringing Asian issues into French activists ’ milieu .
Thanks , and continue .
Pierre Rousset , France
Dreams and hopes are magically transformed each week , converted into a handful of well - written , designed and printed pages .
But there is so much more in each edition !
Above all , because often it is difficult to reconcile these dreams with the petty short - sightedness of our immediate reality .
The fact is that the most important role of a militant journalist is precisely to be ability to see the light of the future through the daily opacity .
For all this , from these far away latitudes , I send my fraternal greetings and encouragement in continuing in this task .

Green Left Weekly is an exceptional resource .
Your writers and subjects are the most committed and informed people I ’ve met .
Many congratulations to Green Left Weekly for its 800th issue !
Comrades everywhere outside Australia wonder how you manage consistently to put out a weekly of such high quality on such a small budget .
When in Melbourne earlier this year , I got a good sense of why you are on top of local struggles ( like those of Australian construction workers ) — - you combine real solidarity work with your journalism .
In other words , it is the commitment of those in the Socialist Alliance who are working with GLW that explains a success that is envied elsewhere .
May you grow in influence in Australia and continue to be an example outside !

Revolutionary and internationalist congratulations and maximum respect .
What an incredible achievement for GLW to be 800 issues strong , unprecedented for a progressive anti-capitalist weekly paper in a country and world so dominated by the capitalist media and its propaganda .
GLW has not only remained a standard bearer of principled , dedicated and activist journalism and writing but represents that rare kind of publication that links with the real struggles against oppression and injustice of people both in Australia and across the globe .
Keep the words coming and the flames burning .

We , your friends and comrades of the German party Die Linke send you , the daring , consistent voice of the Australian radical Left , our warm congratulations on the publication of your 800th issue .
We appreciate your news , comments and thorough analyses on the ideas , actions and visions of the Left in Australia and world - wide .
We feel united with you and the Australian Left in the struggle for social justice , peace and a world - wide solution to the problems of climate change that secure the future of today ’s young generation .
We wish you to continue in the spirit of international solidarity that is coming from every of your issues .
Anne Quart , International Policy Department , Die Linke , Germany
We congratulate all the comrades from Green Left Weekly for its 800th issue , which means a important effort in order to inform the Australian people and create a place for anti-imperialist and anti-capitalist debate .
From the Bolivarian Revolution we are also grateful for the great and militant solidarity you express in your articles and documents with the struggles of our working class and pur people .
For that , GLW is not only a national newspaper , but also very useful in the international solidarity .
The 800th issues marks finally an important milestone for the left press all over the world in the times of the capitalist crisis and the debate about socialism .
As moderator of the Marxism mailing list , I know I speak for everybody on the list in wishing Green Left Weekly continued growth and influence .
As a mailing list that aspires to worldwide unity of the left , having the presence of a number of GLW readers and writers makes an enormous difference . ”
Louis Proyect
I would like to send my warm wishes to Green Left Weekly on its 800th issue .
GLW is the most important weekly paper for greens and socialists on the planet .
For those of who are eco-socialist it is particularly valuable ; it is a rare example of how the left can work in an open way to build a powerful resource for change .
From the biofuels scandal to the indigenous revolution to the victories of the Latin America left , its all in GLW .
Derek Wall , last principal male speaker of the Green Party of England and Wales
I congratulate Green Left Weekly on their achievement at reaching their 800th edition ; in particular GLW have been inspirational for their commitment to combining both green and socialist politics .
They have also been pioneers in web - based publishing , which has provided a model for others to follow , especially inspiring has been GLW ’s commitment to covering a diverse range of opinion , reflecting the ability of the left to democratically debate its disagreements , within a framework of shared common goals .

Well done Green Left Weekly !
You have over the years espoused the cause of uniting green and left politics in a consistent revolutionary fashion .
Your interesting , accessible and topical stories have kept us abreast of developments in Australia and throughout the world .
You have also diligently reached out to many organisations and struggles throughout the world in solidarity , covering stories and sending your newspaper .
Your contribution to socialist renewal in the 21st century cannot be questioned .

It is a great pleasure to be able to send this short message to GLW on achieving its 800th edition .
This is no small achievement given the challenges facing left and alternative publications in this most trying of economic times .
It does however indicate the commitment of those associated with the journal , and the importance they attach to making sure that there is a worker friendly socialist perspective available to educate , share and inspire action on behalf of our class .
LGW has maintained a clear and non-sectarian focus , and remain a vital source of analysis and news for all us intent on building a socialist movement .
Congratulations comrades , and remember , that we have nothing to lose but our chains !
Congratulations to all the companeros y companeras at Green Left Weekly for your tremendous efforts to give voice to the silenced and excluded , and to risk exposing injustice and imperial atrocities to ensure the truth prevails .
You are warriors for justice , armed with words and ideas , helping to build a more peaceful and harmonious world community .
Without the type of solidarity and commitment to truthful journalism you have clearly demonstrated , the liberated peoples of Latin America today would remain invisible before world opinion .
Thank you for remaining brave and firm despite grave dangers and threats from world powers , and most of all , thank you for standing hand in hand with those who have chosen to fight empire and build social and economic justice .
Here ’s to 800 more !
Eva Golinger , author of Bush vs Chavez and The Chavez Code Congratulations on 800 issues and look forward to many more years of fighting for socialism together !
Derrick O'Keefe , editor of Rabble.ca and Seven Oaks I fully agree with my colleague Noam Chomsky .
It is very hard to publish a critical paper in a country where the media market is run by a few corporate oligopolies not only suffocating almost everything in its way but also creating what Al Gore has called “ an assault on reason ” ( 2007 ) Thomas Klikauer , Coogee , NSW
Greetings to Green Left Weekly !
Congratulations on chalking up your 800th issue .
In a world racked by the econcomic and ecological crises , you have long sought to provide a solution which recognises the causal links between both crises , by sourcing both problems to the barbarous economic and political system that is capitalism .
For that future generations will be in your debt .
Gary MacLennan , Marxist academic and activist
Happy Birthday Green Left Weekly .
You have always been so green , so left and so weekly .
Not like the Herald Sun that is n’t a herald or a sun .
Or the Age .
Ha !
What a joke .
I look forward to your 8,000,000th edition .

Green Left Weekly is the voice for the voiceless people .
Government and the media in general are not giving enough attention to the social justice issues .
GLW is our platform to get involved so we can write things at the grassroots and feel part of the global response .
Bashir Sawalha , Greens candidate for Lakemba , 2007 NSW elections
Australia , like the rest of the global community , continues to struggle with the financial crisis .
Most Northern governments — most notably the US — have simply chosen to prop up the existing system by pouring billions of dollars of public funds into the companies that have caused the problem in the first case .
Now , more than ever , we need a voice that talks about other possibilities .
Green Left Weekly does this .
It provides alternative views about other visions and other values .
And it supports the struggles which are working towards a world based on meeting people ’s needs rather than allowing the powerful to continue to chase profits at the expense of everyone else .
Cam Walker Friends of the Earth

Only those who know what it is like to each week produce an edition of a newspaper are able to comprehend what it feels like to reach issue number 800 .
And only those who take up the transcendental task of producing a newspaper that acts as weapon in the hands of activists would know the place occupied by the accumulated collective and individual efforts , removed from any profit motive and false prestige , that goes into every article .
Green Left Weekly has become a reference for all of us around the world who want to get news and analysis from the frontlines of the war between rich and poor .
Congratulations on your 800th capsule of rebellion .
Keep on giving voice to the voiceless !

The Australia West Papua Association ( Sydney ) congratulates Green Left Weekly on its 800th issue .
GLW has been a great supporter of the West Papuan people , publishing continuous updates on the situation in West Papua when the mainstream media have ignored it .
Congratulations and here ’s to the next 800 editions .
Joe Collins , AWPA ( Sydney ) Revolutionary greetings from Pakistan on Green Left Weekly ’s 800th issue !
It was back in 1997 , I first saw a copy of GLW that had landed in Labour Party Pakistan ( LPP ) offices .
Internet had not become fashionable yet .
Hence we would grab every opportunity to quench our thirst , as left activists , for fresh information , analysis and perspectives coming from left in the West .
Revolutionary greetings from Pakistan on800th issue !
It was back in 1997 , I first saw a copy ofthat had landed in Labour Party Pakistan ( LPP ) offices .
Internet had not become fashionable yet .
Hence we would grab every opportunity to quench our thirst , as left activists , for fresh information , analysis and perspectives coming from left in the West .
It was also the time we were learning to be more inclusive and increasingly getting repugnant to sectarian practices .
GLW proved a great help .
For next few years until internet made it easy , GLW was eagerly awaited at LPP offices .
Since many comrades could not read English , therefore , we would translate some of the articles to Urdu for the weekly Mazdoor Jeddojuhd ( Workers Struggle ) .
A copy of GLW was kept in record at Lahore - based central office , where three GLW copies were received by post , while another two were posted to Karachi and Hyderabad regional offices .
Meantime , owing to a growing LPP - DSP co-operation , different struggles in Pakistan started making regular headlines in GLW .
I myself , besides being a regular GLW reader , became an occasional contributor .
A decade on , this personal as well as party relationship has only strengthened .
Of all the alternative media outlets , GLW and the ESSF - website have been most generous to LPP .
Not merely LPP , GLW has been devoting space to Pakistan and often the Pakistan coverage in GLW is an example of quality journalism .
However , it is not merely the Pakistan - coverage that interests me or other LPP comrades .
From Indonesia and East Timor to Cuba and Venezuela , GLW reports on global events are keenly read in Pakistan like elsewhere in the world .
Personally , I eagerly devour the Cultural Dissent .
Seizing the opportunity to mark 800 issues of GLW , on behalf of the LPP , I would like to congratulate GLW staff for bringing an excellent newspaper every week to a wide range of activists worldwide .
Hats off to this dedication , commitment and professionalism .
Farooq Sulehria , Labour Party Pakistan member Congratulations to Green Left Weekly on your 800th issue .
Over the past five years , I have found GLW to be an invaluable source of news and information .
Your attention to international political developments in Asia , Latin America and the rest of the world is invaluable , while your coverage of politics and the class struggle in Australia is proving increasingly important for us to learn and draw inspiration from in Canada .
I am now a devoted subscriber to the print edition of GLW and encourage other international readers to do likewise .
Roger Annis , Socialist Voice , Vancouver , Canada
Congratulations on publication of the 800th edition of Green Left Weekly .
It is quite an achievement that you have been able to sustain such a high quality , comprehensive , reader - friendly vehicle for radical change .
It is a source of inspiration that on the other side of the world there is a paper that campaigns , as we do , to end the corporate bail - out and to make capital pay for its global economic crisis , that fights for eco-socialism and for the rights of indigenous peoples and oppressed nations , and that demands the immediate withdrawal of our imperialist armed forces from Afghanistan and other occupied lands .
Best wishes for the next 800 editions of GLW !
Barry Weisleder , federal secretary , Socialist Action / Ligue pour l’Action socialiste , Canadian state
Congratulations Green Left Weekly !
GLW has been a consistent voice in the alternate media for a long time , to great benefit to the community .
Refreshingly honest , always courageous , GLW is a voice that a jaded Australia needs to hear for many years to come .

Congratulations to all the brilliant people who have and are currently producing Green Left Weekly every week !
It is fantastic to see the GLW is going strong !
Sun Coverage Headlines from the Vegas gaming industry
Reader poll Should the ban on Internet gambling be overturned ?
Yes .
Overturn the ban and allow Internet gambling .
No .
Keep the ban and do n't allow Internet gambling .
View results
For a time , big American casinos were making noises about wanting to expand gambling in cyberspace , as a way to extend their brands .
And why not ?
The evidence was that Internet gambling sites actually boosted business for bricks - and - mortar casinos , especially poker rooms .
The Internet had nurtured a whole generation of new — and anonymous — poker players who wanted to prove their competitive skills at real tables where they could win fame and fortune .
But not everyone is on the bandwagon for Internet gambling legalization .
For years , members of the American Gaming Association , which lobbies on a federal level and has closely watched the debate over online gambling , have been split on the question .
The association ’s two largest members , Harrah ’s Entertainment and MGM Mirage , support some form of legalization .
Several members of the gaming association oppose the legalization and regulation of Web casinos , including Steve Wynn , who believes that Internet gambling ca n’t be adequately policed and could embarrass the industry .
As a result , the association has been forced to adopt a neutral position on the issue .
Many newspapers have published stories about people draining their life savings in casinos — a crisis many people can’t relate to because they either avoid casinos or view them as destinations for occasional excursions or well - deserved pleasure breaks .
But hidden from view are the gambling binges at home computers , a scarier prospect for many people — including politicians and regulators .
Harrah ’s , the most vocal supporter of Internet gambling in recent months , also stands to benefit the most from legalization .
Harrah ’s owns the World Series of Poker , a multiweek tournament in Las Vegas that has morphed into a global tournament franchise not unlike a major sports league .
Days before the 40th annual World Series of Poker kicked off in Las Vegas last month , Harrah ’s launched a subsidiary in Montreal to capitalize on the spread of Internet gambling .
Harrah ’s Interactive Entertainment , led by Mitch Garber , the former CEO of online gambling giant PartyGaming , aims to develop the World Series brand around the world and explore Internet gambling opportunities in Europe , where certain countries have legalized online betting operations or have n’t criminalized them .
Harrah ’s owns the largest customer list in the casino business , with millions of members .
Amid a recession , the company ’s Total Rewards database continues to grow through World Series of Poker - branded tournaments at casinos nationwide and World Series of Poker Europe in London , which attracts players from across Europe .
U.S. law prevents
Harrah ’s from recognizing poker players who win entry fees to the World Series through satellite tournaments offered by gambling Web sites .
The company ’s European tournament , sponsored by Betfair , a London - based online gambling company , has no such restrictions .
Through poker , Harrah ’s is amassing a global and enviable reach outpacing its peers .
Although many casino companies view state legalization efforts with equal parts excitement and trepidation , Harrah ’s has embraced expansion efforts in the United States and is the most aggressive proponent of casino gambling as a mainstream American pastime .
CEO Gary Loveman , who has expressed a desire to open as many casinos as the American population can support , is n’t representative of the American Gaming Association , much less the casino industry , with mostly small , local casinos .
Nor does Massachusetts Rep. Barney
Frank ’s bill to have the feds regulate Internet gambling , which Harrah ’s is backing , have broad support in Las Vegas .
Strip giant MGM
Mirage , for one , prefers to leave regulation up to state governments .
Small casino operators know that Internet gambling has boosted their poker business and could raise needed tax money if regulated .
They also realize the challenge of competing with a dominant brand like the World Series of Poker .
Mushrooms can be delicious , beautiful and even , well , " magical " .
But if tough times send you out to forage for food — beyond the nearest fast - food restaurant — be wary of some of nature 's more toxic temptations .
Whether mistakenly — or maliciously — used , mushrooms have claimed the lives of many , including the Roman emperor , Claudius , who is rumored to have been poisoned by a mushroom dish administered by his wife .
The death of Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI , which prompted the war of Austrian Succession , may also have resulted from feasting on foul fungi .
Although some toxic mushrooms , such as the false morels ( in the Gyromitra genus ) , are still prepared in traditional dishes , evidence is mounting that even in cooked form the meaty mushrooms are n't totally safe for consumption .
Even the deadliest mushrooms , including the aptly named death cap , are reported to taste pretty good , and symptoms often do n't appear for hours .
So as mycologists ( mushroom scholars ) everywhere warn : know your fungi .
Otherwise you may be in for a nasty — if not fatal — case of mycetism ( mushroom poisoning ) .
Nature photographer and author Taylor Lockwood shares photographs of some of the more deadly ' shrooms .
Slide Show : Seven Poisonous Mushrooms
WINNER , South Dakota ( CNN ) -- Neal Wanless , a down - on - his luck cowboy before winning a $ 232 million Powerball jackpot last month , was always known for his big heart even when he barely had a dime to his name .
Neal Wanless , winner of the $ 232 million lottery in South Dakota , shown here in a high school yearbook .
Now , with his good fortune , neighbors and former teachers worry that he might be easily separated from his new - found money , although he does n't seem to be around to give any of it away .
" I just hope he does n't get inundated , " his former English teacher Deana Brodkorb told CNN .
" He 's just such a nice guy and I hope he does n't get suckered . "
Flip through the yearbook at Todd County High School and the portrait emerges of the " good kid " that teachers and classmates remember .
Wanless ran cross-country , played in the band and graduated second in his class -- the 2004 Salutatorian .
Diane Linster , his math teacher , remembers Wanless coming early to school and staying late to pump up his grades .
" Just a very humble , kind and considerate kid , " Linster said .
Watch friends and neighbors describe the lucky cowboy »
Chris Leneaugh , once an assistant cross-county coach , remembers a dedication to running that propelled Wanless from the middle of the pack to near the front of the team by his senior year .
" Neal never gave up trying , " Leneaugh said .
" That 's what I liked about him , his dedication . "
The yearbook also tells the tale of a hat - wearing rancher who was one of a few white students in a school filled with Native Americans -- Lakota Sioux from the Rosebud Indian Reservation .
" Oh man , he was always cowboyed up , " said former classmate Mike Prue .
" We are all Natives around here and there he was with his Wrangler shirt and jeans .
He really stuck out . "
Prue and his buddy Steve Plank said Wanless would help them with their homework , despite the differences .
The story of the Wanless family is the story of a family doing muscle - aching work just to scratch out a living .
It 's the story of a family that needed a break .
Wanless and his parents had recently moved into a camper on their ranch , after losing their home to foreclosure , according to neighbor Erv Figert .
A sign with chipped off green lettering sits in the grass at the entrance to the Wanless property .
" There was a sign out there that said ' the ranch that God built , ' " said Joe Prue , father of Mike Prue .
" And for a while there you thought , where was God when everything was coming apart .
And now , maybe God helped them . "
Neighbors say they have not seen anyone come or go from the Wanless Ranch after Neal briefly emerged at a press conference last week to accept a giant - sized check from the May 27 drawing .
For now , the gate to the Wanless ranch is held tight by a new lock , linking a rusted - brown chain .
Rumors travel through the green fields of South Dakota faster than the Internet .
Talk is cheap with millions of dollars to loosen the tongues .
Many believe the Wanless family is going to buy a place up north , maybe by Pierre , but the cowboy with the big heart is n't talking .
" That grin you saw on his face on television ( when Wanless accepted the check ) is always there , " said Linster .
" He always looked like he was probably up to something . "
Now he has the money to do something about it .

Consumer prices in May posted their largest annual decline in 59 years , as the sharp drop in demand for goods continued to keep inflation in check .
The Labor Department said Wednesday its consumer - price index rose 0.1 % in May from April .
Compared to a year earlier , the CPI was down 1.3 % , the largest decline since 1950 .
Much of that decline ...
God bless Joan Walsh .
She finally did what I thought no one in the media was capable of doing :
She shoved Bill O'Reilly 's vicious words back in his face .
Or more correctly , she smacked him with the evil consequences of his reckless and irresponsible rhetoric , manifested in the case of Jim David Adkisson , the Knoxville shooter .
And rather than respond , he simply shut up .
If there had been more time , I expect he'd have cut her mike .
It was a thing of beauty .
Here are the lines Walsh , who was nastily attacked by O'Reilly the day before , delivered on - air last night on The O'Reilly Factor , to his face , that most of have wished someone would say someday :
Walsh :
And you routinely attack , you routinely attack , people on the left , Janeane Garofalo , Michael Moore , who you think their rhetoric leads potentially to acts of violence .
It never has led to one act of violence .
But you 've already driven that crazy guy in Knoxville last year who read your writings and then went and shot up a church and shot liberals , that 's already happened once , and you do n't feel any responsibility at all , now that it 's happened a second time , Bill ?
Talk about blood on your hands .
The best O'Reilly could muster :
O'Reilly : Miss Walsh , I appreciate you coming on the program .
I think everybody knows exactly where you 're coming from .
If you watch the video -- I 've included the entirety of his exchange with Walsh -- you can see that what led up to this was nine minutes of vintage O'Reilly : nasty , bullying , demanding quick answers to ridiculously leading questions .
It started reaching quite a pitch near the end :
Walsh :
And look , Bill , you crusaded against him , he had been shot twice already , his clinic had been exploded , his place had been attacked , bombed , vandalized -- O'Reilly : I 'm sorry about that .
I 'm sorry about that .
But my constitutional right says , I can say what I say , you can say what you say , as vile as you say it , you can say it , and I would never condemn you for saying it .
You are misguided , you have blood on your hands because you portrayed this man as a hero , when he killed late - term babies for casual reasons .
Now , that 's just bizarre :
He calls someone 's words " vile " and declares they have " blood on their hands " in the same breath in which he declares " I would never condemn you for saying it " .
Bill O'Reilly " would never condemn " someone for saying what they think ?
That 's perhaps the most outrageous lie , among a steady stream of them , that O'Reilly has ever uttered .
O'Reilly regularly , steadily , and remorselessly condemns people for saying what they think .
Garofalo and Moore are only the most frequent examples .
Hell , that 's what his entire show is predicated upon .
The reason his ambush crews are so problematic is that they hunt down and harass private citizens merely for saying things Bill O'Reilly does n't like .
I 've known Joan Walsh for many years , and have always thought well of her , despite some philosophical differences -- including , I 've thought , not showing enough toughness at times .
But after last night , all I can say is :
God bless Joan Walsh .
BTW , below the fold you can see the clip of Falafel Bill setting up this segment in his " Talking Points Memo " .
It is almost as nastily delusional as what follows :
Just to back up Walsh 's point : Below is an excerpt from the opening pages of my new book , The Eliminationists : How Hate Talk Radicalized the American Right :
In July of 2008 , a graying , mustachioed man from the Knoxville suburb of Powell , Tennessee , sat down and wrote out by hand a four - page manifesto describing his hatred of all things liberal and his belief that “ all liberals should be killed . ”
When he was done , Jim David Adkisson drove his little Ford Escape to the parking lot of the Tennessee Valley Unitarian Universalist Church in Knoxville .
A few days before , the church had attracted media attention for its efforts to open a local coffee shop for gays and lesbians .
Leaving the manifesto on the seat of the car , he walked inside the church carrying a guitar case stuffed with a shotgun and 76 rounds of ammunition .
The congregants were enjoying the opening scene from the church ’s production of the musical Annie Jr. when Adkisson , in a hallway outside the sanctuary , abruptly opened the guitar case , pulled out the shotgun , fired off a harmless round that startled everyone , then walked into the sanctuary and began firing indiscriminately .
Witnesses report he was saying “ hateful things . ”
An unsuspecting 61 - year - old grandmother and retired schoolteacher named Linda Kraeger was hit in the face with a shotgun blast .
A 60 - year - old foster father named Greg McKendry got up to shield others from the attack and was hit in the chest .
When Adkisson stopped to reload , a group of men , who had already begun closing around him , tackled him and wrested away his gun .
Adkisson complained that the men were hurting him .
" The only thing he said was he was asking us to get off of him , that he was n't doing anything , " said Jamie Parkey , one of the men who tackled him .
" We just looked at each other incredulously , like ' How dare you ? ' " Greg McKendry was dead at the scene .
Linda Kraeger died the next day .
Seven other congregants were wounded .
A detective who interviewed Adkisson and examined his four - page manifesto reported to his superiors that Adkisson targeted the church " because of its liberal teachings and his belief that all liberals should be killed because they were ruining the country , and that he felt that the Democrats had tied his country 's hands in the war on terror and they had ruined every institution in America with the aid of media outlets . "
When the detective interviewed Adkisson , he said he ’d decided that since " he could not get to the leaders of the liberal movement that he would then target those that had voted them in to office . "
Knoxville ’s police chief told reporters the next day that Adkisson was motivated by his " hatred of the liberal movement " and " liberals in general , as well as gays . "
He was also frustrated by his inability to get a job , a problem he also blamed on liberals .
His neighbors in Powell described Adkisson as “ a Confederate ” and a “ believer in the Old South . ”
When detectives went to Adkisson ’s home in Powell , they found — scattered among the ammunition , guns , and brass knuckles — books written by leading conservative pundits : Liberalism is a Mental Disorder by Michael Savage , Let Freedom Ring by Sean Hannity , and The O’Reilly Factor by Bill O’Reilly , among others .
Adkisson ’s manifesto , released some months later to the public , was in fact largely a distillation of these works , ranting about how “ Liberals have attack 'd every major institution that made America great .
…
Liberals are evil , they embrace the tenets of Karl Marx , they 're Marxist , socialist , communists . ”
And then he went the next logical step , in the logic of anger :
This was a symbolic killing .
Who I wanted to kill was every Democrat in the Senate & House , the 100 people in Bernard Goldberg 's book .
I 'd like to kill everyone in the mainstream media .
But I know those people were inaccessible to me .
I could n't get to the generals & high ranking officers of the Marxist movement so I went after the foot soldiers , the chickenshit liberals that vote in these traitorous people .
Someone had to get the ball rolling .
I volunteered .
I hope others do the same .
It 's the only way we can rid America of this cancerous pestilence . …
If decent patriotic Americans could vote 3 times in every election we could n't stem this tide of liberalism that 's destroying America .
Liberals are a pest like termites .
Millions of them .
Each little bite contributes to the downfall of this great Nation .
The only way we can rid ourselves of this evil is Kill them in the streets .
Kill them where they gather .
I 'd like to encourage other like minded people to do what I 've done .
If life aint worth living anymore do n't just Kill yourself , do something for your country before you go .
Go Kill Liberals .
The events that sunny Sunday left the church ’s pastor , Rev. Chris Buice , with a shattered congregation .
“ People were killed in the sanctuary of my church , which should be the holy place , the safe place .
People were injured , ” he told PBS ’s Rick Karr a couple of weeks later .
“ A man came in here , totally dehumanized us — members of our church were not human to him .
Where did he get that ?
Where did he get that sense that we were not human ? ”

Only after the thrill of picking out your new smart phone is over -- after you ’ve marveled at all the stylish new gadgetry and features , signed a service contract and finally laid your money down -- do you finally get a feel for the speed and reliability of the wireless service that connects your new phone .
That wireless service -- so often an afterthought to smart phone buyers -- is hugely important : it connects your new phone to all the fun and useful apps and services that made you lust after a smart phone in the first place .
The truth is , the 3G wireless networks of today are not perfect ( they are , collectively , a work in progress ) , and they are not all created equal .
Because independent research on these networks is very hard to come by , PC World took a single - day , real - world snapshot of the performance of the three biggest 3G networks in the U.S. – Verizon Wireless , AT&T and Sprint – using industry - accepted testing technology and techniques .
If there ’s a smart phone in your future , we hope to give you some idea of the wireless service that may be in store for you , beyond the anecdotal information you hear from other users , on the web and in the media , and aside from the claims made by the wireless service providers themselves .
Now for an important note before we start reviewing our results .
Wireless signal , by its nature , is extremely variable ; that is , many things , such as obstruction by fixed objects ( buildings , trees , etc. ) , weather , network load , cell tower locations , and time of day , can affect the quality of the signal .
These factors can cause service from a single wireless service to vary widely from day to day and from neighborhood to neighborhood .
Our results , taken together , provide a snapshot of the performance of the largest 3G networks in 13 major markets during March and early April .
But they are by no means exhaustive , and your own connection speeds may differ from ours .
Please tell us about your own experience here .
Results : Speed and Reliability Testing by City : Click on the chart thumbnail at left to see the detailed results of our testing in 13 cities .
The cities are listed in the left - most column ; from that column you can move rightward across the chart to read first Verizon's , then Sprint's , and then AT&T 's download and upload speed averages for each city .
The " reliability " score is the percentage of our tests in which the service maintained an uninterrupted connection at a reasonable speed ( faster than dial - up ) .
During March and early April , our testing partner , Novarum Inc. , used Ixia ixChariot testing software to measure network performance from more than twenty fixed locations in each of the following cities : Baltimore , Boston , Chicago , Denver , New Orleans , New York City , Orlando ( Florida ) , Phoenix , Portland ( Oregon ) , San Diego , San Francisco , San Jose , and Seattle .
In all , our testing partner ran 5443 individual tests from 283 testing locations .
At each location , Novarum measured download speed , upload speed , and reliability for each provider 's 3G service .
( See " How We Tested and What the Ratings Mean . " )

In Novarum 's tests for us , Verizon Wireless demonstrated a good mix of speed and reliability .
Across more than 20 testing locations in each of the 13 cities we tested , Verizon had an average download speed of 951 kbps .
Verizon demonstrated good reliability , too ; the network was available at a reasonable and uninterrupted speed in 89.8 percent of our tests .
Sprint 's 3G network delivered a solid connection in 90.5 percent of our 13 - city tests .
Sprint 's average download speed of 808 kbps across 13 cities was n't flashy ( at that speed , a 1MB file downloads in 10 seconds ) , but dependability is an important asset .
The Sprint network performed especially well , both in speed and in reliability , in our test cities in the western part of the United States .
The AT&T network 's 13 - city average download speed in our tests was 812 kbps .
Its average upload speed was 660 kbps .
Reliability was an issue in our experience of the AT&T system :
Our testers were able to make a connection at a reasonable , uninterrupted speed in only 68 percent of their tests .
Somewhat surprisingly , our testers also found that the " bars of service " readings on their phones were rarely an accurate predictor of the quality of the ensuing connection .
In most places and with most wireless providers , the " bars " did little more than indicate whether the phone had access to some service or to no service .

One person 's planter is another one 's potty
Lakemoor woman 's use of toilet for landscaping has neighbors , village up in arms
Lakemoor resident Tina Asmus has planters made from old toilets and has them displayed in her front yard .
It 's caused quite a stir in her neighborhood and she has been told by the village to remove them or pay a fine .
Lakemoor village officials and some neighbors are upset about the toilet planters in Tina Asmus ' front yard .
Lakemoor resident Tina Asmus has created flower planters from two old toilets and a sink and made them part of the landscaping in her front yard .
One person 's garbage can be another 's treasure , but can a commode be an " artsy planter " ?
Tina Asmus said the village of Lakemoor and some neighbors on Highland Drive are pushing her to remove the front yard " art piece planters " she created using a couple of old toilets and a pedestal sink .
" I 'm very creative , artsy and crafty in this regard and I like to find old things that I can recycle and repurpose , " she said .
" I saw a friend who made a planter out of an old toilet once and I loved it , so last year , I made one for myself . "
However , Mayor Todd Weihoffen said he stands behind police who have given Asmus 30 days to remove the toilets from her front yard .
Weihoffen , a plumber by trade , said all he sees on the front lawn of Asmus ' home are a couple of " old plumbing fixtures " that should be removed .
" I was elected mayor because voters want the town cleaned up , " he said .
" If I do not enforce the ordinances about this , then anyone with some junk in their yard can stick a flower on it and call it art . "
A quick Internet search will show making a planter out of a toilet is n't a new idea .
However , that carries no weight with village officials who say Asmus faces a fine of $ 25 to $ 500 starting June 15 if she does n't comply .
Asmus said she will not remove her " art pieces , " adding each toilet planter costs about $ 100 to make and holds an assortment of daisies , angel 's breath , lilies and other flowers .
" My yard is neat and clean and this definitely catches the eye of some people and makes them smile , " she said .
" It 's different .
I like different . "
The toilet planters have smiley faces on them , and one bears the words " I love my neighbors " .
Weihoffen said the writing was less complimentary - recently it said " Beware of neighbors " - and the front yard was n't as well - maintained when officers issued the compliance ticket .
" This yard has become manicured relatively quick , specifically since the media started calling , " he said .
Asmus argues her yard has always been well maintained .
She said has had the toilet planter for two years , and she likes it because it " makes people laugh . "
" I should be allowed to put out whatever kind of planter I want as long as it's not obscene , " she said .
" And , this is n't obscene . "

Advertisement A 23 - month - old Mexican child has died of swine flu in Texas - the first death from the virus outside Mexico , where it may have killed as many as 159 people .
The child - one of 91 cases of swine flu in the US - had been visiting relatives in Texas when he fell ill .
The World Health Organization said the virus was still spreading , even though it was now from person to person .
And Spain says it has confirmed the first case of swine flu in a person who has not travelled to Mexico .
CONFIRMED CASES Mexico : 159 suspected deaths - seven confirmed cases US : one death , at least 91 confirmed cases Canada : 13 confirmed cases UK : 5 confirmed cases Spain : 10 confirmed cases Germany , New Zealand : 3 confirmed cases each Israel : 2 confirmed cases Austria : 1 case
Mapping the outbreak
In pictures : Concerns grow Mexico :
First swine flu cases
The Mexican boy had arrived in the Texan border city of Brownsville on 4 April and developed flu symptoms four days later , the Texas Department of State Health Services said .
He was later transferred to a hospital in Houston , where he died on Monday night .
The cause of death was confirmed on Wednesday by Dr Richard Besser , acting director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
" Unfortunately this morning I do have to confirm that we have the first death of a child from H1N1 flu virus , " he told US TV channel CBS .
Speaking in Washington , President Obama offered his condolences and said the federal government was doing the utmost to contain the virus .
SYMPTOMS - WHAT TO DO
Swine flu symptoms are similar to those produced by ordinary seasonal flu - fever , cough , sore throat , body aches , chills and fatigue
If you have flu symptoms and recently visited affected areas of Mexico , you should seek medical advice
If you suspect you are infected , you should stay at home and take advice by telephone initially , in order to minimise the risk of infection

He also urged local public - health bodies to be vigilant and said schools with confirmed cases " should consider closing " .
Texas Governor Rick Perry said closing the US border with Mexico was an option , but added that taking that step now would be " a little premature " .
The assistant director general of the World Health Organization ( WHO ) , Keiji Fukuda , said that although the virus originated in pigs , it was now being transmitted from human to human .
" It is clear that the virus is spreading and we do n't see evidence of it slowing down , " he told reporters from WHO headquarters in Geneva .
He added that moving the pandemic alert to five - the second highest - from the current four would be a significant step , but was not necessary at the moment .
He said the WHO would do so if infected people in at least two countries were spreading the disease to other people in a sustained way .
Closed schools
The WHO has said measures like travel bans were unlikely to prove effective .
France will ask the European Union on Thursday to suspend all flights going to Mexico because of the flu outbreak , Health Minister Roselyne Bachelot said .
From Matthew Price in Oaxaca , Mexico
At the local cemetery , a group of gravediggers pointed me towards a freshly dug plot .
The flowers on top had wilted under the sun but still had some colour .
Here was the grave of the first confirmed victim of the virus , Adela Gutierrez , 39 .
One of the gravediggers , Sergio Castro Lopez , told me people here are worried .
They are waiting for the authorities to tell them what they should do .
In Spain , the government said the first person to contract swine flu without having travelled to Mexico was the boyfriend of a young woman who had recently returned from there .
Spanish Health Minister Trinidad Jimenez said such cases were to be expected .
In total , the number of confirmed cased in Spain rose from two to 10 on Wednesday .
None of them are seriously ill .
In Mexico , the search for the source of the outbreak continues , with the focus on the vicinity of a pig farm in the eastern part of the country .
The Mexican government is urging against jumping to conclusions and is suggesting the possibility remains that the virus originated outside the country .
Schools across Mexico have closed , public gatherings are restricted and archaeological sites have been placed off - limits .
Mexico City 's chamber of commerce estimated restrictions in the city were costing businesses there at least 777 million pesos ( $ 57 m or £ 39 m ) a day .

Police target ' innocent ' youths for arrest in bid to increase DNA samples on database
Target : Youths '
DNA is being taken and stored in case they commit crimes
Youths with no criminal record are being targeted for arrest so their DNA can be logged on a database in the event they commit crimes .
A total of 386 under - 18s had their DNA taken and stored by police last year in one north London borough - more than one a day .
An experience officer working for the Metropolitan Police admitted the DNA was being stored as part of a ' long - term crime prevention strategy ' .
The officer said : ' We are often told that we have just one chance to get that DNA sample and if we miss it then that might mean a rape or a murder goes unsolved in the future . '
He added : ' Have we got targets for young people who have not been arrested yet ?
The answer is yes .
' But we are not just waiting outside schools to pick them up , we are acting on intelligence .
' If you know you have had your DNA taken and it is on a database then you will think twice about committing burglary for a living .
Already this year some 169 under - 18s have had their profiles uploaded . '
The officer , who asked not to be named , made the astonishing admission after a Freedom of Information request reveal the startling figures in Camden in London .
LibDem parliamentary candidate for Holborn and St Pancras , Jo Shaw , obtained the figures and was shocked at the findings .
Ms Shaw said : ' Storing the DNA of innocent people as young as 10 is unlikely to solve Camden 's crime problems , but is a costly way of stigmatising young people .
' If you 're innocent , you should n't have your data kept for years .
DNA samples , which are taken by police after an arrest is made , are turned into a number known as a profile and are kept on a national database indefinitely . '
Camden 's representative at the national Youth Parliament , Axel Landin , said : ' Building a catalogue of people they think will be prominent criminals in the future sounds like a renegade justice system .
' Someone who is not convicted of a crime is no more guilty in the eyes of the law than someone who has never been investigated so their DNA should be destroyed .
Chief Inspector Sean Wilson , of Camden Police , said : ' The DNA database is a nationwide one .
' Legislation governing the recording and retention of DNA is fully adhered to by Camden Police . '
New Government proposals state that youngsters who have only been arrested once for minor offences and been found not guilty will have their DNA profiles destroyed when they reach 18 .
When Regular Tennis Becomes Too Freakin ' Boring
Fireball tennis is the perfect answer to all those who find themselves thinking that regular tennis is too boring .
Basically , you take a medium paced game , and you crank it up with fire ( and incidentally , these instructions work well for almost anything ) .
YouTube features several videos of young teens endangering their tennis rackets , but I liked this one the best because they were actually both decent nighttime flaming tennis players .

Mario Lemieux Sure Can Throw A Stanley Cup Party
Having won two of his own during his playing years with the Pittsburgh Penguins , Mario Lemieux is no stranger to Stanley Cup victory parties .
Unfortunately some of the current
Pens may be , so Mario decided to show them what its all about .
At his unbelievable mansion in Siwickley , Pa , Lemieux threw a party for the team and judging by the pics it looks as though it was one hell of a time .
How many people can say they have swam with the Stanley Cup ?
The players as well as family and friends showed up at the bosses place to celebrate the victory and among the pictures which have surfaced are some with players and family in the pool with the Cup , a great view of the mansion and Mario ’s wine cellar .
After winning the NHL ’s coveted trophy on Friday , the Pens have since hoisted it on the bus from Detroit to Pittsburgh , show it off ( among other things ) at their hometown parade , and now this .
We also hear that due to Crosby ’s request , there was no reception line .
Here are the pics from the party .

At the Cincinnati-Northern Kentucky International Airport , passengers are so scarce that a long - term parking lot will soon be turned into temporary housing for 900 horses attending equestrian games in the nearby bluegrass countryside .
It is an apt image  going from air power to horse power  for the troubles that airports are face these days : too few passengers , too few flights , too little revenue .
And to deal with these setbacks they have come up with a solution : cut every capital project they can .
Terminals that were on the drawing boards are now off .
Ditto for new gates , taxiways , roads and lights , as airport executives put a stop to billions of dollars in modernization projects that are now seen as unneeded and unaffordable .
“ It ’s a matter of waiting until passenger levels kick up again , ” said Sean Broderick , a spokesman for the American Association of Airport Executives .
“ Airports are really stuck .
They are cutting back like any other business .
They are in survival mode while still trying to keep an eye on the future . ”
Judge Says Miami Cat Killings Suspect Poses No Danger to Community Tyler Weinman , 18 , implicated in gruesome cat killings , can go home .
June 17 , 2009  --
The Miami teen accused of brutally killing nearly two dozen cats can be released on bail because he poses no danger to himself or the community , a judge ruled Wednesday .
The teen , Tyler Weinman , 18 , has been charged with 19 counts of animal cruelty , four counts of burglary and 19 counts of improper disposing of an animal body .
Judge John Thornton ordered Weinman released after a brief hearing , the Associated Press reported .
His bond , which was set at $ 249,500 , was posted Tuesday .
The judge had previously ordered a pschiatric evaluation for the suspect .
Weinman , who appeared in a Miami - Dade County courtroom in a red , jail - issued uniform , will wear an electronic monitoring bracelet while he awaits his trial and will be allowed to attend counseling sessions that were recommended by a doctor after a court - ordered psychiatric evaluation , according to the AP .
" He is competent to proceed and does not , at this time , appear to be at risk of harming himself or others , " Thornton said .
According to Terry Chavez , a representative from the Miami District Attorney 's Office , Weinman could face a sentence of up to 158 years in jail .
Chavez would n't comment on any of the case 's details , but she confirmed that local crime stoppers helped tip police to Weinman 's alleged involvement in the killings .
Attempts by ABC News to reach Weinman 's attorney for comment were unsuccessful .
Neighbors and police have said the cats were beaten , skinned or sliced open .
Cutler Bay , Fla. , resident Mary Lou Shad , whose 2 - year - old cat was among Weinman 's alleged victims , said Sunday she was relieved to hear of the arrest .
" It 's made me feel safe again , " she told ABCNews.com .
" At least now I can drive around without looking for dead cats . "
Shad 's husband , Thomas Shad , found Miss Kitty , a stray that the couple had come to care for as a pet , in a neighbor 's backyard after she did n't show up for breakfast one morning .
" Her head was smashed in .
Her head was crushed , " Thomas Shad told ABCNews.com last month .
" And her back legs were skinned . "
Miss Kitty 's gruesome killing was just one of the 33 horrific cat deaths that have upset residents in neighboring upscale Miami - area towns in the last month .
While mourning the loss of their pets , many of which were considered members of the family , some wondered if humans could have been the next target .
Mary Lou
Shad said she does not know the Weinman family , but her husband 's boss does .
She told ABCNews.com that Weinman 's parents are divorced , and the teen splits his time between his mother 's house in Cutler Bay and his father 's house in Palmetto Bay , Fla .
Dead cats were found in both towns .
Shad said she thought all along that the killings were the work of a teenager because , " I think that an older person would have acted out much sooner . "
Weinman 's parents did not return messages seeking comment .
According to WPLG , police had issued multiple arrest warrants for suspects , but did not say how many .
Until police say all possible suspects are in custody , Shad said she and her husband will continue to keep their two other cats safely indoors .
At a press conference Sunday , Miami - Dade State Attorney Katherine Fernandez Rundle acknowledged that residents have been on edge for weeks now .
" I sincerely hope that with his arrest the residents will feel relieved and their cats will be safe once again , " she said .
" It is expected that the vicious crimes that have plagued these communities will not be repeated . "
Fear Grew as Cat Deaths Mounted
While the killings started in Cutler Bay , some of the more recent deaths have been in neighboring Palmetto Bay .
That 's where the Gleason family is mourning the loss of their cat Tommy , who was found in the family 's front yard on Memorial Day .
Donna Gleason said Tommy appeared on the family doorstep a year and a half ago , shortly after the Gleasons decided to get a cat for their young daughter .
Tommy was just what they were looking for -- good with both kids and dogs .
Tommy would sleep in and around the house during the day , Gleason said , and roam the neighborhood at night , always making it back in time for breakfast and to play with her daughter , now 6 years old .
That Monday morning , as her husband Ron Gleason worked in the garage , a neighbor came over to tell him that Tommy was dead in the Gleason 's front yard .
" His stomach was ripped open , " his intestines were on the lawn and he had been partially skinned , Donna Gleason said .
" I did n't see it .
I did n't want to see it . "
The Gleasons , having heard about the rash of cat killings , called the police who sent three detectives out to take photographs and collect Tommy 's body .
They told their daughter that Tommy was killed by another animal .
" She does n't need to know there are evil people like that in the world , " Donna Gleason said .
" It 's hard enough for me to deal with . "

Of the hundreds of boys ages 14 to 21 interviewed about male virginity , twenty - eight percent claimed they were after giving their virginity to a girl they discovered did not care about them .
The girls only wanted sex or the bragging rights to claim they had bagged a virgin , a trend by girls called " V Card collecting . "
One boy reported self - mutilating for a year trying to resolve his feelings of regret .
A few boys reported they lost their virginity when intoxicated to girls who mistook their body 's normal arousal reactions as consent .
The boys had negative emotions after the event .

If you are still a virgin at 21 you are considered a weirdo , " claimed a young man from Australia .
A young man from the United States claimed , " Girls and society do n't understand male virginity .
It 's the least discussed topic .
It 's taboo . "
Fathers often tell me the boys who feel bad after losing their virginity are whiners , sissies or homosexuals .
It is no wonder they suffer in silence .
It 's time to break the taboo about male virginity so boys can talk about the topic without ridicule .
Talk to your son while he is still a virgin .
The birds and bees talk can be embarrassing but it 's important that parents take an active role in teaching their children about sex .
Sex from school systems , the internet , peer groups and trial and error is n't enough for our sons or our daughters .
Parents should talk about emotions and sex , not just the actual biology of the act .
When we reduce boys to just their plumbing , we diminish them as human beings .
SOUTH BEND , Indiana ( Reuters ) - President Barack Obama urged both sides in the abortion debate on Sunday to pursue a “ fair - minded ” discussion as he sought to quell a firestorm over his invitation to speak at Notre Dame , a premier U.S. Catholic university .

Notre Dame ’s decision to confer an honorary degree on Obama and invite him to be the keynote speaker for the commencement sparked petitions and several days of protests .
Some students vowed to boycott the commencement .
But the speech itself drew mostly cheers , applause and standing ovations .
Critics who said Obama ’s support for abortion rights violated Catholic Church doctrine had sought to have the invitation rescinded but the university refused .
Interrupted at times by hecklers , Obama said he recognized the strong emotions stirred up by the abortion debate but he urged the two sides to try to find common ground , such as preventing unintended pregnancies .
“ I do not suggest that the debate surrounding abortion can or should go away , ” Obama said .
“ Each side will continue to make its case to the public with passion and conviction .
But surely we can do so without reducing those with differing views to caricature . ”
“ Let us work together to reduce the number of women seeking abortions .
Let ’s reduce unintended pregnancies .
Let ’s make adoption more available .
Let ’s provide care and support for women who do carry their child to term , ” Obama told the crowd of 12,000 at a huge athletic facility .
His appearance was mostly warmly welcomed by the crowd , which gave him several standing ovations .
SOME HECKLERS
But at a few points during the speech , he was interrupted by hecklers , including one who shouted , “ Abortion is murder . ”
That heckler was booed by the audience .
Some graduates displayed a print of a cross symbol and two baby feet on their caps while others wore caps that said “ Viva Obama . ”
Outside the commencement , hundreds of protesters gathered and carried signs that said “ Notre Dame supports violence ” and “ Thou shall not kill . ”
As Obama spoke , protesters chanted outside the arena entrance : “ One , two , three , four .
Throw Obama out the door . ”
At least 22 protesters were arrested after they walked past a piece of yellow police tape they had been told not to cross , according to police .
Norma McCorvey , the Jane Roe of the landmark Roe vs .
Wade case that legalized abortion , was among the first protesters arrested at Notre Dame .
A Catholic convert , McCorvey is now active in the anti-abortion .
Tony Ughetti , of Spring , Texas , said he watched as McCorvey asked the officers , “ How do I get arrested ? ”
Ughetti said that in response to the Notre Dame decision to invite Obama , he got rid of books , T - shirts and other Notre Dame memorabilia in his home .
“ We disposed of over 40 Notre Dame items from our house ... I wanted to burn them but my wife took them to Goodwill ( charity ) .
Our house is now Notre Dame - free , ” he said .
A smaller group of those outside were there in support of Obama ’s visit .
Carrying a sign reading “ Welcome President Obama , ” Bill Dillon , of South Bend , said he thought Obama was being treated unfairly .
“ I do n’t think they should call Obama a murderer , ” said Dillon , a 1951 graduate in aeronautical engineering .
Catholics are the largest single denomination in the United States , making up nearly a quarter of the population .
More than half of the adult population is Protestant but that is split among many denominations .
Many Catholics agreed with the university ’s decision to invite Obama to speak at the commencement , according to a poll by the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life .
Fifty percent of those in the poll agreed with the university ’s invitation to Obama while 28 percent opposed it .
The rest were undecided or had no opinion .
What Happened to Single Payer ?
Created : June 11 , 2009 11:46 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
Rep. John Conyers ( D - Mich . ) ( WDCpix )
As Congress dives head first into what has fast become a thorny debate over health care reform , the key Democrats in the discussion have insisted that all options remain on the table .
All , that is , except one .
Illustration by : Matt Mahurin
Universal , single - payer health care — the idea that the government will cover everyone ’s medical bills using taxpayer dollars — was dismissed by leading Democrats long before any details of their reform plans have been finalized .
In the Senate Finance Committee , for example , a series of health reform discussions this year included input from academics , retirees , health insurers and other industry representatives , but no single - payer advocates were invited .
Last month , the White House ’s top health official told lawmakers that President Obama rejects the model altogether .
The dismissals have confounded supporters of the single - payer system , who contend it ’s the only strategy that ensures universal access to care while minimizing expenses within a health system where costs are skyrocketing .
“ Attempting to reconcile the dual imperatives of universal coverage and cost control through alternative methods besides single payer is an exercise in futility , ” Walter Tsou , advisor to Physicians for a National Health Program , told lawmakers Wednesday during a hearing of the House Education and Labor Committee ’s health subpanel .
“ When some congressional leaders declare that single payer is off the table , they are in effect saying that insurers will be protected , leaving the pain to patients , taxpayers and health care providers . ”
The debate over the single - payer option highlights the difficulty facing the young White House and other Democratic leaders as they prepare to tackle health reforms this year .
Quite aside from the cost concerns associated with the overhaul — and separate from the lobbying dollars that are pouring into Washington from the many medical industries — there ’s also the ideologically driven fight over what a sound health care system looks like .
From the right , Democratic leaders are being blasted with charges of too much government involvement .
From the left , the same leaders are being attacked for not going far enough to provide government help .
Somewhere in that mix , they ’ve got to produce a proposal that can get 60 votes through the Senate .
Many observers say that doing away with private insurers , as the single - payer model would — even if it ’s done in the name of better , expanded health care — is simply too radical a concept to push through Congress .
Outside of Washington , the concern might focus on whether health care is available and affordable .
But on Capitol Hill , the debate is emerging as an ideological battle — one pitting free - marketers against government interventionists .
“ Creating a new , one - size - fits - all health care system modeled on Medicare is a recipe for disaster , ” said Rep. John Kline ( R - Minn . ) , the senior Republican on the health subpanel .
“ It would ration care while empowering bureaucrats . ”
Not that the public is opposed to the idea .
A December 2007 poll conducted by Yahoo and the Associated Press found that 65 percent of respondents thought that the country “ should adopt a universal health insurance program in which everyone is covered under a program like Medicare that is run by the government and financed by taxpayers . ”
Citing that and similar polls , Rep. John Conyers ( D - Mich . ) wondered aloud Wednesday why Democratic leaders have been so quick to dismiss the single - payer option .
“ If you take the most popular health care reform measure and take it off the table , ” Conyers said , “ heaven knows what it is … you think you ’re left with . ”
Conyers has introduced legislation that would offer health care to everyone , paid by the government but privately administered .
In the upper chamber , Sen. Bernie Sanders ( I - Vt. ) has introduced a similar proposal .
Both lawmakers argue that private insurers , who have a fiduciary duty to shareholders , are the wrong folks to dictate who receives what care when .
“ The function of a private health insurance company is not to provide health care ; it is to deny health care , ” Sanders said last week .
“ Every dollar of premium that a health insurance company does not spend on health care needs is a dollar more in profits . ”
But the Democrats drafting the party ’s health reform proposal have other things in mind .
On Wednesday , Rep. Frank Pallone ( D - N.J. ) , who chairs the House Energy and Commerce health subpanel , conceded the system is broken and requires an overhaul .
But the reforms , he added , should build on the existing systems — Medicare , Medicaid and employer sponsorship of private plans — that have taken decades to evolve .
The single - payer model , Pallone said in an interview , “ is off the table . ”
Much of the reason stems from the declination of the White House to get behind the concept .
On the campaign trail last year , President Barack Obama conceded that single - payer might be the best idea out there , but adopting it right away , he said , would cause too much disruption to “ a whole system of institutions that have been set up . ”
Last month , Kathleen Sebelius , the newly installed head of the Health and Human Services Department , told House lawmakers that the single - payer model “ is not something that the president supports . ”
Instead , party leaders intend to revamp the system by piling reforms onto the institutions that already exist , including a continued emphasis on employer - sponsored coverage and a continued reliance on private insurance companies to pay for care .
Many Democrats , including Obama , are also hoping to include the option of a government - sponsored insurance plan that would compete with private companies .
Even that concept , however , has drawn intense fire from across the aisle .
Rep. Tom Price ( R - Ga. ) , an orthopedic surgeon who heads the conservative Republican Study Committee , said during Wednesday ’s hearing that the right to have access to government funded health care “ is a right to get in line . ”
“ Choices are always limited by government intervention , ” Price said .
On Wednesday , Price and other free - marketers found a powerful ally when the American Medical Association , the nation ’s largest doctors ’ group , came out against any public plan option at all .
“ The introduction of a new public plan threatens to restrict patient choice by driving out private insurers , which currently provide coverage for nearly 70 percent of Americans , ” AMA wrote in comments submitted to the Finance Committee .
Yet that argument does n’t go over well with many other health care professionals , who say they ’ve grown tired of haggling with private insurers over whether certain services for certain patients should be covered .
“ The current system rations care based on an ability to pay , ” Geri Jenkins , co-president of the California Nurses Association and National Nurses Organizing Committee , told lawmakers Wednesday .

IN “ KNIGHT RIDER ” , a 1980s television show , Michael Knight fought for justice with the help of KITT , an artificially intelligent Pontiac Trans Am .
The pair chatted amiably , with KITT sensing and reacting to nearby objects , navigating and looking up information about Mr Knight 's immediate surroundings and deadly adversaries .
KITT could even drive itself .
Thirty years on , many of the fantastical Pontiac 's features are becoming reality .
A modern car can have as many as 200 on - board sensors , measuring everything from tyre pressure to windscreen temperature .
A high - end Lexus contains 67 microprocessors , and even the world 's cheapest car , the Tata Nano , has a dozen .
Voice - driven satellite navigation is routinely used by millions of people .
Radar - equipped cruise control allows vehicles to adjust their speed automatically in traffic .
Some cars can even park themselves .
Once a purely mechanical device , the car is going digital .
“ Connected cars ” , which sport links to navigation satellites and communications networks — and , before long , directly to other vehicles — could transform driving , preventing motorists from getting lost , stuck in traffic or involved in accidents .
And connectivity can improve entertainment and productivity for both driver and passengers — an attractive proposition given that Americans , for example , spend 45 hours a month in their cars on average .
There is also scope for new business models built around connected cars , from dynamic insurance and road pricing to car pooling and location - based advertising .
“ We can stop looking at a car as one system , ” says Rahul Mangharam , an engineer at the University of Pennsylvania , “ and look at it as a node in a network . ”
It started with a satnav
The best known connected - car technology is satellite navigation , which uses the global - positioning system ( GPS ) in conjunction with a database of roads to provide directions and find points of interest .
In America there were fewer than 3 m navigational devices on the road in 2005 , nearly half of which were built in to vehicles .
But built - in systems tend to be expensive , are not extensible , and may quickly be out of date .
So drivers have been taking matters into their own hands : of the more than 33 m units on the road today , nearly 90 % are portable , sitting on the dashboard or stuck to the windscreen .
Many consumers are now adding internet connectivity to their cars in the form of another portable device : the “ smart ” phone .
A two - way internet link allows for more elaborate forms of navigation , and also makes it possible to gather and aggregate information from large numbers of vehicles , notes Dev Khare of Venrock , a Silicon Valley venture - capital firm that is investing in connected - car technology .
Examples of such aggregation include Openstreetmap , a project to create open - source maps by collecting GPS data from users as they drive about , and Trapster , a constantly updated database of the locations of police speed traps , compiled from reports sent in by users of the software .

Inrix , a provider of traffic data based in Seattle , has based its business model on this approach .
It combines information from static sensors in the road with GPS information collected wirelessly from more than 1 m fleet vehicles to provide real - time information about traffic flows .
This information is piped in turn to navigation devices and smart - phones , in order to adjust a delivery route in response to an accident , for example .
The company can also forecast traffic flows on a particular route at a particular time and date .
Information specific to individual cars can also present new opportunities .
Some insurers , for example , offer dynamic insurance schemes that use GPS to determine a driver 's premiums , based on distance travelled , driving style and where the car is driven and parked .
Similarly , the ability to treat a car as a node on a network is shaking up the idea of car ownership itself .
Zipcar , the largest car - sharing scheme , shares 6,000 vehicles between 275,000 drivers in London and parts of North America — nearly half of all car - sharers worldwide .
Its model depends on an assortment of in - car technology .
“ This is the first large - scale introduction of the connected car , ” claims Scott Griffith , the firm 's chief executive .
Zipcar 's available vehicles report their positions to a control centre so that members of the scheme can find nearby vehicles through a web or phone interface .
Cars are unlocked by holding a card , containing a wireless chip , up against the windscreen .
Integrating cars and back - office systems via wireless links allows Zipcar to repackage cars as a flexible transport service .
Each vehicle operated by Zipcar is equivalent to taking 20 cars off the road , says Mr Griffith , and an average Zipcar member saves more than $ 5,000 dollars a year compared with owning a car .
Vehicle shall speak unto vehicle
The next step is to enable cars to communicate with each other via vehicle - to - vehicle ( V2V ) networks , and with infrastructure such as toll gates and traffic lights via vehicle - to - infrastructure ( V2I ) links .
A new wireless standard called Dedicated Short Range Communication ( DSRC ) — a sort of Wi-Fi for cars — provides high - speed data connections over distances of up to 200 m , and safety and emergency communications at lower speeds over distances of up to a kilometre from one vehicle to another , and between vehicles and roadside transmitters .
So far the technology is mainly used in electronic toll booths , but it has many other potential applications .
DSRC could be used , for example , to warn nearby cars of sudden braking or an airbag deployment , thereby alerting cars out of visual range and preventing or limiting accidents .
It could be used to set up ad hoc networks to pass data between cars in order to , for example , signal icy spots on the road ( many cars can detect ice as part of their skid - control systems ) or co-ordinate “ platoons ” — groups of vehicles travelling closely together under automatic control .
Other proposed uses include signalling the approach of emergency vehicles and ensuring that traffic lights give priority to buses and emergency vehicles .
V2V features depend on a network effect — the technology is useless to a driver who is the only one using it — but a network could emerge surprisingly quickly .
Dr Mangharam says his simulations and on - road tests in Pittsburgh , carried out in conjunction with the research arm of General Motors , have shown that V2V networking has benefits when as few as 3 - 5 % of cars are equipped to exchange just four pieces of data — position , speed , direction and time — with other vehicles in the vicinity .
As these drivers respond to their enhanced awareness , they influence the overall flow of traffic , benefiting everyone .
Dr Mangharam reckons this level of adoption is at least a decade away .
The prospects for adoption of new V2I technology , beyond road tolls , seem to be greatest in Japan , where researchers have been testing traffic signals that use video - cameras and infra-red beacons to communicate with approaching cars .
Such systems can guide drivers into particular lanes as they approach a junction to ensure a smooth flow of traffic or allow emergency vehicles to pass , greatly improving safety .
The Japanese government plans to deploy the system more broadly from 2010 , in co-ordination with local carmakers , who will provide the necessary in - car technology in new models .
Such co-operation is lacking elsewhere , where carmakers are understandably reluctant to add new features to cars if the necessary infrastructure is not being built by local transport authorities .
“ It is a chicken and egg problem , ” says Dr Mangharam , who estimates it would take $ 4.5 billion to upgrade every traffic light and junction in America with smart infrastructure .
Commercial vehicles may get the ball rolling first .
Connected - vehicle technology is being considered for roadside inspections , freight tracking , road - condition notifications , parking management and enforcing rules on drivers ' working hours .
And adoption of the technology could be mandated by governments , as in the case of Germany 's Toll Collect system , a dynamic road - tolling system for lorries of 12 tonnes or over that has been operating since late 2004 .
Toll Collect uses a combination of satellite positioning , roadside sensors and a mobile - phone data connection to work out how much to charge each user .
Over 900,000 vehicles are now registered with the scheme and there are plans to extend this approach to road - tolling across Europe from 2012 .
Eventually it may also be extended to ordinary cars .
Communication breakdown
Will drivers welcome this ?
Driving already involves a high degree of trust : people who do not know one another routinely engage in life - or - death co-operation .
That trust , and the cues that engender it , may not translate into a V2V system , where a malicious or malfunctioning signal could snarl traffic or cause a pile - up .
Another problem is privacy .
Cars are closely associated with the notion of personal freedom , even if the reality often involves bumper - to - bumper agony .
The use of GPS and roadside sensors to track vehicles and monitor how fast they are moving is already unpopular and controversial in some quarters .
Yet if the benefits are palpable , drivers will be prepared to place their trust in connected car networks , and even to give up some privacy .
Early adopters of dynamic car - insurance schemes , for example , tend to be safer drivers who pay lower premiums in return for allowing insurers to track them .
Connected - car technology could help drivers find parking spaces , avoid traffic and prevent accidents .
“ By 2045 it will be impossible for a driver to impact another vehicle or drive off the road without the serious intention of doing so , ” says Scott McCormick of the Connected Vehicle Association , an industry group established to promote the technology .
Violating traffic rules could also become impossible — getting away with it certainly will be .
So why drive at all ?
Researchers at several universities have built autonomous cars to complete an urban - driving challenge set by the American armed forces in 2007 .
Some of the technology is already in production cars : Toyota 's Lane - Keeping Assist , for example , could easily do much of the driving on long stretches of highway , but the firm requires drivers keep their hands on the wheel — for now .
A team led by Alberto Broggi at the University of Parma has built an autonomous car that will be set loose this summer to navigate Italian urban traffic by itself — a formidable test .
And Sven Beiker , the director of Stanford University 's CarLab , says automatic driving in some situations , such as stop - and - go traffic or smooth motorway driving , could be reliable enough for general use in a decade .
KITT would be proud .
The Worlds Most Beautiful Castles
There was a time when tall stone walls and ramparts were needed for protection from invading armies , lifestyles have changed have n’t they ?
Fortunately , as you can see in these stuningly vivid castle pictures below , some have survived for decades and are standing today , a reminder of how life used to be .
Castle Caerlaverock
Caerlaverock Castle is a triangular moated castle dating back to the 13th century located south of Dumfries in the south west of Scotland .
John de Maccuswell , deceased in 1241 , was first Lord Maxwell of Caerlaverock and its proximity to the English border resulted in its being sieged several times , most notably by Edward I of England .
Interesting fact : Caerlaverock was defended vigorously though defeated .
Upon surrendering it was found that only 60 men had kept the entire English army at bay for a prolonged period of time , a testament to its design .
Castle Dunluce
Dunluce Castle was first built in the 1200s by Richard de Burgh , the Earl of Ulsterand , and is a medieval castle located in County Antrim , Northern Ireland .
Dunluce castle is only accessible via bridge from the mainland because it sits atop a bassalt outcropping with extremely steep sides , perfect for defence .
Interesting fact :
In the 1600s the kitchen area , next to the cliff face , collapsed into the sea and it is rumored that only one small kitchenboy survived because he was sitting in the corner that did n’t fall in .
Castle Babelsberg
Babelsberg Castle , considered the main castle in Park Babelsberg but only one of several , is located in Germany and was originally built as a small summer palace for Prince William of Prussia circa 1800s .
It later served as a paleontology museum from 1966 until the end of the Cold War .
Today the location is part of the Potsdam World Heritage Site .
Interesting fact :
It survived world war II without much damage only to fall into disrepair during the cold war era .
It is being restored to it ’s 19th century glory .
Castle Beaumaris
Beaumaris Castle was built in Beaumaris , on the island of Anglesey , begining in 1295 for King Edward I by Master James of St George however it was never finished .
The castle was the last of several castles built in the area designed to defend the royal home .
Its design is of the double wall concept where the outer walls house an inside building which is effectively a very defendable castle unto it ’s own .
With 14 layers of defense Beaumaris Castle is considered near perfect .
Interesting fact : A “ Gate - next - sea ” protected a tidal dock that allowed ships to dock with the castle for re-supply .
Castle Eilean Donan
Eilean Donan Castle was built as a defence for Alexander II from attacks by the vikings in 1220 .
In 1719 the castle was destroyed by three royal navy frigates after the castle had fallen into spanish hands and was then re-built , 200 years later , by Lt. Col.
John MacRae - Gilstrap .
Interesting fact : Eilean Donan castle has appeared in several movies including Highlander ( 1985 ) , Loch Ness ( 1996 ) and Elizabeth : The Golden Age ( 2007 ) .
Castle Mespelbrunn
Mespelbrunn Castle was built between Frankfurt and Würzburg Germany in 1412 by Echter of Mespelbrunn .
The castle is of medieval moated design with romanesque – renaissance style .
Interesting fact : Mespelbrunn Castle was one of the locations in the film The Spessart Inn – 1958 , which is based on a fairy tale by Wilhelm Hauff .
Castle Heemstede
Heemstede castle was completed in 1286 on the spaarne river by Dirk van Hoylede in the province of North Holland , Netherlands .
It has been built , burned down and rebuilt several times over the centuries and it was last torn down in 1810 , after years of neglect .
Today it is a restaurant .
[ image source : ( Erik ) ]
Interesting fact : Families in the area often moved away during hot summer months to avoid canal fever from the putrid local canals .
Castle Werfen
Werfen Castle , aka Hohenwerfen castle , was built near Salzburg Austria during the 11th century by wealthy archbishops in order to protect the city .
Today you can tour this beautiful fortress in the Salzachtal and visit the weapons room museum and a renovated prince ’s room .
Interesting fact :
The worlds largest glacial caves are nearby and also open to tourism but you ’ll have to brave the steepest cableway in Austria to reach them .
Edinburgh Castle
Castle Edinburgh dates back to the 9th century bc although nothing of it remains from that period .
It is now Scotlands second most visited tourist attractions and it towers over the city of Edinburgh from it ’s location on Castle Rock mountain .
The castle has seen a lot of military activity over the years and still houses a garrison of soldiers albeit mostly for ceremonial purposes .
Perhaps it ’s most notable change of hands occured in 1314 when Robert the Bruce hand picked 30 men to re-capture it from King Edward I of England by climbing the north precipice at night and catching it ’s defenders off guard .
The re-take was successful but Robert the Bruce ordered it ’s defences immediately destroyed to prevent further capture .
Castle Matsumoto
Matsumoto Castle , also known as Fukashi Castle , is located within the city of Matsumoto in Nagano Prefecture and can be dated back to the warring states period circa 1504 .
Matsumoto Castle is a short travel from Tokyo Japan and is sometimes called the ‘ crow castle ’ by tourists because of its dark color and wing - like roofline .
I ’m not up to speed on the extensive history of the area , I wish I was , but if you are please share your historical information in a comment below .
Interesting fact :
In 1872 Matsumoto Castle was sold at auction which rendered it vulnerable to being dismantled but it was spared that fate and is now a National Treasure of Japan .
Editor 's note : Gloria Borger is a senior political analyst for CNN , appearing regularly on CNN's " The Situation Room , " " Campbell Brown , " " AC360° " and " State of the Union With John King , " as well as special event coverage .
Jenny Sanford did not stand beside her husband when he publicly admitted to having an affair .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
After years of watching those wives stand ( sadly ) by their men , there was something refreshing -- and real -- about Jenny Sanford 's decision to be far , far away from the governor 's apology tour .
After all , what would she have done when he rambled on and on about his love of his " adventure trips " on the Appalachian Trail when , it turns out , he was n't hiking ?
And would she have had to sweetly smile as her husband paid homage to her as a terrific " campaign manager " ?
And what affect would she have had to adopt when the governor spoke about " that whole sparking thing " -- his peculiar way of describing how an e-mail relationship developed into something else ?
The accepted political guidelines for jilted wives ( see : wives , jilted ) have always decreed that the wounded ones be seen , but stay silent .
They are the suffering partners willing to literally remain in the picture out of political necessity .
Their very presence helps to suggest that this love is worth saving , because this man is so special -- to all of us .
Well , forget it .
In just one week , Jenny Sanford has shifted the paradigm of the political wife .
Faced with infidelity , she did not stand by her man -- literally or in any other way .
She did not try to soft - pedal the reality of his behavior .
In other words , she did not make his life any easier .
Instead , she told the truth .
First , in a statement , she let it be known that when she discovered the affair , she tried to work on the marriage .
At the point where it was clear that was n't working -- and " I felt it was important to look my sons in the eyes and maintain my dignity " -- she threw Sanford out .
That 's why , she explained , she did n't know where he was when the state -- and the nation -- was playing " Where 's Waldo ? " starring Mark Sanford .
But she was n't consumed with revenge , either .
In fact , her written statement made it clear she still loved her errant husband and , remarkably , remained " willing to forgive Mark completely for his indiscretions " if he gets his act together .
Then came the interviews -- in a car as she left her house , or in a brief sit - down with The Associated Press .
That was where we learned this almost unbelievable tidbit : that the lovesick governor had repeatedly asked her permission to visit his mistress .
( Can we presume to try to break it off ? )
This needs to be stated again :
He asked his wife for permission to visit his lover .
As if he expected his wife to say , " Sure , honey , go right ahead " ?
She did n't .
As she told the AP , " It 's one thing to forgive adultery ; it 's another thing to condone it . "
So he went anyway , as Jenny Sanford tells us .
She has no idea whether he has ended the affair , as he had promised .
" I believe he has , " she said .
" But he was down there for five days .
I saw him yesterday , and he is not staying here . "
As for the governor , he 's too preoccupied with his own personal journey as a vulnerable , emotionally wrought male to actually tell the full truth about what happened .
Apologies abound , but the fact that he has decided to try to remain as governor makes the truth harder to spill .
Instead of seeing himself as a philanderer , he has now decided to cast himself more grandly -- as David in the ultimate battle of his political life .
Jenny Sanford has n't chosen a literary allusion to define her predicament .
She prefers to see herself as she truly is : the mother of four sons , just trying to survive this mess with some dignity and honesty .
Alone .
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Gloria Borger .
All About Jenny Sanford • Mark Sanford • Marriage
Has the economy turned a corner ?
One big enough to justify the gross overuse of the term greens shoots ?
Doubtful .
And despite pleas from the cliche - swamped masses , media continues to bombard us with this overly - optimistic ( and early ) catch - phrase .
Exhibit A : Just today Forbes published an article called The Street Eases , But Green Shoots Abound .
Really ?
They abound ?
Call me skeptical .
I think this post at ZeroHedge provides a more realistic picture .
It argues that those Green Shoots are more like Venus Fly Traps .
I ’ve expanded the metaphor further , to a nastier plant : Audrey II , the man-eating crooner from Little Shop of Horrors .
Why so skeptical ?
Because there is only one thing propping this market up – government intervention .
And the scale of it is awe - inspiring .
Bailouts have been arranged ( directly or otherwise ) for banks , commercial real estate , homebuilders , automakers , and insurers .
What would happen if the Gov withdrew their support ?
Zerohedge sums it up well :
The problem is that despite what Bernanke is saying right now , that he does n’t view government stakes in banks as long - term propositions , there is really no way to extricate the government without suffering the kinds of economic tremors on par with the Lehman collapse .
Roubini : We Ca n’t Subsidize the Banks Forever
A new WSJ piece by Nouriel Roubini and Matthew Richardson shines more light on the issue .
It ’s an absolute must - read .
Among other things , they out - gloom the IMF ’s recently - doubled loss estimates with their own :
the International Monetary Fund has just released a study of estimated losses on U.S. loans and securities .
It was very bleak — $ 2.7 trillion , double the estimated losses of six months ago .
Our estimates at RGE Monitor are even higher , at $ 3.6 trillion , implying that the financial system is currently near insolvency in the aggregate .
But Roubini was n’t featured by mainstream media outlets today , despite his solid track - record .
CNBC and others were laser - focused on pumping Ben Appleseed ’s message that “ All will be better in Q4 ( unless something bad happens ) , and gosh , look at all those Pretty Green Shoots ! ”
Bernanke ’s track record should give pause to anyone tempted to listen .
Messrs Roubini and Richardson also highlight the fallacy of these so - called Stress Tests :
For example , the first quarter ’s unemployment rate of 8.1 % is higher than the regulators ’ “ worst case ” scenario of 7.9 % for this same period .
At the rate of job losses in the U.S. today , we will surpass a 10.3 % unemployment rate this year — the stress test ’s worst possible scenario for 2010 .
Why is the Fed so wrong , so often ?
By now it should be obvious that we ca n’t trust predictions made by the Fed or Government .
It ’s clear that Greenspan and his Reserve blazed the trail to bubbledom , and that Bernanke is following along wholeheartedly .
But why ?
I see 3 possibilities :
They are simply academics in over - their - head , reliant on faulty models and trusting of crooked bankers
They understand the problem , but think deceiving the public is a necessary evil , in order to provide a “ soft landing ”
They are doing everything their power to rescue their buddies , and they justify this to themselves in any way that makes at the time
But their intentions really do n’t really matter , for now .
We should focus on their actions , which only prolong and exacerbate the inevitable pain .
Many amateur investors , who tend to buy high and sell low , are destroying their portfolios because of the extreme volatility we ’ve experienced .
This volatility is largely due to government intervention , and possible manipulation via proxies in equity markets .
What ’s really sprouting up ?
Moral hazards , like weeds .
We ’re creating a new financial system , one more dependent on the government than ever .
Banks and others can start taking ridiculous risks again , assured that the ol ’ reliable taxpayer will bail them out if anything goes wrong .
Weaning the market off the taxpayer - teet will be extremely difficult .
My only advice is to stay flexible , and prepare yourself for various outcomes : inflation , deflation , stagflation .
It all depends on the whims of the Federal Reserve and Government , and the politicians that ( kind of ) watch over them .
I see bigtime - inflation as the most likely outcome , by far .
But who knows ?
My beliefs regarding inflation are largely based on the writings of Bill Fleckenstein , who is fond of saying , “ In a Social Democracy with a Fiat Currency , All Roads Lead to Inflation . ”
His message has become more emphatic as the Fed has gotten more radical and increased quantitative easing .
I ’ve read the deflation arguments , and they do n’t make sense to me , other than in the near - term .
How to prepare for possibly nasty inflation ?
Precious metals and cheap stocks with good cashflow , among others .
I ’ll go into this more in upcoming posts .
This one has already dragged on too long .

UK Health Secretary Andy Burnham has said it is " a sad day " after the BNP won its first seat in the European Parliament .
He said Labour would work to address why voters chose the BNP , " and try to win these people back " , before adding that voters in Burnley rejected the party after seeing them in power .
A large internet service provider said data for as many as 100,000 websites was destroyed by attackers who targeted a zero - day vulnerability in a widely - used virtualization application .
Technicians at UK - based Vaserv.com were still scrambling to recover data on Monday evening UK time , more than 24 hours after unknown hackers were able to gain root access to the company 's system , Rus Foster , the company 's director told The Register .
He said the attackers were able to penetrate his servers by exploiting a critical vulnerability in HyperVM , a virtualization application made by a company called LXLabs .
" We were hit by a zero - day exploit " in version 2.0.7992 of the application , he said .
" I 've heard from other people they 've been hit by the same thing . "
Foster said he 's been unable to reach anyone at LXLabs to discuss the suspected vulnerability .
The Register has also received no response to inquiries sent to the company , which according to its website is located in Bangalore .
According to Foster , data for about half of the websites hosted on Vaserv was destroyed all at once sometime Sunday evening , shortly after administrators noticed " strangeness " on the system .
The attackers had the ability to execute sensitive Unix commands on the system , including " rm - rf , " which forces a recursive delete of all files .
Some 50 percent of Vaserv 's customers signed up for unmanaged service , which does n't include data backup , Foster said .
It remains unclear of those website owners will ever be able to retrieve their lost data , he said .
As a result , at least half the websites that were hosted on the site remain offline .
" Since last night , I 've had probably 40 phone calls from clients saying ' Why is my website down , ' " said Daniel Voyce , a web developer for Nu Order Webs who uses Vaserv to host customer sites .
" It 's making me look bad . "
Voyce said the hackers , given the high level of server access they gained , were likely able to intercept a wealth of sensitive data stored on Vaserv 's servers .
Voyce said his customers are safe because all sensitive information was encrypted .
Little is known about the people who attacked the site .
So far , there are no known reports of individuals taking credit for the hack .
The breach was likely the result of a SQL injection attack that penetrated Vaserv 's central management software and removed vital binaries and data for about half of all user data stored by the service , Foster said .
" This was n't someone randomly scanning things , " he said .
" It was a deliberate attack on our infrastructure . "
Vaserv specializes in low - cost web hosting using VPS , or virtualized private servers .
Virtualization features in LXLabs ' HyperVM helped Vaserv provide the service , which costs a fraction of the price of dedicated server hosting .
It remains unclear how other webhosts using the HyperVM have been affected .
If you 're aware of other providers affected by this reported vulnerability , please contact the reporter at the link above . ®
Does it matter that this is an idea with a known , recent history of failure ?
Or that human beings have no intention of paying for news they 've always received for free ?
Does it matter that we already know a return to the paywall - era of the early 2000s will cost these legacy media companies money they will never recoup ?
No , no and no .
The issue is “ paid content . ”
That 's the generic term .
I consider it a euphemism for an entire suite of frustrations and furies that have been boiling out of my former profession since its once - invincible business model began its final slide to the deep in 2008 .
On the surface , paid content is the reasonable idea that people should have to pay for the professionally produced content they consume .
Its core , however , is a post-rational demand that consumers abandon their habits of the past decade in favor of new behaviors intended to restore media companies to the profitability ordained to them by God Almighty .
I think I 'll remember last week as the moment when I finally knew , with a certainty approaching fatigue , that the newspaper industry – the business and passion that both shaped and warped me over the past 20 years – had chosen ritual suicide .
The choice appears grimly reached and irrevocable .
There has been no shortage of writing debunking this , but what of it ?
The audience that counts in this case – media company executives – decided this future sometime earlier this spring .
All that remains now are the details and marketing terms : “ Paywalls ” are out ; “ Pay Windows ” are in .
The wall must be easy to use , but it must also be “ permeable . ”
And so on .
Confused ?
Do n't be .
Your newspaper overlords believe they can sell you their content if they can just get everybody on the same page and nail the sales pitch this time .
They 're looking for the magic words , not the underlying logic ( the tricky part ?
Doing all this without breaking federal anti-trust law ) .
This is folly , of course .
Even MIT Technology Review Editor and Publisher Justin Jason Pontin concluded that news and opinion must be given away to the aggregators , and that was in an essay advancing the case for paid content .
Pontin comes from the magazine field , which suffers from similar woes but is a fundamentally different beast than the general bundling machine we call the American metro newspaper .
All sorts of content can be sold online quite profitably ( you can read my thoughts on this here and here ) , but trying to force people to pay for generic news content because your advertising rates have dropped so low they no longer cover the cost of your operations ?
Have fun selling that one , boys .
And sell it they are .
This spring and early summer has been a continuous parade of naked emperors and specious arguments .
There 's the Cable TV argument .
The iTunes argument .
They 've argued the Watchdog Case and the Piracy Case .
And as the combined knowledge of the network ground each of these quickly down to dust , the salespeople moved on to the next one .
Did the " blame the bloggers " approach flop ?
OK : Blame Google .
The worst argument I 've heard so far came from Walter Isaacson , the former editor of TIME who got this party started in February with his cover story “ How to Save Your Newspaper . ”
His paid - content call rallied the panicked executives who are presiding over the cascading failure of our industry , yet as Isaacson addressed the crowd at the “ From Gatekeepers to Infovalets ” conference on May 27th , he seemed almost apologetic :
We can't sell much of our content , he said .
We 'll have to do it wisely .
Isaacson is n't a stupid man .
He sounded to me as much a prisoner of his words as their author .
But here 's the terrible argument I mentioned :
In contending that the paid - content movement was not so much about revenue per se , Isaacson used this alternate rationalization :
Paid content models are necessary “ to protect creativity . ”
That 's a pretty stunning statement , even in the favorable context of trying to save an industry in which people are compensated by middlemen for their published work .
And so when I got my turn at the mic , I rose and asked him :
What profit margins will these paid - content models have to generate in order to protect creativity ?
Isaacson never responded to that question , unless you call staring at me with a horrified expression a response .
Instead , Merrill Brown , a senior strategist at paywall - startup Journalism Online LLC , rose in his defense .
It 's not about a profit margin , he said ... and ... well ... then he said some other things ( you can watch it here , although I do n't know that listening would lead to a more accurate paraphrase ) .
He did eventually concede that stockholders might have certain profit expectations .
Yes .
Expectations like 20 and 30 percent profits .
So can we finally , finally call this thing what it is ?
Quality journalism is expensive , and to the extent that it provides a public good , we will find ways to fund it .
But top - heavy , poorly run , arrogant - to - the - bitter - end media companies ?
This is their crisis , not our crisis , and it certainly is n't about journalism .
In other words :
If Isaacson wants to join us in protecting and expanding creativity and quality , welcome aboard , Walter !
Because we can do THAT for an awful lot less than what it 's going to cost to bail out our brain - dead media companies on behalf of shareholders and executives .
Like a lot of my compatriots , I started studying new media options with the intention of saving newspapers , not destroying them .
As recently as last week , in my secret thoughts I doubted my dire conclusions .
These are enormous , powerful companies , representing billions of dollars of assets .
They would survive .
They had to .
But clearly they do n't .
In choosing to go backward instead of forward into the now , these leaders are sealing their fates .
My wife , upon hearing my news from the conference , predicted the companies that go all - in on paywalls will be out of business within six months of their implementation .
I do n't think that 's rash ( although , to be clear : I do n't think ALL these companies will go into bankruptcy , and I stand by my prediction that the " unique nationals " have an interesting future , despite the fact that The NY Times is helping pull the paid - content bandwagon ) ..
Consider InDenver Times :
The online - only startup launched with a plan to fund its operations via 50,000 paid subscriptions .
They got 3,000 .
That 's 6 percent of their goal .
It 's actually worse than that .
Newspapers that are turning to paywall plans today are gambling on a risky revenue stream that even the experts are n't predicting will provide a replacement to their lost advertising revenues ( their biggest financial problem is the rapid decline in advertising rates , not the slow decline in print circulation ) .
It 's a " well , we 've got to do SOMETHING " solution , not a logical , do - the - math solution .
And since since most media companies are owned by shareholders , the resulting loss of confidence could be catastrophic .
What will these media executives do when that reality hits them ?
When these debt - burdened chains , stripped of journalistic talent by a decade of profiteering , their web traffic reduced by 60 percent by their paid - content follies , their pockets emptied by the cost of the proprietary paywall systems offered by Journalism Online LLC and other opportunistic vendors , what will they do ?
Will they buck up and go back out into the fray with fresh ideas and leadership ?
Or will they fold , casting bitter eulogies to their own imagined glories as they exit the stage ?
The chances of them adapting well to another failure are dubious .
Remember , these are the same people who have acted as if there were no other options , even when those options were practically gift - wrapped for them .
As if Newspaper Next never happened .
As if commerce hubs and C3 and all the interesting , exciting ideas that are practically everywhere today do not exist .
They do n't get it .
They do n't want to get it .
And in many cases , they 're literally paid not to get it .
America 's journalism infrastructure – from corporate giants to non-profit foundations like the American Press Institute and the Newspaper Association of America – is funded by dying companies .
So when you hear about efforts to save newspapers ( and , by extension , journalism ) , understand that answers that do n't return the possibility of double - digit profits and perpetual top - down control are n't even considered answers .
They 're not even considered .
They 'll do anything to survive ... so long as it does n't involve change .
Consequently , for many companies the alternatives to paywalls are no longer options because it's too late in the day .
But maybe I 'm looking at this wrong .
Maybe paid content is good for journalism because it 's going to hasten the fall of this terrible system .
It 's going to create a vacuum in which innovators will be able to make a difference .
Maybe the best thing these old media companies can do today is fail quickly .
This was their choice , not ours .
Wave to them as they leave , and try to remember what they once were , not what they 've become .

The Ultimate Commodore 64 Talk
Talk Outline :
The video was referred to us by an Anonymous viewer using the "
" form .
This is the video of the presentation titled " " given by Michael Steil at the 25th Chaos Communication Congress .
Retrocomputing is cool as never before .
People play C64 games in emulators and listen to SID music , but few people know much about the C64 architecture .
This talk attempts to communicate " everything about the C64 " to the listener , including its internals and quirks , as well as the tricks that have been used in the demoscene , trying to revive the spirit of times when programmers counted clock cycles and hardware limitations were seen as a challenge .
The Commodore 64 was released in 1982 as an entry - and hobby - level machine competing against the Atari 8 bit series and the Apple II .
Compared to other systems on the market , it had a lot of RAM ( 64 KB ) , and very sophisticated video and audio hardware .
While it was quickly forgotten in the US , it reached its peak in the late 80s in Europe , being a very affordable hobby and game computer .
Being the longest running computer of all time , being produced for 12 years , programmers understood the hardware very well , and continued finding new tricks how to create even better graphics effects .
" AGSP " for example , a very sophisticated trick that makes it possible to arbitrarily scroll " multicolor bitmaps " , e.g. for platform games , was n't used in games until about 1993 .
This talk explains all the hardware details of the C64 :
The programming model of the 6502 CPU family , the Complex Interface Adapters ( CIA ) , the Sound Interface Device , and the programming details as well as common ticks involving the Video Interface Controller ( VIC - II ) .
The disk interface will be discussed just as well as the design of the 1541 drive .
The listener will get a good understanding of 8 bit programming and creative programming on extremely limited hardware , as well as common tricks that can be generalized to other systems .
Python Programming , news on the Voidspace Python Projects and all things techie .
New in unittest : Test Discovery and the load_tests protocol for Python 2.7 and 3.2
A feature that has long been missing from unittest , is automatic test discovery .
This alone is a major reason why people move to alternative frameworks like nose and py.test .
Test discovery is now in unittest , but it missed version 3.1 of Python ( which is now at release candidate ) and will be in versions 2.7 & 3.2 .
Automatic test discovery is where you do n't need to provide your own test collection machinery , but have a tool that can automatically find and run all the tests in a project .
So long as your tests are compatible with the new test discovery ( see below ) you can now do :
python -m unittest discover
This will find all the test files that match the default pattern ( ' test *. py ' ) and run all the tests they contain .
It also has a customization hook called load_tests which enables you to customize which tests are loaded and run .
This test discovery is not as sophisticated as the discovery in nose or py.test , but it is a good start and will be sufficient for many projects .
The system is as follows ...
Discovery from the command line takes three optional parameters ( plus the - v switch to run tests verbosely ) which can be passed in by position or by keyword .
The parameters are the directory to start discovery ( defaults to the current directory ) , the pattern for matching test modules ( defaults to ' test *. py ' ) and the top - level directory of your project ( defaults to whatever the start directory is ) :
python -m unittest discover myproject / tests / '* test.py ' myproject / python -m unittest discover -s myproject / tests / - p '* test. py ' -t myproject / python -m unittest discover - v - p '* test.py '
All your tests must be importable from the top level directory of your project ( they must live in Python packages ) .
The start directory is then recursively searched for files and packages that match the pattern you pass in .
Tests are loaded from matching modules , and all tests run .
Discovery is implemented in the TestLoader class as the discover method .
It delegates to loadTestsFromModule to load all tests after discovering and importing all modules that match the pattern provided .
The actual signature is :
TestLoader().discover(start_directory , pattern='test*.py ' , top_level_dir=None )
The customization hook is implemented in loadTestsFromModule and is available to all systems that uses the standard loader , not just during discovery .
Iff a test module defines a load_tests function then loadTestsFromModule will call this function with loader , tests , None .
This should return a suite .
An example ' do nothing ' implementation of load_tests for a test module would be :
def load_tests ( loader , tests , pattern ) :
return tests
One use case would be to exclude certain TestCase subclasses from being used ( if they are abstract base classes for other tests ) during a test run .
If a package directory name matches the pattern you pass into discovery and the __init__.py contains a load_tests function then it will be called with loader , tests , pattern .
No further discovery will be done into the package , but because it is passed the pattern as an argument it is free to continue discovery itself .
A do nothing load_tests for a package is :
def load_tests ( loader , tests , pattern ) :
if pattern is None :
return tests
suite = TestSuite ( )
suite .
addTests ( tests )
this_dir = os .
path .
dirname ( os . path .
abspath ( __file__ ) )
suite .
addTests ( loader .
discover ( this_dir , pattern ) )
return suite
The loader stores the top level directory it was originally called with specifically for this use case .
load_tests should not pass in a new top level directory to the existing loader but create a new loader if it wants to do this .
Discovery does not follow the __path__ attribute of packages / modules and only looks at the filesystem .
Both the load_tests protocol and test discovery are useful new features in unittest .
I expect test discovery in particular to mature , but it is definitely already usable .
The implementation uses os .relpath ; so the current trunk version of unittest .py can only run on Python 2.6 or more recent .
At some point I 'll backport it to work with Python 2.5 / 2.4 .
New in unittest : Other Minor Changes
There are a couple of other minor improvements to unittest that I have n't already mentioned .
The TestResult class has two new methods : startTestRun and stopTestRun .
These are called , unsurprisingly , at the start and end of the test run .
A common way to create a custom test framework is to use a subclass of TextTestRunner which uses a custom TestResult class .
You do this by overriding the _makeResult method :
class TestRunner ( TextTestRunner ) :
def _makeResult ( self ) :
return CustomTestResult ( self .
stream , self .
descriptions , self .
verbosity )
I 've documented this .
The addition of startTestRun and stopTestRun makes creating custom test result objects ( for example which push results to a database whilst the tests are running ) easier - and it is my intention to write up better documentation on building test infrastructure with unittest as this whole area is woefully under - documented .
Another minor change is that TestSuite now only accesses its tests by iterating over itself .
This enables you to do lazy generation of tests where the tests are created when the suite is iterated over ; another customization point .
Many of the current crop of changes to unittest were done with help and input from Robert Collins and Jonathan Lange .
New in unittest : Cleaning up resources with addCleanup
One of the new features in unittest for Python 2.7 / 3.1 is better support for resource deallocation through cleanup functions .
This is n't a new idea , it 's something that is already in use in the Bazaar , Twisted and Zope test frameworks .
A standard technique for allocating resources ( creating temporary files or listening on a socket for example ) needed during a test is to allocate them in the setUp method and deallocate them in the tearDown method .
Whether the test passes or fails the tearDown method is run ; however an exception in the setUp method means that neither the test nor tearDown are run .
If you need to allocate multiple resources inside setUp , or need to do the same inside the body of the test , then you need to manually track them and in the event of failure only deallocate the ones that were successfully allocated :
def setUp ( self ) :
try :
self .
resource1 = create_resource1 ( )
try :
self .
resource2 = create_resource2 ( )
except :
self .
resource2 . close ( )
raise
except :
self .
resource1 . close ( )
raise
( If you do something similar inside the body of the test you use try ... finally instead of try ... except .)
Cleanup functions provide a cleaner approach to resource allocation .
Once you have created a resource you call addCleanup with the function that deallocates this .
After tearDown , or in event of an exception being raised inside setUp , all the cleanup functions are executed in the reverse order that they were added ( LIFO ) .
The above example becomes :
def setUp ( self ) :
self .
resource1 = create_resource1 ( )
self .
addCleanup ( self .
resource1 . close )
self .
resource2 = create_resource2 ( )
self .
addCleanup ( self .
resource2 . close )
Cleanup functions can themselves call addCleanups if they need to , and if you ever need to execute all the cleanups you can call doCleanups ( ) ( for example you want to call it manually at the start of tearDown ) .
This is n't just useful for inside setUp , but is also for tests themselves .
In some cases it can be a useful alternative to setUp and tearDown .
New in unittest in Python 2.7 and 3.1 : Better Command Line Features
One of the things I 've been working on over the last few weeks is the Python unittest module .
By virtue of having been included in the standard library for many years unittest is the most widely used Python testing framework .
In Python 2.7 and Python 3.1 / 3.2 it has had some much overdue attention , with several new features added and some of them by me .
I 've already blogged about the new assert methods , in the next few blog entries I 'll catalogue the other changes I 've been involved in .
Note
It looks like the command line improvements actually appeared too late to make it into Python 3.1 and will be in Python 3.2 instead - along with test discovery .
The normal way of making your test files individually executable with unittest is to include the following code at the end of the file :
if __name__ == ' __main__ ' :
unittest . main ( )
This enables the tests in the file to be run from the command line :
python test_something .py
What I did n't know was that you could actually pass the name of a test suite , test class or individual test .
You can also pass the ' - v ' flag to run the tests in verbose mode ( printing individual test names to stdout as they are run ) :
python test_something .
py -v TestClass python test_something .
py -v TestClass.test_method
Now that Python standard library modules can be run from the command line with the -m command line option we can do better .
With unittest in Python 2.7 and Python 3.1 you will be able to specify a test module , class or individual test at the command line :
python -m unittest -v test_something python -m unittest test_something .
TestClass.test_method
This removes the need for the final two lines in your test modules if you do n't want them there .
You can use this to run tests from multiple modules :
python -m unittest -v test_something test_something_else
By default main calls sys.exit once it has finished running tests , which makes it inconvenient to use from the interactive interpreter .
It now takes two new optional parameters , one to switch off the automatic exit and one to run the tests in verbose mode :
>>> from unittest import main >>> main ( module='test_something ' , exit=False , verbosity=2 )
If exit is False then main returns an object whose result attribute is the TestResult instance used during the test run .
You can introspect this if you want more information about the test run .

" I 'll go along with the charade
Until I can think my way out
I know it was all a big joke
Whatever it was all about "
- Bob Dylan , " Tight Connection To My Heart "
Whatever one may think about the so - called " War On Terror " , there are certain stories that both boggle the mind and dramatically highlight just how ridiculous this War Without End really is .
One such recent story concerned the release of yet another innocent man , Mohamed el - Gharani , from America 's notorious gulag down there in Guantanamo Bay .
Now , sadly , the release of an innocent man from Guantanamo is hardly a rare or unique occurrence , but this case , as you 'll see , was particularly disturbing .
As I 'm sure just about everyone 's well aware by now , the vast majority of those who have been locked up at Gitmo over the years have not , in fact , been the sinister terrorists we were initially led to believe and , as a result , most have now been freed ; including , most recently , those Uighurs who had been held at Gitmo for seven long years for the " crime " of resisting the occupation of their homeland ... by China !
The fact remains that of the 775 detainees that have been held at Gitmo over the years , most were either completely innocent or nothing more than small - time low - level fighters .
Hardly the " most dangerous terrorists in the world " that Bush , Cheney , Rumsfeld and their ilk assured us were being held there since the camp 's inception back in early - 2002 .
In fact , the Americans have , so far , released nearly 450 of these " Oops , sorry , we actually had the wrong guy , you can go home now " " terrorists " without charge .
And , as Lawrence B. Wilkerson , an ex-Bush Administration official , recently admitted , many of the remaining prisoners still held at Gitmo are also innocent .
So , in the face of all this , the release of yet another man who should never have been locked up in the first place is hardly news , but what makes this story of special interest is that Mohamed el - Gharani was just 14 years old when they locked him up back in October 2001 .
Yes , that 's right , a 14 - year - old was imprisoned for seven and a half years at Gitmo .
Aside from the natural response of WTF ?! , the question remains , why ?
Did the American military really see this guy as a threat to the Free World , to Western Civilization as we know it ?
Did they think he might have been capable of , say , wiping out New York City with a suitcase nuke ?
Or was he , perhaps , going to take out an entire platoon of American soldiers single - handedly ?
Or were they just concerned that he might illegally download some Britney Spears CDs and DVDs ?
Who knows ?
But the fact remains that they locked up a 14 - year - old kid for seven years at Guantanamo Bay as one of the " worst of the worst terrorists " and if that does n't say something about this ridiculous " War On Terror " then I do n't know what does .
What I do know for sure is that he's now back home in Chad and the Department of Homeland Security 's scary Color - Coded Terrorist Threat Thingamajig has n't been upgraded even one scary shade of fear since his release .
The 11 - Year - Old Terrorist
The sad thing is that this Mohamed el - Gharani kid was n't the only child locked up in this Kafkaesque netherworld known as Gitmo .
Back in 2004
I wrote about the sad , pathetic case of The 11 - and 12 - Year - Old Terrorists held there for two long years .
That 's right , people , they at one time even had pre-teens locked up at Guantanamo Bay .
Does it get any more pathetic than that ?
I think not .
Now this - locking up pre-teens and teens indefinitely in a military prison camp - is something you 'd expect China , North Korea , Burma or , even , Iran to do .
But not America .
Actually , I 'm guessing that even the Chinese would consider it a ridiculous waste of valuable space to lock up pre-teens in their gulags , though they might be reconsidering this now that they 've seen that the Americans think it 's such a good idea .
Iran , Texan Hick , and Obama
As for Iran , the brutal crackdown on protestors that 's been taking place over there over the past two weeks is , sadly , exactly what you 'd expect from such a regime .
But , without sounding too naive and simple - minded , you really expect more from America than torture , indefinite detention without trial and holding children incommunicado in military prison camps for years at a time .
It 's one thing for this kid to have remained locked up all these years under Texan Hick and His Sidekick Dick , but how the hell did he remain incarcerated for five more months under the Obama regime ?
Why was n't he immediately released when Obama came to power ?
That 's what I want to know .
After all , back in January a US court had ordered his freedom after ruling that there was no evidence to prove he was an " enemy combatant " .
But , nevertheless , he remained locked up until earlier this month .
But , hey , what 's an extra five months when you 've already unjustly incarcerated someone for seven years ?
Omar Khadr and Canada 's Confounding Complicity
Which brings us , once again , to the sad case of Canada 's very own Omar Khadr , the 15 - year - old Canadian kid the Americans locked up back in 2002 and still hold today .
It seems that Khadr is now not only the last remaining Western prisoner being held at Gitmo , but he 's also the lone remaining child soldier .
That the Americans , even under Obama , are so caught up in their ridiculous " War On Terror " that they can't see the senselessness , pointlessness and immorality of locking up children is bad enough , but that the Canadian government refuses to even try and have Khadr brought back home is beyond comprehension .
Child Soldiers
Does anyone actually think the world is a safer place by locking up 11 - to 15 - year - olds in a fucking gulag ?
I 'm guessing probably not .
So , how is it that Khadr and , until a couple of weeks ago , el - Gharani have remained there all these years ?
The bizarre thing is we - rightfully - see kids in Africa who have been dragged into wars in places like Sierra Leone , Ivory Coast and Uganda as victims of war .
And we , understandably , support their rehabilitation in camps run by the U.N. and other agencies .
Many of these kids have done horrific things - many have even personally killed dozens of people - but , sensibly , the goal is not punishment , it 's rehabilitation .
But not in the self - righteous , glorious " War On Terror " .
No , these kids are " terrorists " , these kids are " evil " , these kids belong in the gulags .
The whole thing is , truly , a big joke ... whatever it 's all about .

I still remember looking out the window at night — maybe around 9 pm — wondering if he was on the way .
The sky was dark blue and the evening was quiet .
It was a cloudless night , and the stars were brilliant .
I pondered the possibility that I might see his sleigh flying across the sky .
It would , of course , have been risky to stay awake and wait for a glimpse of Santa .
After all , if he knew I was awake , he would pass by my house without delivering his payload .
Good judgement prevailed and I snuggled under the sheets and went to sleep .
The memory is vivid and magical .
I remember waking up the next morning and finding presents under the Christmas tree .
It never occurred to me that my parents put them there .
It was obviously Santa Claus , and it was magical .
All good things come to an end , and so did my belief in Santa Claus .
Perhaps it was my school friends who enlightened me , or perhaps it was simply the beginning of a rational skepticism .
I do not really remember , but something caused me to question the existence of Santa Claus .
It was the end of an innocent and magical belief .
Now , many years later , I watch my beautifully innocent daughter enjoying the same mythology that had captured my imagination , and I realize how easily she accepts Santa as real .
She does n’t have the faculty to question the myth .
She simply believes what I tell her .
Common sense would suggest that belief in Santa Claus causes no problems , and since children grow out of it , there ’ s no harm in spreading the lie .
But is it that simple ?
Is it right that parents knowingly implant a false belief in Children ?
Parents are willingly telling their children lies and asking them to believe in a non-existent entity .
The lies they tell their children are not simple white lies either ; they are blatant falsehoods , which require parents to construct elaborate hoaxes to maintain the lie .
Its fraudulent .
Can this be justified ?
Perhaps the answer lies in the motivation of the parents .
Do parents have good intentions ?
In most cases , it would be fair to say that parents do have the best intentions .
They want their children to experience the same magic as they did

Is it the ' CIV ' or the ' IL ' part that they do n't understand ?
by Jeremy Hooper
Here are three signs that were spotted at yesterday 's anti-equality rally in Albany :
Translation : Marriage is not a marriage unless it involves a religious ceremony , and the God invoked in those kinds of ceremonies intended for the concept of liberty to apply only to those to whom he granted a heterosexual life .
So essentially , their most commonly - held arguments are ones that ( a ) do n't at all apply to the CIVIL marriage debate , and ( b ) are patently offensive to any person of faith who believes that their God created everyone , and not just those who exclusively schtup in the heterosexual missionary position , vote conservative Republican , and define the separation of church and state as barring anything that keeps evangelical Christians from setting policy for the entire world !
In a perfect nation , the only debate would be rather these folks would benefit more from a gay - affirming UCC congregation or a civics class .
But in this annoyingly homo - hostile life , we gay folk are still forced to suffer the indignity of both defending our beings against claims that they are of the devil , and defending our country against claims that civil rights can and should be stifled by personal faith views .
It 's really enough to make one 's brain explode .

My favorite is the " Save Our God Given Marriage " sign .
Ask these folks how they feel about converting their endangered hetero marriage to a so - called Covenant Marriage .
They are already legal in some states and save threatened straight marriages by restricting divorce grounds .
I tell them " opposite " marriage supporter Gov Bobby Jindal has one , but he does n't seem to be much of a selling point .
Funny how they do n't want to save marriage by putting restrictions on THEIR behavior , just ours .
Yeah , I know , I 'm shocked too .
BTW , Jeremy , how go the last minute wedding preparations ?
Just three days to go .

Brazil won the Confederations Cup on Sunday , and on Monday England play Germany in the final of the European Under - 21 Championship , a match which brings to an end the 2008/09 European football season .
So ( hopefully ) still aglow from England 's youngsters ' win in Sweden , the sun will be out , the football will have finished and it'll be time to get the barbeque going , crack open a bottle of beer and settle down to a diet of tennis and cricket until the whole thing starts up again ... on Tuesday !
Les soldats israéliens ont agressé plusieurs fois des diplomates français : la directrice du centre culturel français de Naplouse ( Cisjordanie ) a été sortie de son véhicule , jetée à terre et rouée de coups par des militaires israéliens près de Jérusalem .
Si Nicolas Sarkozy fait beaucoup d’efforts pour se rapprocher de l’Etat hébreu , on ne peut pas dire que la réciproque soit vraie .
A preuve la multiplication des « bavures » commises par les forces de sécurité israéliennes à l’encontre de ressortissants français en mission et soigneusement étouffées par le Quai d’Orsay .
Lundi , la directrice du centre culturel français de Naplouse ( Cisjordanie ) a été sortie de son véhicule , jetée à terre et rouée de coups par des militaires israéliens près de Jérusalem .
« Je peux te tuer » , a lancé en anglais l’un des soldats .
Sa voiture portait pourtant des plaques diplomatiques .
Depuis , on lui a déconseillé de porter plainte pour ne pas « gêner » la visite de Nétanyahou .
Mardi , c’est le directeur du centre culturel de Jérusalem - Ouest , Olivier Debray , qui , à bord d’un véhicule pourvu de plaques consulaires , a été insulté par des policiers .
Miette .
D’une façon générale , le corps consulaire français se plaint de la violation régulière par les policiers et les soldats israéliens des usages consulaires .
Le 11 juin 2008 , Catherine Hyver , consule adjointe à Jérusalem , avait été retenue dix - sept heures sans une goutte d’eau ni une miette de pain par la sécurité israélienne à un point de passage de la bande de Gaza .
Excréments .
Mais l’incident le plus choquant est l’occupation du domicile de l’agent consulaire français , Majdi Chakkoura , à Gaza pendant l’attaque israélienne de janvier .
En son absence , les soldats israéliens ont complètement ravagé les lieux - pourtant signalés à l’armée israélienne - , volé une grosse somme d’argent , les bijoux de son épouse , son ordinateur et détruit la thèse sur laquelle il travaillait .
Et ils ont souillé d’excréments le drapeau français .
Le Quai d’Orsay n’a là encore élevé aucune protestation .
Une occupation semblable s’est produite au domicile d’une professeure palestinienne du centre culturel français .
Avec ce tag écrit en français sur la bibliothèque dévastée : « Sale arabe , ont va revenir te tuer ».
C’est , dit - on à Gaza , la faute de français - le « t » en trop - qui a choqué l’enseignante .
A third of Shanghai 's population are migrant workers Shanghai officials have unveiled plans to relax strict residency rules , making it easier for people from other parts of China to live there permanently .
But the new rules are only thought to benefit 3,000 of the city 's estimated six million migrant workers .
Applicants must be professionals who have lived legally for seven years in Shanghai , China 's most populous city .
Despite these restrictions many locals oppose the plan , saying Shanghai is already too crowded .
Shanghai is the first of China 's four municipalities - which also include Beijing , Chongqing and Tianjin - to relax its rigid registration rules .
Strict criteria Shanghai wants to attract more skilled professionals , and it also wants more income from its temporary workers , to help pay for its welfare system .
One - third of the population are migrant workers who have come from other parts of the country .
Shanghai's new plans are mainly targeted at skilled professionals
These new regulations promise people permanent residency on the condition they contribute to the city 's coffers in the years to come , according to the BBC 's correspondent in Shanghai , Chris Hogg .
Currently most of the city 's migrant workers have no legal status at all .
About 270,000 are thought to have temporary residency , but even that does not confer many benefits .
Citizens need permanent residency status to access health centres and welfare facilities , or get cheaper tuition fees in the city 's childcare centres and schools .
The new rules will allow anyone with a temporary residency certificate who has been in the city 's social security system - working legally - for seven years to apply for permanent residency .
But they must also be able to prove they have paid their taxes , never violated family planning policies , have a clean credit rating and no criminal record .
They must also have obtained a vocational qualification .
Only about 3,000 people are thought to meet the criteria so far .
Despite this , opinion polls on news websites and blogs suggest the overwhelming majority of local residents oppose the new rules , saying the city is crowded enough already .
Others from outside Shanghai complain the criteria are too strict .

Microsoft Corp. founder Bill Gates today renewed his appeal to the world 's billionaires to give up their fortunes to charitable causes .
But in Washington , the software giant ’s chief executive , Steve Ballmer , made it clear that the company ’s charitable views do n’t extend to paying what it considers unfair U.S. tax rates :
Ballmer threatened to move more jobs overseas if President Obama prevails with his proposal to end tax breaks on foreign earnings .
Maybe Ballmer is just thinking about how to make more generous billionaires out of Microsoft shareholders , if he can boost the bottom line enough to revive the stock as a genuine growth investment -- which it has n't been since the 1990s .
Gates , who has used his Microsoft wealth to fund the $ 27 - billion - asset Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation , told a gathering in Oslo that he believed that " all billionaires should give away the vast majority of their fortunes -- though I do n't say they should n't leave anything to their kids . "
From Reuters :
" I think they would enjoy it , their kids would be better off , and the world would be better off , " Gates said .
" I 'm a great believer that great wealth should go from the richest to the poorest , " he said , seated next to his wife , Melinda , who co-chairs the foundation .
Across the Atlantic , Ballmer said Microsoft would move more jobs overseas if Congress goes along with Obama ’s proposed tax changes on foreign - derived earnings .
From Bloomberg News :
" It makes U.S. jobs more expensive , " Ballmer said in an interview .
" We ’re better off taking lots of people and moving them out of the U.S. as opposed to keeping them inside the U.S. "
Obama on May 4 proposed outlawing or restricting about $ 190 billion in tax breaks for offshore companies over the next decade .
Such business groups as the National Foreign Trade Council , the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Business Roundtable have denounced the proposed overhaul .
U.S. tax rules now let companies defer paying corporate rates as high as 35 % on most types of foreign profits as long as that money remains invested overseas .
Obama says he wants to end such incentives .
Obama believes the changes would preserve U.S. jobs .
Ballmer says it would have just the opposite effect .

The cast of Morning Joe while fear mongering about the EFCA can't manage to name a single successful unionized company , even though they work for one .
Media Matters and TPM are already all over this one .
Jamison Foser at Media Matters :
The Morning Joe crew was on an anti-union tear this morning , claiming the union label on a company means " sell . "
Mika Brzezinski went so far as to say of unions : " They cripple the system that makes a company work . "
Collectively , the journalists on Morning Joe could n't name a single " successful " unionized company .
.....
Oh , what the heck , let 's take one more example .
GE is one of the world 's largest companies ; in 2006 , its revenues were greater than the gross domestic products of 80 percent of UN nations .
The company made more than $ 18 billion in 2008 -- again , billion with a b , and again , those are profits , not revenue .
All that despite ( or , perhaps , because of ) the fact that 13 different unions represent GE workers .
Or is it possible that the anti-union rants from Morning Joe journalists has something to do with the fact that members of the National Association of Broadcast Employees and Technicians - CWA union have protested NBC - Universal ?
TPM has a response from James Hoffa .
Unions are aghast .
" Sorkin and the Morning Joe crew just showed their complete failure to understand how unions contribute to the success of the American economy by blindly assuming that unionized companies have n't been profitable in the last year , " said James Hoffa , General President of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters , in a statement to TPMDC .
As both sites noted , Andrew Ross Sorkin is also the one who started the $ 70 per hour auto worker media myth .
TPM has asked their readers to help compile a list of successful union companies if anyone would care to join in here .
The Sorkin List : Successful Unionized Companies

We 'll admit it , we expected to be knee - deep in Android gear by now .
However , it seems like the consumer electronics industry wanted to build more mature products around versions 1.5 and 2.0 of Google 's open source OS instead .
Regardless , we 're in the thick of it now having just witnessed a deluge of Android - based smartbooks / netbooks ( expected before October ) at Computex and Google 's own announcement that at least 18 new Android handsets will launch this year .
Building upon Sony Ericsson 's plan to launch its first handset based on Android 2.0 , we 're now hearing that Android will play a prominent role across Sony 's portable devices starting with an Android - based Walkman and personal navigation device ( PND ) launching sometime in 2010 .
Engadget Japanese says that Sony 's affection for Android is an " open secret " in Japan .
In fact , an analyst speaking to Japan 's Nikkan simply states the development of an Android Walkman and PND as fact .
Not that we 're too surprised by this ; as demonstrated by its XMB interface now extended to a variety of devices other than the PS3 , Sony is clearly trying to unify the user experience across its consumer electronics portfolio .
And opting for open - source software across the board should keep costs low while increasing speed to market .
Oh Android , is there anything you can't do ... in Google fanboy theory ?

Christoph Rehage Grows ‘ Mighty Long Beard ' on Trek Across China
Christoph Rehage planned to walk about 5,000 km from China to Germany , taking a photo of himself every day for one year — and not shaving once .
You will see in the video that he grew a “ mighty long beard ” throughout that time .
The original goal was to reach Germany from China ; however , he did not accomplish his goal on foot .
Rehage did walk from Urumqi in the northwest of China to Beijing , which is still a feat , all on its own .
Watch the video to his transformation .
Information technology has been the underlying cause of business transformation for the past couple of decades .
In the last couple of years , it has changed the way organizations communicate with their target audience .
The cheap availability and wide reach of the Internet has got companies to reconsider their online presence and to use it for relationship building .
From emails to social networking sites and the use of multimedia , the Internet has become a strategic tool for brand building .
The latest networking tool being used by companies is Twitter .
What is Twitter ?
Twitter is a free , micro- blogging service .
It asks the simple question “ What are you doing ? ” and enables users to send and read short , text - based updates .
These updates are known as tweets and they can be no longer than 140 characters .
One can send updates through the www.twitter.com site , an SMS from their cell phones or through extremely convenient applications .
One can also receive updates through RSS .
How does Twitter Help in Brand Building ?
Twitter helps in brand building in the same way as any other social networking site does .
It helps companies to connect and communicate with their target audience .
Broadly speaking , there are two ways in which Twitter can be useful for brand building :
Promotions :
You can use Twitter to let customers know about new deals , new outlets and new products .
You could inform them about discount coupons and special offers .
Dell posts an update – “ 15 % off any Outlet Inspiron Mini 10 laptop . ”
JetBlue tells us about its vacation packages .
Whole Foods tweets “ Surprise !
Our new store in Paramus , NJ opens one day ahead of schedule !
Stop in today for wonderful samples and shopping . ”
Imaging : You can pitch yourself on Twitter and build a great image .
Take Comcast for instance .
Its positioning as “ someone who cares ” with its ComcastCares ID on Twitter has been quite a success .
With this , it encourages customers to share their problems , issues and grievances .
All issues , small and big , are heard and responded to .
Listening and responding to the target audience : Twitter is a great place to learn what people are saying about you .
Apart from addressing customer issues , you could call in suggestions from customers , which could prove to be invaluable .
Starbucks uses Twitter to invite ideas from their customers and then incorporates the feasible ones .
This not only helps them align their product better with the tastes and preferences of their customers , but makes the customers feel great towards the company .
Getting Excited ?
So , now that you ’re excited about using twitter to reach out to your target audience and grow your business , I have to tell you this .
Using Twitter is an art .
For heaven ’s sake , do n’t use it like a one - way PR channel !
This is not merely wasted effort , it is as irritating as the million spam mails that hit your mailbox .
Being too formal is taboo here and if you are too informal , you may be perceived as non-serious .
You ’d like to sound professional , yet not make it too jargon - filled or corporate - like .
It ’s crucial to strike the right tone on Twitter .
Of course , there is no secret formula for success .
The strategy for Twitter would depend , among other things , upon your offering , company image and target audience ( age , economic status , etc ) .
Companies are talking to their target audience 24* 7 .
Twitter is an excellent opportunity to listen for a change .
Know what customers feel about your product and brand and plan out your response according to their perception of what you have on offer .
Use Twitter to build an interactive , responsive relationship with your customers .
For Those Who Have Spare Time
Love , nature , valor , patriotism and devotion
Guess what these really have in common
They no longer inspire poetry
Now that we have Tweety ( check out a poem on Twitter )
PS What am I doing ?
Right now , I ’m thanking god for having invented “ Poetic License . ”
The author , Priya Nigam , is the Chief Content Development strategist in the organization .
IT WAS designed to hold 541 inmates , but Columbia Correctional Institute , a brick prison in Portage , Wisconsin , usually houses about 830 .
New building has helped a bit — metal bunks fill a concrete box added in 1997 — but many cells meant to house one inmate now hold two .
When there are more prisoners than bunks , as is often the case , beds are laid on the floor .
“ This is pretty much typical for the system , ” says Gregory Grams , Columbia 's warden .
Wisconsin 's prison population grew by 14 % between 2000 and 2007 but , in the same period , the rate of violent crime rose by 23 % .
By 2019 the number of prisoners is expected to have swollen by another 25 % , with a price tag of $ 2.5 billion .
Facing a $ 6.6 billion deficit this year , Wisconsin can hardly afford to expand its prison system further .
On May 20th a special committee led by Lena Taylor , a state senator , presented draft bills to contain prison costs and improve safety .
Jim Doyle , Wisconsin 's governor , has proposals of his own within the state budget , which must pass by June 30th .
Wisconsin is not alone .
Nearby Michigan , which spent a staggering 22 % of its general fund on corrections last year , is debating reforms .
Three judges in California have instructed that state to cut its prison population by one - third by 2012 .
And in Washington , DC , members of Congress are mulling over ways to help state governments curb their prison costs , as well as crime rates .
State correction systems have exploded in recent decades .
The Pew Centre on the States , a research outfit , reports that one in 100 Americans is incarcerated .
One in 31 is in prison , on parole or on probation .
This is expensive .
Corrections have gobbled more and more of state budgets , at a faster pace than any government service except Medicaid .
In 2008 spending on corrections was 303 % greater than two decades earlier .
New laws , not more crime , are the main factor .
Since the 1970s , when parole boards had wide discretion to release prisoners , states such as Wisconsin have set mandatory minimum sentences and applied baseball 's “ three - strikes ” rule to the national pastime of incarceration , often locking up repeat offenders for life .
In the 1990s federal incentives prodded the states to adopt “ truth in sentencing ” , meaning that a court sentence would be completed in full , ending rewards for good behaviour behind bars .
Mr Grams noted a change both in the time offenders spent at Columbia and in the prison 's “ climate ” , a euphemism for whether inmates behave well or abominably .
Outside the prison walls , rehabilitation and job programmes remain inadequate .
In Wisconsin 55 % of those in prison in 2007 had been on parole or probation , according to the Justice Centre at the Council of State Governments , a non-partisan group advising the state .
Ms Taylor points to Texas and Kansas as examples of states where reform has begun to reverse these trends .
The Justice Centre counselled both states in 2007 .
The ensuing policy changes expanded treatment programmes in the community and strengthened supervision of those on probation and parole .
In Texas the prison population grew by only 529 inmates between January 2007 and December 2008 , rather than the 5,141 predicted before reform .
In Wisconsin the governor and Ms Taylor 's committee , advised by the Justice Centre , have proposed different plans , but they have much in common .
Each would allow an inmate to serve a shorter sentence if he completed certain programmes , such as job training .
To keep offenders from repeating their mistakes , each would improve treatments for problems such as mental illness and drug abuse .
The proposals have many critics .
Mr Doyle 's plan to end “ truth in sentencing ” has upset Wisconsin 's attorney - general and legislators such as Scott Suder , who calls it the “ let 'em loose early ” scheme .
Concern over Wisconsin 's deficit may scuttle the committee 's proposal , which costs $ 30 m .
But the Justice Centre estimates that investing $ 30 m today would avert spending $ 2.3 billion by 2019 .
State officials say case of alleged voting improprieties in 2002 and 2004 ' still pending ' nearly five months since complaint filed ...
Brad Friedman Byon 6/22/2009 , 5:05 am PT
It 's been nearly five months since the official complaint about Ann Coulter 's alleged voter fraud in 2002 and 2004 was filed in Connecticut , yet state election officials continue to refuse comment on the status of the case beyond acknowledging that it's " still pending , " as recently confirmed by The BRAD BLOG .
Several charges of absentee voter fraud were alleged in the complaint against Coulter in Connecticut , where evidence shows she cast absentee ballots illegally while living in her then permanent New York City residence .
In addition to the head of the California GOP 's voter registration firm pleading guilty to fraud last week ( his company , Young Political Majors , is under investigation in several other states as well , and is alleged to have secretly changed thousands of registrations from Democratic to Republican , denying voters the ability to cast votes in last year 's primary ) , and the Republican election official in Kentucky who last month pleaded guilty to participating in a massive election fraud conspiracy beginning in 2002 , there still remains the outstanding official investigation into the allegations against Coulter , the GOP 's storied Queen of Voter Fraud .
If all you watched was the Fox " News " Channel , however , and their increasingly bizarre --- and yet still evidence - free --- " investigation " into " voter fraud " by ACORN , you 'd have no idea .
That , even though Coulter herself continues to parade in front of their cameras as a regular guest without ever being asked about the official inquiry in the second state to investigate voting improprieties by the GOP superstar .
" The delay in this case is inexplicable given they need to prove two things : where she registered to vote / voted and where she lived when she registered to vote / voted , " the complainant in the case , Daniel Borchers , a Christian conservative who has long opposed Coulter 's behavior , told The BRAD BLOG .
" Both are easily proven . " ...
She 's Beaten the Felony Fraud Rap Before
Coulter had previously skated from charges of voter fraud in 2005 in Palm Beach County , Florida , where a years - long , well - documented BRAD BLOG investigation had shown , beyond a shadow of a doubt , that she had committed third - degree felony voter fraud in 2005 , having given a false address on her voter registration form after moving to her new $ 1.8 million crib near Rush Limbaugh's , as well as a first - degree misdemeanor in having knowingly voted at the incorrect precinct .
( She also lied about her address on her FL drivers license , another third - degree felony , as a report by the Palm Beach Chief of Police confirmed . )
She managed to escape penalties for those crimes in the Sunshine State after lying both to media and to officials , then having her former FBI boyfriend intercede on her behalf , only to see the last official body to review the charges , the Florida State Election Commission , dismiss the charges because the statue of limitations had run out .
In Connecticut , there is no such statute of limitations for charges of voter fraud , while officials there , without explanation , seem to be taking their sweet time investigating and taking action on her case .
Borchers has long been a critic of the GOP superstar for what he believes to be her opportunistic betrayal of true conservative and moral values .
As the founder of CoulterWatch and Citizens for Principled Conservatism , Borchers has been the subject and / or source of many articles on these pages , and has even guest blogged for The BRAD BLOG at various times over the years ; for example , he covered the Conservative Political Action Conference ( CPAC ) for us in 2006 , when keynoter Coulter referred to Muslims as " ragheads , " and , after her 2007 speech at the same venue when she described NC 's former U.S. Sen .
John Edwards as a " faggot , " he wrote about CPAC sneaking her back onto the agenda , without notifying sponsors in advance as usual , for their 2008 conference in hopes of keeping it under the radar of critics .
Borchers himself was used by Coulter , and her former boyfriend , FBI Supervisory Special Agent Jim Fitzgerald , as the purported reason why Coulter lied on her Florida Voter Registration Form .
Inappropriately disclosing Borchers ' name publicly to a rookie detective at the Palm Beach Sheriff 's Office , claiming him to be a " stalker " of Coulter 's , despite no evidence or ongoing investigation into same , Fitzgerald duped the PBSO into dismissing the FL voter fraud charges before they were later taken up by the Florida State Election Commission and subsequently dismissed due to the statute of limitations which , by then , had finally run out .
' Still Pending '
The new voter fraud complaints against Coulter in CT were filed with the state 's Elections Enforcement Commission by Borchers on January 29 , 2009 .
The commission 's MaryAnn Stratton confirmed having received the complaint on February 2nd , as seen in a chain of emails that occurred over the past nearly - five months between her and Borchers .
Those emails are posted at the end of this article .
In late May , commission spokesperson Nancy Nicolescu told The BRAD BLOG she would have " no comment concerning this investigation since it is still pending , " and pointed us toward a web document detailing Commission Procedures [ PDF ] for such investigations .
Our more recent follow - up queries to both Stratton and Nicolescu have so far gone unanswered .
Borchers , however , received a terse reply to a June 18th query in which he noted " Another month has gone by since your last email ...
Has any progress been made in your investigation into the facts regarding Ann Coulter 's voting during the period in question ? "
The dogged Borchers also asked Stratton : " Did she actually vote in Connecticut while maintaining a permanent residence in another state ?
That appears to be a simple question with an easily determinable answer .
Either she did or she didn't , " before concluding with , " Please enlighten me , the citizens of Connecticut , and the American public . "
Stratton replied simply : " While I understand your frustration with the time frame and I apologize that it does not live up to your expectations , I cannot comment on this investigation until is has been presented to the Commission . "
Unusually Long Delay ?
In a case which almost identically mirrors the allegations against Coulter , New York resident Daniel Jarvis Brown , who had been registered to vote at his parents ' home in CT , voted in the November 2008 election illegally by absentee ballot .
Coulter also used her parents home address , claiming it as her own , when she is alleged to have voted while a permanent resident of NYC in 2002 and 2004 .
Brown was found by the Commission to have violated Connecticut General Statutes 9-23g , 9-140 , 9-172 , 9-359 and 9-360 .
Though the violated statutes allow for thousands of dollars in fines , several years in prison , and referral to the Chief State 's Attorney , U.S. Attorney , or U.S. Department of Justice , Brown cooperated with officials and was not perceiving as having the intent of committing a crime , had no prior cases , and lacked " specific knowledge concerning registration requirements . "
He agreed to remit a civil penalty to the state in the amount of $ 1,500 for the violations .
Whether Coulter , a constitutional attorney at the time of her several alleged instances of voting improperly in CT , will be allowed to claim a similar lack of " specific knowledge concerning registration requirements " remains to be seen .
From a leading mouthpiece for the GOP , which has long turned flimsy claims of wide - spread " voter fraud " by Democrats into a core political tactic , such a claim would be dubious at best .
But the timing of Brown 's violation and subsequent settlement of the case is notable as well .
While Brown 's violation [ PDF ] occurred in November of last year , he signed his agreement with the State Elections Enforcement Commission less than three months later , on February 23 , 2009 , and the Commission formally adopted the agreement on March 5th , just four months after the original violation .
In another more recent case [ PDF ] , a CT voter was alleged to have voted improperly during a referendum in the Town of New Hartford on February 12 , 2009 .
After an investigation by the Commission finding no impropriety , the complaint was officially adopted as " dismissed " on May 27th , less than two months after the election .
It 's now been nearly five months since the complaint against Coulter , who is said to have voted illegally in elections in 2002 and 2004 , was filed .
Yet there has been no public indication of the status of her case by officials beyond " still pending . "
There are currently no references to the case posted at the State Elections Enforcement Commission website .
So what 's the hold - up ?
And will Ann Coulter find a way to escape personal responsibility for criminal action yet again ?
And , given the Fox " News " Channel 's seeming obsession with " voter fraud " by the community organizing coalition , ACORN , for which there is no actual evidence , why is Coulter allowed time and again to appear on their network --- as recently as Sunday night on Geraldo Rivera 's show and on Friday before that on the ACORN - deranged Glenn Beck 's program --- without even being asked about her own , multiple , well - documented instances of apparent criminal voter fraud in two different states ?
Stay tuned ...

1 Language Power and Information Reuse
The World Wide Web is unique in its ability to promote information reuse on a global scale .
Information published on the Web can be flexibly combined with other information , read by a broad range of software tools , and browsed by human users of the Web .
For such reuse to succeed , the broadest possible range of tools must be capable of understanding the data on the Web , and the relationships among that data .
Thus , when publishing information or programs on the Web , the choice of language is important .
This finding explores the connection between the choice of computer language and the reusability of information represented in that language .
Principle
Principle : Powerful languages inhibit information reuse .
There is an important tradeoff between the computational power of a language and the ability to determine what a program in that language is doing .
Computer languages range from the plainly descriptive ( such as Dublin Core metadata , or the content of most databases , or HTML ) , through logical languages with limited propositional logic ( such as access control lists , conneg content negotiation or regular expressions ) , to the nearly Turing - complete ( PDF or some versions of SQL ) , through those that are in fact Turing - complete though one is led not to use them that way ( XSLT , more powerful versions of SQL ) , through those that are functional and Turing - complete ( Haskell ) , to those that are unashamedly imperative and Turing - complete ( Java , Javascript / ECMAScript or C ) .
The Turing - complete languages are shown by computer science to be equivalent in their ability to compute any result of which a computer is capable , and are in that sense the most powerful class of languages for computers .
The tradeoff for such power is that you typically cannot determine what a program in a Turing - complete language will do without actually running it .
Indeed , you often cannot tell in advance whether such a program will even reach the point of producing useful output .
Of course , you can easily tell what a simple program such as print " 2+2 " will do , but given an arbitrary program you 'd likely have to run it , and possibly for a very long time .
Conversely , if you capture information in a simple declarative form , anyone can write a program to analyze it in many ways .
Thus , there is a tradeoff in choosing between languages that can solve a broad range of problems and languages in which programs and data are easily analyzed .
Computer Science in the 1960s through 1980s spent a lot of effort making languages that were as powerful as possible .
Nowadays we have to appreciate the reasons for picking not the most powerful solution but the least powerful .
Expressing constraints , relationships and processing instructions in less powerful languages increases the flexibility with which information can be reused : the less powerful the language , the more you can do with the data stored in that language .
Less powerful languages are usually easier to secure .
A bug - free regular expression processor , for example , is by definition free of many security exposures that are inherent in the more general runtime one might use for a language like C++.
Because programs in simpler languages are easier to analyze , it 's also easier to identify the security problems that they do have .
There are many dimensions to language power and complexity that should be considered when publishing information .
For example , a language with a straightforward syntax may be easier to analyze than an otherwise equivalent one with more complex structure .
A language that wraps simple computations in unnecessary mechanics , such as object creation or thread management , may similarly inhibit information extraction .
The intention of this finding is neither to rigorously characterize the many ways in which a programming language may exhibit power or complexity , nor to suggest that all such power necessarily interferes with information reuse .
Rather , this finding observes that a variety of characteristics that make languages powerful can complicate or prevent analysis of programs or information conveyed in those languages , and it suggests that such risks be weighed seriously when publishing information on the Web .
Indeed , on the Web , the least powerful language that 's suitable should usually be chosen .
This is The Rule of Least Power :
Good Practice
Good Practice :
Use the least powerful language suitable for expressing information , constraints or programs on the World Wide Web .
In aiming for simplicity , one must of course go far enough but not too far .
The language you choose must be powerful enough to successfully solve your problem , and indeed , complexity and lack of clarity can easily result from clumsy efforts to patch around use of a language that is too limited .
Furthermore , the suggestion to use less powerful languages must in practice be weighed against other factors .
Perhaps the more powerful language is a standard and the less powerful language not , or perhaps the use of simple idioms in a powerful language makes it practical to use the powerful languages without unduly obscuring the information conveyed ( see 3 Scalable language families ) .
Overall , the Web benefits when less powerful languages can be successfully applied .
If you 've heard of Hal Finney , the following quote should be enough to get you to read : his explanation of the recent homomorphic encryption paper :
This is IMO one of the most remarkable crypto papers ever .
Not only does it solve one of the oldest open problems in cryptography , the construction of a fully homomorphic encryption system , it does so by means of a self - embedding technique reminiscent of Godel 's theorem .
The case of the sixth islander
multiple attestation

Sticking to the story despite the threat of death
[ another extract from a paper I am writing , this time a thought experiment related to the preceding post ] .
Suppose five people are rescued from a large , otherwise uninhabited island on which they were shipwrecked ten years previously .
The shipwrecked party knew that if they survived they would , eventually , be rescued , for they knew the island was a nature reserve visited by ecologists every ten years .
As the rescued party recount their stories , they include amazing tales of a sixth member of their party shipwrecked along with them .
This person , they claim , soon set himself apart from the others by performing amazing miracles - walking on the sea , miraculously curing one of the islanders who had died from a snakebite , conjuring up large quantities of food from nowhere , and so on .
The mysterious sixth islander also had striking and original ethical views that , while unorthodox , were eventually enthusiastically embraced by the other islanders .
Eventually , five years ago , the sixth islander died , but he came back to life three days later , after which he ascended into the sky .
He was even seen again several times after that .
Let ’s add some further details to this hypothetical scenario .
Suppose that the five islanders tell much the same story about the revered sixth member of their party – while differing in style , their accounts are broadly consistent .
Indeed , a vivid and forceful portrait of the sixth islander emerges from their collectively testimony .
Interestingly , the stories about the sixth islander also include a number of details that are clearly awkward or embarrassing for the remaining islanders .
Indeed , they all agree that two of the surviving islanders actually betrayed and killed the sixth islander .
Moreover , some of the deeds supposedly performed by the sixth islander are clearly at odds with what the survivors believe about him ( for example , while believing the sixth islander to be utterly without malice , they also attribute to him actions that are clearly cruel , actions they then have a very hard time explaining ) .
These are details it seems it could hardly be in their interests to invent .
Such is their admiration for their sixth companion and his unorthodox ethical views that the survivors try hard to convince us that both what they say is true , and that it is important that we too should also come to embrace his unorthodox views .
Indeed , for the rescued party , the sixth islander is a revered cult figure , a figure they wish us to revere too .
Now suppose we have , as yet , no good independent evidence for the existence of the sixth islander , let alone that he performed the miracles attributed to him by the rescued party .
What should be our attitude to these various claims ?
Clearly , we would rightly be sceptical about the miraculous parts of the testimony concerning the sixth islander .
Their collective testimony is not nearly good enough evidence that such events happened .
But what of the sixth islander ’s existence ?
Is it reasonable to believe , solely on the basis of this testimony , that the sixth islander was at least a real person , rather than a delusion , or deliberately invented fiction , or whatever ?
Notice that the evidence presented by the five islanders meets three criteria discussed above .
First , we have : not one , but five , individuals claim that the sixth islander existed ( moreover , we are dealing with the alleged eye - witnesses themselves , rather than second or third hand reports , so there is no possibility of other having tampered with or amended the story to suit themselves ) .
Secondly , their reports contain details that are clearly highlyto ( indeed , that seriously incriminate ) the tellers .
This raises the question – why would the islanders deliberately include such details in a made - up story – a story that e.g. is clearly in tension with what they believe about their hero , and which , indeed , also portrays them as murderous betrayers ?
Thirdly , why would they attribute to the sixth islander unorthodox ethical and other views very muchwith accepted wisdom ?
If , for example , the sixth islander is an invention designed to set them up as chief gurus of a new cult , would they attribute to their mythical leader views unlikely to be easily accepted by others ?
Now there ’s no doubt that there could have been a sixth islander who said and did some of the things attributed to him .
But ask yourself : does the collective testimony of the rescued party place the existence of the sixth islander beyond reasonable doubt ?
If not beyond reasonable doubt , is his existence something it would at least be reasonable for us to accept ?
Or would we be wiser , at this point , to reserve judgement and adopt a sceptical stance ? [ nb. the following is for Sam 's interest ]
Another difference between the two scenarios that might be exploited is :
Those who made such claims about Jesus were prepared to , and on occasion did , die for their beliefs .
No such threats are issued to the six islanders .
Some may claim this is a key difference between the two sets of testimony that gives the testimony about Jesus much greater credibility .
Let ’s suppose at least some of those with whom the Jesus testimony originated were prepared to die for their belief .
That would at least raise the credibility of their collective testimony somewhat .
But by how much ?
Again , let ’s adjust our hypothetical scenario so that the islanders are now threatened with death if they do not renounce their claims about the sixth islander ( imagine , if you like , that they are unlucky enough to be rescued by a brutal totalitarian regime highly unsympathetic to such tales ) .
The islanders stick to their story , and are executed as a result .
How reasonable is it , now , to suppose that there was a sixth islander ?
Still not terribly reasonable , I would suggest .
It is , of course , deeply puzzling why the islanders would be prepared to die for their beliefs if those beliefs were not true .
If the islanders made the story up , surely they would have renounced it to save their own skins .
But if they did not make it up , and yet the story is not true , then they would have to have collectively been the victims of some sort of deceit or delusion about the miraculous sixth islander .
Yet that is scarcely credible either .
And yet – given the highly miraculous nature of much of what they recount about the sixth islander , surely it is still not clear that he existed , let alone performed any of the miracles attributed to him .
The fact that it is deeply puzzling why the rescued party would go to their deaths defending beliefs that they knew not to be true , and no less puzzling how they could collectively have become deceived or deluded about a miraculous sixth islander , still leaves us largely clueless about what really happened .
Bailing out the big US banks has done nothing to improve them , writes Joseph Stiglitz .
WITH all the talk of " green shoots " of economic recovery , America 's banks are resisting efforts to regulate them .
While politicians talk about their commitment to regulatory reform to prevent a recurrence of the crisis , this is one area where the devil really is in the details  and the banks will muster what muscle they have left to ensure that they have ample room to continue as they have in the past .
The old system worked well for the banks so why should they embrace change ?
Indeed , the efforts to rescue them devoted such little thought to the kind of post - crisis financial system we want , that we will end up with a banking system that is less competitive , with the large banks that were " too big to fail " even larger .
It has long been recognised that the US banks that are too big to fail are also too big to be managed .
That is one reason the performance of several has been so dismal .
When they fail , the Government engineers a financial restructuring and provides deposit insurance , gaining a stake in their future .
Officials know that if they wait too long , zombie or near - zombie banks  which have little or no net worth , but are treated as if they were viable institutions  are likely to " gamble on resurrection " .
If they take big bets and win , they walk away with the proceeds , if they fail , the Government picks up the tab .
This is not just theory ; it is a lesson learned , at great expense , during the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s .
In a financial restructuring , shareholders typically get wiped out , and bondholders become the new shareholders .
Sometimes , the government must provide additional funds , or a new investor must be willing to take over the failed bank .
Part One : A boxer , an attorney , a single dad — all have taken their own lives in the wake of being on reality shows .
Up next , Part 2 : Psychologists and former contestants discuss what some are calling the ' Truman Show Syndrome . '

Confessions of a Reality TV Star
Aside from Paula Abdul 's departure from " American Idol , " it was perhaps the biggest news story of August : Ryan Alexander Jenkins , a former participant on VH1 reality series " Megan Wants a Millionaire " and " I Love Money , " was found dead in a Canadian motel room amid allegations that he had earlier murdered his ex-wife in a most gruesome way .
The lurid case put the spotlight on the broader reality - television genre :
How did a guy so emotionally troubled wind up on mainstream entertainment television ?
Perhaps it should n't have been such surprise .
As reality has proliferated over the last decade to become television 's dominant creed , emotional stability has not always been a casting requirement .
Susan Boyle should consider herself lucky that when she was rushed to the hospital a day after the " Britain 's Got Talent " finale , it was only for exhaustion .
A Wrap investigation shows that the reality of reality shows is not nearly so benign : at least 11 reality - show participants have taken their own lives — and two more who have tried to — in tragedies that appear to be linked to their experience on television shows .
Many people may know about Paula Goodspeed ( pictured left ) , who killed herself in front of Paula Abdul ’s house last November after she was bounced from audtions on " American Idol . ”
Goodspeed , an obsessed fan of Abdul's , was found dead in her car in Sherman Oaks after a prescription - drug overdose .
But Goodspeed is just one among a long list of reality - show related deaths .
The victims are as varied as they are unexpected : a deputy district attorney , a single father , a young boxer — even the sister of a contestant on a makeover show prodded to make hurtful comments about her sibling 's " before " look .
And the phenomenon is not limited to the United States .
The Wrap 's investigation found suicides and attempted suicide among contestants as far afield as India , England and Sweden .
Certainly , many of these people had pre-existing problems , which may have been why they were looking for such instant TV fame in the first place .
But mental - health workers have discovered that many contestants on shows like “ Survivor ” and “ Big Brother ” — even those who win — suffer severe and often long - lasting psychological trauma .
( Read Part Two tomorrow for more on this subject . )
Here are the victims , beginning with those on U.S. shows :
1. CHERYL KOSEWICZ
“ Pirate Masters , ” CBS
July 27 , 2007
A Deputy District Attorney from Reno , Kosewicz , 35 , killed herself after being bounced from the show .
Her suicide happened just two months after Kosewicz 's boyfriend , Ryan O'Neil , committed suicide himself .
Kosewicz wrote on the MySpace page of fellow contestant Ness Nemir : “ I ’ve lost the strong Cheryl and I ’m just floating around lost .
This frik ’n show … was such a contention between Ryan and I and plus it ’s not getting good reviews … then I made the National Enquirer today so … the hits just keep on coming . ”
A CBS spokesman did not return calls for comment .
2. NAJAI TURPIN
“ The Contender , ” NBC
Feb. 14 , 2005
The 23 - year - old shot himself to death just weeks before his scheduled bout on the series , which chronicles boxers trying to win a TV tournament with a first prize of $ 1 million .
According to the police report , Turpin was sitting in a Chevy Lumina at 4 a.m. with his girlfriend , whom he had been fighting with over their 2 - year old daughter .
His trainer , Perry " Buster " Custus , said that " he had a lot of stuff on his mind .
I was going to talk to him about it while we were driving to camp .
You never really knew what was going on in Najai 's head . "
In joining the show , Turpin hoped to earn money to support his family , but participants were not allowed to fight in any other bouts until the live finale of the show aired .
He was said to have grown frustrated when the premiere was delayed repeatedly .
NBC did not return calls seeking comment .
3. NATHAN CLUTTER
“ Paradise Hotel 2 , ” MyNetworkTV
October 12 , 2007
The 26 - year - old lllinois native jumped to his death from a cellular tower several weeks after he wrapped production on “ Paradise Hotel 2 , ” which aired on News Corp 's MyNetworkTV .
Before filming the show , Clutter had moved to Phoenix , where he worked as a sales manager .
The network initially reported that his death was the result of a climbing accident , but a police investigation concluded that it was a suicide .
Clutter 's uncle told police that Clutter battled depression and a bi-polar disorder and that his family had sent him money in hope of his moving back to Illinois .
The Wrap received no response to an email to a spokeswoman for the network before publication .
4. KELLI MCGEE
“ Extreme Makover , ” ABC
2005
McGee was n't even a contestant on the show — it was her sister , Deleese Williams , who was flown to L.A. for what producers called a " Cinderella - like transformation " that would fix her deformed jaw , droopy eyelids and crooked teeth .
But the night before her plastic surgery , McGee was told she was being dumped from the show because her recovery time " would n't fit with the show 's productions schedule , " said producers .
Williams reportedly sobbed , " How can I go home as ugly as I left ?
I was supposed to come home pretty ! "
McGee had been coaxed by show producers to say mean things about Williams ’ looks — apparently with the intention of contrasting those comment with the “ made - over ” Williams .
When Williams became aware of her sister ’s hurtful remarks , family members claim , “ Kelli went all to pieces ” and took a fatal overdose of pills and alcohol in May .
Williams , who now is raising her sister ’s two children , is suing ABC and production company , Endemol Productions , for breach of contract , willful infliction of emotional distress and negligence .
ABC referred questions about McGee to Endemol , which did not immediately return calls seeking comment .
5. MELANIE BELL
“ Vegas Elvis , ” unsold pilot
March 25 , 2005
Bell , not a contestant but a producer of the show , jumped from the Stratosphere Hotel after a day of filming .
Her family says she was suffering severe depression stemming from her battle with anorexia .
A news release for the fledgling show actually promoted the fact that “ Vegas Elvis ” was “ the second reality program in less than two months to suffer a cast member suicide , ” apparently referring to the death of boxer Turpin .
It claimed that Bell 's death was , basically , a more exciting suicide than Turpin's .
6. DANNY BONADUCE
“ Breaking Bonaduce , ” VH-1
September 2005
The former “ Partridge Family ” child actor tried to kill himself with vodka and Vicodin after his wife asked for a divorce while the couple was filming their reality series — and just prior to the Sept. 12 , 2005 , airing of the first episode .
The programs shows Bonaduce swilling an entire bottle of vodka and screaming at a producer , " I 'll cripple him for life . "
VH - 1 producers claim they wanted to stop filming after the off - camera suicide attempt but his wife Gretchen " really begged us to keep filming . "
Gretchen says she allowed the filming because " I wanted to use every leverage I had to get him help .
Danny loves to be on TV . "
A spokesman for VH - 1 did not return calls seeking comment .
7. JAMES SCOTT TERRILL
“ Supernanny , ” ABC
July 4 , 2008
The Georgetown , Kentucky , single father died of self - inflicted gunshot wounds after appearing on the series that purports to help parents deal with out - of - control young children .
Terill , 37 , struggling with financial and parenting issues , called the police while at the cemetery where his father was buried , threatening to shoot himself .
The police stayed with him on the phone for an hour but were unable to stop him .
A spokesperson for ABC did not return our calls seeking comment .
It 's the same problem in other countries , as well .
TheWrap was unable to get comments from spokesmen in other countries :
8. SIMON FOSTER
England
“ Wife Swap ”
April 15 , 2008
Foster lost his wife Jane , his house and his job after appearing on “ Wife Swap . ”
Finally , he was found dead in a tiny room in Brighton , after consuming excessive quantities of methadone and alcohol .
He and Jane were featured on the program because they lived " an alternative " lifestyle , each having girlfriends outside the marriage .
A friend of the Foster said , “ The show put an enormous strain on Simon , he was really never the same .
To be shown with your wife happily seeing another woman made him a laughingstock . ”
Soon after filming , Jane moved in with her lesbian lover and took the couple ’s two children , Foster ’s boss fired him and he ended up homeless .
Viewers were told in an update that the Fosters had divorced but did not link the end of the marriage to the show .
9. CARINA STEPHENSON
England
“ The Colony ”
May 2005
Stephenson , 17 , the youngest reality suicide , took her life two weeks before her role was to air .
Her body was found hanging from a tree in a Yorkshire forest two days after she went missing ; it later emerged that she had been visiting suicide sites on the internet .
On the sites , Stephenson was encouraged to take her own life and given advice on how to kill herself , which her mother claimed Stephenson followed in her actual attempt .
" The Colony " — filmed in Australia — is described as a “ fly - on - the - wall series that shows how modern day families would have coped as settlers in 1800 . "
10 . JO O'MEARA
“ Celebrity Big Brother ”
February 2007
O’Meara has recovered from a suicide attempt after fellow contestants accused her of being a “ bully and a racist . ”
Her conduct towards the eventual winner , Shilpa Shetty , was questioned , and O'Meara claimed that she received death threats after leaving the show .
She later described her attempt in detail , in which she downed pills and whiskey before passing out on her bathroom floor .
A friend found her in time to revive her , but O'Meara still is furious with the producers for " abandoning " her .
" I was in so much pain and just hurting , I could n't believe what I 'd become and how I 'd been shown on the telly .
I was shaking , but I poured the whiskey into the glass , then I just took one Nurofen , then another , then another , " O'Meara said in April 2007 .
Her mother says she ’s recovering from her suicide attempt but , “ She ’s not eating , she ’s wasting away . ”
11 . SINISA SAVIJA
Sweden
“ Expedition ”
July 11 , 1997
Savija threw himself under a train after being voted off the island on an episode of " Expedition : Robinson , " the 1997 program that was guided by producer Mark Burnett , who renamed it " Survivor " for the United States run .
His suicide led Burnett and other producers to subject potential contestants to psycohlogical testing before casting .
Savija 's widow Nermina said the 34 - year - old " became deeply depressed and agonized .
He felt degraded as a person ; he was a glad and stable person before , and when he came back he told me , ‘ They are going to cut away the good things I did and make me look like a fool to show that I was the worst , the first to go . "
12 . TANIA SAHA
India
“ Fatafati ”
September 2008
The 21 - year - old Saha swallowed poison immediately after being rejected as a participant on the Indian reality show .
Apparently she brought the bottle of poison with her to the audition .
Tomorrow , " Reality Suicide , Part 2 " : Psychologists and former contestants talk about what some are calling the Truman Show Syndrome .

The majority may be hooked to their digital players but there plenty of old - schoolers who hang on to their vinyl for dear life .
Trying to appease this segment is “ Linos ” , a portable record player .
Ditching the traditional full platter configuration for modern sensibilities , this player takes into consideration the space demands and limited mobility of regular turntables .
Simply load the record to the lower spindle element and lock it into place from above .
Pushing down on the power icon then releases the tonearm and spins up the record .
Hook up the player to your comp via micro USB for sound and powering or use the USB power adapter with standard stereo jack output .

The wind does blow whether coastal or inland and affects the play of golfers , perhaps more mentally than physically .
Winds are an element that all must face and learn to deal with .
Here are a few considerations that might help the golfer â€œturn the wind around .â€ 
Downwind :
When the wind blows from behind the golfer , the golfer might find advantage in playing a three or four wood off the tee .
With more loft , the shot will carry further with more control .
Starting from an original Athletic Readiness condition , widen the stance slightly by moving the trailing ( right for right - handers ) .
The ball should be in front of your forward cheek .
Take less club in approach shot iron play , and within reason increase the pace of the swing .
The ball should stop better on greens .
Wind Against :
When the wind blows from in front ( into the golferâ€™s face ) , the golfer should swing a little easier concentrating of making solid contact instead of overpowering the wind which can not be done .
Tee the ball high on tee shots , rather than low : making a shallower sweeping attack is the key .
Set up with more weight on forward side by widening the forward foot slightly from an original Athletic Readiness condition .
On iron shots adjust the shoulders so that the rear shoulder is higher than normal and the forward shoulder is lower ( letâ€™s say , strive for level shoulders ) .
Take at least one more club on regular iron shots .
Do not be ashamed to take three or four more , depending upon the force of the wind .
The ball should always be played from in front of the lead cheek , even on punch shots from an open stance .
Crosswinds :
These are winds that blow against the back or against the chest .
Letâ€™s call a wind that pushes you backward a draw wind and one that pushes you forward a fade wind .
Consider both winds as a wall .
Establish weight carefully for stability , leaning ever so slightly into the wall .
Hit the ball into the wall for control .
The golfer should plan to let the wind move the ball , aiming more left or right and let the winds play with it .
Slices or hooks hit into a wall of wind will double the effect .
The big concern on approach shots is to guard against missing the green on the side the pin is on .
Key thoughts : ( 1 ) The wind can not be overpowered .
( 2 ) Solidness of contact is more important than trying to generate clubhead speed .
With a little thought and practice the golfer might find playing in the wind to be fun .
Calling them “ man ’s best friend ” may be a cliché , but no description is more apt to describe the relationship of humans with these fascinating creatures .
Loyal , smart , protective , fun and playful , dogs have served as man ’s ultimate companion since time immemorial .
But did you know that a dog ’s loyalty to his master can reach enormous , fascinating levels ?
Yes , there are dog breeds which are amazingly loyal to their owners .
What other “ mosts ” are there when it comes to these canines which man has considered to be his best friend since time immemorial ?
How about the world ’s most expensive dog breed ?
Or the most dangerous ?

Counting Down the Top 10 Most Amazing Dog Breeds
If you ’re thinking of a breed of dog to take care of , it is good to have an idea about what its temperament is , its characteristic and what makes it unique .
[ Owning a Dog ]
A large database of dog names to help you pick the perfect name for your puppy !
To help you out , we will have a countdown of the top 10 most amazing dog breeds – ranging from the most dangerous , loyal , fascinating , popular and expensive breeds that you can buy .
1. Dog Breed : Doberman pinscher
Distinction :
One of the most dangerous dog breeds in the world .
With their tall and compact bodies , dark color and alert ears , it is easy to see why the Doberman Pinscher as a dog breed is considered to be one of the most dangerous dog breeds in the world .
Simply referred to as Doberman , this canine breed originated from Germany .
Generally , a domesticated Doberman is loyal , intelligent and alert .
If you own this dog breed , they will be particularly loyal to you and aggressive towards strangers .
They also do not like rivalry with other dogs .
What makes caring for a Doberman pinscher particularly dangerous is when the owners lack guidance , subject them to abuse or if not enough attention is given to them – upon which they can become destructive , dominant and extremely aggressive .
[ Dog Behavior ]
2. Dog Breed : German Shepherd
Distinction :
One of the most dangerous dog breeds in the world .
Another German breed of dog which is considered to be one of the most dangerous in the world is the German Shepherd .
Unlike the Dobermans , this breed of canine does not have a particularly menacing look because they have a long coat and a generally mild - looking face .
However , they are extremely intelligent , strong and obedient , which is probably the reason why most police and military establishments employ them as guard dogs .
Another characteristic of the German Shepherds which makes them particularly dangerous is their aggression towards smaller dog breeds .
3. Dog Breed : Rottweiler
Distinction :
One of the most dangerous dog breeds in the world .
Did you know that Rottweiler is also known as Butcher dog ?
This canine breed ranks third in our list of the most dangerous dog breeds in the world .
They are energetic , intelligent and hardy animals .
The thing which makes Rottweiler – and any dog breed for that matter – become dangerous is when they are subject to abuse and neglect .
They also become a hazard to the community if they do not have sufficient training when it comes to mingling with humans or other animals .
In addition , Rottweilers are aggressive towards other dogs of the same sex .
If you have cats and birds in the house , they might also exhibit aggressive behavior towards them .
4. Dog Breed : Samoyed
Distinction :
One of the most expensive dog breeds in the world .
Next , we will take a look at a few of the most expensive dog breeds in the world .
This ‘ luxury ’ dog breed has a price ranging from around $ 3,000 to $ 8,000 .
What makes the Samoyed breed particularly expensive is the fact that they are among the ancient dog breeds that have been around for the last three centuries .
There are also a dwindling number of Samoyed dog breeders which is another reason why an owner needs to pay an arm and a leg to call this canine breed his or her best friend .
5. Dog Breed : English Bulldog or British Bulldog
Distinction :
One of the most expensive dog breeds in the world .
How would you feel about owning a dog breed which is also owned by the British royals ?
In the United States in particular , English or British bulldogs are both expensive and popular .
This breed of dog is also favored by a lot of men who see the breed as being a symbol of masculinity and tenacity .
If you ’re thinking about a breed of dog to buy and you are willing to shell out the money for it , then you might as well go with one of the most popular and expensive dog breeds in the world – the British or English bulldog .
A typical English bulldog puppy can cost you anywhere from $ 2,000 to $ 5,000 .
6. Dog Breed : Cavalier King Charles Spaniel
Distinction :
One of the most expensive dog breeds in the world .
To cap off our list of the most expensive dog breeds , there is the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel which can cost anywhere from $ 800 to about $ 3,500 for a puppy .
What makes the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel expensive and special is that they are the ultimate definition of a man ’s best friend .
When you look at their puppy - dog eyes , their rich coats and their small , compact bodies , it is easy to see why anybody would want to spend a significant amount of money just to be able to own a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel puppy .
[ Adorable Dog Breeds ]
7. Dog Breed : Labrador Retriever
Distinction :
One of the most popular dog breeds in the world .
Finally , we ’ll move on to some of the most popular dog breeds in the world .
First , there ’s the Labrador Retriever .
They are among the world ’s most popular dog breeds according to the American Kennel Club because of their friendly demeanor .
If you would like to purchase a dog breed which is great with kids and works as a great solo companion as well , then you can never go wrong by choosing to care for a Labrador Retriever .
8. Dog Breed : Golden Retriever
Distinction :
One of the most popular dog breeds in the worlds .
Golden Retrievers rank next to the Labrador Retriever as the most popular dog breeds in the world .
This cousin breed is almost synonymous with the dog that almost every average American family has .
What ’s so good about this breed of canine is that they are gentle by nature and their temperament is suitable for kids and all members of the family to play with .
Despite their large size , they do have a way with kids which make for the perfect canine friend .
Just make sure that you have enough room for them to grow , because they can weigh as much as 90 pounds .
9. Dog Breed : Yorkshire Terrier
Distinction :
One of the most popular dog breeds in the world .
Yorkshire Terrier dogs are small pooches which are also an ideal family dog .
Let ’s say that you live in an apartment which allows pets – but there is n’t much room for the dogs to move around .
Naturally , you would be selecting a breed which is small in nature – and the Yorkshire Terrier is perfect for such a setup .
10 . Dog Breed : Dachshunds
Distinction :
One of the most popular dog breeds in the world .
This dog breed with a unique name , Dachshund , is also known as wiener dogs .
They do have a unique body shape and they are known for their playful and sometimes ferocious nature .
There are different kinds of Dachshunds that you can own – including the long - haired , standard Dachshunds which has a calm demeanor , or the wire - haired Dachshund which has a personality more like the terrier’s .
Now that you already have an idea about the world ’s most expensive , dangerous and popular dog breeds , which one are you planning to own ?
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - U.S. regulators closed three small banks on Friday , bringing the number of bank failures to 40 so far this year as the recession and delinquent loans erode the health of financial institutions .
The largest of the banks closed on Friday was Cooperative Bank of Wilmington , North Carolina with $ 970 million in assets and $ 774 million in deposits , the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp said .
The failure is expected to cost the FDIC deposit insurance fund an estimated $ 217 million .
First Bank of Troy , North Carolina will purchase all the deposits , except about $ 57 million in brokered deposits .
The FDIC said it will pay the brokers directly .
Cooperative Bank ’s 24 branches will reopen on Monday as branches of First Bank .
The FDIC also announced the failure of Southern Community Bank of Fayetteville , Georgia , which had $ 377 million in assets and $ 307 million in deposits .
The failure is expected to cost the FDIC deposit insurance fund an estimated $ 114 million .
United Community Bank of Blairsville , Georgia , agreed to assume the insured deposits of Southern Community Bank , whose five branches will reopen on Monday as branches of United Community Bank .
In Kansas , the FDIC said regulators closed First National Bank of Anthony , with $ 156.9 million in assets and $ 142.5 million in deposits .
The failure is expected to cost the FDIC deposit insurance fund an estimated $ 32.2 million .
Bank of Kansas in South Hutchinson , Kansas , agreed to assume the insured deposits of First National Bank of Anthony , whose six branches will reopen on Monday as branches of Bank of Kansas .
Customers can access their money over the weekend by check , teller machine or debit card , the FDIC said .
The pace of bank failures has accelerated in 2009 as the 18 - month - old recession continues .
There were 25 failures in all of 2008 and just three in 2007 .
Seattle - based Washington Mutual became the biggest bank to fail in U.S. history when it was seized in September with $ 307 billion in assets .
JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N acquired the assets of Washington Mutual .
The FDIC insures up to $ 250,000 per account at member institutions .
The agency also has a running tally of problem banks that its examiners closely monitor .
At the end of the first quarter , 305 unidentified financial institutions were on that list .
As an investment tip it is unlikely to inspire a rush : put your money in rubbish .
Nevertheless , new figures reveal that the price of recyclable waste has doubled in the past six months .
The news will provide a boost to Britain 's flagging recycling movement , and go some way towards reversing the gloom over mountains of glass bottles and newspapers piling up across Britain after the drop last year in the value of recyclables .
It will also be a welcome change for UK waste collection companies and councils , hit hard by a drop in demand last autumn for paper , bottles and cans from countries such as China and India .
There had been calls for warehouses and disused airfields to be made available for storing rubbish that could not be sold .

A huge global drop in the volume of waste being produced , partly due to the economic downturn , is thought to have sparked the recent sharp rise .
The price of cardboard has trebled to £ 59 per ton since November , while PET – the plastic used in drinks bottles – has also more than doubled from £ 75 per ton to £ 195 .
During the same time period , the price of gold has risen by just 14 per cent , and crude oil by 16 per cent .
" The main reason for this is that the quantity of recycled material available around the world is lower than it was six months ago .
It is a question of supply and demand , " said George Broom , the owner of the commercial recycling company Environmental Support Services .
" Also , the international demand that had dropped off is coming back . "
Reports are also suggesting that overseas demand for recyclable materials is slowly increasing .
" Prices are creeping up , " said Lorna Langdon , managing director of Paperchasers .
" The price for highgrade paper fell last year from £ 60 a ton to nothing at Christmas time , but has now risen to around £ 35 a ton .
All industries have had a downturn , which includes the recycling industry .
I 'm sure it will improve . "
Figures released by the government waste watchdog Waste Resources and Action Programme ( Wrap ) last week confirmed that the price of recovered materials is continuing to rise .
The latest figures show that plastic bottles are increasing in value , with PET bottle prices currently at , or above , last year 's peak , and paper prices are edging higher .
Although the slump in the value of recycling materials did not have a measurable impact on levels of household recycling across the UK , reports of the slump in prices did little to help consumer confidence .
" Wrap tracks consumer recycling very closely , and there has been absolutely no evidence of a significant fall in recycling behaviour since the fall in prices , " said a spokesperson .
" But it 's also clear from the research that consumers want to be confident that what they put out is actually recycled into something useful .
So this evidence of rising prices and rising demand should definitely help reinforce consumer confidence that recycling remains worthwhile . "
BlackBerry Tour 9630 specs leak : Arrives in Canada mid-July
It looks , judging by these images , like someone has been faxing something they should n’t have , but when the leak is a detailed spec-sheet for the BlackBerry Tour 9630 we wo n’t quibble over it coming on thermal paper .
According to MobileSyrup ’s source , the Tour 9630 will arrive on Canadian carrier Bell in mid-July , bringing with it an HVGA 480 x 360 display , 3.2 - megapixel autofocus camera with flash , quadband GSM / GPRS / EDGE , 2100MHz UMTS / HSPA and 800/1900MHz EVDO Rev.A .
There ’s also GPS and A - GPS , a 35 - key QWERTY keyboard , Bluetooth 2.0 , 3.5 mm headset port and microUSB port .
No sign of WiFi , but you do get a microSD card slot ( under the battery cover ) , 256MB of internal memory and a 1,400 mAh battery .
The whole thing measures 112 x 62 x 14.2 mm and weighs 130g .
While we ’re excited for our friends up in Canada , we ’re perhaps a little more keen to see whether – as the leaked inventory details suggest – the BlackBerry Tour 9630 arrives on Verizon Wireless in the US on July 13th .

How High Can You Get ? Killing the Killscreen by Donkeying with Kong
The Journey to Find and Fix Donkey Kong ’s Logic Bomb By Don Hodges
Started 10/28/2007 - Posted 11/4/2007
Last update Sunday , February 19 , 2017 Donkey Kong has a “ kill screen ” if the player ever makes it to level 22 .
On this level , the timer runs out very quickly and Jumpman [ Mario ] always dies before he can get past the 2nd girder .
So I wanted to find out : what exactly is the bug in the program that causes this behavior and also , can it be fixed ?
First I looked on the Internet to see if the answer has already been found .
Some good starting information is located at http://www.jeffsromhack.com/products/donkeykong_tech.htm.
There , Jeff Kulczycki breaks down the math of the kill screen , showing the formula that is used to compute the bonus for each level .
The formula says the level times 10 , plus 40 , gives the number of hundreds in the bonus timer .
If the result is too large it is forced back down .
The key to this is that the level number is used in the calculation .
On level 22 an overflow occurs , leaving the player with just 400 points on the timer because the multiplication and addition yields a number larger than 256 .
So armed with this knowledge and a MAME emulator complete with some cheats to help out , we start the journey .
In MAME we look closely at the set level cheat and the cheat which gives infinite time on the bonus clock .
Memory location # 62B1 holds the hundreds place of the timer , with the onscreen timer in # 638C , and the level of play in # 6229 .
The next step is to disassemble the program ROMs for Donkey Kong .
I found a good Z80 disassembler ( dZ80 by Mark Incley , http://www.inkland.demon.co.uk ) and ran it on the program ROMs , then searched for those addresses listed above , looking for clues .
After lots of looking we finally arrive at a section of code inside the c_5et_g .bin file .
You will probably need some knowledge of assembly language to follow the rest of this .
The reason this section stands out is because the first instruction references the level number stored in # 6229 , and near the end is a reference to # 62B0 , which is very close to # 62B1 which holds the timer .
So let ’s look at the code with my comments attached .
0F7A 3A2962 LD
A ,(#6229 ) ; Load A with level number
0F7D 47 LD B , A ; Copy this number into B
0F7E A7 AND A ; Perform Bitwise AND of A with A
0F7F 17 RLA ; Rotate Left the bits in A ( multiply by 2 )
0F80 A7 AND A ; Perform Bitwise AND of A with A
0F81 17 RLA ; Rotate Left the bits in A ( multiply by 2 )
0F82 A7 AND A ; Perform Bitwise AND of A with A
0F83 17 RLA ; Rotate Left the bits in A ( multiply by 2 )
0F84 80 ADD A,B ; A = A + B
0F85 80 ADD A,B ; A = A + B
0F86 C628 ADD A ,#28 ; A = A + # 28 ( 40 decimal )
0F88 FE51 CP # 51 ; Is A >= # 51 ( 81 decimal ) ?
0F8A 3802 JR C,#0F8E ; No , then skip ahead to # 0F8E
0F8C 3E50 LD A,#50 ; Yes , then A = # 50 ( 80 decimal )
0F8E 21B062 LD
HL , #62B0 ; Load HL
Address to store the result
0F91 0603 LD B,#03 ; For B = 1 to 3
0F93 77 LD ( HL ) , A ; Stores A in # 62B0 , # 62B1 , then # 62B2
0F94 2C INC L ; L = L + 1
0F95 10FC DJNZ # 0F93 ; Next B
The first half of this code takes the level and multiplies it by 10 .
First , it grabs the number of the level and stores it in A .
Then it makes a copy of A in B for later use .
The next step had me confused for a while :
0F7E A7 AND A ; Perform Bitwise AND of A with A
What could the benefit be of ANDing a number to itself ?
Would n’t it always just give the same number back as a result ?
The answer to this question is yes , but it turns out the reason for this is to clear the Carry flag to zero , so that the next instruction which multiplies the level by 2 will not also bring in the Carry bit into the least significant bit .
The next instruction is
0F7F 17 RLA ; Rotate Left the bits in A
With the Carry flag cleared , this will double the number in A by shifting its bits left .
This process is repeated 2 more times , which results in A becoming 8 times what it started as .
To get to 10 times , we add the original value stored in B twice :
0F84 80 ADD A,B ; A = A + B
0F85 80 ADD A,B ; A = A + B
So now the value in A is 10 times the level .
Next we add # 28 ( 40 decimal ) to the result :
0F86 C628 ADD A ,#28 ; A = A + # 28 ( 40 decimal )
Now the value in A is 10 times the level , plus 40 , just like it is supposed to be .
Next we have a check that is run on the answer .
0F88 FE51 CP # 51 ; Is A >= # 51 ( 81 decimal ) ?
0F8A 3802 JR C,#0F8E ; No , then skip ahead to # 0F8E
0F8C 3E50 LD A,#50 ; Yes , then A = # 50 ( 80 decimal )
0F8E …
The game programmers wanted to make sure the timer never got above 8000 , so they coded in a check to see if the hundreds ever went higher than 80 , and if it did to force it back down to 80 .
Next , the result is stored .
0F8E 21B062 LD
HL , #62B0 ; Load HL
Address to store the result
0F91 0603 LD B,#03 ; For B = 1 to 3
0F93 77 LD ( HL ) , A ; Stores A in # 62B0 , # 62B1 , then # 62B2
0F94 2C INC L ; L = L + 1
0F95 10FC DJNZ # 0F93 ; Next B
This final set of instructions saves the answer computed for the timer into memory by writing the value into 3 locations : # 6280 , #6281 , and # 6282 .
The problem with this code is apparent :
There is no checking for overflow when doing the doubling , nor when doing the addition .
If the level number is large enough , the final result for the timer will lose the Carry flag , making the result mod 256 of the intended result .
As we have seen , the Carry flag is intentionally cleared each time before the number is doubled .
This all works together to create the “ kill screen ” on level 22 : the timer is computed as ( 22 * 10 ) + 40 = 260 , which is greater than 256 by 4 .
This gives level 22 a starting bonus of 400 , which is a very short time and makes it impossible to finish .
Now , most of this information so far was already known , at least to Jeff Kulczycki at the web page referenced in the introduction .
The next step is to create a fix for this code .
To be elegant , we want to implement the fix in the same or less space that the original program runs .
If we make the code shorter , that is OK because we can fill the extra space with NOP ( No OPeration ) commands .
But we can not take more room unless we jump out of the code here to a new subroutine and then jump back .
This would require finding unused memory in the program space for the fix code .
It turns out that one solution is possible ; there may be others .
Here is what we do .
First , we get rid of the code which checks if the result is greater than 81 .
Instead , we create a check right after loading the level into A to see if it is greater than 4 .
If A is greater than 4 , we force it back to 4 and continue with the rest of the code normally .
This means now that level 4 and above will always compute to a bonus of 80 hundreds , giving the desired result .
The fixed code fits exactly in the same space as the original :
0F7A 3A2962 LD
A ,(#6229 ) ; Load A with the level number
0F7D FE04 CP # 04 ; Is the level >= 4 ?
0F7 F 3802 JR C , # 0F83 ; If not , jump ahead and compute bonus normally
0F81 3E04 LD A , # 04 ; If it is , then set A = 4
0F83 47 LD B, A ; Copy A into B
0F84 A7 AND A ; Clear the carry flag
0F85 17 RLA ; Rotate
Left the bits in A
0F86 A7 AND A ; Clear the carry flag
0F87 17 RLA ; Rotate
Left the bits in A
0F88 A7 AND A ; Clear the carry flag
0F89 17 RLA ; Rotate Left the bits in A
0F8A 80 ADD A,B ; A = A + B
0F8B 80 ADD A,B ; A = A + B
0F8C C628 ADD A ,#28 ; A = A + # 28 ( 40 decimal )
0F8E 21B062 LD
HL , #62B0 ; Load HL
Address to store the result
Now we just need to get this fixed code back into the ROM named c_5et_g.bin .
There are two ways to do this .
One is to use a hex editor ( I use Hex Workshop ) and overwrite the locations of offset 0F7D through 0F8D with the new values [ FE 04 38 02 3E 04 47 A7 17 A7 17 A7 17 80 80 C6 28 ] .
The problem with this method is that MAME thinks the ROM is bad with an incorrect checksum .
Luckily , Donkey Kong does not have a self - test of its ROMs , so it will still play without problems .
Another way is to create a cheat for MAME to use , and load it when we need to use it .
The MAME cheat looks like this :
: dkong:20000001:0F8D:00000028:000000 FF:
No Kill Screen
: dkong:20710001:0F89:178080C6 : FFFFFFFF: No Kill Screen ( 2/5 )
: dkong:20710001:0F85:17A717A7 : FFFFFFFF: No Kill Screen ( 3/5 )
: dkong:20710001:0F81:3E0447A7 : FFFFFFFF: No Kill Screen ( 4/5 )
: dkong:20710001:0F7D:FE043802 : FFFFFFFF: No Kill Screen ( 5/5 )
The above text can be added to your MAME cheat .dat file .
Then the fix can be enabled in MAME as a cheat .
All the information you may need about MAME cheats can be found at http://cheat.retrogames.com
It helps to have some of the already known MAME cheats for Donkey Kong , like unlimited lives and set level .
Using the set level cheat , this patch has been tested and it does seem to work ; when we arrive at level 22 , the timer behaves correctly , and we can finish the level .
In addition to the bug which computes the timer , there is also a bug in the display of the timer .
Let ’s have a quick look at that :
063A 3AB062 LD A , (# 62B0 ) ; Load
A with value from initial timer
063D 010A00 LD BC , #000A ; Load B with 0 , load C with # 0A ( 10 decimal )
0640 04 INC B ; B counts how many tens
0641 91 SUB C ; subtract 10 decimal from A
0642 C24006 JP
NZ , #0640 ; keep repeating until zero
0645 78 LD A , B ; Load A with the number of tens in the counter
0646 07 RLCA ; rotate left four times …
0647 07 RLCA
0648 07 RLCA
0649 07 RLCA
064A 328C63 LD ( #638C ) , A ; store results to on screen timer .
The above segment of code will properly convert the hex value of the timer into its hex coded decimal equivalent , provided the input is in the expected range ( 50 , 60 , 70 , or 80 decimal ) .
For example , if the timer is # 50 , the algorithm generates an answer of # 80 to display on the screen ( 80 is decimal for # 50 ) .
However , if the input is outside the expected range ( not evenly divisible by 10 ) , the formula generates garbage .
This explains why the onscreen timer on level 22 is incorrect .
As we have seen above , the hundreds timer for level 22 gets computed as 4 .
When fed into this code , the answer that gets computed is A1 , which is not a decimal number and the game does n’t know how to display it properly .
This explains why the timer on level 22 is initially shown as 100 .
Finally , it turns out that there is another section of code which checks to see if the level is greater than or equal to 100 , and if it is , to force it back to 99 :
06E1 3A2962 LD
A ,(#6229 ) ; Load A with level number
06E4 FE64 CP # 64 ; Is A >= # 64 ( 100 decimal ) ?
06E6 3805 JR C,#06ED ;
If not , jump to ahead to # 06ED
06E8 3E63 LD A,#63 ; If yes , then load A with # 63 ( 99 decimal )
06EA 322962 LD ( # 6229 ) , A ; Push A back into level location
With the above code , it proves the game designers considered the possibility that level 100 could be reached and put in a cap to keep the level , and the level display , from overflowing .
This inclusion is very interesting given the timer bug prevents anyone from passing level 22 .
Comments and Conclusions I hope this excursion was as fun for you to read as it was for me to find and write up .
It is interesting to go back to this game , now 26 years old , and patch the code which prevents expert players from getting as high as they can get .
Given that only a handful of players have ever gotten that high , why did I even bother to do this ?
The answer lies in the fact that just because a program is old , does n't mean it can't someday be fixed , especially in a game that asks the player , " How High Can You Get ? " .

Little Tikes Cozy Coupe - Click above for high - res image gallery
The middle of June might seem like an odd time to release sales figures , but we 've just gotten word that previous reports announcing America 's best - selling vehicle may have been all wrong .
While the Ford F - Series pickup has topped the vehicle sales list for as long as we can remember , the car crown has shifted back - and - forth from the Taurus to the Accord to the Camry for the past few decades .
Or has it ?
A relatively unlikely American carmaker is now laying claim to that title .
Little Tikes Co. of Hudson , Ohio has released sales figures for its iconic Cozy Coupe showing that it has outsold all of those four - door family sedans throughout its 30 - year production run .
That 's right , the red plastic coupe with the yellow top turns 30 this year , and last year alone the company moved 457,000 of them , handily besting the Toyota Camry and Honda Accord While the Cozy Coupe you 're buying for your kids today might look just like the one you remember unwrapping yourself 30 years ago , it has actually undergone three revisions in that time .
The original Cozy Coupe was actually penned by former Chrysler designer , Jim Mariol , in 1979 .
It kicked off a riding toy craze that has n't subsided .
Rather than resting on their laurels , however , Little Tikes has taken the 30th anniversary of America 's favorite ride - on car as a great opportunity for a makeover .
The 2009 model gets Pixar - like eyes up front , a floorboard to keep tiny feet from getting caught under the seat , and a handle and cupholders for parents built into the roof .
Besides the classic Cozy Coupe , the company has also offered a variety of specialized models including the Princess edition , a Patrol police car , a Ride & Rescue fire company ride , a pickup truck and the uplevel Grand Coupe among others .
The American - made Cozy Coupe is even being enshrined in the Crawford Auto - Aviation Museum in Cleveland as one of the top twenty best selling models of all time .
Congrats on turning 30 and for snagging that best - selling car title .
Here 's to 30 more years of happy Little Tikes .
Is this the earliest image of St Paul ?
' Sensational ' 1,600 - year - old icon of saint found in a Roman tomb
This faded face , with a pointed beard and furrowed brow , is believed to be the oldest image in existence of St Paul the Apostle .
Vatican archaeologists uncovered the fresco in a catacomb beneath Rome with the help of a laser , which cleared away centuries of grime , clay and limestone .
The image was created in the 4th century , according to Barbara Mazzei , the director of work at the catacomb .
Ancient : Delighted archaeologists believes the fresco is the oldest picture of St Paul
' It was easy to see that it was Saint Paul because the style matched the iconography that we know existed at around the 4th Century - that is the thin face and the dark beard , ' she said .
' It is a sensational discovery and is of tremendous significance . '
The discovery was made at the Catacomb of Saint Thekla , who was a follower of St Paul and who was put to death under the Emperor Diocletian at the beginning of the 4th Century .
It was first uncovered on June 19 but was kept secret until yesterday to mark today 's religious holiday for the Feasts of St Peter and St Paul .
St Paul was a Roman Jew , born in Tarsus in modern - day Turkey , who started out persecuting Christians but later became one of the greatest influences in the Church .
He did not know Jesus in life but converted to Christianity after seeing a light on the road to Damascus and spent much of his life travelling and preaching .
He was executed for his beliefs around AD 65 .
Archbishop Gianfranco Ravasi , the Vatican 's cultural minister , said : ' This is a fascinating discovery and is testimony to the early Christian Church of nearly 2,000 years ago .
' It has a great theological and spiritual significance as well as being of historic and artistic importance . '

It did n't have a TV special , book deal or media - friendly pimping from the mayor of New York City , but a 12 million - year - old skull recently unearthed in Spain just might end up actually deserving the label of " missing link . "
The skull possesses a combination of primitive features previously unseen in a primate , along with a flat , anatomically modern face — the earliest such face in the fossil record .
These characteristics qualified it as the founding member of a new genus and species , Anoiapithecus brevirostris .
The findings , described Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , follow in the wake of Ida , a fossil lemur whose made - for - TV hype far outpaced its scientific value .
But A. brevirostris , despite its lack of fanfare , may be far more significant .
According to the Catalan Institute of Paleontology researchers who found the skull , A. brevirostris represents the last common ancestor of humans and the other great apes .
Only more fossils and years of study will reveal if that bold statement is true .
If so , then our evolutionary history is rooted in a primate lineage that arose in Africa , wandered into Eurasia , and then went back to Africa before returning to Eurasia in modern human form .
The " Out of Africa " theory , which postulates a tidy , totally African origin for modern humans and is a near - consensus position among scientists , would go out the window .

Video : Trials of robots to help out in the home are underway
Welcoming a lone robot like a Roomba vacuum cleaner into your home is no challenge and becoming more common .
But researchers in the UK are thinking about the problems of accommodating a whole staff of robotic servants with different tasks , bodies and features .
Controlling a varied team of them could , the British team fear , be as time - consuming and demanding as being the major - domo of a collection of human servants .
They think the answer is to give all the robots on a household staff a single artificial “ personality ” that jumps from one to another , giving the mistress or master of the house a single , familiar interface to interact with .
Divided attention
To test the idea , Kerstin Dautenhahn at the University of Hertfordshire in Hatfield , UK , and her team have created an ideal robotic home in a typical British suburban semi-detached house with around ten rooms across two floors ( see video ) .
Advertisement
The house has around five robots of varying shapes and sizes on the staff , as well as computer screens displaying a graphical companion called Greta , which allows the human residents a different way to interact with the robots .
But such a high - tech environment might overwhelm the average person , Dautenhahn says .
“ Studies show that people are n’t very good at dividing their attention among dozens of objects , ” she says .
“ It can be confusing having various machines in your house all operating simultaneously – are they actually doing what I told them to do ? ”
Head butler
Dautenhahn and her team decided to simplify things by creating a single interface that acts like a head butler , accepting commands from the homeowner on behalf of all the subordinate robots and answering questions .
But if that interface was tied to one “ butlerbot ” , the homeowner would have to seek out that particular machine whenever they wanted their robot staff to do something .
Furthermore , all the other machines in the house would be unhelpfully mute if accosted by the homeowner .
To get around that problem , the robotic “ head butler ” function can jump from machine to machine , so that at any point during a domestic chore the homeowner can accost and question the machine that ’s in action .
Essence of robot
“ If it [ the “ head butler ” interface ] reaches the limit of what it can do itself , it will move to another machine and then back to the machine near you , ” explains Dautenhahn .
“ So , for example , it can tell you it ’s been able to pick up the towels from the bathroom . ”
In their initial experiments , the “ head butler ” resides in only one machine at a time , so just one robot is active at any given moment .
Flipping control from one robot to another is not straightforward , though .
Jumping between robots with very different physical designs , and even to cellphones to allow the homeowner to take their “ butlerbot ” with them on holiday , creates what the team dub “ format issues ” .
There is also the question of what to transfer .
For example , detailed knowledge of the control of the robotic vacuum cleaner does n’t need to migrate to the dishwasher .
On the other hand , it ’s important to make sure that the homeowner still feels they are interacting with the same essence even if it ’s moved to a very new robotic “ body ” .
Bipedal stance
The arrival of the personality in a new robot might be indicated by a characteristic behaviour , says Dag Syrdal , a psychologist at Hertfordshire working on the project .
For instance , if the essence normally resides in a humanoid robot but has to switch to a robotic dog , the dogbot might suggest the transition has occurred by trying to stand on two legs .
“ But what I think is really important is to nurture a relationship between the user and the robotic agent , ” Syrdal says .
There have been studies showing how the interaction with a virtual agent is enhanced if the computer character becomes friendlier with time .
Syrdal hopes to design ways that each robot can give hints of the long - term relationship between the user and the core personality .
The Hertfordshire team ’s work is part of a Europe - wide project , Living with Robots and Interactive Companions ( LIREC ) , that aims to move robots out of the lab and into the home .
While the announcement of Metal Gear Solid : Rising at the Microsoft press conference may have been their showpiece announcement , a look at the E3 games list from Konami should surprise Metal Gear fans even more .
As we all know , the leaked June 2009 episode of Qore revealed not only the rumored PSP Go ! but also a new Metal Gear Solid title for the PSP .
Now , it looks like the official name of the game is revealed as well .
As seen in the image above , courtesy of IGN , Metal Gear Solid : Rising is coming to the PS3 , PC , and Xbox 360 as well as another MGS game called Metal Gear Solid : Peace Walker , exclusively for the PSP .
Even though the leaked episode of Qore ruined the surprise , this has only made us more excited for Sony ’s press conference today .

“ … nobody puts a value on pollination ; national accounts do not reflect the value of ecosystem services that stop soil erosion or provide watershed protection . “
Barry Gardiner , Labour MP for Brent North ( UK ) , Co-chairman , Global Legislators Organisation ‘s International Commission on Land Use Change and Ecosystems
Last week I read with great interest the BBC ’s Green Room opinion article by Barry Gardiner , Labour MP in the UK , about how the biodiversity crisis takes very much the back seat to climate change in world media , politics and international agreements .
He could n’t be more spot-on .
I must stipulate right up front that this post is neither a whinge , rant nor lament ; my goal is to highlight what I ’ve noticed about the world ’s general perception of climate change and biodiversity crisis issues over the last few years , and over the last year in particular since Conservation Bytes.com was born .
Case in point : my good friend and colleague , Professor Barry Brook , started his blog BraveNewClimate.com a little over a month ( August 2008 ) after I managed to get Conservation Bytes.com up and running ( July 2008 ) .
His blog tackles issues regarding the science of climate change , and Barry has been very successful at empirically , methodically and patiently tearing down the paper walls of the climate change denialists .
A quick glance at the number views of BraveNewClimate.com since inception reveals about an order of magnitude more than for ConservationBytes.com ( i.e. , ~ 195000 versus 20000 , respectively ) , and Barry has accumulated a total of around 4500 comments compared to just 231 for ConservationBytes.com .
The difference is striking .
Now , I do n’t begrudge for one moment this disparity – quite the contrary – I am thrilled that Barry has managed to influence so many people and topple so effectively the faecal spires erected by the myriad self - proclaimed ‘ experts ’ on climate change ( an infamous line to whom I have no idea to attribute states that “ opinions are like arseholes – everyone ’s got one ” ) .
Barry is , via BraveNewClimate.com , doing the world an immense service .
What I do find intriguing is that in many ways , the biodiversity crisis is a much , much worse problem that is and will continue to degrade human life for millennia to come .
Yet as Barry Gardiner observed , the UK papers mentioned biodiversity only 115 times over the last 3 months compared to 1382 times for climate change – again , that order - of - magnitude disparity .
There is no biodiversity equivalent of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( although there are a few international organisations tackling the extinction crisis such as the United Nation ’s Environment Program , the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment and the International Union for Conservation of Nature ) , we still have little capacity or idea how to incorporate the trillions of dollars worth of ecosystem services supplied every year to us free of charge , and we have nothing at all equivalent to the Kyoto Protocol for biodiversity preservation .
Yet , conservation biologists have for decades demonstrated how human disease prevalence , reduction in pollination , increasing floods , reduced freshwater availability , carbon emissions , loss of fish supplies , weed establishment and spread , etc. are all exacerbated by biodiversity loss .
Climate change , as serious and potentially apocalyptic as it is , can be viewed as just another stressor in a system stressed to its limits .
Of course , the lack of ‘ interest ’ may not be as bleak as indicated by web traffic ; I believe the science underpinning our assessment of biodiversity loss is fairly well - accepted by people who care to look into these things , and the evidence spans the gambit of biological diversity and ecosystems .
In short , it ’s much less controversial a topic than climate change , so it attracts a lot less vitriol and spawns fewer polemics .
That said , it is a self - destructive ambivalence that will eventually come to bite humanity on the bum in the most serious of ways , and I truly believe that we ’re not far off from major world conflicts over the dwindling pool of resources ( food , water , raw materials ) we are so effectively destroying .
We would be wise to take heed of the warnings .

i Phone OS 3.0 Has Tethering , It ’s Just Hidden
Most of the bad news coming with the iPhone OS 3.0 release is from AT&T , the iPhone ’s sole US carrier .
Despite most every other iPhone carrier in the world enabling tethering and MMS today , AT&T did not , much to her users ’ chagrin .
The software is there , though , and it ’s taken less than a day for someone to figure out a hack ( for tethering that is – MMS has been around since the first jailbreak ) .
The guys at MacMegasite have a quick and dirty tutorial to get the thing running .
In short , all it requires is that you download a carrier settings file and perform a defaults write command in a Mac terminal .
Restore your phone while holding option down and you can add the carrier settings update without messing with the rest of your phone .
Head to “ Network ” under your general settings and you should see tethering , with options for USB and Bluetooth functionality .
Early reports suggest things are a little slow , and I have yet to read of a successful PC mod for this .
Still , good work from everyone involved with this ( seems like MacMegasite , Gizmodo , and AppleNova for some quick credits ) .
Have you tried this yet ?
Did it work for you ?

The launch of a new paper in Zimbabwe is testament to the dogged resistance to state pressure by a band of idealists , writes ROBYN DIXONin Harare
THE NEWSPAPER consists of a small office with one authentically untidy desk and one table bare but for a borrowed laptop .
A couple of chairs .
Newspapers and papers stacked on the floor .
And Boss Barns .
That would be Barnabas Thondhlana , one of Zimbabwe ’s best - known newspapermen .
He sits at the messy desk , explaining the vague order in the various piles .
The big one is job applications , hundreds of them .
The ones he does n’t like ( including those of four former state spies ) get thrown onto the floor .
Boss Barns , as he is fondly known to his colleagues and drinking pals at the Quill Club , was there on the day in 2003 when armed police shut down the country ’s last independent daily , the Daily News .
They ordered the journalists out and put a padlock as big as his hand on the front door .
Now the affable 47 - year - old is about to launch a new independent daily , NewsDay .
It is the first major test of media freedom under Zimbabwe ’s new government of national unity , set up in a political compromise after president Robert Mugabe and his Zanu - PF party lost elections last year but refused to give up power .
No launch date has been set for NewsDay .
The big question mark is whether the ministry of media , information and publicity , controlled by hardline Mugabe loyalists , will give the paper a licence to operate .
Trevor Ncube , NewsDay backer and owner of the Zimbabwe Independent , a weekly , and South Africa ’s Mail & Guardian , says he has spoken to government ministers from all sides : “ And I have n’t received a single indication that there ’s somebody who does n’t want us to be licensed , ” he says .
His aim is to produce a paper trusted not only by Zanu - PF but by its erstwhile partner in the unity government , the Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) .
“ We need a newspaper that says it ’s okay to disagree .
The fact that I disagree does n’t mean that I should wish you dead .
“ That ’s the environment we have come from , ” says Ncube , who describes himself as an idealist .
The Daily Newswas the first big independent daily in Zimbabwe , where state - controlled and subsidised media such as the Heraldvoiced the ruling party line .
With the slogan “ Telling It Like It Is ” , cheeky cartoons and reports investigating corruption and abuses , the Daily Newssaw its circulation soar to more than 100,000 .
Thondhlana was news editor when it launched in 1999 – the same year the MDC was formed by Morgan Tsvangirai , now the country ’s prime minister .
He later became editor of the Sunday Daily News .
“ The vision was to give the population news that was not being covered by the state media .
We did n’t think it was dangerous , ” Thondhlana says .
But after Zanu - PF was nearly defeated in the 2000 elections , it cracked down .
The spies of the Central Intelligence Organisation , Zimbabwe ’s KGB , circled closer .
The paper ’s editor , Geoff Nyarota , was riding in the lift with a stranger one morning around that time .
The man confessed that he had been sent to kill Nyarota , but could not bring himself to do it , Thondhlana says .
In 2001 , a large bomb destroyed the paper ’s printing press .
Later that year , a shop beneath the editor ’s office was blown up .
In 2002 , the paper ’s office in the city of Bulawayo was gas - bombed .
Nyarota was arrested twice , and numerous other Daily Newsjournalists were arrested and charged .
“ Some people [ at the paper ] were saying , ‘ Look , we ca n’t put our lives on the block for a newspaper .
Maybe we should leave some of the issues we covered and go more social ’ , ” Thondhlana says .
But the paper stuck to its guns .
“ I said , ‘ Guys , let us stay resolved .
We are here to provide balanced news .
We must stick to that because for every head on a coin , there ’s a tail . ’
“ We just decided we would not accept to be frightened .
We would not stop covering the news the way we had covered the news . ”
In those days , colleagues recall affectionately , Boss Barns was a real pro .
He could have walked straight out of the Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon film The Front Page .
Yes , he sometimes took long lunches .
“ But he would then come back and work deep into the night to clear everything that was on his table , ” says Augustine Mukaro , a former colleague .
“ Young guys would compete to be close to Boss Barns , just to enjoy the fun of being near Boss Barns . ”
On the day the newspaper was shut down , editors and journalists , believing the closure was temporary , were afraid to resist the police who stormed in .
“ They just said , ‘ This newspaper is closed , you ’re going home . ’
Armed soldiers came and pushed everybody out , ” Thondhlana says .
Zimbabwe ’s media law , which was used to shut down the Daily News , has not been repealed , as Tsvangirai struggles against recalcitrant Zanu - PF hardliners in the unity government .
There are some ominous signs : the editor and news editor of the Zimbabwe Independentwere arrested and jailed overnight last week for publishing the names of police and intelligence agents who arrested civic and opposition activists last year .
Ncube concedes that it could take time for NewsDayto take off , but believes a freer press for Zimbabwe is close .
“ I ’m a pragmatist .
I do n’t expect people who are intolerant of a free press and free flow of information to be born - again lovers of plural media .
It will take some cajoling , some trust - building .
But it will happen .
I have no doubt about that . ”
But there are tough financial challenges : most Zimbabweans are simply too poor to buy newspapers , and the few surviving businesses can barely afford to advertise .

Impasse : pact on key posts elusive
Zimbabwe ’s powersharing government has resolved most disagreements but is deadlocked on the appointments of attorney general and central bank governor , whose tenure was marked by hyperinflation .
Prime minister Morgan Tsvangirai ( left ) told a press conference the regional Southern African Development Community would be asked to mediate .
The posts of central bank chief Gideon Gono , an ally of president Robert Mugabe , and that of the attorney general have been the most contentious in the fragile unity government formed by Mr Mugabe and Mr Tsvangirai in February .
Critics say Mr Gono printed money , pushing the country ’s inflation rate to the world ’s highest .
They also allege he raided private bank accounts to shore up Mr Mugabe ’s regime .
Human - rights groups accuse the attorney general of presiding over the prosecution of opposition activists .

They did n't use those exact words , of course , but in a group statement signed by the Human Rights Campaign , the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force , Lambda Legal , the ACLU , and other big national organizations — organizations that are typically cautious and concerned about preserving their access — they come as close to " FUCK YOU " as they 're ever going to get :
We are very surprised and deeply disappointed in the manner in which the Obama administration has defended the so - called Defense of Marriage Act against Smelt v. United States , a lawsuit brought in federal court in California by a married same - sex couple asking the federal government to treat them equally with respect to federal protections and benefits .
The administration is using many of the same flawed legal arguments that the Bush administration used .
These arguments rightly have been rejected by several state supreme courts as legally unsound and obviously discriminatory .
We disagree with many of the administration ’s arguments , for example that DOMA is a valid exercise of Congress ’s power , is consistent with Equal Protection or Due Process principles , and does not impinge upon rights that are recognized as fundamental .
We are also extremely disturbed by a new and nonsensical argument the administration has advanced suggesting that the federal government needs to be “ neutral ” with regard to its treatment of married same - sex couples in order to ensure that federal tax money collected from across the country not be used to assist same - sex couples duly married by their home states .
There is nothing " neutral " about the federal government ’s discriminatory denial of fair treatment to married same - sex couples : DOMA wrongly bars the federal government from providing any of the over one thousand federal protections to the many thousands of couples who marry in six states .
This notion of “ neutrality ” ignores the fact that while married same - sex couples pay their full share of income and social security taxes , they are prevented by DOMA from receiving the corresponding same benefits that married heterosexual taxpayers receive .
It is the married same - sex couples , not heterosexuals in other parts of the country , who are financially and personally damaged in significant ways by DOMA .
For the Obama administration to suggest otherwise simply departs from both mathematical and legal reality .
When President Obama was courting lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender voters , he said that he believed that DOMA should be repealed .
We ask him to live up to his emphatic campaign promises , to stop making false and damaging legal arguments , and immediately to introduce a bill to repeal DOMA and ensure that every married couple in America has the same access to federal protections .

Jane Jacobs long ago argued that cities are the cradles of civilization and of economic development and that density and human interaction hold the key to economic progress .
The findings of a major new study published in Science finds that density is a key factor in the emergence of modern human behavior .
Increasing population density , rather than boosts in human brain power , appears to have catalysed the emergence of modern human behaviour , according to a new study by UCL ( University College London ) scientists published in the journal Science .
High population density leads to greater exchange of ideas and skills and prevents the loss of new innovations .
It is this skill maintenance , combined with a greater probability of useful innovations , that led to modern human behaviour appearing at different times in different parts of the world .
In the study , the UCL team found that complex skills learnt across generations can only be maintained when there is a critical level of interaction between people .
Using computer simulations of social learning , they showed that high and low - skilled groups could coexist over long periods of time and that the degree of skill they maintained depended on local population density or the degree of migration between them .
Using genetic estimates of population size in the past , the team went on to show that density was similar in sub-Saharan Africa , Europe and the Middle - East when modern behaviour first appeared in each of these regions .
The paper also points to evidence that population density would have dropped for climatic reasons at the time when modern human behaviour temporarily disappeared in sub-Saharan Africa .
Google Australia opened the doors to its new Sydney headquarters today and it was easy to see why the company was found by BRW to be the best place to work in the country - the office appears more like a day - care centre for adults than a workplace .
The new building , located in the harbourside suburb Pyrmont , now houses 350 Australian Googlers who have been the driving force behind several global Google products including Google Maps and the forthcoming Google Wave , which seeks to reinvent email .
But the media pack touring the new building today could be forgiven for wondering how any work gets done , as staff are constantly tempted by copious free perks , including games rooms , snack rooms filled with junk food and several chill - out areas built around themes such as parks and the ocean .
When they 're not hard at work , Australian Googlers can relax in a hammock , bean bag or lounge chair while playing any of the three major games consoles , pool , table tennis and any number of board games .
A live webcam allows them to see if the equipment is being used without leaving their desk .
Google chefs provide free breakfast , lunch and dinner , and dishes are colour - coded green , yellow or red to allow staff to gauge how healthy their meal choice is .
A new term , the " Google 15 ' ' , was coined to describe the weight people add upon starting at Google .
" People tend to go nuts when they first start and eat a lot , '' Google Australia 's first employee , Kate Vale , said .
The campus - style office , the first six - star Green Star building in NSW , was officially opened this morning by the Governor - General , Quentin Bryce .
Much of the decor is green - themed , with the reception area resembling a rainforest and a plethora of plants dotted all over the office .
Google used the event to announce that it would add timetable information for Sydney 's light rail and monorail network , and Canberra 's bus network , to Google Maps this month .
Google Maps users can already use the service to plan public transport trips in Adelaide and Perth .
Google also announced a partnership with Fairfax Media to provide free access to digitised archival copies of The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age - dating back to the late 1800s and early 1900s - through Google News and Google Search .
Overseas , Google 's fun - filled campuses and playful decor have helped fuel Google 's run of good PR .
Journalists have long drooled over the perks offered to US Google employees including a workout room , laundry room , massage room , video games , ping pong , pool table and snack rooms stocked with free food and drinks .
Today 's event sought to extend the hallowed perception of the Googleplex to Australia .
The new office contains a number of Australian - themed areas , including offices with picnic benches , fish tanks , Australian flora , the beach - themed " Cafe ' Esky " , a sports - themed mini kitchen and a games room named " The Rissole " .
The Aussie - inspired meeting rooms - with names such as Billabong , Eucalyptus , Iced Vo-Vo and Howzat - leave little doubt that Google is going for a distinctly Australian look .
Indeed , some of the rooms were built to resemble dunnies .
" It 's an architectural style that can best be described as Googley , " Google Australia head of engineering Alan Noble said .
The only perk Australian Googlers miss out on is a company gym , but , in addition to free meals , all staff are provided with free private health cover .
After an initial gaffe , when she pronounced Google Australia CEO Karim Temsamani's name as " Tebasabi ' ' , Ms Bryce praised Google for providing the space and time " for Australian ideas to emerge , develop and proliferate " .
" I can imagine few other companies that have their own verb , '' she said , noting that the term ``Google ' ' had entered the vernacular .
" [ It 's ] a mark not only of the evolution of our language - however weird - but of the way Google has influenced our culture , our society , our habits and speech and our way of engaging with the world and the web . ''
In April , a BRW study , conducted by the Great Place to Work Institute , found Google was the No.1 company to work for in Australia .
The commendation was quite a feat considering Google Australia started in Australia only in 2002 , with a single employee selling advertising from her lounge .
The company operated from an office building in Darling Park before the move to Pyrmont .
The study surveyed 15,000 Australians , who lauded Google 's perks including its free cafeteria , ping - pong tables and beanbag - filled meeting rooms .
Earlier , Google 's US campus topped a 1000 Best Place To Work survey conducted by the US magazine Fortune .
In 2001 , one country decided to end the criminal treatment of possession or use of street drugs , to counter alarming numbers of deaths and HIV infections .
Dealers and traffickers are still locked up .
Users are n't .
Glenn Greenwald put the study together for CATO .
Its results are striking :
The number of deaths from street drug overdoses dropped from around 400 to 290 annually , and the number of new HIV cases caused by using dirty needles to inject heroin , cocaine and other illegal substances plummeted from nearly 1,400 in 2000 to about 400 in 2006 , according to a report released recently by the Cato Institute , a Washington , D.C , libertarian think tank .
" Now instead of being put into prison , addicts are going to treatment centers and they 're learning how to control their drug usage or getting off drugs entirely , " report author Glenn Greenwald , a former New York State constitutional litigator , said during a press briefing at Cato last week .

An exhaustive list of America 's nuclear sites – including maps showing the location of fuel for nuclear weapons – has been accidentally posted on a government website , but the Obama administration denied that the leak had jeopardised national security .
The 266 - page document , marked " highly confidential " , was removed from the website of the Government Printing Officelast night following media inquiries .
Barack Obama had ordered the report for the International Atomic Energy Agency in the hopes of prodding other countries , such as Iran , to submit similar classified information nuclear activities to the agency .
In his accompanying letter to Congress , Obama described the information as " sensitive but unclassified " .
Nearly every page is stamped " highly confidential safeguards sensitive " .
" The enclosed draft declaration lists each site , location , facility , and activity I intend to declare to the IAEA , " he wrote .
It was not immediately clear how the report , with details of hundreds of US nuclear facilities , including reactor sites and confidential sites at weapons labs , ended up on the website of the Government Printing Office .
Its publication was first noted on Monday by Steve Aftergood , who publishes a blog on government secrecy at the Federation of American Scientists .
The report contains information on America 's nuclear weapons labs at Los Alamos in New Mexico , Livermore and Sandia as well as scores of other nuclear sites .
In its potentially most serious breach , the report provides a map showing the exact location of a storage site for highly enriched weapons grade uranium at the heavily guarded Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee .
The Obama administration admitted the information should never have been released .
But Damien LaVera , a spokesman for the National Nuclear Security Administration , said in a statement that the disclosure posed no risk to security .
" The departments of energy , defence and commerce and the [ Nuclear Regulatory Commission ] all thoroughly reviewed it to ensure that no information of direct national security significance would be compromised . "
Even so , some security analysts today raised concerns that thieves or terrorists could make use of the maps that show where the nuclear fuels are stored .
Kit Bond , the leading Republican on the Senate 's intelligence committee , told reporters it was a " virtual treasure map for terrorists . "
However , military and civilian experts concluded that the document – while offering an extensive account of the US nuclear complex – did not pose a serious danger as much of the information was already in the public realm .
" These screw - ups happen , " John Deutch , a former director of central intelligence and deputy secretary of defence told the New York Times .
" It 's going further than I would have gone but does n't look like a serious breach . "
Analysts say the meeting will help to ease tensions
The leaders of India and Pakistan have met for the first time since last November 's Mumbai ( Bombay ) attacks .
Indian PM Manmohan Singh and Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari held talks on the sidelines of a summit in the Russian city of Yekaterinburg .
Mr Singh said he had to tell Mr Zardari that Pakistani territory must not be used for terrorism against India .
Relations between the two countries nosedived after Delhi said the Mumbai gunmen were from Pakistan .
More than 170 people died in the attacks , including nine gunmen .
Pakistan denied any responsibility in their immediate aftermath , but later admitted they had been partly planned from its soil .
The sole surviving suspected gunman is Pakistani and is currently on trial in Mumbai .
' Positive development ' " I am happy to meet you , but my mandate is to tell you that the territory of Pakistan must not be used for terrorism , " Mr Singh told Mr Zardari at the meeting .
Pakistan 's foreign minister described the meeting as a " positive development " and played down any suggestion that Mr Singh 's frank words had got proceedings off to a difficult start .
The BBC's Jill McGivering says the meeting was never expected to produce a breakthrough formula for reviving the stalled peace process .
But , she adds , the fact that the two leaders met at all is a positive sign and a measure of growing political willingness to seek new momentum .
Pakistani officials said after the meeting that foreign ministry officials from both countries will meet soon to discuss pertinent issues .
More than 170 people died in the attacks in Mumbai last November Mr Singh had said earlier this month that his government would seek to mend fences with Pakistan provided it cracked down on militants , in an address India 's newly - constituted parliament .
The statement did not represent any dramatic shift in policy .
Our correspondent says that for both leaders , any attempt to compromise is hampered by strong public suspicion at home .
While Mr Singh has been under considerable pressure to act tough , Pakistan is being urged by the US to improve its relationship with India so it can concentrate on tackling the insurgency on its own soil .
Pakistan 's military is engaged in a series of offensives against Taliban militants across the north - west of the country .
India and Pakistan both have observer status in the Yekaterinburg summit for the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation , which include Russia , China and former Soviet Central Asian republics .
Strains India pulled out of long - running peace talks with Pakistan following the Mumbai attacks .
It has since accused Pakistan of " not being serious enough " about bringing those who planned the Mumbai attacks to justice .
The recent release on bail of Hafiz Saeed , the head of the Islamic charity Jamaat - ud - Dawa , put further strain on relations between the two countries .
The charity is accused of being a front for Lashkar - e - Taiba , the group India says carried out the attacks .
Jamaat - ud - Dawa - listed by the US as a terrorist organisation - denies any links with militants .

Back in April , Wired magazine published a story on the history of a strange monument in rural Elberton , Georgia ( “ granite capital of the world ” ) known as the Georgia Guidestones .
The monument consists of four 16 - foot - high slabs of granite arranged around a central column and topped with a capstone weighing 25,000 pounds .
Carved onto the face of each slab is a list of ten precepts for creating a better society , written in eight modern languages .
On the four sides of the capstone are written the words , “ Let These Be Guidestones to An Age of Reason ” in Sanskrit , Babylonian cuneiform , Classical Greek , and Egyptian hieroglyphs .
The central column and capstone are also equipped with holes , astronomically aligned so that the Guidestones can serve as a compass and clock .
The popular consensus is that these stones were meant to survive a global apocalypse and aid survivors in creating a new , enlightened society .
Unveiled in 1980 , and built by an unknown party , the monument has stood for nearly thirty years outside of town , attracting the curious to Elberton .
However , in the last ten years the Guidestones have garnered the attention of conspiracy theorists , who see their message as anti-Christian and a call for a global government .
This new reading of the Guidestones ultimately led vandals to deface the monument sometime in December 2008 .
The official story of the Guidestones ’ origin is that Joe Fendley Sr. , president of the Elberton Finishing Company , was contacted in 1979 by one “ Robert C. Christian ” to commission a monument .
Christian was a pseudonym used by someone representing “ a small group of loyal Americans who believe in God . ”
Fendley has since died , but Randall Sullivan of Wired interviewed Wyatt Martin , the president of Granite City Bank and the only living man who allegedly met Christian .
As the project ’s banker , Martin allegedly learned Christian ’s true name but will not reveal it .
Martin claims he received letters and phone calls from Christian until “ around the time of the 9/11 terrorist attacks ” and assumes Christian is dead ; though some believe Christian never existed .
While construction was still underway , Martin and Fendley were accused of perpetuating a hoax , either out of amusement or to promote Fendley ’s business .
Both men took lie detector tests , which they passed .
Sullivan suggests that the hoax rumor may have come from rival granite workers .
According to Jim Miles ( author of Weird Georgia ) , shortly after the Guidestones were unveiled , a local minister stated his suspicion that “ Mr. Christian is not a Christian ” and that the monument was designed for the worship of the sun as well as the devil .
Contemporary Pagans , UFO buffs , and New Agers were naturally attracted by the mystery of the site .
New myths were created that the monument was built upon a “ power - nexus ” or a place sacred to Native Americans .
One legend holds that visitors who point both arms at the monument ( one palm up , one palm down ) will receive a psychic message from the stones .
Another Guidestone admirer , Yoko Ono , composed a three - movement score entitled “ Georgia Stone . ”
In 2000 , Dr. Reagan R. Davis , a Christian minister , visited the stones and concluded that the Guidestones may well describe the ten commandments of the Antichrist .
Particularly upsetting were the precepts to “ Maintain humanity under 500 million in perpetual balance with nature , ” “ Guide reproduction wisely encouraging fitness and diversity , ” and “ Let all nations rule internally , resolving external disputes in a world court . ”
Davis interpreted these messages as a call for a world government , a policy of state - sponsored eugenics , and the culling of billions of people .
This new interpretation elevated the Guidestones from mere local curiosity to the subject of national notoriety among conspiracy theorists and Christian dispensationalists .
Conspiracy buffs were quick to point out the similarities between the pseudonym “ R.C. Christian ” and Christian Rosenkreuz , the legendary founder of the esoteric Rosicrucian Order .
( Documents attributed to Rosenkreuz were signed “ Frater C.R.C . ” ) .
Christians added that The Age of Reason is also the title of a book by Thomas Paine , which challenges the inerrancy of the Bible .
Through numerous
Web sites and talk radio programs , a narrative eventually emerged in which the Guidestones ( along with ancient esoteric societies like the Masons , eugenics , perceived anti-Christian hostility , and globalization ) were all part of a single monolithic entity known as the “ New World Order . ”
The goal of the New World Order is the creation of a single world government and the destruction of national sovereignty and religion .
A significant number of Christian dispensationalists subscribe to this view and believe that the New World Order was foretold in the Book of Revelation .
In 2005 , Mark Dice ( using the pseudonym “ John Connor ” in reference to the Terminator film franchise ) organized a Christian group opposed to the New World Order called “ The Resistance ” and began a campaign to have the monument destroyed .
In 2007 , radio personality and filmmaker Alex Jones released a documentary entitled Endgame : Blueprint for Global Enslavement , outlining a plan by the Bilderberg group and other global elites to exterminate eighty percent of humanity .
The Georgia Guidestones are cited as primary evidence of this plot .
The call of The Resistance was eventually answered with an attack on the stones by vandals who used a can of red spray - paint to write messages such as , “ The elite want 80 % of us dead , ” “ 9 - 11 inside job , ” “ Obama iz a Muslim , ” and “ Council on Foreign Relations is ran by the Devil . ”
The stones were also splashed with polyurethane , which is especially difficult to remove .
The vandalism has been celebrated on numerous Web sites discussing the New World Order ’s agenda ; with only a few dissenting voices pointing out that any assault on free speech , even the free speech of an anonymous cabal , threatens the rights of all .
The vandalism of the Guidestones seems to be a classic case of an eccentric and lofty idea under assault by the hoi polloi .
In fact , a letter from the monument ’s benefactors printed by the Elberton Granite Finishing Company predicted just such a scenario .
They ask that the people of Elberton County restore the stones should they be “ scattered by people of little understanding .
”
The short history of the Guidestones has parallels with the history of other mysterious messages and prophesies .
It seems plausible that whoever invented the name “ R. C. Christian ” — be this an actual cabal or Fendley and Martin — had some knowledge of Rosicrucianism .
( Fendley was active in the local Shrine Club where he could have been exposed to Rosicrucian lore . )
There are interesting similarities between the Guidestones and the origin of the Rosicrucian legend .
A European preoccupation with the mysterious Rosicrucian order began in Germany with the appearance of two anonymous documents in the early 17th century : Fama Fraternitatis and Confessio Fraternitatis .
Clearly someone wrote these documents although , much like the Guidestones , there is little evidence to determine whether these messages were a legitimate manifesto from a secret brotherhood or an elaborate hoax .
But regardless of their origin , the excitement generated in the wake of anonymous messages is very real .
Numerous modern esoteric groups claim a connection to the Rosicrucians just as conspiracy theorists regard the Guidestones as vital evidence of a demonic globalist agenda .
Another interesting parallel can be drawn between the Guidestones and the Book of Revelation .
Both are texts of little - known origin warning of future peril .
These conditions allow for historical - critical as well as dispensationalist readings of both messages .
Scholars believe the Book of Revelation was written sometime in the first century and is a warning to early Christians not to conform to the evils of Greco - Roman society .
Although the Guidestones were constructed relatively recently , they too have a historical context .
The letter from the Guidestones ’ benefactors describes the problem of global overpopulation and warns that , “ Armageddon can be prevented . ”
Whoever planned the monument in 1979 most likely imagined that Armageddon would take the form of nuclear war with the Soviet Union .
“ R.C. Christian ” could not possibly have predicted the events referenced by the vandals , such as the attacks of September 11 or the election of Barack Obama .
But Dice , and others like him , read the Guidestones much as they read the Book of Revelation : not as historical artifacts but as important clues to understanding current events .
Stripping the messages of their historical contexts allows them to converge , so that they mutually confirm a dualistic cosmology in which Christians must battle the New World Order .
Thus , evidence of the New World Order ’s unfolding plot can be found both in the Book of Revelation and in the Georgia Guidestones .
Likewise , Dice ’s use of the pseudonym “ John Connor ” is very telling .
Like the character in Terminator , he likely sees himself as one who knows the future and is fighting to prevent it from happening .
The history of the Guidestones is ultimately an interesting study in the heterogeneous nature of symbols .
To build something so extraordinary with so little explanation created a vacuum of meaning .
Much like the Guidestones ’ inspiration , Stonehenge , this caused new meanings to be invented .
The Guidestones are essentially a spiritual and political Rorschach test onto which any number of ideas can be imposed .
Pagans and New Agers created new myths and rituals , imbuing the stones with sacred reverence .
For others , the monument is not the marker of a sacred space but the evidence of a demonic plot .
Should the Guidestones survive for centuries as their creators intended , many more meanings could arise , equally unrelated to the designer ’s original intention .

Disasters like Hurricane Nargis can't be prevented but could be planned for
The risk of disaster worldwide is increasing , says a new UN report .
Climate change , environmental degradation and badly planned urban development are more likely to affect populations around the world .
The report warns that millions of lives are in jeopardy because proper risk assessment is rarely carried out , particularly in developing countries .
The UN says money spent on risk reduction is a cost - effective way to reduce deaths and injuries .
The Asian tsunami of 2004 , or last year 's earthquake in China are natural phenomenon which can't be prevented .
But the Global Assessment on Disaster Risk Reduction says there is a lot we can do to reduce our own risk - the problem is , we are n't doing it .
We already know that climate change means more extreme weather events - but the UN's Assistant Secretary General Margareta Wahlstrom says most countries have failed to look at how that will affect their own towns and cities .
The local effects of disasters like the 2004 tsunami need research " We do n't know enough of the impact of climate change at local level , " she explained .
" We know a lot about the global parameters but how it is going to play out in local communities , we do n't have enough research , knowledge and scientific basis for that yet . "
The report highlights some staggering differences in risk assessment and reduction between rich and poor countries .
Japan and the Philippines for example have equal exposure to tropical cyclones - but for every one death in Japan , 17 people die in the Philippines .
This report is aimed not at the emergency services , but at governments and their planning and finance ministers .
The UN says spending money on risk reduction is a good investment - while loss of life , property and livelihoods is very costly .

CAMP VICTORY , Iraq 
It was Sunday night in Baghdad , and President Obama was ordering Gen. Ray Odierno , the commander of the American troops here , to shave Stephen Colbert ’s head .
( Not to give everything away , but the general is not as brutal with an electric razor as one would expect a bald man to be ; Mr. Colbert ’s hairdresser , on the other hand , has a merciless streak . )
War , as things go , is a fairly unironic exercise .
Sure , there are endless incongruities to be found and parodied in the speeches about war from politicians , generals and heads of state .
But war itself  the dirty , dangerous business of soldiers on the ground  seems to be about as earnest a trade as you can find .
Into this comes Mr. Colbert .
He is taping four episodes of “ The Colbert Report , ” the Comedy Central show featuring his egotistical , fake - macho , nationalist blowhard alter ego , in Baghdad this week .
It ’s the first time in the history of the U.S.O. that a full - length nonnews show has been filmed , edited and broadcast from a combat zone .
The week of shows , taped a day or two before they are broadcast , is called “ Operation Iraqi Stephen : Going Commando , ” and it has a pretty fancy guest list ( in addition to General Odierno , and the president , whose appearance was taped ahead ) that includes Iraq ’s deputy prime minister .
But there is also something kind of meta about the whole thing .
Mr. Colbert ’s entire career is based on being gleefully insincere , a man who literally wraps himself in the flag to the screaming of majestic computer - generated eagles .
A New York Times article has just confirmed that the US Government has been “ working for several days ” with the coup planners in Honduras to halt the illegal overthrow of President Zelaya .
While this may indicate nobility on behalf of the Obama Administration , had they merely told the coupsters that the US Government would CUT OFF all economic aid and blockade Honduras in the event of a coup , it ’s almost a 100 % guarantee that the military and right wing parties and business groups involved in the coup would not have gone through with it .
So , while many make excuses for the Obama Administration ’s “ calculated ” statements , had they been more firm with the coup leaders , instead of “ negotiating ” , the coup may never have happened .
Also , the State Department says they believed “ dialogue ” was the best way to resolve the situation , but their lack of clarity and firm position has caused multiple human rights violations to occur in Honduras and a lot of tension to take place in the region .
And during the April 2002 coup against Chávez in Venezuela , the State Department also claimed it knew of the coup and tried to “ stop ” it .
Later , in my investigations , it was discovered through documents from State and CIA declassified under the Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) that CIA , State and other US agencies , funded , supported , advised and armed the coup leaders .

Here is the NY Times article posted a few hours ago .

CYBER MENTORS ( www.cybermentors.org.uk)
Cyber Mentors
The Internet can be a worrying place for children , especially when you hear stories about online bullying .
Cyber Mentors is a UK charity and a community where children can get support and advice from other children , as well as trained professionals - whether they are experiencing problems online or out in the physical world .
The young volunteers who make up the cyber mentor fellowship have all been trained by the charity to be children 's first port of call if they feel they cannot talk about their problems with a grown - up .
They will support and encourage youngsters - urging them to go to a parent or teacher - but there are also councillors available to deal with any serious issues .
Since the site went live a few months ago they have helped 70,000 children , and have just trained up their 1,000th volunteer .
Users need to register to talk to a mentor , and they do ask for some details about your mobile phone , which the site 's creators say is not used for marketing purposes - just their own internal research .

A research project at the University of Gothenburg has been testing large groups of 13 - year - olds in Sweden since the early 1960s using the same intelligence test .
The tests have taken place at approximately five year intervals and consist of an inductive - logic test , a verbal test and a spatial test .
Crucial factor
The most recent study , which was reported in the new issue of Journal of Swedish Educational Research , shows that today ’s teenagers are achieving demonstrably better results in the logic test than was the case fifty years ago .
This is positive as logic is a crucial factor for achievement in mathematics .
" With regard to pupils chances of assimilating maths teaching , there is thus nothing to indicate that the preconditions have deteriorated in recent decades , " says Professor Allan Svensson at the Department of Education .
No inferior talents
The claim has recently been made that Swedish pupils ’ mathematical skills are declining when compared with other countries .
This should therefore not be to do with inferior talents , but rather with factors such as course content , teaching methodologies , teaching media and teaching skills .
The development is not as positive in terms of teenagers ’ verbal capacity .
After an increase during the 1960s , the test values start declining slowly before falling even more substantially from 1985 .
Uncommon words
This is primarily due to the fact that the test is a vocabulary test and many of the words that are included are relatively uncommon in current Swedish .
The analyses also reveal that it is precisely the old - fashioned words , such as ” destitution ” and ” copious ” , that over time have become more difficult for teenagers , while words such as ” separate ” and ” attack ” have become easier for them to deal with .
" I would hazard to contend that the pupil ’s vocabulary is no smaller now that it was in the 1960s , but that it partially consists of other words .
The prerequisites for today ’s pupils to assimilate teaching in Swedish are consequently not inferior , " says Allan Svensson .
Girls perform better
Teenagers ’ spatial capacity , the so - called power of spatial imagination , is higher now than it was in the 1960s .
This capacity has however diminished somewhat during recent decades , principally as a consequence of weaker attainment by boys .
In its turn this has led to girls now performing better than boys in this test , while the situation was the reverse 50 years ago .

IT WAS a terrible night for European socialists , but also a worrying night for those who believe in a Europe of open borders .
As elections for a new European Parliament ended on Sunday June 7th , after four days of voting in 27 countries , it became clear that not only Britain 's Labour Party had received a pasting .
In the words of the socialists ' leader in the Euro - parliament , the centre left suffered a “ very bitter evening ” , confirming their failure to take advantage of a financial crisis that might have been tailor - made for critics of free market excesses .
At the same time , the vote for mainstream conservative parties in several countries only held steady or even slightly fell , against a backdrop of the lowest ever turnout for a Euro-election , with just 43 % bothering to vote .
In many countries , large protest votes went to populist , fringe and hard - right politicians vowing to close borders , repatriate immigrants or even dismantle the European Union in its current form .
Britain elected two members of the avowedly racist British National Party and in the Netherlands , a populist party which vows to ban the Koran and close the European Parliament , picked up four seats with 17 % of the vote , coming second only to the ruling conservative Christian Democrats .
Far - right and anti-immigrant parties picked up seats in Austria , Denmark , Slovakia and Hungary .
The hard - left picked up an extra seat in Denmark , but failed to make breakthroughs predicted in France and Germany .
Gloom for Britain 's Labour government became outright humiliation when the party was pushed into third place by the United Kingdom Independence Party ( UKIP ) , which advocates withdrawal from the European Union .
UKIP was a big beneficiary of British voter rage at an expenses scandal that has left the British Parliament reeling .
This is ironic , given that of the 12 UKIP members of the European Parliament elected in 2004 , one was later jailed for fraud and a second is now facing trial for money laundering and false accounting .
UKIP now has 13 seats , one ahead of Labour , and well behind the opposition Conservatives , who picked up 24 seats with nearly 29 % of the vote .
The appalling results for Labour came after a week in which Gordon Brown , the prime minister , had to fight off calls for his resignation , including from members of his own cabinet .
Oddly , Mr Brown 's mauling last week may save him now : his survival thus far seems to show that his own party has no appetite for his immediate removal .
Using provisional figures as final votes were tallied , in Germany , the Social Democratic Party ( SPD ) suffered its worst ever result , with just 21 % of the vote .
The SPD has suffered badly from being locked in an uneasy coalition with the conservative Christian Democrats ( CDU ) of Angela Merkel .
Mrs Merkel will be relieved to take first place , but the CDU vote still fell compared with the Euro-elections in 2004 .
The big winners of the night in Germany were the pro-business liberals of the Free Democratic Party , whose vote almost doubled to 11 % , perhaps gaining from free - market minded Christian Democrats worried by Mrs Merkel 's recent shifts leftwards .
In France , the Socialist Party only just escaped being pushed into third place by Greens led by a former student firebrand of the May 1968 movement , Daniel Cohn - Bendit .
The ruling Socialists in Spain lost painfully to the centre - right opposition , while in Poland , the left was simply crushed , with 75 % of the vote going to conservative parties .
The pattern of misery for the left was powerful enough to trump the adage that deep recessions punish governments in office .
In France , the governing UMP party of President Nicolas Sarkozy was left jubilant after coming first , with 28 % of the vote .
The result seemed to endorse Mr Sarkozy 's jackdaw - like approach to the Euro - campaign , in which he has played to the right with stern talk about cracking down on crime and opposing Turkey 's entry to the EU , while appealing to the left with attacks on financial “ speculators ” and promises to construct a “ social market economy ” which “ protects ” workers from unfair foreign competition .
In Italy , a similar focus on controlling illegal immigration and protecting workers was enough to hand victory to Silvio Berlusconi and his conservative Party of Freedom .
As in France , Mr Berlusconi was helped by disarray among his opponents on the left .
However , the Italian prime minister did not emerge unscathed from an ongoing press furore about his private life : his 35 % of the vote was down from his general election showing last year , and less than the 45 % he had predicted .
Overall , the European Parliament will look a different place after these elections .
The socialists remain the second largest group , but they are a reduced force and will have to seek alliances more of the time with Greens and others .
The largest centre - right grouping will also be transformed by the departure of Britain 's Conservatives , who say they will form a new anti-federalist alliance in the Euro - parliament with other right - wing parties , mostly from eastern Europe .
Planes , trains or automobiles …
The worst emitters may surprise you ( Image : R. G. Williamson / Rex Features )
True or false : taking the commuter train across Boston results in lower greenhouse gas emissions than travelling the same distance in a jumbo jet .
Perhaps surprisingly , the answer is false .
A new study compares the “ full life - cycle ” emissions generated by 11 different modes of transportation in the US .
Unlike previous studies on transport emissions , Mikhail Chester and Arpad Horvath of the University of California , Berkeley , looked beyond what is emitted by different types of car , train , bus or plane while their engines are running and includes emissions from building and maintaining the vehicles and their infrastructure , as well as generating the fuel to run them .
( Table 1 on page 3 has a complete list of components that were considered ) .
Transport studies expert Abigail Bristow of Loughborough University , UK , who was not involved in the study , says it is valuable because it attempts to compare transport on equal terms .
To do this , Chester and Horvath calculated how many passengers each train , plane , bus or car would carry in its lifetime and how many kilometres it would cover .
The pair took into account how much each infrastructure component – such as tracks , roads and airports – is used in its lifetime .

Including these additional sources of pollution more than doubles the greenhouse gas emissions of train travel .
The emissions generated by car travel increase by nearly one third when manufacturing and infrastructure are taken into account .
In comparison to cars on roads and trains on tracks , air travel requires little infrastructure .
As a result , full life - cycle emissions are between 10 and 20 per cent higher than “ tailpipe ” emissions .
Empty seats
Cars emitted more than any other form of transport with the notable exception of off - peak buses , which often carry few passengers .
The researchers found that travelling 1 kilometre on a nearly empty bus during off - peak hours emits eight times more per person than taking the same bus at rush hour – suggesting peak - time commuters may suffer , but they do less harm to the environment .
The occupation level of a vehicle is an important but often - overlooked factor , says Chester .
“ Although mass transit is often touted as more energy efficient than cars , this is not always the case . ”
Buses turned out to be the most sensitive to how full they were – those with only five passengers were less efficient than cars ; even large SUVs and pick - up trucks .
The finding also underlined that electric trains and cars can contribute to emissions if the electricity is generated by burning fossil fuels .
Passengers on the Boston light rail , an electric commuter train , were found to emit as much or marginally more than those on mid-size and large aircraft .
This is in part because 82 per cent of electricity in Massachusetts is generated by burning fossil fuels .
Clearer view
The results make it easy to target attempts to cut emissions and could change how politicians think about measures to improve transportation , say the researchers .
The life - cycle emissions generated by cars , buses and aircraft are dominated by tailpipe emissions pumped out in day - to - day running of their engines .
Hence , the best way to reduce emissions from these modes of transportation would be to increase fuel efficiency and push for renewable fuels .
Crisscrossing the US with a rail network , however , creates a different problem .
More than half of the life - cycle emissions from rail come not from the engines ’ exhausts , but infrastructure development , such as station building and track laying , and providing power to stations , lit parking lots and escalators .
Any government considering expanding its rail network should take into account the emissions it will generate in doing so , Chester says .
Setting up a public transportation system that only a small proportion of the population uses could generate more emissions than it cuts , he adds – especially if trains and buses are not well connected .
“ New rail systems should serve as links to other transit modes , as is often the case in Europe and Japan , ” he says .
“ We should avoid building rail systems that are disconnected from major population areas and require car trips and parking to access . ”

Seriously .
He really is a big scared angry child with a camera .
Of course , he was even better last night than that little quote .
Glenn
Beck ’s guest last night , with Beck seemingly in agreement , argued that the Holocaust denying , racist , Jew hating , government hating , Obama hating , Free Republic frequenting guy who shot up the Holocaust Museum was actually a liberal .
Proof ?
Hitler was a liberal .
( He had the word “ socialist ” in his party name .
Seriously . )
And he hated Jews .
Yes , which party does this describe more closely :
National Socialism was similar in many respects to Italian fascism ( see Fascism ) .
The roots of National Socialism , however , were peculiarly German , grounded , for example , in the Prussian tradition of military authoritarianism and expansion ; in the German romantic tradition of hostility to rationalism , liberalism , and democracy ; in various racist doctrines according to which the Nordic peoples , as so - called pure Aryans , were not only physically superior to other races , but were the carriers of a superior morality and culture ; and in certain philosophical traditions that idealized the state or exalted the superior individual and exempted such a person from conventional restraints .
Uh huh .

WHEN Sri Lanka 's president , Mahinda Rajapaksa , declared victory over the ruthless Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ) in a speech to parliament on May 19th , he should have addressed a full house .
In fact , over 20 opposition chairs in the 225 - seat chamber were frostily vacant .
Keeping away were members of the Tamil National Alliance , the largest group of parties representing the Tamil minority , elected in the north and east of the island .
It was a reminder to a triumphant government of an unhappy truth : the Tigers may be dead , but the bitter ethnic divisions that fuelled the 26 - year war live on .
Some hours later only a few bursts of firecrackers were heard in Colombo when state television aired footage of the dead Tiger supremo , Velupillai Prabhakaran .
There had already been two days of noisy celebration at the end of one of Asia 's longest wars .
Firecrackers were sold out ; national flags , with their dominant lion insignia representing the Sinhalese ethnic majority , had doubled in price .
Prabhakaran was shown with a single shot to the forehead , a cloth covering the top of his skull , which appeared to have been blown off .
Blood seeped from the yawning wound into the muddy ground he lay in .
A soldier turned his head from side to side for the camera .
In death as in life ( see our obituary ) , the man many had thought invincible wore an impenetrable stare .
LTTE 0:01 , read his dog - tag ; blood group , B-negative .
The army reportedly located his body beside a lagoon a day after the state media had first announced his death .
In the absence of photographic evidence , Sri Lankans had begun to dread that he had escaped .
Then , on the afternoon of May 19th , after the president 's speech , the army chief , General Sarath Fonseka , revealed that the corpse had been found .
This soon raised questions about the circumstances of his death .
Some speculated he was shot by an infantryman who had stumbled upon him during mop -up operations .
Others claimed he was killed after being tricked into turning himself in .
The International Committee of the Red Cross ( ICRC ) reported that the LTTE had offered to surrender to the government through them and that this offer had been suitably conveyed .
The government heightened the confusion by insisting that Prabhakaran had died in battle the previous day , a claim belied by the evidently fresh state of his corpse .
All other senior Tiger leaders , including Sivershankar Pottu Amman , who led intelligence , and Thillaiyampalam Sivanesan , alias Soosai , who commanded the naval unit , were reported killed , as was Prabhakaran 's oldest son , Charles Anthony , who had run the nascent air wing .
For Rajan Hoole , a prominent Tamil human - rights activist , how the fighters died is less important than the government 's plans , if any , for post - war reconciliation .
The war , he argues , has left the minorities feeling less Sri Lankan .
So if the government does not act wisely , Tiger leaders might come to be seen as martyrs to the cause of a separate homeland .
Sulochana Ramaiah , a Tamil journalist , hopes the end of the war heralds a new era of prosperity .
But she worries that Tamils might have to live in fear under a pro-Sinhalese government that is now cockier than ever .
In a more understated speech than had been expected , President Rajapaksa attempted to allay some of these concerns by drawing a clear distinction between the Tigers and the Tamil people .
He promised equal rights for all .
But any response to the long - standing grievances of the Tamil minority must be home - grown , he stressed .
Sri Lanka had no time to try out solutions put forward by other countries — an implicit dig at Indian attempts at intervention .
Much of the world has been sickened by the cost in human life paid for the government 's victory .
Thousands of civilians have been killed or severely wounded in furious crossfire .
The government blames the Tigers for civilian casualties .
There is indeed evidence that they shot civilians when they tried to escape .
But it seems likely , as UN officials and others have suggested , that many , or most , perished in heavy artillery - and mortar - fire from the army .
Feverish last - minute attempts by Western nations to bring about a humanitarian pause were rejected by Mr Rajapaksa .
He said it would serve no purpose when the rebels were clearly holding civilians as human shields .
European Union foreign ministries have already urged an independent inquiry into alleged war - crimes by both the LTTE and the government .
At a meeting in Brussels , they said they were appalled by the high number of civilian casualties in the fighting .
Separately , David Miliband , Britain 's foreign secretary , noted on May 19th that , though exact numbers may never be known , thousands of civilians have died .
More than 250,000 have been displaced by the fighting and interned by the government in camps , to which the access of the international humanitarian agencies is still restricted .
The ICRC has been excluded from the area of north - eastern Sri Lanka hardest hit by fighting in recent weeks .
So it has been unable to obtain first - hand information about the needs of civilians and wounded people , including those needing urgent medical care .
Many of those crammed into internment camps require humanitarian assistance that the government is not financially equipped to provide .
The territorial conflict may be over but a humanitarian disaster is still unfolding .

Let ’s face it , expatriation is most appealing when we imagine ourselves on an exotic beach somewhere , soaking in the rays and sipping on a sweet , tangy fruity drink .
Thus , in this spirit we ’ve made a list of 7 great beaches from around the world , one for each continent .
Enjoy !
Australia : Whitehaven Beach , Queensland
Australia ’s world famous Whitehaven Beach is located on North Queensland ’s Whitsunday Island .
The majestic white sands are actually made up of tiny bits of coral from the Great Barrier Reef , after millions of years of being turned and crushed by the blue , gentle ocean waves .
Since it ’s located so close to Australia ’s coast , the island is a popular day trip and easily accessible .
Africa : Beaches of Mauritius
The African island nation of Mauritius has so many beautiful beaches , it was impossible to pick just one .
A coral reef surrounds the islands , making for some amazing snorkeling .
You may also recall that the island was the only known home of the famously extinct Dodo bird , which met its demise shortly after European settlers discovered it .
Asia : Sanur Beach , Bali , Indonesia
If Bali is known for anything , it ’s the beaches .
Lined with resorts and popular with tourists , Sanur Beach has a well deserved reputation of being one of the world ’s most beautiful .
The surf here is gentler than at other beaches on the island , and the surrounding beach town is mellow , laid back and exactly what you ’d expect from paradise .
Lounging under a palm tree here will quickly make you forget all your troubles .
North America : Bahias de Huatulco , Oaxaca , Mexico
Located in the largest ecological reserve designated by the Mexican government , is the Bahias de Huatulco , which includes 35 km of coastline , 10 bays and 35 beaches .
While many of the beaches are secluded , there is also a local infrastructure in place for travelers ..
Because so many of the beaches are hard to reach , you ’ll be able to cozy in to your own romantic nook far away from the ‘ spring break ’ crowds and noise common in Mexico ’s more populous beaches .
South America : Praia do Rosa , Brazil
In a land of beautiful beaches , Praia do Rosa is one of Brazil ’s best .
Nestled within a crescent - shaped bay , this beach has it all : sand dunes , surfing , beautiful people , charming bungalow getaways , and you can even catch a glimpse here of southern right whales making their seasonal migration , from July to November .
Europe : Navagio Beach , Zakynthos , Greece
Perhaps more famously known as “ Shipwreck Beach ” or “ Smuggler ’s Cove ” , this breathtaking white - sands spot might symbolize the Greek Islands better than anywhere .
The shipwreck is the suspected remains of the smuggler ship Panagiotis , which would be ghostly or ominous if we could n’t imagine a better place to shipwreck .
Antarctica : Deception Island Beach
We know Antarctica is n’t exactly a continent known for its beaches , but you might be surprised .
Most notable is Deception Island , which is actually a half - submerged , active volcano caldera .
It may be hard to believe , but thanks to that volcano , it ’s actually warm enough to swim in the island ’s bay .
Yes , even in Antarctica .
The island also features several hot springs , like those featured above .
Try swimming with the penguins– in a bathing suit !

I once asked a professor of French about this thorny problem .
She said that both pronunciations are correct and it's
your choice in a case like this .
The pronunciation
varies with the speaker .
Jobs are not easy to find .
In this time of recession , jobs become even more scarce .
Companies nowadays are really putting emphasis in hiring the best candidate , more on quality rather than quality .
Have you experienced applying in a job for a Call Center , a Bank , or a private company ?
Passing the initial screening and the exams only to flunk during the final interview ?
Frustrating , is n't it ?
It leaves a feeling in your gut that 's a mix of dissapointment and pure self loathing .
Fret not , this hub is for you guys .
Using my experience as an interviewer , I will try to give you tricks and tips to help you overcome that hump which is the final interview in this second part of several hubs which I will be creating on getting a job .
The final interview is usually composed of questions aimed to provide the interviewers and the hiring staff with information which will be able to help them with the hiring decision .
Questions can range from your experiences in school to your job experiences .
One thing that you can notice is that the questions are behavioral , which means that they are targeting a specific behavior from you , the interviewee .
Below are some tips to help you out in the preparation for the interview as well as the interview proper itself :
Prepararation is Key - Just like any other recruitment step , the final interview is very important and review and preparation is always vital to your success or failure .
Research about the company that you are applying for .
It is always important to know the background and brief history of the company so that you will get a feel of what kind of people they are looking to hire .
Also , some interviewers ask the applicants what they know about the company and why they would like to apply .
Knowing about the background will create the impression that you are taking the job seriously and that you care .
Honesty Still the Best Policy -
One thing that I have noticed is that applicants tend to lie about their answers during the final interview .
This is not a smart move as sooner or later , the company you are applying for will know about this and it will jeopardize your application or job status .
Fraud is never the answer , to pass the final interview you need to answer honestly not give the interviewers what you think they want you to say .
Specify and Clarify -
As mentioned above , the questions during the final interview are behavioral , thus specific behaviors are targeted .
The important thing is always to specify your answers , and not give a broad and safe response .
It is always smart to give specific details as these are the information being evaluated by the interviewer to make a decision to pass or fail you .
Stay Relevant -
Always try to stick to the topic or the question .
Do n't stray away from the discussion or the interview questions and move to irrelevant and unrelated answers .
Stay within the realm of the subject matter , it is okay to move to another situation or answer related to the question to give a detailed answer , as long as you do not veer to far from the initial question .
These are all for the information I have for now .
Please come back as I will finish the list of tricks and tips in my next hub .
If you have any questions or comments , please leave them below so that I may address them as soon as I can .
I hope that these tips will help you land your dream job and wishing all you job seekers all the luck in your search for a place in the corporate world .
Session Abstract :
It is an exciting time for developing applications that run on the Java™ Virtual Machine ( JVM ™ machine ) , because you have more choices than ever .
You can take your pick of languages such as Python , Ruby , Groovy , and Scala for writing your applications while still leveraging the power of the JVM machine .
However , what are the performance trade - offs ?
This session , for developers who want to use alternative languages on the JVM machine , looks at implementing various algorithms in each of these languages and compares how well they perform on the JVM machine .
It discusses the characteristics of each language and how they influence performance results .
It also throws in pure Java technology - based implementations of these algorithms as well as “ native ” performance for languages such as Python and Ruby .
Some of the results can be very surprising .
TOKYO , Japan ( CNN ) --
They are young , earn little and spend little , and take a keen interest in fashion and personal appearance -- meet the " herbivore men " of Japan .
Former CNN intern Junichiro Hori is a self - described ' herbivore . '
Author and pop culture columnist Maki Fukasawa coined the term in 2006 in a series of articles on marketing to a younger generation of Japanese men .
She used it to describe some men who she said were changing the country 's ideas about just what is -- and is n't -- masculine .
" In Japan , sex is translated as ' relationship in flesh , ' " she said , " so I named those boys ' herbivorous boys ' since they are not interested in flesh . "
Typically , " herbivore men " are in their 20s and 30s , and believe that friendship without sex can exist between men and women , Fukasawa said .
The term has become a buzzword in Japan .
Many people in Tokyo's Harajuku neighborhood were familiar with " herbivore men " -- and had opinions about them .
Shigeyuki Nagayama said such men were not eager to find girlfriends and tend to be clumsy in love , and he admitted he seemed to fit the mold himself .
" My father always asks me if I got a girlfriend .
He tells me I 'm no good because I can't get a girlfriend . "
Midori Saida , a 24 - year - old woman sporting oversized aviators and her dyed brown hair in long ringlets , said " herbivore men " were " flaky and weak . "
" We like manly men , " she said .
" We are not interested in those boys -- at all . "
Takahito Kaji , 21 , said he has been told he is " totally herbivorous . "
" Herbivorous boys are fragile , do not have a stocky body -- skinny . "
Fukasawa said Japanese men from the baby boomer generation were typically aggressive and proactive when it came to romance and sex .
But as a result of growing up during Japan 's troubled economy in the 1990s , their children 's generation was not as assertive and goal - oriented .
Their outlook came , in part , from seeing their fathers ' model of masculinity falter even as Japanese women gained more lifestyle options .
Former CNN intern Junichiro Hori , a self - described herbivore , said the idea goes beyond looks and attitudes toward sex .
" Some guys still try to be manly and try to be like strong and stuff , but you know personally I 'm not afraid to show my vulnerability because being vulnerable or being sensitive is not a weakness . "
Older generations of Japanese men are not happy about the changes .
At a bar frequented by businessmen after work , one man said : " You need to be carnivorous when you make decisions in your life .
You should be proactive , not passive . "
Fukasawa said the group does not care so much about making money -- a quality tied to the fact that there are fewer jobs available during the current global economic recession .
Japan 's economy recently saw its largest - ever recorded contraction and has shrunk for four straight quarters .
Blue chip companies Sony , Panasonic , Toyota and Nissan all reported losses in May , and most are forecasting the same for the current fiscal year .
Though still low by international standards , Japan 's reported 5 percent unemployment is the highest since 2003 .
Hori agreed economics has played a role .
When he finished university , " a lot of my friends were trying to work for a big company that pays well and I was n't interested in that .
I am kind of struggling financially and my father is not very happy about it , " he said .
Fukasawa estimated some 20 percent of men are what she would call " herbivorous " and said their attitudes were influencing others .
Indeed , she said , it was a return to the norm for Japanese men , rather than a departure .
" It was after World War II and the post - war economic growth that Japanese men gained the reputation as a sex animal through the competition with the West .
Looking back beyond that time , older literature talks a lot about men with the kind of character we see in the herbivorous boys . "
Will these men simply grow out of this ?
Fukasawa said it was anyone 's guess .
Some of them may , but Japan 's image of masculinity is nonetheless changing .
" The men in dark suits are changing , too , " she said .
" Today 's young people in dark suits are different from the baby boomers in dark suits .
They are evolving , too . "
( CNN ) -- Steven Van Zandt did not mince words .
Steven Van Zandt ( right ) wants musicians to have a sense of history and care for their craft .
" I want to spend just a minute on a topic that never ever gets discussed in the music business -- the music , " the Bruce Springsteen guitarist and " Sopranos " star said in a speech to the SXSW music and arts festival in March .
" The reason nobody wants to talk about it is because it mostly sucks !
" Who are we kidding here ? " he said .
" Nobody 's buying records ?
Because they suck ! "
He called the speech " A Crisis of Craft , " and implored listeners to get back to rock ' n ' roll 's roots .
Learn how to play cover songs , he said .
Get people to dance .
Harness your working - class energy .
Take pride in craft .
It 's been two months since that speech , and Van Zandt is still passionate about the subject .
" [ Rock ' n ' roll ] is a craft that has to be learned , " he tells CNN .
" There are things you learn by listening to great records , copying heroes . "
He believes that he said some things that people were thinking , but have n't said out loud .
But the rumbles are out there .
The music business is in a state of flux , with the sales of more profitable CDs continuing to fall even as single downloads climb .
" American Idol's " season is coming to an end , with rock purists once again assailing the show 's slick pop sensibility .
Commercial radio , country , rap and hip - hop -- they all have their critics , many of them wishing a return to the way things used to be .
Blog :
What do you think of the state of rock ' n ' roll ?
Van Zandt has sympathy for all sides , coming at the issue from what he calls " a unique perspective " -- he 's a musician , a DJ ( with his radio show and Sirius XM channel , " Little Steven 's Underground Garage " ) and record label honcho ( Wicked Cool Records ) .
He 's quick to observe that he 's not slamming all pop music .
There 's vibrancy in some hip - hop , he says , and he admires " Idol , " particularly when it promotes music history .
" But it 's quite an alien world to my traditional rock ' n ' roll world , " he adds .
" It has nothing to do with it . "
Within that rock ' n ' roll world , he worries .
Today 's bands , he says , look down on performing covers , and as a result many have gotten lost in a musical wilderness .
" The result is an extraordinary amount of mediocrity , " he says .
" There are no standards to live up to . "
Which is part of the problem with rejuvenating rock ' n ' roll , says Steve Greenberg , founder of S - Curve Records , which includes alt - rockers Tinted Windows and We The Kings among its acts .
Technology is one problem , he observes .
" I think in the old days , in order to even be decent , it took a lot of work , " he says .
" And today , relatively untalented and uncreative people can actually make rock ' n ' roll music that sounds kind of decent .
And I think that kind of fools people and causes people to be lazy . "
But for Greenberg there 's also a sense that the " square pegs " -- the naturally rebellious types -- are getting shoved in round holes .
" A lot of opportunities inevitably these days go to people who fit the format , whether the format is Top 40 radio or ' American Idol ' or [ Radio ]
Disney or whatever it is , " he says .
" There 's so much pressure to fit those slots .
And it 's the square pegs ultimately who are going to change the world . "
The spirited Greenberg wants to channel that rebellious energy .
He 's high on a band he signed named Care Bears on Fire , a trio of 13 - year - old Brooklyn girls who sound like the Ramones with a touch of Shonen Knife .
" Their attitude is maybe one size does n't fit all , " he says .
" I feel like the spirit of rock ' n ' roll lives in those guys .
...
They 're having fun playing rock ' n ' roll . "
Scott Booker , the manager of the avant - pop band the Flaming Lips ( " She Don't Use Jelly , " " Do You Realize ? ? " ) , is also hoping to foster creativity .
He 's serving as the CEO of the Academy of Contemporary Music , a music school based at Central Oklahoma University .
Drawing from a British concept , the school plans to offer courses in music , music production and the music business , many starting this fall .
Booker observes record labels are n't spending as much money on developing talent .
He hopes the ACM not only makes bands more signable , but also teaches them business strategies , such as setting up their own label and distribution apparatus .
" This could become a think tank for how the industry could go , " he says , musing aloud .
" People think of music as a throwaway cultural item [ nowadays ] .
I want to change that .
...
Make things more exciting . "
Technology , adds BMI executive Phil Graham , can also be rock ' n ' roll 's friend .
" The opportunities the digital world give the population as a whole to throw their talents to a very wide audience is a very good thing , " he says .
More people have gotten the chance to put their music out there and connect with fellow music lovers , he says .
Of course , there are also old - fashioned connections .
BMI sponsors dozens of showcases for new acts ; young bands play clubs and hawk their CDs ( or Web page ) .
Van Zandt welcomes the efforts , but hopes there 's also a connection to rock ' n ' roll history .
He 's founded a Rock and Roll Forever Foundation to foster music education in schools .
( To its credit , the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum has similar programs . )
" The spark comes from whatever people are into these days -- and that very well may be ' American Idol , ' " he says .
" You start with whatever singer you 're rooting for , and you start to trace back where they come from .
It 's up to the artists themselves to make sure that their fans know where they 're coming from , to make it clear that music does n't fall off trees . "
These adorable photos and related information come to us from photographer Volker Wurst .
Upala is none too pleased about this weekend coming to an end ...
" Upala is a little Gorilla boy who was born at the Heidelberg Zoo about half a year ago .
Unfortunately , his mother did n't care enough for him and did n't protect him from attacks from his half - brother .
Therefore , the zoo team at Heidelberg decided to give Upala to the Wilhelma zoo , as they are very experienced here in helping young apes ( Upala is the 57th gorilla baby who is raised in the Wilhelma Kindergarten ) .
He arrived at the Wilhelma on Nov , 18th . "
More proof that a one - world satanic currency and government is about to happen .

Newsletter : US Embassies Are Advised to Buy Enough Local Currency for 1 Year
Toni Straka , CEFA
This rumour could become TNT for the USA .
Newsletter publisher Harry Schultz who correctly forecast the 2008 stock tsunami and outperformed the market more or less as long as he invests , comes up with truly hot stuff .
In its current issue the Harry Schultz Letter ( HSL ) ( via Marketwatch , HT John Trudgian ) reports rumors that
“ Some U.S. embassies worldwide are being advised to purchase massive amounts of local currencies ; enough to last them a year .
Some embassies are being sent enormous amounts of U.S. cash to purchase currencies from those governments , quietly .
But not pound sterling .
Inside the State Dept. , there is a sense of sadness and foreboding that ’ something ’ is about to happen … within 180 days , but could be 120 - 150 days . ”
His apocalyptic projections do n’t end there :
“ Another FDR - style ‘ bank holiday ’ of indefinite length , perhaps soon , to let the insiders sort out the bank mess , which ( despite their rosy propaganda campaign ) is getting more out of their control every day .
Insiders want to impose new bank rules .
Widespread nationalization could result , already underway .
It could also lead to a formal U.S. dollar devaluation , as FDR did by revaluing gold ( and then confiscating it ) . ”
This is one more rumor adding to my suspicions something big is going to happen .
An imperium in decline will play all dirty tricks in order to stay afloat .
There are no green shoots to be seen for several years , as explained in my 600 + earlier posts .
We are in for a K - winter ( Kondratieff ) .
Was the swine flu just a test run for a deadlier pandemic ?
Or will the US default by waging WW3 ?
Section 25C of the Federal Reserve Act ( adapted in 1994 ) explicitly says that the USA does not have to repay debts to a country if the two countries are engaged in a war .

In the wake of Alex Jones and Infowars and Prison Planet breaking the MIAC story , Highway Patrol Superintendent James Keathley has put a halt to the report designating Ron Paul , Bob Barr , Chuck Baldwin , Libertarians and constitutionalists as terrorists .
“ The head of the Missouri State Highway Patrol has shut down a controversial report linking right - wing groups with the modern militia movement , ” reports the Associated Press .
Missouri is taking the report seriously and is now engaging in damage control .
“ Lt. Gov. Peter Kinder on Wednesday called on the director of the Public Safety Department to be placed on administrative leave pending an investigation of the report . ”
In addition , Keathley said he is creating a new system in which he and Public Safety Department Director John Britt will review future reports before they are released .
Lt. Gov. Kinder calls for DPS director to be placed on leave .
Kinder told the St. Louis Post - Dispatch that all groups have extremists , and pointed to eco-terrorists as examples of liberal militia groups that were n’t mentioned in the report .
“ Apparently it was more important to focus on pro-lifers , ” he said .
After an anonymous police officer in Missouri sent the MIAC report to Alex Jones and his flagship websites posted the report and commentary , the corporate media covered the story without providing attribution to Jones or his journalists .
The corporate media coverage reached a crescendo when Fox News host Glenn Beck mentioned the MIAC report on March 23 .
Radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh also mentioned the report .
Alex Jones interviews Missouri State Police officer about the MIAC report .
Part 2 .
Appearing on the Alex Jones Show on March 19 , founder - pastor of Crossroad Baptist Church and presidential nominee Chuck Baldwin announced he had collaborated with Barr and Paul on a letter that was subsequently sent to public officials in Missouri .
Infowars and Prison Planet posted the letter on March 23 .
Ron Paul appeared on Back ’s show and attempted to minimize the report .
“ Well , it may be a backhanded compliment , because a lot of us have worked real hard to change our government , ” said Paul .
Chuck Baldwin on the Alex Jones Show , March 19 , 2009 .
Part 2 .
Earlier this month , Missouri governor Jay Nixon went public with his support of the report .
On March March 26 , Nixon did an abrupt turn - around and distanced himself from the report .
“ I was not governor when the MIAC was formed , ” Nixon said .
“ I was not governor , I did not hire any of the people there and nobody in my administration — the director of public safety — saw this stuff before it went out , ” reports Prime Buzz .
“ Under a previous system , MIAC would prepare and distribute these reports to law enforcement agencies without review or approval from the colonel of the Highway Patrol or the director of Public Safety , ” Nixon said .
“ That ’s simply not acceptable . ”

New cool list of Linux must - have programs
Updated : June 6 , 2009
Note : A new , up - to - date collection is A new , up - to - date collection is available .
Please take a look !
It 's been approximately two years since I 've written the first article , A ( cool ) list of Linux tools .
The article proved quite popular with my audience , as it allowed Linux users , new converts in particular , a quick taste of some of the more useful programs available for Linux platforms , across a range of categories .
Since , a lot has changed .
Two years is a long time .
I have decided to write a new article , from scratch , cataloging an up - to - date collection of must - have programs .

Live CDs ( best choices )
This section is somewhat unusual .
First , almost every single Linux distro comes as a bootable live CD .
Second , narrowing down the huge list of good possibilities to just a small number of extremely great candidates is difficult .
However , I have compiled a short presentation of the five smartest choices for new and intermediate users .
These distros are all widely popular , stable , simple and friendly to use , easy to install and run , and offer a good mix of programs , security , updates , and support for their audience .
While this list contains only five entries , you 're welcome to check my Software collection for dozens of distribution reviews and tutorials .
The tutorials , including the five distros mentioned below , all cover a broad range of topics in detail , including Wireless , Bluetooth , Compiz , NTFS support , digital and web cameras , multimedia codecs , installation , applications , software management and updates , and much more .
You are most encouraged to read them .
Ubuntu
Ubuntu is the de-facto Linux distribution .
It is the most popular distribution these last four years and for a good reason .
It has massive support and recognition , the forums are rich and lively , the repositories are fast , and the distro itself is stable , secure and very easy to use .
openSUSE
openSUSE is a mature distribution , supported by Novell .
The main highlights of the distro is the range of new and innovative technologies included , centralized management using a powerful control center , support for enterprise solutions , good security , and a very large selection of applications .
Linux Mint
This distribution is based on Ubuntu , with additional support for multimedia codecs and third - party software , which makes it instantly usable out - of - the - box and very appealing for Windows converts .
PCLinuxOS
PCLinuxOS is a smaller distribution , which nevertheless delivers an almost perfect experience out of the box .
The distribution comes with a huge collection of programs and utilities , with a focus on multimedia and audio - video processing .
Knoppix
Knoppix is a pure live CD distribution , however you should definitely consider using it , even if you do not intend to install it .
This is because Knoppix offers phenomenal hardware detection and good stability , making it perfect for testing Linux .
As an appetizer , I 've created a Compiz wall below , demonstrating 3D effects on each of these distributions :
Other useful distributions
Some other worthy candidates you may want to consider are Mandriva , Wolvix , SimplyMEPIS , Puppy , and Dreamlinux .
The fact they are not listed here does not make them bad ; it 's simply that with the level of development and forum support that they offer and their general usability mode , they are less suitable than the other candidates .
Mail clients
Thunderbird
Thunderbird is a cross-platform mail and news client developed by the Mozilla Foundation .
Thunderbird can manage multiple accounts , including email , newsgroups and RSS feeds , and supports encryption .

Amarok
Amarok is an excellent media player .
Although it is mainly intended for KDE desktop , it will work well on other platforms .
Some people argue whether the Amarok 2.0 is indeed better than the older Amarok 1.4 , so you should check for yourself before deciding .
I 've listed Amarok as one the recommended applications in my Audio tutorial .
Rhythmbox
This is another great Linux music player .
It works with a range of media formats and will naturally " plug in " to Web radio stations .
For example , you can stream music from Last . fm directly into Rhythmbox .

VirtualBox can also run from USB drives , in portable mode and can even be installed in MojoPac .
The last two flavors are for Windows , though .
VirtualBox comes in two flavors - OSE and PUEL .
PUEL is a closed - source version , with USB support .
OSE version has less features , but it comes included in most repositories .
VMware Player
VMware Player is a simple , adequate virtualization solution for desktop use .
It is less powerful than either VirtualBox or VMware Server ( see below ) , but it allows home users to test new operating systems or new software for their existing platforms in guest machines , without altering their base setup .
It also comes included in numerous repositories , so it is quite easy to install and maintain .
You can check a review here .
VMware Server
VMware Server is another powerful desktop virtualization software .
Alongside VirtualBox , it makes a great combo for exploring and testing new stuff .
VMware Server has many useful features , including the ability to connect to remote machines , a mighty network stack , and offers 3D support for DirectX on Windows guests , complementing OpenGL on VirtualBox .
VMware Server also contains the VMware Player , so you are better off trying the Server in the first place .

At 26 , Contador , a slightly built Spaniard , is at the top of the sport  and enjoying the Giro from the comforts of his home right now .
While big - name riders like Armstrong , the 2008 Tour winner Carlos Sastre and the two - time Vuelta champion Menchov , have been competing on this grueling Giro course  tackling mountains in the Dolomites and even the volcano Mount Vesuvius  Contador has been saving his energy for the Tour .
“ I personally think riders like Menchov , Sastre and Lance came to the Giro because , psychologically , they do n’t believe they can beat Contador at the Tour , ” said Matt White , a race director for the Garmin - Slipstream team and Armstrong ’s former teammate on the United States Postal Service team .
“ They ’d rather get a big win here .
It ’s very hard to be in full flight here and then back it up in July at the Tour .
Only a few riders have ever done it . ”
To ready himself for the Tour , cycling ’s most prestigious race , Contador rode several races earlier in the season and will ride in the Critérium du Dauphiné Libéré in June .
He was leading Paris - Nice before crumbling one stage from the finish , needing to be helped off his bike .
He said he had forgotten to eat and replenish his energy before the stage .
Armstrong , a brash Texan , wrote on Twitter that Contador “ has a lot to learn , ” but they later said they had defused any controversy .
Before the two raced together for the first time with Astana , at the Castillo y León event in Spain in March , Armstrong struck a conciliatory note .

“ I think right now it has to be him , naturally , ” Armstrong said of Contador , according to The Associated Press .
“ There ’s no way I can come back after four years and reclaim leadership or reclaim some type of ownership .
I have to respect the current results , and he ’s the best right now .
And until that changes , he ’s the leader . ”

Over bishops ’ objections , North Carolina passes ‘ sexual orientation ’ legislation
June 24 , 2009
Over the repeated objections of Bishop Peter Jugis of Charlotte and Bishop Michael Burbidge of Raleigh , the North Carolina House , by a 58 - 57 vote , has passed legislation that would require school employees and students to report “ bullying , ” “ harassing behavior , ” or a “ hostile environment ” that is motivated by a bullying victim ’s “ sexual orientation ” or “ gender identity . ”
The bishops had warned :
The School Violence Prevention Act ( Senate Bill 526 ) is an attempt to eradicate bullying at public schools .
Much of its language and its attempt to make all forms of bullying unacceptable are laudatory and this dimension of the bill has been endorsed by us .
However , the inclusion of the terms “ sexual orientation ” and “ gender identity , ” as specific examples of bullying to be eradicated , creates a potential for legalizing same - sex marriage in NC .
Codifying these terms into an anti-bullying law was used in the construction of “ findings of fact ” by lawyers to convince judges in California , Connecticut and Iowa to mandate same - sex marriage .
We oppose this language because of its future implications for same - sex marriage .
Efforts to remove this specific language and simply make all forms of bullying unacceptable have failed so far .

Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell was on CBS News ’ Face
The Nation today , where he continued to call the Obama healthcare reform proposal government run healthcare , and he said that a public option is a non-starter on healthcare .
McConnell claimed that America has the best healthcare in the world , but he offered no ideas to give more people access to healthcare .
McConnell first brought up the boogeyman of rationed care , “ Well , let ’s start at the beginning .
They teach every first - semester medical student , “ Do no harm . ”
And what the president did not talk about yesterday is his ambitious plan to have a government insurance plan , in effect , that essentially crowds out of the private market all the competition that we have among insurance companies today to have a national rationing board which would determine what kind of treatments would be available for American citizens . ”
McConnell compared the president ’s healthcare plan to the auto industry bailout , “ We ’ve seen a , kind of , version of that over in the auto takeover .
You ’ve got Ford Motor Company , which makes Ford vehicles in my hometown — it did n’t take any government money — now having to compete with a government - controlled General Motors acceptance corporation , trying to finance their cars in competition with the government financing company .
And they ’re having a hard time doing it .
We know that , if the government gets in this business , pretty soon nobody else will be in the business . ”

He also said that Republicans wo n’t support a public option , “ I think that , for virtually every Republican , a government plan is a non-starter .
There are a whole lot of other things we can agree to do on a bipartisan basis that will dramatically improve our system .
But we already have the best health care in the world .
We know it costs a lot , but we have the best health care in the world .
And I do n’t think many Americans want to start having to , you know , wait in line and start getting government permission for procedures .
We need to be very careful about taking the wrong steps . ”
McConnell followed the typical Republican talking point which is trying to divide the American people by turning the insured against the uninsured .
McConnell ’s talk of nationalization is nonsense , but he does tap into the debate on a public option , which is the sticking point , even among Democrats , on the issue of healthcare reform .
There are three problems that any healthcare reform plan must tackle .
The plan must cover the uninsured , lower costs , and place healthcare decisions back into the hands of doctors and patients , not HMOs and accountants .
Two of these goals can be accomplished without a public option .
The public option is designed to provide coverage for those who ca n’t afford private insurance .
The Republican plan which is based around tax credits is fatally flawed because in order to obtain the tax credit , people first have to buy the insurance .
What happens to the people who the insurance companies wo n’t insure , or the people who ca n’t afford to buy the policy in order to qualify for the tax credit ?
In an ideal world , there would be agreement on a plan that would lower the costs for those with private insurance , while also providing coverage for the uninsured .
McConnell ’s statement that Obama wants to nationalize healthcare is scare tactic .
There are legitimate questions about a public option , but it is almost a certainty that big changes are coming to healthcare .

Found a post whilst reading a post by the Standalone Sysadmin … and it is a beauty .
Michael Janke has a post comparing ad - hoc versus structured systems management .
One of the items that Michael says is essential for structuring your systems management is automation .
As Matt Simmons says :
“ Remember , if you can script it , script it .
If you ca n’t script it , make a checklist ”
In the Windows world automation has been a pretty tough ask until Windows Power Shell came onto the scene .
Whilst it was possible to script Windows with VBScript , it was n’t easy or quick .
If it is n’t easy and quick it probably wo n’t happen .
I still have n’t noticed any network management tools supporting Power Shell yet .
Shame .
Given that nearly everything seems to be sprouting PowerShell support it is a shame that network and systems management vendors are slow supporting a technology designed to help sys admins do their job more easily .
The world is becoming a lot more dynamic with virtual & cloud computing coming to the fore .
Management tools need to be equally dynamic and yet , so far , they ’ve been pretty un -dynamic .
If I have a script that provisions a new virtual machine it would be nice to tell the management platform to start monitoring its performance from the same script .
If I have a script that takes down a service , it would be nice to tell the management platform to put that particular service into maintenance mode so I do n’t get deluged with alerts .
The Best Hybrid Cars
The Hybrid cars introduce us to a brave new world of trying to efficiently replace gas as the main energy source .
The down fall of all previous attempts to do so was slow and very small cars that simply could n’t replace the ‘ regular ’ car .
But , today ’s hybrids are really beautiful machines that you can proudly drive on the road at a reasonable price , as you will see later on .
First things first , what are the hybrids ?
And why would you want one ?
About Hybrid cars Hybrid cars were introduced by various automotive industries as a result of the need for more efficient and environmentally sound cars .
Even though everyone has heard about hybrid cars , but there still exists confusion about how they operate and what are the components does it need to function properly .
Basically hybrid cars are operated by three main sources such as , a well performing battery , an electric motor and a gas engine .
Each of the sources is very important for the performance of the car .
Â
The main benefit of using hybrid cars is that , it proves to lower the harmful emission and better the gas mileage .
A lot of difference in their function exists between full hybrid cars and a mild hybrid car .
Based on the gas mileage and its performance , the top 10 best hybrid cars are taken and reviewed in detail .
2010 Honda Insight EX
2010 Honda Insight EX is considered as the best hybrid car because it offers an excellent fuel economy and is more fun to drive .
Honda Insightâ€™s styling closely resembles the Toyota Prius which adds an extra X factor in your personality .
It comes with the best voice - command system equipped with Bluetooth connectivity .
The user rating for this 2010 Honda Insight EX is found to beâ€ excellentâ€ .
2009 Nissan Altima Hybrid
2009 Nissan Altima Hybrid offers a best mileage over 30 mpg and it provides an exceptional performance .
Â
The Bluetooth system that comes with this Nissan Altima is found to be very basic and it doesnâ€™t have iPod integration which is a setback but otherwise it includes safety features such as smart airbags , stability control antilock brakes and etc and the car rocks .
2009 Mercury Mariner Hybrid
2009 Mercury Mariner Hybrid , the hybrid system present with the car gives it very low emission which is considered as an added advantage .
It is equipped with voice command , phone and MP3 player integration .
The audio system present with the car is found to be very basic yet itâ€™s still very stylish .
2009 Cadillac Escalade Hybrid
Though it seems to be a heavy vehicle , Cadillac Escalade is found to provide good in fuel economy with its hybrid power train without compromising its performance .
The navigation system integrated with the car provides the traffic reporting and blind - spot detection is included with its driving aids .
With very basic audio sources no facility for iPod integration Cadillac Escalade still holds its place n the race of style and economy .
2009 Ford Escape Hybrid Limited
Ford Escape comes with a best sync system and it provides an excellent fuel mileage .
Sirius Travel
Link offers the traffic data and other navigation options to the car .
Highway driving is seems to be a difficult one with and is best suited for urban dwellers and not for freeway commuters because of its high speed .
2008 Toyota Prius
Toyota Prius offers an unbelievable fuel mileage and its emission rating is found to be very low without compromising its size .
The shape of this car is mostly confused with other Priuses available at present .
2008 Lexus LS 600h
Hybrid system with the car offers a good fuel economy more than expected and its emission rating is also very low which gives a reputation for this 2008 Lexus LS 600h .
Live traffic is handled by excellent navigation facility present with the car .
Driving performance of the car is good and its stereo system seems to be wonderful .
2008 Lexus RX 400h
The userâ€™s rating for Lexus RX 400h is â€ œGoodâ€ and its smooth drive is delivered by its suspension .
The car seems to be the best with its unbelievable fuel economy .
Â
The navigation system present with the car is pretty good and it lacks recognizing live traffic and iPod integration is missing .
2007 Honda Civic Hybrid
Some of the users have experienced the following with Honda Civic hybrid and it includes excellent gas mileage , very comfortable to drive , quite , exceptional voice command and climate control and etc .
Trunk space is limited which seems to be the disadvantage with this car .
Automatic Shut - offâ€™s feature of the gas engine seems to be very bad and it makes difficult for stop - and - go driving .
2008 Chevrolet Malibu Hybrid
Though Chevrolet Malibu uses a mild hybrid train system , it is found to provide fuel savings ability to a great level .
Look and feel of this Chevrolet Malibu seems to be good .
It is designed in such a way that it attracts everyone and both the driverâ€™s and passengerâ€™s seat offers a great comfort zone .
Visitors here will be more fortunate .
And since Dr. Schaller ’s surveys of snow leopards in the Himalayas during the 1970s were done in conjunction with the Wildlife Conservation Society , which runs the zoo , and those surveys built awareness about this endangered species , Dr. Schaller ’s tributes to it are shown at the entrances to the Allison Maher Stern Snow Leopard Exhibit , which opened on Friday .
“ Suddenly I saw the snow leopard , ” Dr. Schaller writes .
“ Wisps of cloud moved between us , ” causing the animal to appear and disappear “ as if in a dream . ”

It is to the credit of this $ 10.6 million installation  the first new exhibition in the Central Park Zoo since 1988  that you can get a sense of Dr. Schaller ’s excitement .
The habitats created for the animals cannot , of course , replicate the stunning vistas of their mountainous homes ( which , the exhibition points out , would dwarf Manhattan skyscrapers ) .
But the Wildlife Conservation Society has shaped miniature natural worlds that maintain the illusion .
Two pavilions , with spare panels of text , look out onto two hills , while a barely visible steel wire mesh covers these habitats like protective tents .
One scene is a verdant landscape with plantings that hide most signs of a world beyond .
Another is a rocky landscape with a waterfall .
Mist - machinery creates wisps of cloud through which snow leopards mysteriously take shape , their lush spotted fur illustrating why poachers have so coveted their pelts .
Here , too , snow leopards can be easily seen , even coming right up to the viewing glass .
It is quite different in their native home of rock and snow as a photograph on display shows , daring the stymied viewer to try to find one , so expertly camouflaged .
These are not brightly colored jungle cats , but vaguely yellow - hued , spotted with white and gray .
Their lives on the edges of precipices make their long tails as important as their wide paws , while their thick belly fur provides some comfort at 19,000 - foot altitudes .
There is a fierce calm in their stride and the strength to leap 20 feet toward helpless prey ( including domesticated livestock ) .
Glenn
Beck wants everyone to rest assured he 's not a complete nutcase .
He 's not a fan of state secession , after all !
Beck : Did you catch the New York Times this weekend ?
[ Giggles weirdly . ]
They published the third -- count it , three -- the third op - ed in the New York Times blaming Bill O'Reilly and me , or Fox News in general , of spreading hate and inspiring people like the killer of Dr. Killer , uh , Tiller , in Kansas .
Also , we were the inspiration apparently for the guy at the Holocaust Museum last week .
You know , there are groups out there that preach hate and violence and racial violence .
There are groups out there so fed up they want to secede from the union .
But we ain't one of them !
Hmmmm .
An interesting denial .
There 's only one problem with it : Beck was downright enthusiastic about Texas secession two months ago when he interviewed Chuck Norris :
GLENN : Chuck , you live in Texas .
NORRIS : Yes , I do .
GLENN : Somebody asked me this morning , they said , you really believe that there 's going to be trouble in the future .
And I said , if this country starts to spiral out of control and , you know , and Mexico melts down or whatever , if it really starts to spiral out of control , before America allows a country to become a totalitarian country , which it would have under I think the Republicans as well in this situation ; they were taking us to the same place , just slower .
NORRIS : It was slower , yeah .
GLENN : Americans will , they just , they wo n't stand for it .
There will be parts of the country that will rise up .
And they said , where 's that going to come from ?
And I said Texas , it 's going to come from Texas .
Do you agree with that , Chuck , or not ?
NORRIS : Oh , yeah .
You know , Texas is a republic , you know .
We could actually -- GLENN :
It was a country before it was a state .
NORRIS : Yeah , we could break off from the union if we wanted to .
GLENN : You do , you call me .
NORRIS : Oh , yeah .
If the people who call for state secession are complete nutbags , then why does Beck keep featuring on his show his good buddy Chuck Norris ?
The guy who wrote this :
On Glenn Beck 's radio show last week , I quipped in response to our wayward federal government , " I may run for president of Texas . "
That need may be a reality sooner than we think .
If not me , someone someday may again be running for president of the Lone Star state , if the state of the union continues to turn into the enemy of the state .
From the East Coast to the " Left Coast , " America seems to be moving further and further from its founders ' vision and government .
... ... I 'm not saying that other states wo n't muster the gumption to stand and secede , but Texas has the history to prove it .
Of course , Beck is busy making this claim and running far far away from the right - wing nutcases whose theories he spent much of his first couple of months at Fox promoting .
Because heaven forfend that anyone should look at Beck 's proclamation after the Holocaust Museum shooting that " the pot in America is boiling " and start figuring out who turned up the temperature .
Dr. Slammy at Scholars and Rogues has a great post on the phoninness of the " lone wolf " / " isolated incidents " meme that seems to be all the rage on the right these days .
Robert Pattinson recently revealed there would be a fourth Twilight film
Twilight star Robert Pattinson was hit by a taxi in New York as he tried to run away from a crowd of teenage fans , according to reports .
US website Radaronline said the 23 - year - old was clipped by a cab but was not seriously hurt .
The British actor , who had been filming his new movie Remember Me , was surrounded by fans as he tried to cross the street to his trailer .
Pattinson 's manager did not comment on the accident .
The actor 's security guards were reportedly furious about the scuffle and one was heard shouting : " You see what you did , you almost killed him . "
Since appearing as vampire Edward Cullen in the Twilight film series , Pattinson has become a huge star .
Earlier this month , he took home the prize for best male breakthrough performance at the MTV Movie Awards in Los Angeles .
He also shared the best kiss prize with co-star Kristen Stewart .
In May , he confirmed there will be a fourth film in the vampire series .
A young man with a talent for music has begun a career with much promise .
He meets an aspiring singer , Apollonia , and finds that talent alone is n't all that he needs .
A complicated tale of his repeating his father 's self destructive behavior , losing Apollonia to another singer ( Morris Day ) , and his coming to grips with his own connection to other people ensues .

Having just wrestled the word " netbook " free from the legal grasp of Psion , Microsoft now wants to change the name of these low - cost slabs of white plastic riding Intel 's Atom processor .
Oh joy .
Apparently unhappy with the choices of netbook , smartbook , MID ( NVIDIA 's definition , not Intel's ) , thin - and - light , and ultra-portable , Microsoft 's preference is , are you ready , " low cost small notebook PC . "
Man , that flows like a sonnet .
The new name proposed by Steven Guggenheimer , general manager of Microsoft 's Application Platform & Development Marketing Division , is meant to reflect netbooks that do more than Internet browsing .
What Steve - o does n't say is that by creating a new product division above netbooks , Microsoft can require beefier versions of its Windows OS installed for higher profits on higher margins -- especially now that they 've dropped the three application limit from its entry - level Windows 7 Starter Edition .
Hey Microsoft , if it's all the same to you , we 're just fine with the term netbook thankyouverymuch .
Given the near - universal positive press heaped on Windows 7 thus far , you 'll be raking in the cash starting October 22nd , no need to shake us down , ok ?

One benefit of being a poet -- as opposed to , say , a politician or talk - show host -- is that you can be the most celebrated person in your field , a virtual rock star among those who study , read and write poetry , and still remain anonymous in just about any public setting .
The thought occurs to me as I stand outside one of this ...
By Kim Tong - hyungStaff ReporterSouth Korean scientists reported advancement in the techniques to create stem cells without destroying embryos , which may allow them to avoid the ethical and practical problems about their use for treatment .
A team of experts led by Kim Kwang - soo , head of the Cha Medical Center 's stem cell institute , said they successfully generated induced pluripotent stem ( iPS ) cells from human fibroblasts , or cells used by the body to synthesize new tissue , by injecting them with a cocktail of ``reprogramming '' proteins .
The therapeutic potential of iPS cells , or adult stem cells that are made to perform like embryonic ones , is considered enormous as they gain the ability to become any cell in the human body , thus opening new opportunities in the treatment of difficult medical conditions .
In 2007 , a joint research team of Japanese and American scientists was the first to successfully turn adult skin cells into stem cells by injecting them with gene - carrying viruses .
Since then , scientists around the world have been devoted to finding ways to improve the reprogramming process , winding the clock back on cells taken from adults until they are in an embryonic form .
But most of the previous methods in generating iPS cells had required the use of genetic materials , such as genome - integrating viruses and other potentially harmful chemicals .
The use of these substances has been linked to health problems such as genetic disorder and cancer .
Kim said his team eliminated this problem by delivering four reprogramming proteins ―
Oct4 , Sox2 , Klf4 and c - Myc ― directly into somatic cells .
The successful production of iPS cells proved that it 's possible to create stem cells without using viral or DNA vectors , Kim said .
`` This system eliminates the potential risks associated with the use of the viruses , DNA transfection , and potentially harmful chemicals , and in the future could potentially provide a safe source of patient - specific cells for regenerative medicine , '' the researchers said in their study published in peer - review journal Cell Stem Cell .
`` These protein - induced human iPS cells exhibited similarly to human embryonic stem cells in morphology , proliferation and expression of characteristic pluripotency markers . '' Stem cells have the ability to be turned into any tissue in the body .
Researchers are hoping they could be used to regenerate diseased and damaged organs and treat a wide range of conditions including Parkinson 's disease , diabetes and spinal cord injuries .
Creating stem cells from adult cells is considered key to developing clinical applications .
Stem cells made from a patient 's own cells would reduce the risks of immune system rejection , as they carry the same DNA .
This would also eliminate the need for gathering and destroying embryos to create a supply , which has been the biggest ethical barrier in pushing further stem cell therapeutics .
`` Our discovery solves a critical problem regarding the safety in generating iPS cells , and may open the way to create an iPS cell bank , '' said Kim .
`` We plan to continue our iPS cell research and integrate the technology in producing stem cells that grow out into retinal pigment epithelial cells , blood alternatives and cardiovascular cells . ''
Biz Stone , Twitter ’s , recently wrote in a blog post entitled The Replies Kerfuffle that
We removed a setting that 3 % of all accounts had ever touched but for those folks it was beloved .
…
97 % of all accounts were not affected at all by this change — the default setting is that you only see replies by people you follow to people you follow .
For the 3 % who wanted to see replies to people they do n't follow , we cannot turn this setting back on in its original form for technical reasons and we wo n't rebuild it exactly the same for product design reasons .
…
Even though only 3 % of all Twitter accounts ever changed this setting away from the default , it was causing a strain and impacting other parts of the system .
Every time someone wrote a reply Twitter had to check and see what each of their followers ' reply setting was and then manifest that tweet accordingly in their timeline — this was the most expensive work the database was doing and it was causing other features to degrade which lead to SMS delays , inconsistencies in following , fluctuations in direct message counts , and more .
Ideally , we would redesign and rebuild this feature but there was no time , hence the sudden deploy .
As someone whose day job is working on a system for distributing a user ’s updates and activities to their social network in real - time across Web and desktop applications , I ’m always interested in reading about the implementation choices of others who have built similar systems .
However when it comes to Twitter I tend to be more confused than enlightened whenever something is revealed about their architecture .
So let ’s look at what we know .
When Ashton Kutcher posts an update on Twitter such as
it has to be delivered to all 1.75 million of his followers .
On the other hand , when Ashton Kutcher posts an update directed to one of his celebrity friends such as
then Twitter needs to decide how to deliver it based on the Replies settings of users .
One option would to check each of the 1.75 million followers of aplusk ’s setting to decide whether they need have @replies restricted to only people they are following .
Since this will be true for 97 % of his followers ( i.e. 1.7 million people ) then there would need to be a 1.7 million checks to see if the intended recipient are also friends of John Mayer before delivering the message to each of them .
On the other hand , it would be pretty straightforward to deliver the message to the 3 % of users who want to see all replies .
Now this seems to be what Biz Stone is describing as how Twitter works but in that case the default setting should be more expensive than the feature that is only used by a minority of their user base .
In that case I ’d expect Twitter to argue that the feature they want to remove for engineering reasons is filtering out some of the tweets you see based on whether you are a follower of the person the message is directed to not the other way around .
What have I missed here ?
Update : A comment on Hacker News put me on track to what I probably missed in analyzing this problem .
In the above example , if the default case was the only case they had to support then all they have to do to determine who should receive Ashton Kutcher ’s reply to John Meyer is perform an intersection of both user ’s follower lists .
Given that both lists need to be in memory for the system to be anywhere near responsive , performing the intersection is n’t as expensive as it sounds .
However with the fact that 3 % of users will want to have received the update even though they are n’t John Mayer ’s friends means
Twitter needs to do a second pass over whoever was not found in both follower lists and check what their @reply delivery settings are .
In the above example , even if every follower of John Mayer was a follower of Ashton Kutcher , it would still require 750,000 settings checks .
Given that it sounds like they keep this setting in their database instead of in some sort of cache , it is no surprise that this is a feature they ’d like to eliminate .
I do n’t receive financial aid from the state , but my disabled sister and her two children , one who is a “ special needs ” child do - and not too long ago , we learned that social services in the State of Georgia is on the verge of total collapse .
We were told that the state is essentially broke , state employees are being layed - off - and there is a hiring freeze in effect .
One caseworker has in excess of 600 cases and has been with the state for over 20 years .
Her husband is asking her to quit , however , this courageous woman is attempting to do her job with her staff cut more than half - and the caseloads are growing by the day .
Do the math on this one ; based on a 40 hour workweek times 4.3 , which is an average month , allows a caseworker approximately 3.5 minutes per case , barely enough time to use the restroom !
So far , my sister has lost her benefits twice ; the first time , they scheduled a review on the day she was scheduled for major surgery .
I am her authorized representative and made sure to keep Child Support Services apprised of her condition ; we never received notice of the hearing , and to make matters worse , the state has a call - in center that records any address changes or other pertinent information that can affect a beneficiaries case .
The “ call center ” is an utter farce , and if you report something , whether it is entered into the system is a coin toss - sometimes they do their job , but more often than not , they are incompetent and I believe they are purposely sabotaging cases to save the state money .
( This is my opinion . )
Georgia , in their quest to save money , are over - working their employees and treating them as if they were slaves , thus exacerbating the problem by losing seasoned workers that knew the system and were able to help people ; their years of experience allowed them to serve huge caseloads and still maintain some semblance of competence in a state agency that is quickly being destroyed .
The above facts / allegations bring forth a question ; how much money did Georgia receive in “ Stimulus Money ” - and where was that money spent ?
It ’s quite obvious that Social Services was ignored , or whatever money had been earmarked for them was diverted to a program that was “ politically correct . ”
“ Yes we Can ” Obama bails out banks , the auto industry , financial services companies , and if there ’s anything left over - it might find its way into the hands of the people that actually need it .
Once again , even though we called the call center and gave them a change of address , it did n’t go through , and her medicaid benefits were terminated because she did not attend a review that she never received notice of …
It ’s extremely hard to keep an appointment that you do n’t know about - and this is happening to the poor across the state of Georgia on a regular basis .
We learned that in Forsyth County , one of the wealthiest counties in Georgia - their staff has been cut almost in half while their caseloads are soaring .
Lumpkin County is even in worse shape , and DHR ( Department of ( in ) Human Resources ) workers are being brow - beated to the point that many of them who have served this state for decades are now considering quitting their jobs - and many have already quit or been layed - off ..
Those who feed their families and receive Medicaid and Food Stamps are arbitrarily being cut - off from their benefits based on a severe lack of support staff in the Department of Family Services .
It ’s not often that I side with state employees , but in this matter , I can honestly state that Georgia is treating their employees like crap - which ultimately impacts those whom they are attempting to serve .
I choose not to name names , however , a state employee asked us to please contact the Governor ’s office and demand that they properly staff the state Child Support Services not just in Lumpkin County , but throughout the state …
If you live in Georgia , receive food stamps or Medicaid , please email a copy of this post to the Governor ’s office so he will know that the public is aware that his cuts are impacting loyal state employees .
It is also impacting the people who need assistance the most and is causing people to go hungry - something I never believed would happen in the United States .
I received this information some time ago , however , in order to protect the identity of the employee (s ) that gave me this information , I have held off publishing this article with the hope they are unable to trace who gave us this information - and if they do , the individual has since retired .
Lumpkin County in particular appears to be vicious in their approach to sick children and adults .
As I stated in JustanotherUpdate For February 2009 , our family , since October of last year , has faced death and a multitude of health problems .
After my Mother died as a direct result to the damage that a Lunesta adverse reaction caused to her heart , we were forced to move to Lumpkin County ; without my Mom ’s income , we had to reduce our bills and find a place we could afford , and Lumpkin County seemed to be our best bet .
We do like where we live , and enjoy being in a county that has not “ militarized ” their police force .
I ’ve heard there are a few bad apples , but generally speaking , the Sheriff ’s Department in Lumpkin County is professional , courteous , and our Sheriff is respected and well liked by anyone that has had the pleasure of interacting with him and his department .
The school system is another matter , and in my opinion , they are discriminating against our family based on my political beliefs .
It ’s very rare when I write about local matters , especially on an issue that will soon be adjudicated ( sic ) in what I believe is a lost cause .
Most states have truancy laws , and in many cases , they are necessary to make sure that students attend school as they are supposed to .
My Sister has been extremely ill , and since October , she has had almost all of her teeth pulled , developed MRSA ( ( Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus ) in her jaw , and was miserable for a very long time .
She also had knee surgery , an emergency hysterectomy that was put on hold to meet Medicaid criteria ; no matter how sick a woman is , they have to prescribe a course of birth control pills to ensure that it wo n’t solve the problem , so by the time the surgery was approved , one of her ovarian cysts burst approximately two weeks before she went under the knife - and even though I ’m not that familiar with this type of procedure , I watched in absolute horror as she suffered beyond belief when the cyst(s ) burst .
Her physician , who was excellent , wanted to perform the surgery immediately , but he had to comply with Medicaid rules which in her case , could have killed her .
She is still extremely ill , needs surgery on her right foot , which was crushed in an auto accident , and has a long way to go before she is healthy again .
If you take the time to read the link to JustanotherUpdate For February 2009 , you will find that we had the bad luck of moving into a trailer that was infested with mold - and our entire family was extremely ill for months before we found out exactly what was making us sick .
There were too many times when the children had headaches so bad that they continually vomited and were exhausted to the point that my sister decided that it would be cruel to send then to school when they were obviously that ill .
It ’s noteworthy to add that the schools do n’t care if a child is vomiting and has debilitating headaches ; if there is n’t a fever present , then the schools believe the student should be in school .
In the State of Georgia , a parent ’s right to try and care for their children has been taken away by “ No Child Left Behind . ”
As usual , it ’s all about the money which was recently evidenced by several Georgia schools who cheated on the States CRCT Tests :
Determining the " biggest " dog in the world is more complicated than it sounds .
The " The Guinness Book of World Records " is widely regarded as the determiner of the world 's " biggest , " " largest , " " tallest , " and " smallest " items , people , geographic locations , and , of course , dogs .
But , the record book actually only determines the world 's " tallest " dog — that is , how tall the dog is when it stands on its hind legs — not technically the " biggest . "
The " biggest " dog would actually be the heaviest , but " Guinness " does n't measure dogs by that metric , likely due to animal welfare concerns .
Awarding a title for the world 's biggest or largest dog might persuade owners to overfeed their pets in hopes of winning the honor .
Read on to see who is the world 's tallest dog , as well as the planet 's biggest .
Interestingly , both dogs live in the same country .
Freddy , the Sofa - Munching Dog
The world 's tallest dog is Freddy , a 7 - foot , 6 - inch - tall Great Dane , who reportedly loves chicken and peanut butter , " but he 's also munched his way through 23 sofas , " according to the " Daily Mail . "
Freddy also measures 3 feet , 4.75 inches tall when standing on all fours .
Freddy 's owner , Claire Stoneman , who lives in Essex , England , " is utterly devoted to her ' ​ Guinness World Record ' pet , and his sister Fleur , " says the " Daily Mail . "
" They are children to me ... because I have n't had any kids , " says Stoneman , who shares her bed with Freddy .
" They need me and it 's quite nice to be needed . "
Surprisingly , Freddy was never expected to grow so tall .
" I got him a couple of weeks earlier than I should have done because he was n't feeling off mum , so he was pretty poorly , " Stoneman told the Huffington Post .
Freddy was a relatively small pup when Stoneman picked him up at a local pound .
No one suspected that Freddy would grow up to claim the world title .
The " Biggest " Dog But , not so fast : Balthazar , another Great Dane who also lives in England , is 7 feet tall when standing on his hind legs — about half a foot shorter than Freddy .
Balthazar , however , tips the scales at a whopping 216 pounds , 42 more pounds than any other dog on Earth , according to " Metro , " a British Newspaper .
The dog's owner , Vinnie Monte - Irvine , who lives in Nottingham , England , said that she took Balthazar to the vet when he was not feeling well .
" After he was weighed everyone at the surgery was gobsmacked and we were all just Googling to see if he was actually the world ’s heaviest living dog , " Monte - Irvine told " Metro . "
Despite his hefty size , Balthazar 's best friends are three small cats who also live at the house in central England .
" I admit that at first I was ashamed of him and would not leave the house , but now I only feel pride and am desperate for him to be named as the tinniest man in the world . "
The release of the first of five British hostages kidnapped in Baghdad two years ago may be imminent after the US military freed a senior Shia militia leader from prison .
The freeing of Laith al - Khazali , an important member of Asaib al - Haq , an Iranian - backed militia group , marks a crucial breakthrough in efforts to secure the return of Peter Moore , a computer expert , and four British security men seized with him .
The kidnappers have demanded the release of Qais al - Khazali , the leader of Asaib al - Haq , along with his brother Laith and other militants , in return for the five Britons who were captured while working in the Iraqi Finance Ministry in a highly organised raid on 29 May 2007 by men dressed as Iraqi policemen .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
A senior Iraqi politician in Baghdad said that he expected Qais al - Khazali , the most important of the Iraqis whose release is demanded by the kidnappers , to be handed over by US military forces to the Iraqi government in the next five days .
It would then free him , opening the way for further releases of the British hostages .
The difficulty in arranging for the Britons to be released is that the Iraqis held by the US were accused of masterminding a devastating attack on a US base in the city of Kerbala early in 2007 in which five American soldiers were killed .
When the Khazali brothers were arrested in Basra in March 2007 the US said they had a document containing detailed military information about the Kerbala camp .
A further problem is that the Iraqi government , Britain and the US do not want to be seen to be releasing prisoners in exchange for hostages .
But a solution appears to have been found by Asaib al - Haq promising the Iraqi government that it would renounce violence and join the political process .
This enabled the Iraqi government to say that the group could not do so while it held hostages , but it also suggested to the US that Asaib al - Haq could not be expected to cease armed actions while its leaders were being held in prison .
The attack at Kerbala , which was more expertly planned than most such incidents in Iraq , was part of a tit - for - tat covert war in Iraq between the US and Iran , sometimes waged through their proxies .
This conflict was particularly intense in the first half of 2007 , when five Iranian diplomatic officials were seized in a US helicopter raid on Arbil , the Kurdish capital , and , on 23 March in the same year , when 15 British Marines and naval personnel were captured by Iranian Revolutionary Guards in disputed waters in the Gulf .
Qais al - Khazali was part of the movement of the Shia anti-American cleric Muqtada al - Sadr following the US invasion in 2003 .
During the siege of the Sadrists by the US Marines in 2004 Qais was their chief spokesman .
Both brothers later split from the Sadrists and Qais became the leader of an Iranian - supported special group called Asaib al - Haq ( the Leagues of Righteousness ) .
These groups were alleged to be armed , trained and paid by the Iranians in 2006 - 07 and were thought to specialise in attacking US forces .
It was two months after the Khazali brothers had been captured that men in Iraqi police uniforms stormed the Finance Ministry .
They appeared to have exact information on what foreigners were employed there .
They found Mr Moore , who was working for Bearing Point , a US management consultancy , and grabbed him along with two of his guards , but failed to kidnap a second consultant who hid among a group of Iraqis .
Before the kidnappers left , they took away two other British guards working for the same Canadian security company , GardaWorld .
Little is known of the security men except that two , Alec and Jason , are Welsh and two others , Alan and another man , also called Jason , are Scottish .
At least four videos of the five Britons have since been released by the captors , the most recent in March this year to the British embassy in Baghdad .
Previously the videos had been given to the Arab media .
Gordon Brown described one of the videos , which said that one of the hostages called Jason had committed suicide , as " a very distressing development " .
Mr Moore 's father , Graeme , said last night he was optimistic that he might soon see his son following the freeing of Laith al - Khazali but was not taking anything for granted .
" This is obviously very exciting news , " he said .
" We have always been told that Peter may be the first one to be released .
I heard this afternoon that this may take place within two days .
The problem is that we have heard on several occasions in the past that a deal had been done and my son and the others were going to be freed but then this never happened . "
The war in Iraq has seen repeated kidnappings – the vast majority of the victims have been Iraqis and the motive has generally been money .
Kidnapping foreigners by Sunni insurgents was generally also for money , and the French and Italian governments are known to have paid large sums .
The five Britons , grim though their captivity may be , may be fortunate they were kidnapped by the Shia who , unlike the Sunni , generally keep their victims alive .
I 'm getting so tired of these stories .
I mean , what 's the point ?
Americans are perfectly happy to stay home and watch TV while our elected officials rob us blind and we struggle along without needed health care :
June 26 ( Bloomberg ) -- In June 2008 , U.S. Virgin Islands Governor John deJongh Jr. agreed to give London - based Diageo Plc billions of dollars in tax incentives to move its production of Captain Morgan rum from one U.S. island -- Puerto Rico -- to another , namely St. Croix .
DeJongh says he had no idea his deal would help make the world ’s largest liquor distiller the most unlikely beneficiary of the emergency Troubled Asset Relief Program approved by Congress just four months later .
Today , as two 56 - foot - high ( 17 - meter - high ) tanks for holding fermenting molasses will soon rise from the ground on the Caribbean island of St. Croix , the extent to which dozens of nonbank companies benefited from last October ’s emergency financial rescue plan is just beginning to come to light .
The hurried legislation adopted by a Congress voting under the threat of sudden global economic collapse led to hidden tax breaks for firms in dozens of industries .
They included builders of Nascar auto- racing tracks , restaurant chains such as Burger King Holdings Inc. , movie and television producers -- and London ’s Diageo .
“ It ’s kind of like the magician ’s sleight of hand , ” says former House Ways and Means Committee Chairman William Thomas , a California Republican who ran the committee from 2001 to 2007 and oversaw all tax legislation .
“ They snuck these things in a bill that was focused on other things . ”
[...]
The added tax breaks prevented the TARP legislation from being rejected a second time , says Michael Steel , a spokesman for House Minority Leader John Boehner .
Twenty - six Republicans , including Tim Murphy of Pennsylvania , John Shadegg of Arizona and Zach Wamp of Tennessee , reversed their earlier no votes .
Each of the tax provisions has a story -- and plenty of defenders .
It looks more like a house to me , but like the saying goes , " one man 's house is another He - Man 's Castle Grayskull " .
So who am I to argue ?
BESIDES THE BEST DAMN ( MASS ) DEBATER MY HIGH SCHOOL EVER SAW !
Anyway , this is a Hello Kitty castle that recently opened to the feline loving public in Shanghai , China .

Who says pot makes people lazy ?
The Marijuana Policy Project 's effort to legalize medicinal use of the plant in Arizona will be the " first major petition on the street " for 2010 's election , says Andrew Myers , local spokesman for the Project .
" We 're very much in need of people to help us gather signatures . "
Backers are hoping the early bird gets the roach .
They need to collect 153,365 valid signatures of registered voters by July , 2010 to put their citizens iniatiative on the ballot .
If approved by voters , the measure would be the second time Arizonans have legalized medical marijuana .
But this time , supporters expect it to stick .
Voters passed a medical pot proposal overwhelming in 1996 .
However , the law required patients to get a prescription from their doctor for marijuana , and the DEA threatened that doctors who wrote such prescriptions would have their licenses revoked .
( The latest proposal requires only a " recommendation " for pot and not a prescription ) .
Another measure in 2002 would have decriminalized marijuana for everyone .
That one failed because voters found it absurd that the Arizona Department of Public Safety would be forced into the dope - distribution business .
This new proposal has as excellent chance at passing , says Myers .
Polls conducted by the Marijuana Policy Project in February showed that 65 percent of likely voters support the idea .
The support cut across all demographic groups , Myers says .
Even the group that favored the initiative the least , self - described conservative Republicans , was split 50 - 50 on it , he says .
Surveys showed that Arizonans are n't quite ready for a law as liberal as the one in California , which allows a patient to obtain pot from a doctor for nearly any reason .
The planned initiative in this state would require a documented illness , though it does leave some wiggle - room in the concept of getting a pot recommendation for " severe pain . "
Although the Policy Project generally backs the complete legalization of marijuana , members believe changing laws for sick people is a priority .
" We can have a war over marijuana , and I 'm more than willing to have that discussion , " says Myers .
" But before we do , let 's get the sick and dying off the battlefield . "
( Myers laughed when we asked him if he 'd used that line with other media .
No one else has published it yet , he says ) .
" Our core belief is this :
We need to trust our physicians , " he says .
" It makes you angry to see how some of the most vulnerable people in our society have been treated by the government . "
Marijuana opponents , like former Maricopa County Attorney Rick Romley , say in an April 18 Arizona Republic article that the medical community , which has " never " pushed for medicinal marijuana , ought to make the decision on the issue :
" I just do n't believe we decide what 's good medicine at the ballot box , " Romley said .
The fallacy of such a statement should be obvious :
If Romley 's right , then lawmakers should n't decide " what 's good medicine " anymore than voters .
Yet lawmakers made marijuana illegal , not doctors .
In fact , when marijuana was first made illegal by Congress in 1937 , the American Medical Association opposed the law .
An interesting side - note is that Romley , who lost both legs above the knee to a land mine in Vietnam , is on the record as having smoked marijuana back in the 1970s .
If he'd been busted in Arizona at the time , he sure as heck would n't have been elected county attorney -- and , thus , he 'd likely have no public forum to state his opposition to this iniatitive .
It may not look like something you 'd take onto the local freeway , but the car in the above picture can easily hit highway speeds , running on nothing but solar power .
It 's the newest vehicle , called Infinium , to be produced by the University of Michigan 's solar car team .
That team drove Infinium 's predecessor , Continuum , to a ten - hour margin of victory in the 2,400 - mile North American Challenge last year , and is planning on racing its newest vehicle in the World Challenge in Australia later this year .
We talked with Alex Dowling , the team 's strategy director , about everything that goes into solar racing .
The mere fact that there 's a strategy director involved should hint that driving a solar car involves a lot more than simply having the fastest car on the course .
The students on the Michigan team handle everything from meteorology to clearing roadkill from the race course — and that 's just on race days .
The evolution of solar cars
Dowling said that , when solar racing first started , cars were n't getting all that much power from the sun to the wheels .
As a result , aerodynamics really did n't matter all that much , while catching the sun did , so cars had all sorts of elaborate mechanisms for getting as much of their solar cells into the sunlight as they could .
As things grew more efficient and the cars picked up speed , aerodynamic issues came to dominate — teams would build an efficient shape , and build the panels into that , catching as many rays as they could .
This ushered in what Dowling called the " rolling poptart " era of racing vehicles .
What changed next was n't the approach , but the rules .
Starting with the 20th anniversary edition of the race in 2007 , things had to get a bit more car - like , with an upright driver 's seat and an actual steering wheel , and solar panels were limited to covering six square meters of the vehicle 's surface .
This appears to have ushered in something akin to a pregnant poptart , one that , with driver and ballast , weighs in at about 300 kg ( 660 lbs ) .
With one major exception , the components of the car are simply exotic versions of familiar items .
The solar cells are n't silicon — Dowling said that current silicon is in the area of 20 percent efficiency .
Instead , they use a triple - junction gallium - arsenide cell of the sort that typically powers a satellite ; these yield efficiencies above 25 percent .
The car also has some batteries to smooth over bumps in the solar power , although those take up less than 30kg of the car 's weight .
Using lithium polymer cells , those can pump out about six kilowatt hours , which will keep the car running for three hours at highway speeds .
Those of you who can do basic math have probably recognized that this means the car runs on engines that draw two kilowatts of power , a number that Dowling compared to the draw of an industrial microwave oven — which you may have encountered while nuking a frozen burrito at your local 7 - Eleven .
It does that using a lightweight , highly efficient engine that was developed by an Australian research agency ; the engine itself is integrated into the wheels of the vehicle .
" To a first - order approximation , the engine is the electrical system , " Dowling told Ars .
Nevertheless , the car has a series of low - powered embedded boards to distribute power , monitor performance , and handle communications , running on the sort of network that 's typically used in current - generation autos .
Although these do n't add up to a major power draw , they involve lots of customization , and are fairly sophisticated .
The team has made them so that they can be reprogrammed remotely and , if that does n't work , they can swap them out at the next scheduled break point .
During the North American challenge , where it took the team 50 hours to get from Plano , Texas to Calgary , it suffered only 20 minutes of downtime .
The previous model , the Continuum , shown with a car for scale .

Moving beyond the car
But , as we mentioned earlier , a lot goes into racing a solar car beyond the car itself .
" As the speed increases you 're starting to look at 50 , 60 mph ; there 's a considerable amount of power consumed by each additional mile an hour , " Dowling said .
" There 's a trade off between energy and time . "
To determine how best to expend the vehicle 's energy budget , including the power in its batteries , the team has developed software that models the vehicle 's performance .
To provide the raw material for that model , the team relies both on performance measurements of the vehicle ( which , since they built it , they definitely have ) and field data from the route of the challenge .
The team uses a commercial high - precision GPS system that can typically provide locations at 10 cm precision .
Prior to the race , the team drives the whole route , producing a three - dimensional profile for their models .
This also gives them a chance to note some of the road features that may play into strategic decisions , like speed limits , sharp turns , and the like .
The model also takes meteorological inputs , which help it figure out how much power the car is likely to have to work with .
But , since " nobody really forecasts for the middle of Australia , " as Dowling put it , the Michigan group brings along its own meteorological team , and has been known to launch its own weather balloons ahead of some races .
On race day , the race team deploys several vehicles beyond the car doing the actual racing , and integrates all their data and locations into " something like an amateur fleet management system that a trucking company might deploy , " Dowling said .
To keep them all on the same page , they set up their own network , using cellular signals in the US , and satellite communications when in Australia .
The weather team drives about forty miles ahead of the vehicle and , in addition to the weather data , marks road hazards like potholes and debris on their map .
For the smaller debris , like roadkill kangaroos in Australia , a scout team that has a shorter lead over the racing vehicle stops and clears them , updating the shared map accordingly .
Immediately behind the solar car is the chase vehicle , which houses the strategy team .
All of that generally keeps the racing vehicle speeding through checkpoints and stage stops .
A real - world opportunity
Dowling said that the Michigan team is entirely student run — there are faculty advisors , but they primarily perform administrative duties and help ensure that the project meets safety requirements .
At any given time , there are roughly 40 students that are willing to put 10 hours or more into the work , performing work that includes fundraising , speaking about the project to high school students , working on the hardware and software , etc .
Since the entire team turns over every few years due to graduation , the project has to have a pretty strong appeal in order to drag people away from all the other options college life provides .
For Dowling , the experience adds depth to the classroom experience .
" It has been three years of immense technical management and learning experiences , " he said .
" It 's both an educational opportunity and a sanity check on classroom material — you 're likely to trust something once you 've gone out in the field to use it . "
So , although some of the technology behind the solar car is n't likely to show up on the roads any time soon — and some of it is already there — the students will be taking the experience they get into their careers , which will undoubtedly involve fields that are far more diverse than the automotive industry .

Our current income tax system , inaugurated in 1913 with the adoption of the 16th Amendment , began with a 1 percent tax on taxable income above $ 3,000 ( $ 4,000 for married couples ) .
A series of surcharges of up to 6 percent were applied to higher incomes , with the maximum rate being 7 percent on taxable income over $ 500,000 .
Less than 0.5 percent of the population ended up paying income tax .
From these humble beginnings , the income tax soon blossomed , thanks to World War I , into a tax with a minimum rate that doubled and a maximum rate that reached 77 percent on income of over $ 1 million .
The rates did not fall significantly until 1925 .
In the middle of the Great Depression , the top rate rose to 79 percent .
During World War II , the tax rate for those in the highest income bracket reached an astounding 94 percent .
The Internal Revenue Code of 1954 resulted in 24 brackets with rates ranging from 20 to 91 percent .
The top rate remained at 91 percent until 1964 .
Under the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 and the Tax Reform Act of 1986 , the top marginal tax rates were lowered to 50 and 28 percent respectively .
The Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation
Act of 2001 established the current tax brackets of 10 , 15 , 25 , 28 , 33 , and 35 percent .
There is no question that the federal tax code is too long , too complex , too intrusive , too confusing , and too inequitable .
The members of Congress responsible for the tax code would not even disagree .
As a consequence , cries for tax reform can always be heard from every quarter — and especially around election time .
There are even organizations dedicated solely to tax reform , such as Americans for Tax Reform , Reform AMT , Citizens for Tax Justice , and Americans for Fair Taxation .
Since the federal government is always looking to increase its revenue while at the same time making Americans feel better about paying their taxes , it has also climbed aboard the tax - reform bus , most recently in 2005 when President Bush formed the President 's Advisory Panel on Federal Tax Reform .
I am sorry to say that principled libertarians who welcome gradualism toward the goal of substantially reducing or abolishing the income tax while at the same time shunning any compromise of the principle that taxation is theft — like those friends and supporters of the Mises Institute — are in the minority .
Left - liberals , who want to use the tax code for their social engineering and income redistribution schemes , are not opposed to taxes on principle .
Barack Obama ran campaign commercials openly boasting that no taxes would be raised on any American making under $ 250,000 .
This , of course , means that he intends to fleece any American making over this amount .
Conservatives are not generally opposed to taxes on principle either .
They have no problem taxing the American people to fund bloated defense budgets , US military adventures around the world , the CIA , FBI , and anything related to law enforcement or homeland security , faith - based welfare programs , educational vouchers , abstinence - education programs , the war on drugs , and various conservative pork projects .
But what 's up with libertarians ?
Brink Lindsey , of the Cato Institute , supposedly a libertarian think tank , wrote in an online article for the New Republic that also appeared on the Cato website :
Tax reform also offers the possibility of win-win bargains .
The basic idea is simple :
Shift taxes away from things we want more of and onto things we want less of .
Specifically , cut taxes on savings and investment , cut payroll taxes on labor , and make up the shortfall with increased taxation of consumption .
Go ahead , tax the rich , but do n't do it when they 're being productive .
Tax them instead when they 're splurging — by capping the deductibility of home - mortgage interest and tax incentives for purchasing health insurance .
And tax everybody 's energy consumption .
All taxes impose costs on the economy , but at least energy taxes carry the silver lining of encouraging conservation — plus , because such taxes exert downward pressure on world oil prices , foreign oil monopolies would wind up getting stuck with part of the bill .
Shift taxes ?
Increase taxes ?
Tax the rich ?
Impose new taxes ?
Use the tax code to influence public policy ?
What kind of libertarian tax reform plan is this ?
How about reduce , cut , eliminate , and abolish taxes ?
Not deductions , not exemptions , not credits , not shelters , not loopholes — taxes .
Two specific tax reform plans that some libertarians have fallen for are the Flat Tax and the FairTax .
Both plans promise to invigorate the economy , increase employment , and raise everyone 's standard of living .
Neither one is true to its name ; neither one is an incremental step toward overall lower taxes .
Both are fraught with problems and contradictions ; both are revenue - neutral plans that would fund the federal government at the same obscene level that it is now .
The Flat Tax is an income tax .
It is the tax - reform idea that has been around the longest .
First proposed by economist Milton Friedman in 1962 , the flat tax entered the mainstream through a 1981 Wall Street Journal article by Hoover Institution economists Robert Hall and Alvin Rabushka called " A Proposal to Simplify Our Tax System . "
This article grew into a 1985 book published by the Hoover Institution Press called The Flat Tax .
A second edition was published in 1995 , and an " updated revised edition " in 2007 that can hardly be called either .
Aside from this book , the Flat Tax gained national prominence when House Majority Leader Dick Armey ( R - TX ) pushed the idea of a Flat Tax after the Republicans gained control of Congress during the Clinton administration .
A few bills based on the Hall - Rabushka plan were then introduced in Congress , but came to nothing .
Other incarnations of the Flat Tax were pushed by both Democrats and Republicans .
Another incarnation of the Flat Tax is that of former Republican presidential candidate Steve Forbes .
His 2005 book is called Flat Tax Revolution .
Under a Flat Tax , everyone 's income is taxed at the same rate ( Forbes says 17 percent ; Hall and Rabushka say 19 percent ) .
And not only are there no tax brackets , there are generally no tax deductions other than personal and dependent allowances .
Social Security and Medicare taxes would remain as they are now .
The appeal of the Flat Tax is simplicity .
You can do your taxes on a postcard - sized form says Forbes .
Goodbye compliance costs .
The problem with the Flat Tax is a simple one : the Flat Tax is not flat .
And furthermore , no one actually pays 17 or 19 percent .
In fact , taxpayers do n't even pay the same percentage .
The Flat Tax is actually a highly progressive tax .
It is more progressive than our current system , and effectively has more tax brackets .
Who said progressivity requires graduated tax rates ?
Under the Forbes plan , a family of four would pay no federal income tax on its first $ 46,165 of income ; a family of six would owe nothing until its income exceeded $ 65,930 .
And those figures are sure to have increased since they were first proposed back in 2005 .
But not only would many families pay no income tax , they still might get a refund anyway because the Forbes plan includes a refundable child credit and earned - income credit .
If you want an example of a real flat tax , look no further than the 2.9 percent Medicare tax .
Everyone pays 2.9 percent ( split between employer and employee ) , on every dollar earned , no matter one 's marital status , number of dependents , or income level .
I am in favor of neither the tax nor Medicare , but if you are looking for a genuine flat tax , then the Medicare tax is your tax .
The Fairtax is a consumption tax .
It is the most radical tax reform plan , bar none .
It also has the most vocal and intolerant proponents .
The FairTax is the brainchild of three businessmen concerned about the crippling effects on the economy of the current federal tax code .
After adopting the name " FairTax " for their tax - reform plan , they formed Americans for Fair Taxation in 1997 and enlisted Representative John Linder ( R - GA ) to introduce FairTax legislation in Congress .
Linder first sponsored the " Fair Tax Act " in the House in July of 1999 , and has reintroduced a FairTax bill at the beginning of every term of Congress since then , including the current one .
Although Linder 's FairTax bill languishes in the House Committee on Ways and Means each time it is introduced , it has always had a number of cosponsors , including Tom Tancredo and Duncan Hunter — but not Ron Paul , the acknowledged taxpayers ' best friend .
It also has its share of supporters outside of Congress , including Mike Huckabee and Neal Boortz .
The latter is the author , with Congressman Linder , of The FairTax Book , published in 2005 .
A paperback version of The FairTax Book was issued in 2006 with some notable changes to correct false statements made in the original hardcover release of the book .
Boortz and Linder also published a sequel , FairTax : The Truth , Answering the Critics , just last year .
I am getting weary of writing about the FairTax .
Every time I think I 've written my last article on the subject , some new opportunity presents itself and I take the bait , as I am doing right now .
I do n't consider myself to be an expert on the FairTax .
Although the idea of the FairTax has been around since 1997 , I had never even heard of the FairTax until I wrote an article for the Mises Institute in 2005 on the evils of the withholding tax .
It was only after my inbox was bombarded with mail from FairTaxers trying to sell me on the FairTax that I looked into it .
If you have read any of my articles on the subject you know that I did n't like what I saw .
" Why is it that people who rightly criticize the income tax are so quick to accept a national sales tax on consumption ? "
The FairTax is a national retail sales tax of 30 percent on the final sale of all new goods and services .
All new goods — from cars and houses to prescription drugs and food ; and all services — from operations and funerals to rent and haircuts .
Because it would replace the personal income tax , there would also no longer be withholding tax , capital - gains tax , the alternative - minimum tax , or taxes on interest and dividends .
Even your gambling winnings would no longer be taxed .
Of course , there would be no tax deductions either .
The FairTax would likewise eliminate corporate income tax , estate tax , gift tax , unemployment tax , Social Security tax , and Medicare tax .
The appeal is obvious : no more complex tax code , no more taxes withheld from paychecks , no more 1040 forms , no more record keeping , no more compliance costs , no more IRS audits .
And if that were n't enough , the FairTax also includes a monthly rebate to offset the taxes paid on basic necessities .
But for a plan that promises such a utopia , the problems with the FairTax are legion .
The stated rate of the FairTax is too low to achieve the promised revenue neutrality .
The amount by which it is claimed that prices would fall under a FairTax system has been grossly exaggerated .
There is nothing to prevent an income tax from being reinstituted , giving us a two - headed hydra of an income tax and a consumption tax .
And not only would state and local governments have to pay a national sales tax to the federal government , the federal government would have to pay sales taxes to itself on all its new purchases .
Since I have already written extensively about the problems with the FairTax , I will stop with its problems here and focus on why the FairTax , like the Flat Tax , is not true to its name .
So why is the FairTax not fair ?
Well , first of all , what 's fair about a consumption tax ?
Why is it that people who rightly criticize the income tax are so quick to accept a national sales tax on consumption ?
The FairTax perpetuates the fallacy that the government has a right to confiscate a percentage of the value of each new good sold and every service rendered .
This is no different than claiming that the government has a right to the portion of each American 's income .
As Murray Rothbard explained ,
The consumption tax , on the other hand , can only be regarded as a payment for permission - to - live .
It implies that a man will not be allowed to advance or even sustain his own life , unless he pays , off the top , a fee to the State for permission to do so .
The consumption tax does not strike me , in its philosophical implications , as one whit more noble , or less presumptuous , than the income tax .
The FairTax is also not fair because of the rate .
What is fair about the government taking a 30 percent cut on every transaction ?
I know the FairTaxers claim that the rate is only 23 percent , but when I buy an item for $ 1.00 and end up paying $ 1.30 , the basic math I learned in elementary school tells me that I paid a tax rate of 30 percent .
But regardless of whether the rate is 23 or 30 percent , why should the bloated , pork - laden leviathan we call the US government get anywhere near this much of our income ?
And finally , maintaining that the FairTax is a " fair " tax system , or one that is " fairer " than our current system , is highly subjective .
Boortz himself even acknowledges this in his newest book on the FairTax : " Whether a tax system is ' fair ' is a complicated economic and philosophical question , one that inevitably involves oversimplification and subjective judgment . "
If you want an example of a real fair tax , then consider the equal tax .
I first saw this proposed by Joe Sobran .
Let every American pay the same amount — no deductions , no exemptions , and no exceptions .
Sobran reasons ,
The billionaire does n't use the police or the streets any more than the pauper .
Maybe less , since he presumably hires private guards to protect him and has less need of the police , and he is less likely to drive long distances than to fly .
Now , I would n't like paying this tax any more than I like paying income tax , but it is certainly a fair tax .
But not only is the Flat Tax not flat and the FairTax not fair , the Flat Tax is not fair and the FairTax is not flat .
Let me repeat that : not only is the Flat Tax not flat and the FairTax not fair , the Flat Tax is not fair and the FairTax is not flat .
According to Hall and Rabushka , the flat - tax system they propose is both " fair and progressive — the poor pay no tax , and the amount that a family pays rises with income . "
They say their Flat Tax is fair because it is based on the principle that " income should be taxed exactly once , as close as possible to its source . "
But how can a system that punishes success and fosters class envy be considered " fair " ?
And why should it be considered " fair " that income is taxed " exactly once , as close as possible to its source " ?
Just because every American would pay the same rate under the Flat Tax does n't necessarily make it a fair tax .
Making the tax code less progressive is not enough .
As Rothbard again explains ,
The flat - tax movement is part of a process by which the government and its allies have been able to split and deflect the tax protest movement from trying to lower the taxes of everyone , into trying to force everyone into paying some arbitrarily defined " fair share . "
It is no consolation to a wealthy person who is stripped of his money by the federal government that a poorer person is likewise relieved of his money by the same percentage .
One of the reasons FairTax supporters claim that their tax is fair is that it has a flat rate that everyone would pay .
But the FairTax is about as flat as it is fair .
I already mentioned that the FairTax includes a monthly rebate to offset the taxes paid on basic necessities .
This " prebate " is based on the government poverty level and family size .
Thus , although everyone would pay the same rate under the FairTax , the end result would be that some Americans would pay no taxes at all , some would have most of their taxes offset , and some would get more money back than they paid in taxes .
This makes the FairTax an income redistribution scheme under the guise of tax reform .
" We need radical tax reform that reduces , cuts , eliminates , and abolishes taxes without replacing them with other taxes . "
Neither the Flat Tax nor the FairTax is a step toward the libertarian goal of substantially reducing or abolishing the income tax ; neither tax - reform plan is an incremental step toward lower overall taxes .
They could be , however , if their promoters recognized that the problem is taxation itself , not the tax code .
All they have done is shift the debate from how much of the wealth of the American people the federal government confiscates to the manner in which the wealth is confiscated .
We do n't need compassionate tax reform that makes people feel better about paying their taxes ; we need radical tax reform that reduces , cuts , eliminates , and abolishes taxes without replacing them with other taxes .
As I have quoted Congressman Ron Paul on many occasions , " The real issue is total spending by government , not tax reform . "
With the federal budget fast approaching $ 4 trillion , I can't think of anything that is more of a waste of time than quibbling about how the government can make the tax rates flatter or fairer while it robs us of trillions of dollars .
The only fair tax is a tax low enough to flatten skyrocketing congressional spending .
Like educational vouchers and the privatization of Social Security , the Flat Tax and the FairTax are gimmicks that libertarians should avoid .
1. Create a setting where everything seems perfect , beyond expectations , until the characters of your story begin to dig beneath the surface .
Soon , everything turns out to be a facade– Luxury gives way to mold and disease , opulence gives way to cheap corner cutting , and what was originally seen as something incredible and perfect is quickly exposed for what it really is .
2 . Consider for a moment what it would be like to be directly involved in analyzing a situation or a threat to a population ( of humans , bacteria , or other forms of plant or animal life ) and addressing a solution of alternative action that could either be a fix ( however temporary or permanent ) or a preventative measure .
Put yourself in the shoes of a professional scientist who considers it to be her or his duty to look at and handle this burgeoning situation , then write your groundbreaking report .
If you ’re stuck for ideas , create a new disease or “ Chronic defect ” and then approach it from the observational and detached position of a researcher .
3 .
People in today ’s world have all kinds of strange allergies .
Just right now , I can think of three such people , one allergic to red dye # 5 , one allergic to chlorinated water ( as in pools ) and one who ’s allergic to cucumbers ( even in the form of pickles . )
Using an existing , but bizarre allergy ( or by creating and using a new one ) write a story about someone who suffers from it , how it effects their life , and how they ultimately overcome it .
4 .
Television rules the nation .
Write a story where the mainstream media ’s domination over the common man is emphasized , where the average populace blurs together , and only a few people are truly aloof and free .
What makes them different ( besides not watching TV ? )
How do they view the hypnotized masses ?
As tools , idiots , or souls to be pitied ?
Are they interested in change ?
What will they do to insure it happens ( or to keep it from happening ? ) 5. Some series that have appeared since the advent of entertainment as a medium have become iconic , thoroughly integrating themselves into our society in a way that makes them unforgettable and subject to a massive fan base or instant recognition ( like Sherlock Holmes or Star Wars ) .
What is it that makes them so iconic , so popular ?
What is it that they have and so much else seems to so painfully lack ?
Try to capture that something and instill it into a story of your own invention .
6. Write a “ Chop - Saki . ”
Think about every Jackie Chan or Bruce Lee film you ’ve ever seen , every late night kung - fu flick you ’ve ever sat and watched without reaching for the remote and changing the channel .
Now , put that knowledge to work !
Craft something new , something exciting that ’s only cheesy if you want it to be .
7 .
The idea of being invaded by a hostile force is a terrifying one .
Write a story where an invasion ( either real , fantastic or futuristic , etc. ) is imminent , and the invading force is superior in both equipment and tactics .
How do you prepare to meet this invasion ?
Will you defend yourself ?
If so , then with what ?
However far your ingenuity takes you , will it be enough to turn the tide , or will you and your compatriots fall before your foes anyway ?
8 .
A lot of college humor in the last few decades focuses on the comedic way that binge drinking tends to erase all of the memories of the night before and leave a person holding their head , wondering where they left their pants– and their dignity .
Write a story where this is the case , but provide a way for the character ( or at least the reader ) to track back through the night of debauchery until the true list of the previous night ’s events are laid bare .
9 . Experiment with poetry and form .
Try something new , play with it until it all fits together .
If you ’re strapped for ideas , try a Sestina form , a Fibonacci Sequence or a 26 line poem with lines that all begin with a letter of the alphabet , in proper order .
10 .
Resisting any impulses you may have of seeing it as morbid , visit a graveyard and check out the grave markers and headstones until you find one that catches you .
Write a story about that person ’s life , what it might have been like , the kind of things they might have had to deal with .
Tony Fratto is envious .
Mr. Fratto was a colleague of mine in the Bush administration , and as a senior member of the White House communications shop , he knows just how difficult it can be to deal with a press corps skeptical about presidential economic claims .
It now appears , however , that Mr. Fratto's problem was that he simply lacked the magic words -- jobs " saved or created . "
" Saved or created " has become the signature phrase for Barack Obama as he describes what his stimulus is doing for American jobs .
His latest invocation came yesterday , when the president declared that the stimulus had already saved or created at least 150,000 American jobs -- and announced he was ramping up some of the stimulus spending so he could " save or create " an additional 600,000 jobs this summer .
These numbers come in the context of an earlier Obama promise that his recovery plan will " save or create three to four million jobs over the next two years . "
The president should ' save or create ' more jobs in Cleveland .
Associated Press
Mr. Fratto sees a double standard at play .
" We would never have used a formula like ' save or create , ' " he tells me .
" To begin with , the number is pure fiction -- the administration has no way to measure how many jobs are actually being ' saved . '
And if we had tried to use something this flimsy , the press would never have let us get away with it . "
Of course , the inability to measure Mr. Obama 's jobs formula is part of its attraction .
Never mind that no one -- not the Labor Department , not the Treasury , not the Bureau of Labor Statistics -- actually measures " jobs saved . "
As the New York Times delicately reports , Mr. Obama 's jobs claims are " based on macroeconomic estimates , not an actual counting of jobs . "
Nice work if you can get away with it .
And get away with it he has .
However dubious it may be as an economic measure , as a political formula " save or create " allows the president to invoke numbers that convey an illusion of precision .
Harvard economist and former Bush economic adviser Greg Mankiw calls it a " non-measurable metric . "
And on his blog , he acknowledges the political attraction .
" The expression ' create or save , ' which has been used regularly by the President and his economic team , is an act of political genius , " writes Mr. Mankiw .
" You can measure how many jobs are created between two points in time .
But there is no way to measure how many jobs are saved .
Even if things get much , much worse , the President can say that there would have been 4 million fewer jobs without the stimulus . "
Mr. Obama 's comments yesterday are a perfect illustration of just such a claim .
In the months since Congress approved the stimulus , our economy has lost nearly 1.6 million jobs and unemployment has hit 9.4 % .
Invoke the magic words , however , and -- presto ! -- you have the president claiming he has " saved or created " 150,000 jobs .
It all makes for a much nicer spin , and helps you forget this is the same team that only a few months ago promised us that passing the stimulus would prevent unemployment from rising over 8 % .
It 's not only former Bush staffers such as Messrs .
Fratto and Mankiw who have noted the political convenience here .
During a March hearing of the Senate Finance Committee , Chairman Max Baucus challenged Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner on the formula .
" You created a situation where you cannot be wrong , " said the Montana Democrat .
" If the economy loses two million jobs over the next few years , you can say yes , but it would 've lost 5.5 million jobs .
If we create a million jobs , you can say , well , it would have lost 2.5 million jobs .
You 've given yourself complete leverage where you cannot be wrong , because you can take any scenario and make yourself look correct . "
Now , something 's wrong when the president invokes a formula that makes it impossible for him to be wrong and it goes largely unchallenged .
It 's true that almost any government spending will create some jobs and save others .
But as Milton Friedman once pointed out , that does n't tell you much :
The government , after all , can create jobs by hiring people to dig holes and fill them in .
If the " saved or created " formula looks brilliant , it 's only because Mr. Obama and his team are not being called on their claims .
And do n't expect much to change .
So long as the news continues to repeat the administration 's line that the stimulus has already " saved or created " 150,000 jobs over a time period when the U.S. economy suffered an overall job loss 10 times that number , the White House would be insane to give up a formula that allows them to spin job losses into jobs saved .
" You would think that any self - respecting White House press corps would show some of the same skepticism toward President Obama 's jobs claims that they did toward President Bush 's tax cuts , " says Mr. Fratto .
" But I 'm still waiting . "

Advertisement Rooks have a remarkable aptitude for using tools , scientists have found .
Tests on captive birds revealed that they could craft and employ tools to solve a number of different problems .
The findings , published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , came as a surprise as rooks do not use tools in the wild .
Despite this , the UK team said the birds ' skills rivalled those of well - known tool users such as chimpanzees and New Caledonian crows .
Dr Nathan Emery , an author of the paper from Queen Mary , University of London , said : " The study shows the creativity and insight that rooks have when they solve problems . "
The scientists focused on four captive rooks : Cook , Fry , Connelly and Monroe , and discovered that the birds were able to use tools in a number of ways to solve a variety of problems .
Meet the brains of the animal world For example , the birds were presented with a vertical tube , running down to a trap - door with an out - of - reach worm perched upon it , as well as a number of different - sized stones placed nearby .
The scientists discovered that the rooks would select the largest stone , which was heavy enough to push open the trap - door , and drop it into the tube to release the snack .
And when given a selection of different - shaped stones , some of which could fit into the tube , some of which could not , the rooks opted for a tool that would give them access to the treat .
Lead author Christopher Bird , from Cambridge University , said : " We have found that they can select the appropriate tools out of a choice of tools and they show flexibility in the types of tools they use . "

The researchers also found the rooks could use two tools in succession - something that is described as metatool use .
They gave the birds a large stone , as well as two vertical tubes , one wide , with a small stone perched at the bottom on a trap - door , and another thin , this time containing a worm .
They found that the rooks would first drop the large stone into the wide tube to release the smaller stone , and subsequently drop this small stone into the thin tube to free the tasty treat .
Until now , metatool use has only been seen in great apes and New Caledonian crows .

Advertisement Perhaps most surprisingly , the team also revealed that rooks could modify and create new tools .
They found that the rooks would bend a piece of straight wire into a hook so that they could retrieve a bucket laden with food from the bottom of the vertical well .
Until now , this novel tool - fashioning behaviour has only been reported for a single New Caledonian crow called Betty .
But in this study , three of the four rooks created the hook in their first trial .
Bird brains ?
Mr Bird told BBC
News : " It was a big surprise to find out that rooks could use tools .
" We 've seen this kind of tool use in New Caledonian crows , but the interesting thing about the rooks is that they do not use tools in the wild . "
Both rooks and New Caledonian crows belong to the corvids , a bird group that is renowned for intelligent behaviour .
Rooks are a member of the corvid family However , until now , it was thought that sophisticated tool - use was limited to New Caledonian crows , a species found on the island of New Caledonia in the Pacific that create tools to pluck grubs from holes .
Mr Bird said : " Tool use is probably very important for these crows because of their ecology - they may get a large proportion of the protein they need from these grubs .
" And it has been suggested that tool - use is a trait unique to that species that might have evolved because of ecological pressures . "
But the finding that rooks can also use tools raises questions about how this special ability might have come about .
Mr Bird said : " Rooks do n't have the same pressures [ as New Caledonian crows ] .
In the wild they do n't need tools - they have lots of access to other sources of food , like carrion , human rubbish , and seeds from agriculture , things like that . "
The researchers said that this could mean that an ancient ancestor of the corvids might have evolved the capacity to use tools as well as a complex understanding of the physical properties of materials .
Dr Emery told BBC
News : " Because they do n't use tools in the wild , the question is why should they have evolved the ability to use tools in the lab and understand the properties of those objects as tools ?
" Is this a form of general intelligence that has been co-opted for tool use ? "
The researchers say the finding raises the possibility that other corvid species may also possess an innate ability to use tools .

The real - time strategy genre is a tricky one ; it can be hard to get your name out among the AAA franchises that seem to grab all the headlines .
Using the Halo universe for a setting is certainly one solid strategy , as Halo Wars has sold over one million units worldwide .
Microsoft is sharing a few other impressive stats : 2.6 million multiplayer matches have been played , and 118 years of time have been spent on Xbox Live playing Halo Wars , with over 200,000 people playing each day .
While gaming is certainly no better or worse than other hobbies when it comes to sinking time , those numbers do make you think about what else could have been accomplished ... before you get back to playing co-op .
With this milestone reached in such a short time — the game was released at the beginning of the month — you can bet the title will be supported into the future .
Microsoft calls these early stats " just the beginning . "
What else can we expect ?
That 's unknown , but it 's coming .
" Microsoft is working closely with partner and newly formed studio Robot Entertainment , which is comprised of Halo Wars and Age of Empires veterans from Ensemble Studios .
More Halo
Wars content is being prepared , so stay tuned . "
What do we want to see ?
A Covenant campaign , for starters .
More units and missions is also a no- brainer .
There is a ton of room for expansion in Halo Wars ; the game could be kept viable through new content packs for quite a while .
First off ... there 's an iPod Touch , but I 've yet to see an iTouch .
iTouch sounds like something dirty .
Second , while this is a great idea in theory , by the time you download a video ( especially over 3G if allowed , but WiFi also ) your battery would be gone .
So unless they are somehow upping the battery life 10 - fold or giving us on - the - fly battery swappage , I do n't see any use for this .
Thank you all for your patience .
Enjoy the Big Wet Asses 15 trailer , including Gianna 's 1st anal scene :
Also enjoy this interview of Gianna , taken shortly after shooting the anal scene :
The U.S. Trade Representative released its Special 301 report today , in which it casts judgement on the intellectual property laws of dozens of countries around the world .
To the surprise of no one , Canada finds itself playing the role of Bill Murray in Groundhog Day as it once again is target .
In fact , this year the U.S. aims to increase the pressure by elevating Canada to the Priority Watch List ( a more sinister designation than the previous Watch List ) , implausibly claiming that Canada sits alongside countries like Russia and China with its intellectual property laws .
The move is not unexpected , given recent comments from Vice President Joe Biden and U.S. Congressional panels as well as the demands from U.S. lobby groups .
Those same groups will now dust off their press releases that lament the " embarrassment " of being included on the list ( never mind that countries that represent more than 70 percent of the world 's population are on the list ) and the failure to introduce U.S. - style reforms ( never mind that Canada enacted anti-camcording laws in 2007 , introduced C - 61 last year , is an original negotiating partner in the ACTA negotiations , joined the U.S. as a third party in the WTO copyright complaint against China , etc. ) .
Hopefully , the Canadian officials will similarly dust off their advice to the Minister , which for the past few years has stated ( as obtained under Access to Information ) :
The Government is disappointed with the United States ' decision to include Canada in its [ year here ] Special 301 " Watch List . "
Canada does not recognize the Special 301 process due to its lacking of reliable and objective analysis , and we have raised this issue regularly with the U.S. in our bilateral discussions . "
Those same sentiments were expressed by an official at the Department of Foreign Affairs to a House of Commons committee in 2007 :
In regard to the watch list , Canada does not recognize the 301 watch list process .
It basically lacks reliable and objective analysis .
It 's driven entirely by U.S. industry .
We have repeatedly raised this issue of the lack of objective analysis in the 301 watch list process with our U.S. counterparts .
While this demonstrates that Canadian officials recognize the Special 301 process for what it is ( and is n't ) , it may well be time to take a more aggressive approach .
This year , twenty countries responded to the USTR process , challenging the claims of lobby groups like the IIPA and their possible inclusion on the list .
Some focused on their IP reform efforts , while others challenged the legality of reaching a conclusion of non-compliance .
The strongest came from Israel , which in discussing the view that the absence of anti-circumvention legislation could be the basis for inclusion on the list , stated :
given the industry objections to TPM , it lack of uniform implementation worldwide and its nascent obsolescence , non implementation of TPM can not be the basis for determining that a country , as in the words of the Trade Act of 1974 ( 19 USC 2242 ) " denies adequate and effective protection of intellectual property rights or deny fair and equitable market access to U.S. persons who rely on intellectual property protection .
I think Israel is on the right track here ( though it too was elevated to the Priority Watch List ) .
It is not enough to say that the Special 301 process is unreliable and lacks objectivity .
Canadian officials must counter claims that Canada – which is compliant with its international obligations and has been a major partner for the U.S. on international IP matters – should be included at all .
Update :
Here the come the lobbyist releases – the MPAA , Entertainment Software Association , and IIPA all celebrate Canada 's inclusion on the list .
Citing copyright infringement concerns , Apple wo n't include a BitTorrent client in the App Store .
The Cupertino - based electronics company rejected Maza Digital 's Drivetrain , saying " this category of applications is often used for the purpose of infringing third - party rights .
We have chosen to not publish this type of application to the App Store . "
Apple is well known for banning porn-related apps or those it deems culturally unworthy .
That said , the latest rejection is rather ironic : iPhones , iPods , even Apple computers and those produced by its competitors are routinely used " for the purpose of infringing third - party rights . "
And there already is at least one app available , called trackr , which is described as " an RSS reader with the unique ability to queue to torrent downloads diectly from an RSS feed . "
Clearly , there are legitimate uses for the BitTorrent protocol .
Still , Apple is obviously wary of authorizing BitTorrent downloading apps because it could hinder its iTunes market for videos and music by turning the iPhone into a pocket - sized venue for ripping off pirated content .
It is also fighting to retain control of its App Store as the Copyright Office is considering authorizing iPhone users to jailbreak the device and run unauthorized apps .
Aaron Scott , the developer of Drivetrain , said via an e-mail interview from Australia that Apple 's decision was " ridiculous . "
" I do think that some people might choose to download pirated works .
But they can not outlaw a program because of a few who choose to do the wrong thing .
The BitTorrent protocol and client apps are not illegal , " he said .
Hat nod : ilounge
Sign language : week 45
Another selection of amusing signs sent in by readers on their travels .
Or a carton of milk , or a loaf of bread .
Both George Will and Greg Mankiw basically argue that we do n’t need a government role because we can trust the market to work — hey , we do it for groceries , right ?
Um , economists have known for 45 years — ever since Kenneth Arrow ’s seminal paper — that the standard competitive market model just does n’t work for health care : adverse selection and moral hazard are so central to the enterprise that nobody , nobody expects free - market principles to be enough .
To act all wide - eyed and innocent about these problems at this late date is either remarkably ignorant or simply disingenuous .
This is haskeem , a small scheme interpreter .
It lives on the web at http://www.korgwal.com/haskeem/
You should be able to build it with cabal configure cabal build
Once you have done so , find the haskeem executable and run it .
At the " lisp > " prompt , type ( assuming you are still in the top - level haskeem directory ) ( load " stdlib.scm " ) ( load " selftest.scm " )
The first command loads haskeem 's standard library , and the second command runs the self - test .
Assuming that all works , you can automate some of this : copy the haskeem executable and the stdlib.scm file to some standard location (s ) , and then set the environment variable HASKEEM_INIT to the absolute path of the stdlib.scm file .
I store both the haskeem executable and the stdlib.scm file in / home / uwe / tools , which is in my PATH , and thus I set HASKEEM_INIT to /home /uwe/tools/stdlib.scm .
Then I ( and you ) can launch haskeem from any directory .
If you do not have haskeline installed , do n't panic !
There is an alternate version of the main module in the file haskeem_readline .hs .
That provides either a binding to the gnu readline library , or an alternate REPL with no line - editing capability at all .
You 'll need to rename this to haskeem.hs , edit it to select which of the two you want , and rebuild .
Sorry , no bindings to editline .
Enjoy !
Confession time : we were n't exactly charmed by Sony's PSP Go when Sony made the thing official .
It 's not that we 're particularly fond of UMD ( quite the contrary as a matter of fact ) , rather we found it a little hard to stomach a slimmer device that offers nearly the same hardware as its predecessor , swapping an optical drive for more storage , yet will cost nearly twice as much .
Factor in the cost of all new accessories and things get even less appealing , with confirmation that the Go lacks a standard mini USB port on top , meaning things like PSP keyboards and Sony 's GPS accessory are on a fast - track to obsolescence .
Even current A/V cables and chargers wo n't work thanks to a new multifunction port on the base -- but Sony will be quite happy to sell you new ones .
Is this the price of progress , or an attempt to boost profit margins ?
It 's not good news for gamers , regardless .
Yes , good money can actually be made in the rapidly - growing world of free - to - play massive multiplayer online games ( MMOs ) , but just how much can micro-transactions actually generate ?
Unfortunately , average revenue per user information is often concealed behind the fog of competition by privately held game makers reluctant to report either very high or very low results .
To add to the confusion , some developers choose to report their " average revenue per paying user " ( ARPPU ) which , by definition , is always more impressive than their " average revenue per user " ( ARPU ) .
( Both of these statistics relate to monthly logged - in users , and the amount of monthly logged - in users cited in ARPU is often a fraction of total registered users -- a common metric used in press releases . )
The inability to get at the real " metrics - to - success " can make it extremely difficult for a developer mulling whether or not to enter the free - to - play MMO sector .
According to Daniel James , this " reluctance to clearly report revenues is a deliberate attempt to obfuscate the numbers . "
James is CEO of San Francisco - based Three Rings Design .
" There seems to be a perception , " he explains , " that there is a business advantage to not being transparent .
But I disagree . "
As James blogged recently : " People often ask me , with a wary look such as you 'd give a lunatic , ' Why do you dish out your numbers like this ? '
It 's a good question .
There are possible downsides , but they are limited ; if a competitor looks at my numbers and then goes on to execute better than us , I do n't think that has much to do with our numbers .
They executed better , that 's the hard bit .
Well done to them .
" The upside , " he continued , " is that the more information that circulates the startup and games community , the more people will share their data .
This rising tide will raise all boats .
If I can shame my fellows into parting with their data , we 'll all benefit . "
Indeed , James reveals that Three Rings ' MMO Puzzle Pirates takes in approximately $ 50 each month from each paying user ( ARPPU ) for a total of $ 230,000 a month , all resulting from microtransactions .
In February , 2005 , James chose to launch a free - to - play version of Puzzle Pirates alongside the original subscription model ( which contributes an additional $ 70,000 each month from subscription fees ) .
Three Rings ' Puzzle Pirates
He admits he really did n't know what to anticipate in terms of revenue ; there was nowhere to go to research how well microtransaction - based MMOs did elsewhere .
" We just jumped in , " he recalls .
" There were no data points and , frankly , every game is different , every play population is different , and extrapolating from one developer 's data to your own is , well , an interesting intellectual exercise but it does n't necessarily tell you what to expect . "
Four and a half years later , James has learned a lot -- that the average revenue per user ( ARPU ) is between one and two dollars a month , but only about 10 % of his player base has ever paid him anything .
As a result , he says , approximately 5,000 gamers are generating the $ 230,000 in revenue he sees each month .
" The pivot number -- the number to focus on -- is not the $ 50 ARPPU but the $ 1 - 2 ARPU , " he says .
" That 's the number that a new paying customer is worth to you .
If that number were , say , 20 cents , you 'd probably have a difficult time building a business . "
" But if that number were , say , $ 3 then you have a good business that enables you to go to a flash distribution site and say , ' Hey , put my game up on your site and I 'll give you a dollar for every new user you send me . '
They 'd surely be interested in that . "
( Regarding registered users , a late 2008 press release from Three Rings noted that , over the lifetime of Puzzle Pirates , the game has seen seven million accounts created -- showing that the ' registered user ' metric is not particularly helpful in extrapolating revenue - based success stats . )
I have to say my skepticism about this new medium has now disappeared .
Without it , one wonders if all this could have happened .
A reader notes a few facts :
Ahmadinejad's and Khamenei 's websites were taken down yesterday - I saw the latter go down within a couple of minutes because of a DDOS attack organised via Twitter .
@ StopAhmadi is a good source for tweets on this .
The other important use of Twitter has been distribution of proxy addresses via Twitter .
This would be how most video and pictures of today 's rally have gotten out .
Technology has not just made the world more dangerous ; it has also enabled freedom to keep one small step in front of tyranny and lies .
One thing you can do is use Twitter to fight the regime yourself .
Help bring these fascist bastards down at the end of your modem .

If you thought the eruption of Mount St. Helens in 1980 was a big one , it 's possible you ain't seen nothing yet .
According to an article in NewScientist , there may be a " super volcano " brewing under the mountain , which has been steaming and stewing since its notorious eruption on May 18 , 1980 .

I 'm going to say something about neoconservatism here that perhaps needs to be said amid my many swipes .
There are many good faith neocons who could not be more thrilled at what is happening in Iran , and although they may still have a hankering for some of the emotionally satisfying but now discredited rhetoric of the early days , their hearts are still in the right place .
Not all neocons backed torture ( many were appalled ) , or the Iraq war in bad faith .
The core hope that democracy could spread in the Middle East - and that this alone would ultimately destroy Jihadism - is in some ways vindicated by this year in Iran .
It remains , of course , a fantastic irony that they chose Iraq to impose this result , rather than waiting for Iran to demonstrate it .
And a further irony that their opponent Barack Obama helped inspire the hopes to vindicate neoconservative dreams .
But this democratic flowering follows the best version of the neoconservative inheritance , if not its recent descent into a bitter ideology of naked power .
And if Obama can meet it , if he can somehow be a second term Reagan in his first , then the resonance will be even deeper .
Iran 's green awakening may end awfully .
But if it succeeds , it will be everything the neocons had hoped to achieve in Iraq - and also a demonstration of neoconservatism 's core fallacy , which is that freedom can be forced on anyone ; or somehow force - fed into maturity .
It thus vindicates and refutes neoconservatism at the same time .
History is like that .
It makes fools of us all in the end .

The Taliban Advances ' If We Now Kill Schoolgirls , You Should n't Be Surprised '
Responding to threats from the Taliban , at least 10 girls ' schools have shut down near Kunduz in northern Afghanistan .
Visiting the schools is a dangerous proposition -- a trip leading directly into the heart of Islamist territory .

There ’s no doubt that we live in a world which puts an individual under a lot of pressure to look his or her best .
In the name of aesthetics , how much aches and pains are you willing to bear ?
How much money are you actually willing to spend ?
You just need to look at the health and beauty aisle of a grocery store to see how many over - the - counter cosmetic products are available that will make you look ageless , give you that youthful beauty , revitalize your skin – and everything else that these supposedly ‘ miracle ’ products are supposed to provide .
Aside from this , there is one other aspect in society that you can look at which just goes to show how obsessed some people can be in achieving perfection with themselves : the cosmetic surgery industry .
Liposuction , Botox surgery and similar cosmetic and surgical procedures are being performed to individuals who would like to look their best .
But just how far can one go in the name of beauty ?
What are the most bizarre surgical procedures which a person is actually willing to undergo ?
And would you try any of them yourself ?
The Case of the “ Stalking Cat ”
First , let us take a look at the case of the “ Stalking Cat ” .
You might have already seen television features or read articles online about a man named Dennis Avner .
Although he ’s popularly known as the “ Catman ” , Avner prefers to be called by his Indian name which is the “ Stalking Cat ” .
What makes his story worthy of being a human interest segment on TV shows is that he has undergone several surgeries to modify his body so that it resembles a tiger .
Some of the surgical procedures include facial tattooing ; hairline modification ; facial transdermal and subdermal implants ; surgically modifying his ears ; silicone injections and bifurcation of his upper lip .
He even wears green contact lenses with split irises to make his face really resemble that of a tiger .
In this case , the reasons behind his undergoing of extensive bizarre surgical procedures are a combination of aesthetics and tradition .
He wants to bear a resemblance to a tiger based on an ancient Huron tradition of altering yourself to look a lot like your own totem .
After a Native chief reportedly inspired Avner to follow the ways of the tiger , that is exactly what he did .
A Look at the Top 8 Most Bizarre Surgical Procedures
Now , take a look at the top eight most bizarre surgical procedures that some individuals have actually gone through – and ask yourself whether you ’re willing to try them out for yourselves or not .
1 . All in the name of music : From rounded to pointed ears .
If you ’re not satisfied with the shape of your earlobes , would you like to give this bizarre surgery a try ?
Basically , what the doctors will do is put you under local anesthesia so that the upper part of your earlobes will be reshaped .
A slit will be placed on the top rounded edge of your ear and it will be stitched and bandaged immediately .
It is supposed to enhance the attractiveness of your face – while at the same time giving you a more ‘ natural ’ way of appreciating music .
The way that pointed ears are shaped are said to improve your music listening experience .
If you would like to attain the look that the character of Orlando Bloom has in “ Lord of the Rings ” – this time on a permanent basis – then this is the bizarre surgical procedure for you .
Just remember that the cut needs bandaging for weeks before you can show off your new pointed ears .
2. Permanent eyeglasses surgery .
Perhaps one of the most bizarre surgeries that anyone could ever come up with is having their eyeglasses permanently attached to their faces through a piercing across the nose .
If you ’re the forgetful type , it will probably be convenient for you to not misplace your eyeglasses – and for some people , having permanent eyeglasses through surgery is the best way to do it .
3 . Get six pack abs with abdominal etching .
Instead of the typical liposuction which just sucks the fat out of your belly – abdominal etching takes things one step further .
Here , the fat which will be sucked out of your abdomen will be the ones covering that oh - so - elusive six pack abs .
The downside is that you would need to wait for a few months before the swelling goes down – enough that you can see your new ripped abs .
So do n’t stuff yourself with junk food just yet and succumb to being a couch potato again – unless you want to throw the thousands of dollars that you spent down the drain .
4 . Get the legs of a hunk with calf implants .
Okay , so women do it .
They get implants to make their breasts look bigger – and sometimes , an upgrade of your cup size is all you need to boost your self - confidence .
But did you know that skinny guys who have ‘ chicken legs ’ can do the same thing with their calves ?
Yes , there is such a thing as calf implants wherein your legs will be injected with the same material used in breast implants .
The result ?
A hunkier - looking you minus the workout needed for calf exercises .
5 . How about a toe - shortening surgery ?
If you always get ribbing from your friends because your second toe is way too longer than your biggest toe , there is a surgery that will make the lines of your toes perfect .
The procedure involves having your extra-long toe surgically shortened .
6 . Do you feel that you ’re too short ?
Try lengthening your legs – literally .
You might have seen an episode in “ Grey ’s Anatomy ” where a character came in with a contraption wrapped around his legs that caused a complication to his legs .
What he tried to do is similar to an existing bizarre surgical procedure done in southeast Russia .
It ’s performed by the Ilizarov Scientific Centre where your legs will be broken apart at the shin bone .
Then , the surgeons will gradually push your bones further apart by a metal frame .
What happens is that the metal frame prevents the bones from healing naturally – so new bone cells will form on the gap and your legs will literally be given an extension .
7. Tongue or lip bifurcation , anyone ?
Dennis
Avner has his upper lip bifurcated so that his mouth will resemble that of a tiger .
It ’s probably perfectly understandable since he has a ‘ model ’ to pattern the look after – but is it also really necessary to bifurcate your tongue ?
Basically , what this surgical procedure does is to split the muscle using either a laser or the traditional way of cutting tissue .
It is typically someone who has a tongue piercing who considers to have his tongue bifurcated so that when he sticks it out , you will either be amazed or creeped out at the sight of a human tongue split halfway – feel free to take your pick .
8 . Putting a little dazzle on your eyes .
There is such a surgery called eyeball bedazzling , where a tiny jewel will be permanently affixed to your eyeball .
It ’s similar to the procedure of eye lens replacement – and once the tiny jewel is in place , the flap of the eye is laid back in place .
Ahh , the things that people do in the name of beauty .
Whether it ’s for the sake of tradition , beauty , or there ’s just a ‘ quirk ’ in your body that you would like to appear as normal - looking – or as odd - looking – as compared to everybody else , then you are in luck .
Medical science has made it possible for these modifications in one ’s face and body to be performed .
As these bizarre surgical procedures break the norm of medicine , what they actually do is cater to a clientele of patients who would like to look – and feel – as unique as they can be .
Exxon Mobil shoved aside Wal - Mart to retake the No. 1 slot .
But the Fortune 500 had its worst slump ever .

Yisrael Beiteinu 's policies have sparked anger around the world
Israel 's internal security minister has apologised after being caught on film using the word " Araboosh " - highly offensive Hebrew slang for Arabs .
While Yitzhak Aharonovitch was on a tour meeting police , one plain clothes officer apologised to him for his scruffy appearance .
" What do you mean dirty ?
You look like a real Araboosh , " the minister was heard to respond .
He is a member of Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman 's far right party .
Mr Aharonovitch later said he wished to " apologise to anyone who was hurt " .
" This remark does not reflect my positions or world view , " the minister said in a statement .
His far - right party , Yisrael Beiteinu , has been under fire for its policies , which have raised concerns over racism in Israel and around the world .
The party wants to make all Israeli citizens swear allegiance to Israel as a Jewish state , something that most of the fifth of the population who are Israeli - Arabs would find very difficult to do .
It has also pushed for a law to ban commemorations of the Nakba , or " catastrophe " , as Palestinians call the events of 1948 , when Israel was created and hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were forced from their homes in what had been British - ruled Palestine .

Anne Coulter Would n’t Shoot an Abortion Provider but " Does n’t Want to Impose Her Morals on Others "
As
always , Anne Coulter is spitting out any words that will get her some
media attention .
This time , she justifies the murder of abortion
provider Dr. George Tiller , reports a Daily Kos article .
In her most recent column , in which she poses as a " Legal Correspondent , " she wrote :
I would n’t kill an abortionist myself , but I would n’t want to impose my moral values on others .
No one is for shooting abortionists .
But how will criminalizing men
making difficult , often tragic , decisions be an effective means of
achieving the goal of reducing the shootings of abortionists ?
Following the moral precepts of liberals , I believe the correct
position is :
If you do n’t believe in shooting abortionists , then do n’t
shoot one .
Sex . Abortion .
Parenthood .
Power .

Then
she appeared on Fox ’s The O’Reilly Factor , where she said she did not
consider Tiller ’s killing murder .
O’Reilly asked her to elaborate and
she said , " I am personally opposed to shooting abortionists , but I do n’t want to impose my moral values on others . "
On Alternet.org , Lynn Harris offers a groundbreaking analysis of the effect of dating violence on unintended teen pregnancy .
According to the article ,
many violence and public health experts say that abuse is not always in
the form of bruises , but instead in contraceptive sabotage that can end
in pregnancy .
Harris tells the
story of a young girl named " Janey , " who was in an abusive relationship
with a man who cheated on her , and raped her .
After two pregnancies and
many STD ’s , Janey told her boyfriend to move out , but he threatened her
with more violence .
Harris writes :
" Sexual coercion and " reproductive control , " including contraceptive
sabotage , are a common , and devastating , facet of dating and domestic
abuse .
A growing number of studies , experts and young women
themselves are testifying to boyfriends demanding unprotected sex ,
lying about " pulling out , " hiding or destroying birth control —
flushing pills down the toilet , say — and preventing ( or , in some
cases , forcing ) abortion .
The implications for young women ’s and public health are profound , among them unintended pregnancy ,
miscarriage and STDs , including HIV .
( Some STDs are cured easily — if
tested for and treated — while others can lead to chronic pelvic pain ,
ectopic pregnancy , even infertility . )
While this problem is not
brand - new , only now are we starting to understand its scope – and ,
ideally , starting to learn from its consequences . "
Harris
also cites a Boston - area study that found that 53 of 61 girls were in
abusive and sexually active relationships at the time they were
interviewed , and said 26 percent of the girls said their boyfriends
were " actively trying to get them pregnant by manipulating condom use , sabotaging birth control . "
Mike Huckabee Says Common Ground Does Not Exist
When he appeared on the Daily Show with
Jon Stewart , former Republican presidential nominee Mike Huckabee said
there is no such thing as a common ground regarding the abortion
debate , a LifeNews.com article said .
According to the article , Huckabee said
" Abortion advocates do n’t want to give an inch in the abortion
debate by accepting even modest limits on abortion such as parental
notification , which would allow parents to know when their daughters
are considering the life - altering . "
When Stewart asked him to entertain the idea of common ground , Huckabee
said he would be willing to support efforts that truthfully reduce
abortions and do n’t just give more money to abortion rights groups like
Planned Parenthood .
Stewart said he was in the " squishy middle " of the abortion debate .

The missing Air France flight en-route from Rio de Janerio to Paris has been confirmed by Air France to have gone down in the Atlantic ocean , with little chance of any survivors .
The following statement from Air France CEO , Pierre - Henri Gourgeon was released to the press a short time ago .
Air France regrets to confirm the disappearance of flight AF 447 flying from Rio de Janeiro to Paris - Charles de Gaulle , scheduled to arrive at 11:10 am local time today , as announced to the press by Air France CEO , Pierre - Henri Gourgeon .
The Airbus A330 - 200 , registration F - GZCP , left Rio on 31 May at 7:03 pm local time ( 12:03 am in Paris ) .
The aircraft hit a zone of stormy weather with strong turbulence at 2 am this morning ( universal time ) , i.e. 4 am in Paris .
An automatic message was received from the aircraft at 2:14 am ( 4 : 14 am in Paris ) indicating a failure in the electric circuit a long way from the coast .
The Brazilian , African , Spanish and French air traffic control centres all tried to make contact with flight AF 447 but to no avail .
The French military air traffic control centre tried to detect the aircraft but did not succeed .
216 passengers were on board : 126 men , 82 women , 7 children and one infant .
There were 12 flight crew members : 3 pilots and 9 flight attendants .
The flight captain had a record of 11,000 flight hours and had already flown 1,700 hours on Airbus A330 / A340s .
Of the two first officers , one had flown 3,000 flight hours ( 800 of which on the Airbus A330 / A340 ) and the other 6,600 ( 2,600 on the Airbus A330 / A340 ) .
The aircraft was powered by General Electric CF6 - 80E engines .
The aircraft had totalled 18,870 flight hours and went into service on 18 April 2005 .
Its last maintenance check in the hangar took place on 16 April 2009 .
Air France fully shares the anxiety and distress of the families concerned .
The families are being taken care of in a specially reserved area of Paris - Charles de Gaulle Terminal 2 .
Health and intelligence may be the result of the same genetic factors ( Image : Don Hammond / Design Pics Inc. / Rex Features )
In addition to checking blood pressure and heart rate , doctors may want to test their patients ’
IQs to get a good measure of overall health .
A new study of 3654 Vietnam War veterans finds that men with lower IQs are more likely to suffer from dozens of health problems – from hernias , to ear inflammation , to cataracts – compared with those showing greater intelligence .
This offers tantalising – yet preliminary – evidence that health and intelligence are the result of common genetic factors , and that low intelligence may be an indication of harmful genetic mutations .
Advertisement
“ It poses the question to epidemiologists : why is it that intelligence is a predictor for things that seem so very far removed from the brain , ” says Rosalind Arden , a psychologist at King ’s College London , who led the study .
Lifestyle choices
One obvious counter - argument is that intelligent people make healthier choices .
“ You could say : ‘ look , brighter people make better health decisions – they give up smoking when they find it ’s bad for you , they take up exercise when they find out its good for you , and they eat a lot of salad ’ , ” Arden says .
That ’s probably true , she says , yet her team found that indicators of healthy living , such as a low body mass index and not smoking , do not correlate with overall health of veterans as well as several tests of intelligence .
The researchers analysed data from a 1985 to 1986 study of Vietnam veterans led by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention into links between chemicals such as Agent Orange and health problems .
Participants received thorough physical exams and took several intelligence tests .
Harmful mutations ?
Arden ’s team is aiming to find more evidence that health and intelligence are driven by common genetic factors .
They previously showed , in the same group of Vietnam veterans , that more intelligent men produce healthier sperm , and they are currently working on a direct genetic test of their theory .
“ I find the work pretty fascinating , ” says Mark Prokosch , a psychologist at Elon University in North Carolina .
He agrees that finding a link between harmful genetic mutations , health and intelligence will make a better case for Arden ’s theory .
“ I do n’t think they have quite driven the nail in the coffin that there is clear evidence of this mutation load found in all of us that contributes to a fitness factor , ” he says .

The loons were out in full force on Wednesday , attacking President Obama for giving the Queen of England an iPod containing video of her 2007 state visit to the U.S. because — get this — she already owns a 2005 edition iPod Mini .
You know , the kind without video .
That they were offended over this triviliality was enough comedy to warrant a mid-week Loon Watch , but the fact that the Queen requested the iPod and that her former spokesman said the Obamas " scored a hit " sealed the deal : a Loon Watch was called for .

High art is less hung up about purity and sanctity .
The Salisbury International Arts Festival , programmed for Middle England , recently featured a stirring performance by the tabla player Kuljit Bhamra and other Indian artistes at Stonehenge .
In the newly - opened classical music hub , Kings Place in London , they had a week in Spring of " East meets West " .
That fateful meeting took place at least four centuries back , but evidently when artists from the two spheres make music together , it is still a big deal and sounds bigger than the parts .
Fusion in art and popular culture is back .
Arguably , it has really never gone away .
Cross - fertilisation has gone on since human groups found or heard of others unlike themselves .
Tim Bridgman , who has studied musical traditions , believes " pure music has not existed in western Europe since the middle ages " .
In Vaughan Williams you find Celtic music and in English ballads traces linger of old black Delta work songs .
The critic and broadcaster Alkarim Jivani takes a similarly long view .
Britain 's culture perpetually evolves , is audaciously derivative and yet stubbornly denies this obvious truth .
Nash 's Greek columns and Neoclassicism have been turned , for example , into the nation 's " traditional " aesthetic and scant attention is paid to Britannia 's irrepressible cultural promiscuity and her ingestion of , among others , Egyptian , Ottoman , Indian and Persian , Chinese , later Japanese colour , design , crafts and visual sense .
All of our great museums are repositories of creative miscegenation yet some reputably deep thinkers today reject the flux and mix of history and insist that globalisation or multiculturalism or post modernism have ripped into chaste national narratives leaving them torn and fatally wounded .
And as Fascism gains popularity in old and fatigued Europe , expect more vociferous calls for cleansing and purification .
That , in turn , will , for sure , fire up a fresh counter offensive of subversive cross - breeding in art and culture .

Post war generations reawakened their creative spirits by experimenting and crossing boundaries .
The greatest moments of integration came , says Jivani , when a " moribund art form had to invigorate itself , save itself from atrophy " .
Top black artists like Miles Davis , agrees the jazz writer Clive Davis , injected new ideas and energy into an exhausted jazz vocabulary .
It made financial sense too –working with white talent helped black artists break into a bigger market .
The Beatles , Rolling Stones , Hendrix , and later Paul Simon used traditional African beats to express new sounds , new freedoms .
The recent enthralling BBC4 documentary on Chris Blackwell and the Island record label was an ode to those breakthrough times and expansive minds .
There have also been less illustrious moments .
The massive influence of Indian classical music on pop in the Sixties and Seventies is well known .
Much of it sounded lazy , lacking in aesthetic theory and drained of all political and social content but the punters loved it because it promised peace and love .
It extended an invitation to ingratiation to previously despised subject people and they grabbed the offer – even those who were supreme talents in their own world .
Ravi Shankar and The Beatles fell together at a time when British racism was at its most vicious .
So fusion has a long and controversial history .
However today it is bigger in scale , overwhelming , more heady ( and less discerning ) with fresh waves of enthusiasts washing up and shaking off memory , form , tradition , discipline , the laughable idea of territorial integrity .
Bollywood imitates Hollywood and vice versa ; British artists , musicians , filmmakers and designers meld and marry influences just like the revivified British Kitchen has successfully done with food .
Everything in the arts now , it seems , has to be spiced up , blended , mashed together , emulsified , or lifted with cosmopolitan flavours .
The public appetite grows for smoothies , easy and fast to swallow .
It is pure entertainment with a global reach .
Think of the money .
In the speedy post - millennium world , never still , perpetually in motion , seeking instant gratification and novelty , is this surge any more than the fizz in a coke bottle ?
Perhaps the world rushes towards manufactured unities to reassure and divert us from global chaos and violence and the way we now fear each other .
The more divided we become , the more we must believe we are really , really connected .
The worry now is that the concept could soon buckle with the strain of carrying so many disparate meanings – some contradictory – and market pressures .
" Fusion " for example , describes Chadha 's populist pastiche Bride and Prejudice as well as the new , colourful production of Wuthering Heights by theatre company Tamasha , which transports the story to Rajasthan using both Bollywood and British musical theatre styles , a combo previously served up in Bombay Dreams .
Audiences do love such productions of borrowing and cheek .
Yet fusion also describes intellectual art that deliberatively subverts expectations and identities and would include the RSC , which under Michael Boyd courts international appropriators of Shakespeare and Yinka Shonibare , a Brit artist of Nigerian ancestry who dresses headless figures in Victorian clothes , lace and all , only in bold African fabrics .
Fashion steals and adapts from across the seas with panache , always has done , only now there is a glut on the one hand of hotchpotch styles – boho , " tribal " and " east meets west " kitsch ( think Sienna and Liz Hurley ) and on the other , the artistic designs of say , Hussein Chalayan , Turkish and British , whose distinct selves coalesce exquisitely in his unique creations .
In music too , you get some dreadful blends flooding the marketplace , so too exciting and hopefully enduring marriages of style and content .
On offer are garish sound cocktails of Primark quantity and quality , a startling dumbing - down from the relatively sophisticated , yet unapologetically popular perennial stars like Eric Clapton and Jools Holland who draw and improvise from a seemingly infinite musical palate .
Thankfully , that tradition has attracted new converts and relationships , curious , brilliant and inventive .
They duet , converse from across different world views as they do in the beautiful album , Tell no Lies , released last month by the Etonian guitarist Justin Adams and the Gambian fiddler Juldeh Camara .
It is indescribable , the feast of sound they offer .
In the same vein , Davis recommends Kronos Quartet 's Floodplain , which mixes classical vigour with folk and traditional music from the Balkans , Middle East and the horn of Africa .
Thankfully excellence fights back , is not ( yet ) wiped out in this age of cheap " multicultural " thrills .
Like the old black American Blues and Jazz musicians , current African and Arab musicians need western encouragement and participation .
Crossovers and cooperation increase sales ( you double your fan base ) .
Freed from holding pens of tradition , good artistes can release extraordinarily original work .
Some were showcased by Africa Express , which brings together Western and African musicians in unrehearsed collaborations , in part as a rebuke to Live8 which marginalised African talent while trying to raise cash for the continent 's poor , the most condescending manifestation of One World ever .
The BBC's Electric proms gave the talent further affirmation .
Some star gigs join the constellation of collective memory – like Franz Ferdinand and Senegal 's Baaba Maal ; Johnny Marr , the ex-Smith 's guitarist reaching new heights with Mali 's legendary Miriam and Amadou .
In the theatre , there are fresh green shoots of hybridity at play , written and directed by a new generation who are by nature cosmopolitan , even though their roots go back to old ancestries .
The Royal Court breeds and nurtures such talent and cultural copulation , animating outlandishly unfamiliar stories in conservative Chelsea .
Take the Olivier winner Bola Agbaje , a young Anglo - Nigerian playwright , whose acclaimed Gone too Far ! was a tragi-comedy about two teenage Nigerian brothers , one brought up in Britain , one in Nigeria , meeting for the first time in London .
It was directed by Bijan Sheibani , half Iranian , half English , who runs ACT ( Actor 's Theatre Company ) , an alchemist inspired by Peter Brook .
His unique plays come together after actors , writers , designers , dancers , musicians of myriad backgrounds go through an intense process together , over many long weeks .
Once upon a time white novelists – the Ian McEwan generation – either avoided multiracial Britain as if it was n't quite their business , or wrote about it from a distance , a view they saw while safely on a train .
Some saved their passion for an old Blighty long gone .
Now that nervousness is gone and we have novelists who go way beyond empathy to absorb the Other .
Maggie Gee ( White Family , My Cleaner , My Driver ) and Stella Duffy ( The Room of Lost Things ) are among the best of these .
In British Caribbean fiction , although there are fewer new voices than we might expect , the known names are molecularly transformed - from writing about historical injustice , exile , settlement and longing , they are injecting themselves into the nation 's blood , painful though it may be .
The BBC producer Tony Phillips , brother of Caryl Phillips the novelist , remembers the old struggles .
As a newly qualified actor , he was rejected by York 's Theatre Royal because that city did not have a " multicultural community " .
Now , he says : " I find myself in the strangely uncomfortable position of having to show my daughters how to make a St George 's flag .
They belong , and thank goodness they have that confidence . "
It is the journey from Andrea Levy 's wonderful Small Island to Caryl 's new novel , In the Falling Snow , in which Keith , the black British hero is irreversibly V CEnglish , married to an Englishwoman whom he betrays as if he wants to excise that part of himself .
Only he can't : there is his child , and hers , miscegenation made flesh .
These compositions of multiplicity and integrity are not amalgams produced on demand .
They are emphatically not the result of contrived integration , the multicultural tick box , what Jivani contemptuously labels " PC " arts practice .
One such cited by Davis is the ENO 's Voxygen project with Talvin Singh , a dissatisfying project , I agree , that felt like a cut - and - paste job that did a disservice to both sides .
Singh needs to exercise better judgement on what best showcases his supreme gifts and complex works .
Some artists – and they include those who have worked with Singh – are choosing to ditch the messy category of " fusion " altogether .
Like the ethereally - beautiful Mayuri Boonham , Bharatnatyam dancer and choreographer with the Angika dance company admired for extending the language of dance .
" Fusion is not a word I like .
It implies forcing things to come together where the origins of the forms being fused are often lost or thinned out ... there is a loss of essence and resonance resulting in the Sellotaping of different styles for the sake of something apparently different or new .
I prefer the word ' synthesis ' – one single work expresses several symbolic ideas , combining them into a complex whole . "
The choreographer Shobana Jeyasingh is as " allergic " to what she says is " un-rigorous , easy bolting on of opposing elements .
The word ' fusion ' implies an overdefined authenticity , it is an outdated word which does not reflect the reality of the 20th century to - ing and fro-ing " .
She prefers to describe her own complex creations as " hybrid ; it has an autonomous life and power of its own rather than be a sum of parts and it allows for edginess and tension " .
That creative tension is vital to the novelist and dedicated musician Amit Chaudhuri .
So too are the awakenings of various selves within the self , which is a condition of modern life .
He lives in India and the UK .
Epiphanies mark his journey of self discovery .
As a young man he was into rock and jazz , which he felt obliged to excise from his inner repertoire as he took up classical North Indian music in the Eighties , an act of reclamation perhaps .
Within a few years he experienced as series of " mishearings " where listening to one tradition , another would speak up in his unconscious , or pick up echoes : " When I was practising the raga Todi , for example , I heard the riff to Clapton 's ' Layla ' . "
That led him to wider questions , unexamined beliefs about identity and the conviction that " fusion " is a scandalous or liberating departure from canonical traditions .
His new collection of songs ( out this month ) is titled This is Not Fusion , a provocation and rebuff to players of the past like Mahavishnu who projected east and west as inert , static categories .
" There was no history , neighbourhood , by which I mean a texture , sounds of , sense of a place .
There is no quarrel within fusion , no inner tension and therefore no development . "
Like Chaudhuri , Boonham and Jeyasingh use this struggle and make torpid elements pull together to flash and burn bright .
Sometimes a casual , delicate embrace inspires profound understanding and complex composition .
Take the poetry of the prize - winning Daljit Nagra , who word - sculpts using his many - parted sensibility .
In Look We Have Come to Dover !

The Soul Superstar
You 've Never Heard Of
Between 1968 and 1977 Mingering
Mike recorded over fifty albums , managed thirty - five of his own record labels , and produced , directed and starred in nine of his own motion pictures .
In 1972 alone he released fifteen LPs and over twenty singles , and his traveling revue played for sold out crowds the world over .
How is it that such a prolific musician has gone under the radar for more than forty years ?
The answer is that all took place in Mike 's imagination , and in the vast collection of fake cardboard records and acapella home recordings that he made for himself as a teenager in Washington , D.C. in the late 1960s .
In 2003 two record diggers stumbled into the world of Mingering Mike at a flea market .
There they discovered a collection of albums that were made solely of cardboard , each intricately crafted with gatefold interiors , extensive liner notes , and grooves drawn onto the " vinyl . "
The crates contained albums not only by Mingering Mike , but also other unheard of artists such as Joseph War , the Big " D , " and Rambling Ralph , on labels such as Fake Records , Inc. , Decision , Sex , and Mother Goose .
There were even soundtracks to imaginary kung fu films and a benefit album for sickle cell anemia .
Hadar posted pictures of the albums on the popular record collecting forum Soulstrut and Mike instantly became a cult hero .
He tracked Mike down and eventually Mike revealed his story of how as a lonesome teenager he dreamt of being a soul singer , songwriter and producer , and how he lived out his dream by creating an amazing imaginary career for himself .
During the Bush administration , many hundreds of people were tortured and abused by the CIA and Department of Defense , primarily in Afghanistan , Guantánamo , and Iraq , but also in other countries after unlawful rendition .
Our government 's embrace of torture shattered lives , shredded our nation 's reputation in the world , and compromised our national security .
Yet , to date , there has been little accountability for these wrongs .
In January 2009 , shortly after entering office , President Obama took important steps to dismantle the torture program .
But in the following years , his administration undermined that early promise by thwarting accountability for torture .
Accountability for torture is a moral , legal , and national security imperative .
With the release of the Senate Intelligence Committee 's summary of its landmark investigation into the CIA 's use of torture , the United States has a critical opportunity to change course .
By taking steps in the five key areas described below , the Obama administration can begin to redress the abuses perpetrated in our names and help ensure that the United States never tortures again .

Way true , re : framing language , ' outside groups ' turns to ' coalition of liberal groups ' --- at the NYT , Scott Shane started with ' a coalition of left - wing advocacy groups . '
That guy has other examples of putting op - ed - type framing language in ' news ' articles .

There were no commercial planes on 911 .
Torture came about because " terrorist " attacked us on 911 .
There were no commercial planes on 911 .
To this day ... not one single piece of debris from any of the 4 planes from any of the 4 locations on 911 has EVER been tested , inspected , analyzed , or verified in ANY WAY by anyone on the planet .
The FBI now says it has never nor ever will test debris because " we all saw it on TV " ( 2008 ) .
There were no commercial planes on 911 and you are going after men who followed orders years later ?

End the career of ALL " torture " and " death squad " affiliates .
STARTING WITH TOP OFFICIALS , and working down to grunts who were sucked in but still in the back of their mind KNEW something was wrong .
I honestly can't blame the low - level - compartmentalized folk that that were facing - dishonorable for refusing orders .
BUT , with that said , you know what 's right and what 's wrong in your motherfucking heart !
The TOP OFFICIALS need to come down first .
Then sort out the lower levels .

Nice address ... eh ?
Also did I mention my Sample ballot was HELD and DELAYED by the USPS ( United States Postal Service ) because of a " box full " PS Form 3849 , " Sorry We Missed You " , by the mail carrier ..
And to bring this even deeper nasty - ness , first by ignoring the fact that my USPS " Land Park Station " is 10 miles away round trip on foot , there was a time when I did n't even have a valid California ID .
When I tried to pick my god damned fucking mail up , the guy said show me your ID .
I thought I had it on me , but could n't find it , Then as I was leaving with no mail I found it , and CUT the holy shit off the next person in line , saying there 's no way your going next .
Anyway , my Special ballot has SPECIAL MARKINGS ON IT .
first there 's a hand written in ballpoint PEN " 4111 " under the Access Access YES handicap thingy on the back cover , and some kind of red stamp ( which I need a lens to read , but looks like 1st ( illegable ) , 2nd ( illegable ) ) and then there is a hand written 1171 1.4 - 11 - 9 on the back cover , what these mean I do not know .
1171 is my address .
Could it be USPS scribbling that is benine ?
I do n't know .
However , I think it is ..
It 's still bullshit that it's on my ballot , which I did n't bring , and which is the reason I WENT TO THE WRONG POLLING PLACE -- a place that does n't even exist .
I am resting right now because of the heat , I will try to head out again , in a bit .

To fight somewhat for my MAIL CARRIER , I did work out a thing where my videos for my show would be unofficially dropped on my front porch , instead of a PS Form 3849 , " Sorry We Missed You " , in hind sight it 's good I asked the CARRIER not the POSTMASTER and bureaucracy .
Which would limit choices to fighting the HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION to replace the 12 box SIZE A UNIT - 1 outbound ( CBU ) Clusterbox unit with something that can actually handle mail -- perhaps SIZE B UNITS + PARCEL drops .

Anyone want to drive me to the polls ?
Considering I wo n't put my vote in the scanner ( if it still exists ) and I always have to go through the same crap .
I literally do n't feel like even going .
And really if you think about it , what difference will it make ?
If we DO pass the fascist crap , the math will catch up and we 're lost , and if we DONT pass the crap , the math will catch up an we 're lost .
All in all , California is roasty toasted .
They 'll need to crack down on our civil rights or survival rights to balance their cooked books .
Okay , yeah , I will try again to vote .
But god damn it , especially those of you just reading this post saying in your mind , " oh your just a freak . "
NO YOUR THE FREAK !
You watch your fascist TV set , and corporate fascist news , pretending nothing is wrong , making opinions on us , all the while we 've gotten crushed trying to tell you the truth .
I do n't want to vote .
It 's a hassle , it 's berating at the point where I turn my fucking ballot in to a machine which can no longer be watched by humans .

By the way , just some information for you reading here ...
Ever since these diebold scanners came out , I have NOT put my ballot into the slot .
I have always forced them to open the AUXILIARY TRAY and manually place my ballot in there .
Sure the bastards probably empty the tray and feed it in at the main site 's scanner .
I NEVER AGREED TO IT OR SUPPORTED IT OR WANTED IT .
It 's on them for screwing my vote up .
Not me .
Just something for you on the fence to think about , it a small protest , albeit ineffective .
It 's better than doing NOTHING !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Welp , now I got that anger out , I guess I will head over again .
I wish there was a THREAD dedicated to this special election so MY SHIT do n't get burried .

okay final update for California Special Election ( today 's date ) I am glad I lost the anger .
but the story does n't end sadly .
I should have brought a camera or an AUDIO recording device , as the 2nd Polling place I went to on " Florin and Amherst " had a poll worker ( I made them identify ) who first told me they were just a voter , and then I asked why they were LEANING on the diebold scanner , and they said they were a poll worker .
( So I was lied to just coming in the door . )
Then the next poll worker could not find my name in the book .
The poll worker next to him said , " do n't be starting no crap in here . "
They all ganged up on me after than as I said , " why are you talking to me like that ? "
For you idiots out there that think this is nothing get on with your life .
Fine bitch .
And I did , I found a nice lady outside who dialed up my information to the " polling place look - up " number ( 916 ) 875-6500 after people standing around gawked in horror at the nonsense the number played on us I found out my polling place was at the OPPOSITE side of amhurst .
( Remember I am not driving ) I make it to the 3rd polling place , and outside the parking lot there is a Asian lady who can't get her mini van started , being the nice guy I am I try to help , as I am helping I notice a POLL WORKER show up to help as well .
Not only does the guy not know how to do battery cables , he 's out in the parking lot ....
Anyway the lady after I hooked up both sides of the cables and got the charge car running , we find out the asian lady has her keys in the ignition and the doors are locked .
heh .
I am real hot .
So I bail .
I lock my bike up .
and go try to vote .
inside I am nice and let several folks go first , while I catch my breath , soon my conversation with someone in line goes like this , " Did we cut in front of you ? "
" No , go ahead this is my third polling place " Immediately I am greeted with an overzealous poll worker who asks me what 's your address , what 's your address what 's your address , what 's your name , what 's your ...
I totally ignore her and pretend she ain't there and wait for the poll worker with the book who smiles and ask 's name .
I give the name , get the ballot , ask for a pencil , then fill it out and take off the zip strip and lay it on TOP of the diebold scanner .
No I did n't put it in the machine , usually they make a big deal out of it , but I was walking out before they had a chance ..
On the way out I visit the asian lady again , noticing her hood was still up .
I asked are you okay , need your hood put down , etc .
No , I am okay , someone is coming ..
I head a little further into the parking lot , Some weird lady with some official looking line badge shows up .
She acts like I am intimidating her , so I go away from here and turn my back to her , and turn my bike upside down ( no kickstand ) in the shade and light a smoke to try to relax some , a black lady comes out and sparks up a conversation , she seems informed about the electronic voting problem , I tell her visit bradblog , and god bless .
I leave the church parking lot and find an asian ( I think Laotian this time ) guy whit massive blood coming out of his mouth , sitting in the sun , in the street under a no parking sign , I check on him , " Are you okay ? " he does n't understand .
" Are you good "
" You good ? "
He replies , " I 'm good " I say , need some smokes ?
" No . " He has two packs of nonfilters , layin there they look crushed though .
I say , " need water " I make the sign of drinking .
" No " " I 'm good " What a horrible day , I am sitting in front of a fan now trying to cool .
I felt like throwing up when I got home from the heat from the traffic .
So , basically the polling places were a massive nightmare of nonsense , the same crap machines are in place , nothing has changed .
We are screwed if we think things are changing for the better .

Six members of the Iranian football team have used a televised match to protest about the presidential election result .
They were wearing green wristbands , thought to be a symbol of their support for the opposition candidate Mir Hossein Mousavi .
The BBC's Jon Leyne , in Tehran , gave his reaction to the gesture which was seen on Iranian state television .
As I have already written in a previous post , I have moved away from bzr to git for most of my software projects ( I still prefer bzr for documents , like my research papers ) .
A lot if not most of the comparison of git vs other tools focus on speed .
True , git is quite fast for source code management , but I think this kinds of miss the point of git .
It took me time to appreciate it , but one of the git ’s killer feature for source code control is the notion of content tracking .
Bzr ( and I believe hg although I could not find good information on that point ) use file id , i.e. they track files , and a tree is a set of files .
Git , on the contrary , tracks content , not files .
In other words , it does not treat files individually , but always internally consider the whole tree .
This may seem like an internal detail , and an annoyance because it leaks at the UI level quite a lot ( the so - called index is linked to this ) .
But this means that it can record the history of code instead of files quite accurately .
This is especially visible with git blame .
One example : I recently started a massive surgery on the numpy C source code .
Because of some C limitations , the numpy core C code was in a couple of giantic source files , and I split this into more logical units .
But this breaks svn blame heavily .
If you just rename a file , svn blame is lost can follow renames .
But if you split one file into two , it becomes useless .
Because git tracks the whole tree , the blame command can be asked to detect code moves across files .
For example , git blame with rename detections gives me the following on one file in numpy :
dc35f24e numpy/core/src/arrayobject.c
1 ) #define PY_SSIZE_T_CLEAN dc35f24e numpy/core/src/arrayobject.c
2 ) #include < Python.h > dc35f24e numpy/core/src/arrayobject.c
3 ) #include " structmember.h " dc35f24e numpy/core/src/arrayobject.c
4 ) 65d13826 numpy/core/src/arrayobject.c
5 ) /*#include < stdio.h>*/ 5568f288 scipy/base/src/multiarraymodule.c
6 ) #define _MULTIARRAYMODULE 2f91f91e numpy/core/src/multiarraymodule.c
7 ) #define NPY_NO_PREFIX 2f91f91e numpy/core/src/multiarraymodule.c
8 ) #include " numpy/arrayobject.h " dc35f24e numpy/core/src/arrayobject.c
9 ) #include " numpy/arrayscalars. h " 38f46d90 numpy/core/src/multiarray/common.c
10 ) 38f46d90 numpy/core/src/multiarray/common.c
11 ) #include " config.h " 0 f81da6 f numpy/core/src/multiarray/common.c
12 ) 71875d5c numpy/core/src/multiarray/common.c
13 ) #include " usertypes.h " 71875d5c numpy/core/src/multiarray/common.c
14 ) 0f81da6 f numpy/core/src/multiarray/common.c
15 ) #include " common.h " 5568f288 scipy/base/src/arrayobject.c
16 ) 65d13826 numpy/core/src/arrayobject.c
17 ) /* 65d13826 numpy/core/src/arrayobject.c
18 ) * new reference 65d13826 numpy/core/src/arrayobject.c
19 ) * does n't alter refcount of chktype or mintype --- 65d13826 numpy/core/src/arrayobject.c
20 ) * unless one of them is returned 65d13826 numpy / core/src/arrayobject.c 21 ) */
You can notice that the original file can be found for every line of code in the new file .
The original author and date may be found as well , I just removed them for the blog post .
This is truely impressive , and is one of the reason why git is so far ahead of the competition IMHO .
This kind of features is extremely useful for open source projects , much more than rename support .
I am ready to deal with quite a few ( real ) Git UI annoyances for this .
Edit
It looks like my example was not very clear .
I am not interested in following the renames of the file : in the example above , the file was not arrayobject .c first , then renamed to multiarraymodules.c , and later to common .c .
The file was created from scratch , with content taken from those files at some point .
You can try the following simplified example .
First , create two files prod.c and sum.c :
# include double sum( const double * in , int n )
{
int i ;
double acc = 0 ;

The fossil treasure chest that was home to ' missing link '
Ida
Ida , a lemur - like fossil hailed by some as our ' missing link ' , caused a worldwide sensation when she was unveiled to the public last month .
Found in a shale pit in Germany , the creature was clearly an ancestor of modern primates and therefore evidence for Darwin ’s theory of evolution , experts say .
But Ida is just one of thousands of remarkably well - preserved fossils recovered from the Messel pit in Hesse .
Star of the show : Darwinius masillae fossil known as Ida ( l ) - you can see an outline of where the fur once was .
The 49 - million year old fossil of a monkey 's hand , only a few centimeters in size , was found at Messel
A Diplocynodon darwini , an extinct alligator , was completely removed from the oil shale and resin mix for display
A bat from the Eocene Era which was a crucial period in the early development of mammals
It is an unassuming crater tucked behind an industrial site with a housekeeper doubling as a security guard and only a couple of portable cabins for a trickle of visitors .
Yet it is the richest fossil site in the world for understanding the early development of mammals - and therefore ultimately man himself .
Although mammals only make up two per cent of the total finds , 45 species have been uncovered in the pit .
They include animals resembling primates , horses , marsupial possums , tapirs , rodents , bats and hedgehogs .
There are also 43 species of birds , 31 species of reptiles and more than 10,000 fossil fishes .
The pit reveals a snapshot of the Eocene Epoch 48 million years ago .
This was a time when mammals became firmly established as the rulers of the land , invaded the seas as whales and took to the air as bats .
During the period North America , Europe and Asia were in continuous land contact .
Many of the pit 's fossils are exceptionally well preserved .
Usually only fragments of bones are found but Messel has yielded up full skeletons and the outlines of entire bodies as well as feathers , hair and even stomach contents .

.
It would once have been surrounded by lush sub-tropical forests supporting an incredible diversity of life .
The Messel lake bed was probably a centre point for drainage from nearby rivers .
Oil shale would have formed over a long period from mud and dead vegetation the lake bed .
The lake bottom had low oxygen levels and was little disturbed by currents , so it was ideal for preserving fossils .
Scientists believe Messel was once in a tectonically active region with sub - surface shifts releasing deadly gases that killed organisms in and around the lake .
This would account why there are so many non-aquatic fossils among the remains .
The fossil Amia kehreri from Messel measures 8.9 " long .
Fins and vertebra can be seen
Allognathosuchus , an extinct ancestor of alligators and crocodiles .
It had stout jaws and bulbous teeth probably for crushing molluscs
A small bird found at Messel near Darmstadt , shows how well its feathers and body tissues have been preserved
Unfortunately many of the precious remains were lost during 1884 and 1971 when the site was actively mined for the oil inside the bituminous shale .
The first fossil of a crocodile was discovered in 1875 but formal excavation did not begin until 1919 .
It was not until 1966 that systematic excavations were carried out and the remains preserved by a ' transfer ' technique , with resin applied to the removed fossils .
But after 1971 hundreds of amateur fossil - hunters - many not properly equipped - were allowed to dig at random on the site .
Over the next two decades a number of precious fossils , including the impressive Ida , were removed by private collectors .
In the early 1990s the pit narrowly escaped being turned into a landfill site .
Thankfully the area was eventually declared a natural world heritage site in 1995 and an amnesty on previously collected fossils was put into effect to get privately owned collections back into public ownership and available to science .
Digs by Darmstadt University are ongoing and experts hope the Messel pit still has plenty more fossil treasures to yield up .
