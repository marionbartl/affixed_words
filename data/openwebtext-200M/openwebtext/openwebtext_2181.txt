Former White House spokesman : Bush used ' propaganda ' to sell war Mike Sheehan

Print This Email This Update : Bush ' did n't remember ' whether he'd tried cocaine , McClellan writes
In a new tell - all memoir on sale next week , former White House press secretary Scott McClellan writes that President Bush depended on propaganda to sell the Iraq war to the American public , The Politico reports .
According to the Atlanta Journal Constitution , McClellan also reveals new details about allegations regarding Bush 's former drug use that shadowed his 2000 campaign .
McClellan tracks
Bush 's penchant for self - deception back to an overheard incident on the campaign trail in 1999 when the then - governor was dogged by reports of possible cocaine use in his younger days .
The book recounts an evening in a hotel suite " somewhere in the Midwest . "
Bush was on the phone with a supporter and motioned for McClellan to have a seat .
" ' The media wo n't let go of these ridiculous cocaine rumors , ' I heard Bush say .
' You know , the truth is I honestly do n't remember whether I tried it or not .
We had some pretty wild parties back in the day , and I just do n't remember . ' "
" I remember thinking to myself , How can that be ? " McClellan wrote .
" How can someone simply not remember whether or not they used an illegal substance like cocaine ?
It did n't make a lot of sense . "
Bush , according to McClellan , " is n't the kind of person to flat - out lie . "
" So I think he meant what he said in that conversation about cocaine .
It 's the first time when I felt I was witnessing Bush convincing himself to believe something that probably was not true , and that , deep down , he knew was not true , " McClellan wrote .
" And his reason for doing so is fairly obvious  political convenience . "
In the years that followed , McClellan " would come to believe that sometimes he convinces himself to believe what suits his needs at the moment . "
McClellan likened it to a witness who resorts to " I do not recall . "
McClellan's " surprisingly scathing " and " often harsh " What Happened : Inside the Bush White House ... also contains , as Mike Allen writes for Politico , other standout revelations such as : Bush and his aides " confused the propaganda campaign with the high level of candor and honesty so fundamentally needed to build and then sustain public support during a time of war " ;
Some of McClellan 's assertions before the White House press corps were , in retrospect , " badly misguided " ;
Karl Rove and Lewis " Scooter " Libby " had at best misled " McClellan about their roles in the notorious CIA leak case , even as McClellan publicly defended them ;
The White House was in a " state of denial " during the first week after the Hurricane Katrina disaster ;
Bush was " steamed " about his top economic adviser telling The Wall Street Journal that a possible Iraq war could cost as much as $ 200 billion .
" He should n't be talking about that , " said Bush , according to McClellan ;
The press was " probably too deferential to the White House " when it came to public discourse over the choice to go to invade Iraq .
McClellan also says the " White House press corps went too easy on the administration , " reports Allen .
Despite the book 's criticisms of the administration he once worked for , McClellan writes , " I still like and admire President Bush , " reserving most of his rancor for Bush 's top advisers , especially Karl Rove .
Excerpts from the Politico article , available in full at this link , follow ... #
The book begins with McClellan 's statement to the press that he had talked with Rove and Libby and that they had assured him they " were not involved in ... the leaking of classified information . " ... " [ President Bush ] too had been deceived , and therefore became unwittingly involved in deceiving me .
But the top White House officials who knew the truth  including Rove , Libby , and possibly Vice President Cheney  allowed me , even encouraged me , to repeat a lie . "
McClellan also suggests that Libby and Rove secretly colluded to get their stories straight at a time when federal investigators were hot on the Plame case .
" There is only one moment during the leak episode that I am reluctant to discuss , " he writes .
" It was in 2005 during a time when attention was focusing on Rove and Libby , and it sticks vividly in my mind .
... Following [ a meeting in Chief of Staff Andy Card's office ] ...
Scooter Libby was walking to the entryway as he prepared to depart when Karl turned to get his attention .
' You have time to visit ? '
Karl asked .
' Yeah , ' replied Libby .
" I have no idea what they discussed , but it seemed suspicious for these two , whom I had never noticed spending any one - on - one time together , to go behind closed doors and visit privately .
...
At least one of them , Rove , it was publicly known at the time , had at best misled me by not sharing relevant information , and credible rumors were spreading that the other , Libby , had done at least as much . " #

Mr Bush said more still needed to be done to fight the world 's food crisis George W Bush has offered $ 770 m ( £ 390 m ) in international food aid to help ease the effects of surging food prices that have sparked riots in some countries .
The US president said he was asking Congress to approve his request .
Soaring food and fuel prices have squeezed poor families at home and abroad , putting the White House under intense pressure to step in .
The move has been broadly welcomed , though critics point out the money will only be available from October .
That is because it is included in a funding measure that applies to the next fiscal year .
Critics also highlight what they say is the administration 's contradictory policy of backing huge increases in the agricultural land devoted to biofuels .
' Silent tsunami '
" We 're sending a clear message to the world that America will lead the fight against hunger for years to come , " said Mr Bush , announcing the funding plan .
The new aid comprises $ 620 m in direct food aid shipments , mainly to needy African nations , and $ 150 m in long - term projects to help farmers in developing countries .
We believe in the timeless truth , to whom much is given , much is expected

Afghans struggle as prices soar China ' may lease foreign fields '
Task force faces major challenge
The new money would come in addition to some $ 200 m the US president released for emergency food aid two weeks ago , but Mr Bush warned that " more needs to be done " .
" In some of the world 's poorest nations , rising prices can mean the difference between getting a daily meal and going without food , " he said .
" The American people are generous people and compassionate people .
We believe in the timeless truth , to whom much is given , much is expected . "
The new money is tied to a wider , $ 70 bn spending measure that also covers funding for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan in 2009 .
The proposal has received broad approval , though some have criticised the fact that the funds will only be available in the next fiscal year .
Others highlight what they say are contradictions in the policies of President Bush 's administration , which is simultaneously providing generous subsidies to US farmers to cultivate corn - based biofuels such as ethanol .

" It 's a very good move , a very urgent move - but it does n't solve the problem , " Jean Ziegler , the UN special rapporteur on the right to food , told the BBC .
He says growing crops for fuel instead of food is one of the main causes of the price rises - but the White House counters that biofuel production accounts for only a small fraction of the recent food price increases .
' Unprecedented unrest '
Food price rises , dubbed by the United Nations World Food Programme ( WFP ) a " silent tsunami " , have sparked riots in some countries , including Haiti , Cameroon and Indonesia .
Earlier this week , UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon set up a task force to tackle the crisis .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
He said the priority was to feed the hungry by closing a $ 755 m ( £ 380 m ) funding gap for the WFP this year .
Mr Ban said the world faced " widespread hunger , malnutrition and social unrest on an unprecedented scale " because of soaring food prices , and urged donor countries to make more money available now .
The WFP believes 100 million people are currently going short of food .
It says only 62 % of the $ 755 m it needs to feed them has been pledged so far , and , of that , only $ 18 m or 2.4 % has actually been received .
Mr Ban said it was essential to support farmers in poor countries who were producing less because of the high cost of fertilizer and energy , and to this end he said the task force hoped to : Offer $ 200 m financial support to farmers in the worst affected countries to boost food production
Set up a $ 1.7 bn programme to help countries with a food deficit to buy seeds
The task force , which Mr Ban will chair , will be made up of the heads of UN agencies and the World Bank .

Others critics were alarmed that some of the $ 38 billion in bonds Mr. Corzine hoped to issue would be used for projects unrelated to transportation .
“ Early on , there was excitement about the big checks that came in , ” Jonathan R. Peters , a finance professor at the City University of New York and an expert on toll roads , said of the arrangements in Indiana and Chicago .
“ But now academics and departments of transportation are starting to see that you can give away too much . ”
In the aftermath of the agreements in Chicago and Indiana , lawmakers in California , Texas and other states have struggled to muster support for their own lease deals .
In Pennsylvania , Gov. Edward G. Rendell ’s plan to lease the state ’s turnpike has been delayed by a counterproposal to collect tolls on Interstate 80 .
As these other states try to devise a plan acceptable to their residents , drivers who use the Chicago Skyway and Indiana East - West Toll Road seem to be adjusting to the new operators from Macquarie - Cintra , the Australian - Spanish consortium .
But Mr. Peters and other specialists who study toll road deals cautioned that the lease in Indiana was structured so that tolls would remain relatively stable for the first decade , then could rise quickly for the remainder of the lease  after many of the politicians who signed the original lease have left office .
That may explain why drivers on the Skyway and Toll Road , while still suspicious of privatization , are largely pleased with conditions on the roads .
They say they like the additional tollbooths and the introduction of electronic tolls .
And while truckers and those using cash saw tolls rise this month in Indiana , drivers of passenger cars with E - ZPass or the local alternatives , known as iPass and iZoom , are still paying tolls that have not been raised in more than two decades .
“ The positive thing is they put in iZoom and the roads are well maintained , ” said Roy Platz , 60 , of Naperville , Ill. , who for years has used the Skyway and Toll Road to get to his job at a steel company in East Chicago , Ind .
“ I do n’t care who they sell it to , ” Mr. Platz said between bites of a double cheeseburger at a McDonald ’s near the Skyway .
“ If the Spanish want to give us $ 4 billion , fine .
But government being government , the money could be frittered away . ”
Wired :
Community organizing and peer - to - peer communications have worked out well so far in Barack Obama 's presidential campaign .
So well , in fact , that one group of conservative activists is co-opting one of the Obama campaign 's online communications strategies to use it against him .
This new effort is a viral e-mail campaign that aims to frame Obama as a disastrous - for - the - country left - of - left liberal .
It is on view at a website called ExposeObama.com .
A group of long - time Republican operatives run the effort , the most high - profile of whom is Floyd Brown , a communications and organizational consultant who created the infamous " Willie Horton " television advertisement that sank Democrat Michael Dukakis ' 1988 presidential campaign .

The Obama camp has set up a website to combat those lies and smears , and show no sign of backing down this time .

The manager of an Orlando condo building where Deborah Jean Palfrey , also known as the D.C. Madam , owned a unit disputes the alleged suicide notes that were published in the media – after witnessing examples of her handwriting going back years Joe Strizack concludes , " That is not her signature . "
" She could sign her signature a hundred times and it would be identical , " Strizack told a local NBC news station .
" That is not her signature . "
" Strizack looked over the suicide notes , but he questioned if the notes were actually written by Palfrey , and if they were , he thinks they may have been written under duress , " according to the report .
Strizack remains convinced that Palfrey ’s demeanor immediately before she allegedly took her own life betrayed no sign that she was contemplating suicide .
" Monday morning a woman tells you that she ’s afraid for her life , she told me several instances where people we following her , and Thursday she ’s dead , " Strizack said .
" What do you think ?
If someone would put a hit out for her and if someone wanted something done they could do it . "
Strizack provided us with copies of Palfrey ’s handwriting from personal letters and bill payments Palfrey had sent to him ( click here for images ) .
While the overall style is obviously similar to the alleged suicide notes , certain letters and numbers are clearly different .
A comparison between one of Palfrey ’s notes to Strizack shows a difference , for example , in the number " 2 " ( which is curled in the suicide letter but not in the note ) and in letters like " T . "
A clear contradiction between the two styles is evident with the letter " N " in the word " Need " – which is of a different structure in the suicide note and flamboyantly curls up in comparison with Palfrey ’s note to Strizack where the letter is much more understated .
An independent analysis on behalf of a handwriting expert needs to be undertaken in order to ascertain whether the writing belongs to Palfrey , is an outright fraud , or shows evidence of having been written under severe duress whereby Palfrey was forced to write the notes at gunpoint , for example .
As we reported on Monday , the content of Palfrey ’s alleged suicide notes contradicts both her public statements and the context of her situation following her upcoming prison sentence .
Joe Strizack appeared on The Alex Jones Show yesterday and revealed that Palfrey had told him that her client list went “ from the White House on down . ”
Palfrey told Strizack her clients consisted of “ a lot of influential people ” from both political parties .

Remaining hair cells are multiplied to fill bald areas Cells grown in the laboratory may offer a possible solution to hair loss , preliminary trials have suggested .
The technique involves taking small amounts of the remaining hair cells , multiplying them , then injecting them into bald areas .
Six months after treatment , 11 out of 19 patients had grown new hair , UK researchers told an Italian conference .
However , a UK specialist said further work would be needed so that the new hair looked right .
It will revolutionise hair care , I think
Dr Paul Kemp , Intercytex
Hair loss affects two - fifths of men over 50 , and can be a long - term problem for some people following radiotherapy or burns .
Currently available methods of hair transplantation involve taking large clumps of remaining follicles under local anaesthetic and moving them to the desired area , a technique dependent on the amount of hair left , as no new hair is created .
The new method , called " follicular cell implantation " , developed by UK firm Intercytex , claims to be able to provide a limitless supply of replacement hair cells , and , if other trials show it to be safe and effective , could be available within five years .
Doctors take only the dermal papilla cells - cells found in the follicle which are responsible for hair growth .
They are harvested from areas on the back of the head , which usually still have hair growth , and then bathed in a specially - developed chemical in the laboratory , before being placed back into bald areas of the scalp .
The early results suggest that most patients appear to benefit after just a few months , although the numbers involved in the trial are relatively small .
Dr Paul Kemp , Intercytex 's Scientific Officer , said that the presence of the dermal papilla cells encouraged skin cells to start building a brand new hair follicle , or rejuvenated follicles which have stopped producing hair properly .
He said : " It will revolutionise hair care , I think .
People will use this when they are starting to go bald - they 'll come and see us , we 'll take a few dermal papilla cells , grow them up in the lab , freeze most of them , and inject some .
" They can keep coming back as the balding process continues .
I 'm convinced it will work , it 's just a question of fine - tuning the technique . "
Other organs
He said that the same principles could one day be harnessed to grow replacement teeth , or other organs .
" Every hair is a tiny little organ , after all . "
Professor Val Randall , from the University of Bradford , said that the progress made was " exciting " .
She said : " To get anything growing at all is a real achievement , although it will be difficult to make the hair come back in the right way , pointing in the right direction , with the hair follicles lined up the right way . "
Dr Andrew Messenger , a consultant dermatologist at the Royal Hallamshire Hospital in Sheffield , said that if new hair follicles had been produced , then it would constitute an advance .
However , he added : " We do n't yet know for certain whether these are new hair follicles , and it 's actually quite hard to prove that they are , not just the result of rubbing on the scalp or another effect . "

A student at " Od Yosef Chai " Yeshiva in the Samarian Jewish community of Yitzhar recently assembled a " Kassam " - type rocket and fired it at a neighboring village , NRG - Maariv reported Friday .
According to the report , Rabbi Itzik Shapira , who heads the yeshiva , is suspected of involvement in the incident .
The rocket landed in a field between Yitzhar and the Arab village that was targeted and exploded a few meters away from a Breslaver Hasidic Jew who was busy praying at the time .
No one was hurt .
Interesting : Fluoride pioneer Grand Rapids rethinks safety of putting chemical in water
Will the city that became the first in the world to fluoridate its drinking water decide to discontinue use of the chemical ?
I 've read some pretty compelling arguments against water fluoridation , such as this one from the Environmental Working Group : National Academy Calls for Lowering Fluoride Limits in Tap Water
If Grand Rapids is rethinking fluoridating its water , surely Ann Arbor wo n't be far behind .
I think if there 's any doubt whatsoever about the safety of fluoride , they should stop adding it to the water system .
In looking at the most recent Ann Arbor water quality report available online ( from 2006 ) , it looks like Ann Arbor keeps fluoridation levels on the low side , at 1.13 mg/l , rather than the maximum 4 mg/l , the level at which the NAS says causes dental fluorosis in a large percentage of children .
In the New York Review of Books , Freeman Dyson reviews two recent ones about global warming , but his review is mostly shaped by his own rather selective vision .
1. Carbon emissions are not a problem because in a few years genetic engineers will develop “ carbon - eating trees ” that will sequester carbon in soils .
Ah , the famed Dyson vision thing , this is what we came for .
The seasonal cycle in atmospheric CO 2 shows that the lifetime of a CO 2 molecule in the air before it is exchanged with another in the land biosphere is about 12 years .
Therefore if the trees could simply be persuaded to drop diamonds instead of leaves , repairing the damage to the atmosphere could be fast , I suppose .
The problem here , unrecognized by Dyson , is that the business - as - usual he ’s defending would release almost as much carbon to the air by the end of the century as the entire reservoir of carbon stored on land , in living things and in soils combined .
The land carbon reservoir would have to double in size in order keep up with us .
This is too visionary for me to bet the farm on .
2. Economic estimates of the costs of cutting CO 2 emissions are huge .
In an absolute sense , this is true , it would be a lot of dollars , but it comes down to a few percent of GDP , which , in an economic system that grows by a few percent per year , just puts off the attainment of a given amount of wealth by a few years .
And anyway , business - as - usual will always argue that the alternative would be catastrophic to our economic well being .
Remember seat belts ?
Why is it that Dyson ’s remarkably creative powers of vision ( carbon - eating trees for example ) fail to come up with alternatives to the crude and ugly process of burning coal to generate electricity ?
3 . The costs of climate change are in the distant future , and therefore should be discounted , in contrast to the hysterical Stern Report .
I personally can get my head around the concept of discounting if the time span is short enough that it ’s the same person on either end of the transaction , but when the time scales start to reach hundreds and thousands of years , the people who pay in the future are not the same as the ones who benefit now .
Remember that the lifetime of the elevated CO 2 concentration in the air is different from the lifetime of CO 2 to exchange with the biosphere .
Release a slug of CO 2 and you will increase the CO 2 concentration in the atmosphere for hundreds of thousands of years .
The fundamental tenet of civil society is to protect people from harm inflicted by others .
Are we a civilized species , or are we not ?
The question is analogous to using economics to decide whether to abolish slavery .
I ’m sure it was very costly for the Antebellum Southern U.S. to forego slave labor , but it simply was n’t an economic question .
4. Majority scientists are contemptuous of those in the minority who do n’t believe in the dangers of climate change .
I often find myself contemptuous of efforts to misrepresent science to a lay audience .
The target audience of denialism is the lay audience , not scientists .
It ’s made up to look like science , but it ’s PR .
We have documented Lindzen ’s tortured and twisted representation of the science to non-scientists here and here .
If Lindzen had a credible argument to support his gut feeling ( and apparently Dyson ’s ) , I can promise that I for one would take it seriously .
I ’ve got kids at home whose future I worry about .
If Lindzen were right , no one would be happier about that than me .
But I do get contemptuous of BS .
Okay , I ’ve lazed about for long enough so it ’s back to it !
To start things off , here ’s one that ’s short but sweet .
Well , it ’s short …

You work late .
Like , every night .
You probably screwed up your last steady relationship , and , well , maybe there ’s no one to curl up next to in bed when you stumble in the door at night .
Drew Burrows knows the feeling .
“ I ’m in this grad program right now , and it ’s totally consuming , ” he said .
“ I come home every night to an empty bed . ”
So Burrows , 28 , engineered ( literally ) a solution , which he unveiled to the public last night at NYU ’s Interactive Telecommunications Program Spring Show at Tisch School of the Arts .
It ’s simple to behold — a single mattress , tucked into a dark , curtained back room of the showcase space .
On it : a lithe brunette .
She ’s perfectly quiet , but once you sit or lie down , she responds to your every move .
Lie on your back , she snuggles up right next to you in a log position .
Curl up in the fetal position , she spoons .
The only hitch : She ’s 2 - D. “ Yeah , you ca n’t feel the girl .
That ’s the thing , ” Burrows explained as he demonstrated his invention , an “ infrared sensitive ” light projection ( meaning it reacts , and the projected woman moves , based on an infrared sensor ) called INBED .
“ Still , it ’s so nice if you ’re tired and worn out to have someone to curl up with . ”
As for satisfying those not - so - innocent late - night desires , this lady adheres to her role as steady girlfriend .
Give her kiss on the check and she rolls over and buries her face in the pillow .
And yes , she stays fully clothed at all times .
Nonetheless , Burrows suggests his new alternative to a full - body pillow or ( ugh ) blow - up doll could provide late - night comfort for traders , lawyers , or any other single guy in Manhattan who simply works too hard to keep a girlfriend .
Speaking of , how long has Burrows been single ?
“ Long enough to come up with this idea , ” he sighed .

You ask me why I listen to Alex Jones and infowars.com – well HERE ’S why !
He said the Supreme Court would rule " in favor " of gun owners but in actuality rule against them .
Notice that these justices say exactly what the Second Amendment states ( " A well regulated militia , being necessary to the security of a free state , the right of the people to keep and bear arms , shall not be infringed . " ) but then through CLASSIC double - speak they say " even though it says it shall not be infringed , it shall be . "
In other words , " yes , you have a right to own guns but we have a right to infringe them . "
Technically , if the justices followed the Amendment to the letter of the law it would get rid of ALL gun control across the board .
But that ’s never going to happen .
I ’m not dumb enough to think that any politician or judge in their right mind is going to strike down gun control entirely , although they should because that ’s what the Constituition says .
So yeah , this might peel back SOME gun control but not all .
They still say " the government may infringe your right to own a gun " even though the Second Amendment clearly states " shall NOT be infringed "
It does n’t say UNREASONABLY infringed , it says flat - out it shall not be infringed !
But as is the case with the Constitution , everyone has a different interpretation .
People think " the militia " mean the military , or the national guard .
No , sorry liberals .
The militia is EVERYONE !

We can do it again , that ’s why I post these bulletins and blogs .
It ’s a grassroots effort – just a few people CAN make a difference .
Here ’s a good example : remember in the Ben Affleck movie " Pearl Harbor " there ’s a scene where FDR is briefed by the Joint Chiefs and one of the generals says " Mr. President , if the Japanese invaded California they could get all the way to Chicago before we could stop them . "
Now , I have no idea if that was true at the time , but this is EXACTLY the kind of scenario the Second Amendment was supposed to prevent .
Imagine , even as recently at the 1940s if a foreign country invaded our soil they could get halfway across it .
Well , if we had a regulated - militia we would never have to worry about this .
If you believe that ALL American citizens make up the militia you should be against all gun control across the board .
If you think the second amendment only applies to police and military , well , you ’re deluding yourself .
And I know what you ’re thinking , " you ’re saying ex-cons , lunatics , and children should carry guns ? "
In an ideal world , yes , because this would n’t be a problem since everyone else would be armed to defend themselves against these people .
Obviously , that ’s never going to happen .
I ca n’t honestly imagine a scenario in which every American citizen is allowed to walk around with a gun on their side at all times , much like the Old West or the setting of a Star Wars movie .
Do n’t worry limp - wristed liberals and fake neo-cons , the gun control laws still on the books will work wonders to keep guns out of the hands of law - abiding citizens and keep them IN the hands of street thugs , Mafia members and backwoods survivalist groups .
Maybe instead of passing gun control laws we go after the people supplying the guns to these criminals ?
It ’s like illegal immigrants , instead of just deporting them why not prosecute employers who hire them ?
That would solve that problem pretty darn quick .
So you you wonder why I listen to Alex Jones ?
He predicted this outcome TO THE LETTER of the ruling !
It ’s not a victory for gun owners , it ’s a victory for double - speak government and double - think people everywhere .

Supreme Court rules in favor of gun ownership rights
By MARK SHERMAN , Associated Press Writer
WASHINGTON – The Supreme Court ruled Thursday that Americans have a constitutional right to keep guns in their homes for self - defense , the justices ’ first major pronouncement on gun control in U.S. history .
The court ’s 5 - 4 ruling struck down the District of Columbia ’s 32 - year - old ban on handguns as incompatible with gun rights under the Second Amendment .
The decision went further than even the Bush administration wanted , but probably leaves most firearms restrictions intact .
( DOUBLE - THINK !!)
The court had not conclusively interpreted the Second Amendment since its ratification in 1791 .
The amendment reads : " A well regulated militia , being necessary to the security of a free state , the right of the people to keep and bear arms , shall not be infringed . "
The basic issue for the justices was whether the amendment protects an individual ’s right to own guns no matter what , or whether that right is somehow tied to service in a state militia .
Writing for the majority , Justice Antonin Scalia said that an individual right to bear arms is supported by " the historical narrative " both before and after the Second Amendment was adopted .
The Constitution does not permit " the absolute prohibition of handguns held and used for self - defense in the home , " ( YES IT DOES !!
WHAT PART OF " SHALL NOT BE INFRINGED " DON ’T YOU UNDERSTAND !?!?!)
Scalia said .
The court also struck down Washington ’s requirement that firearms be equipped with trigger locks or kept disassembled , but left intact the licensing of guns .
( DOUBLE - THINK !!)
Scalia noted that the handgun is Americans ’ preferred weapon of self - defense in part because " it can be pointed at a burglar with one hand while the other hand dials the police . "
In a dissent he summarized from the bench , Justice John Paul Stevens wrote that the majority " would have us believe that over 200 years ago , the Framers made a choice to limit the tools available to elected officials wishing to regulate civilian uses of weapons . "
He said such evidence " is nowhere to be found . "
( WHAT PART OF " SHALL NOT BE INFRINGED " DON ’T YOU UNDERSTAND , STEVENS ?
OBVIOUSLY YOU DON’T KNOW WHO FOUGHT THE REVOLUTIONARY WAR )
Justice Stephen Breyer wrote a separate dissent in which he said , " In my view , there simply is no untouchable constitutional right guaranteed by the Second Amendment to keep loaded handguns in the house in crime - ridden urban areas . "
( THAT ’S RIGHT , BREYER , PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN CRIME - RIDDEN AREAS DON’T HAVE A RIGHT TO DEFEND THEMSELVES .
YET SOMEHOW THE CRIMINALS IN THOSE AREAS GOT THEIR HANDS ON GUNS AND YOU WANT TO TAKE THEM OUT OF THE HANDS OF LAW - ABIDING CITIZENS – RIGHT ON !!)
Joining Scalia were Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Samuel Alito , Anthony Kennedy and Clarence Thomas .
The other dissenters were Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and David Souter .
Gun rights supporters hailed the decision .
" I consider this the opening salvo in a step - by - step process of providing relief for law - abiding Americans everywhere that have been deprived of this freedom , " said Wayne LaPierre , executive vice president of the National Rifle Association .
( MAYBE , BUT THEY STILL SAID THE GOVERNMENT MAY RESTRICT OUR RIGHTS TO BEAR ARMS .
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK IT’S REALLY GOING TO CHANGE IN THE BIG PICTURE ? )
The NRA will file lawsuits in San Francisco , Chicago and several of its suburbs challenging handgun restrictions there based on Thursday ’s outcome .
Sen. Dianne Feinstein , D - Calif. , a leading gun control advocate in Congress , criticized the ruling .
" I believe the people of this great country will be less safe because of it , " she said .
( OH MY GOD , THESE CHICKEN - NECK LIBERALS MAKE ME NUTS .
" PEOPLE DON’T HAVE THE RIGHT TO DEFEND THEMSELVES – THAT’S WHAT WE HAVE POLICE FOR ! " )
The capital ’s gun law was among the nation ’s strictest .
Dick Anthony Heller , 66 , an armed security guard , sued the District after it rejected his application to keep a handgun at his Capitol Hill home a short distance from the Supreme Court .
" I ’m thrilled I am now able to defend myself and my household in my home , " Heller said shortly after the opinion was announced .
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ruled in Heller ’s favor and struck down Washington ’s handgun ban , saying the Constitution guarantees Americans the right to own guns and that a total prohibition on handguns is not compatible with that right .
( NEITHER IS EVEN A PARTIAL PROHIBITION – " SHALL NOT BE INFRINGED !! " )
The issue caused a split within the Bush administration .
Vice President Dick Cheney supported the appeals court ruling , but others in the administration feared it could lead to the undoing of other gun regulations , including a federal law restricting sales of machine guns .
Other laws keep felons from buying guns and provide for an instant background check .
( NOTICE HOW A NEO - CON IS ACTUALLY FOR GUN CONTROL !
THAT GOES TO SHOW HOW BIG OF FRAUDS THESE GUYS ARE !
OF COURSE HE DOESN ’T WANT AMERICANS ARMED – WE MIGHT ACTUALLY FIGHT BACK AGAINST HIS ENGINEERED POLICE STATE ! )
White House reaction was restrained .
" We ’re pleased that the Supreme Court affirmed that the Second Amendment protects the right of Americans to keep and bear arms , " White House spokesman Tony Fratto said .
Scalia said nothing in Thursday ’s ruling should " cast doubt on long - standing prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons or the mentally ill , or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings . "
( DOUBLE - THINK ! DOUBLE -THINK !
DOUBLE -THINK !!!)
In a concluding paragraph to the his 64 - page opinion , Scalia said the justices in the majority " are aware of the problem of handgun violence in this country " and believe the Constitution " leaves the District of Columbia a variety of tools for combating that problem , including some measures regulating handguns . "
The law adopted by Washington ’s city council in 1976 bars residents from owning handguns unless they had one before the law took effect .
Shotguns and rifles may be kept in homes , if they are registered , kept unloaded and either disassembled or equipped with trigger locks .
Opponents of the law have said it prevents residents from defending themselves .
The Washington government says no one would be prosecuted for a gun law violation in cases of self - defense .
( WORD ! )
The last Supreme Court ruling on the topic came in 1939 in U.S. v. Miller , which involved a sawed - off shotgun .
Constitutional scholars disagree over what that case means but agree it did not squarely answer the question of individual versus collective rights .
Forty - four state constitutions contain some form of gun rights , which are not affected by the court ’s consideration of Washington ’s restrictions .
The case is District of Columbia v. Heller , 07-290 .

LONDON , England ( CNN ) --
In the coming years we face an unprecedented challenge -- to provide the means for global prosperity , growth and stability from a radically different set of energy sources .
Many governments have recognized the need to wean themselves off fossil fuels in favor of renewable energy .
In the 21st century governments across the world are being forced to ask themselves daunting questions about the long - term viability , sustainability and safety of their traditional energy supplies .
Gas and oil face uncertain futures in term of long - term supply .
And their negative impact on global warming is practically beyond doubt .
Coal , of course , is no better for the climate .
But with plentiful supplies , coal - fired power stations are being built apace .
Hundreds of them are going up in China and India and the United States .
Combined , these three nations own half of the world 's coal reserves .
The recent skyrocketing of oil prices is also compounding the problem , leading many manufacturers to buy coal to provide the raw materials for hundreds of products , including plastics and fertilizers .
Historically economists have paid scant attention to the subject of energy .
In " The Coal Question " , published in 1865 English economist William Jevons argued that the rate of UK coal consumption was unsustainable .
Of course , his calculations proved wrong not least because he was unable to foresee the rise of other fossil fuels .
Sixty - six years later , Harold Hotelling was putting forward his thesis showing that under competitive conditions the price of non-renewable energy increases at the market rate of interest .
Any sense of apathy towards the subject evaporated when the Middle East oil crisis in 1973 focused the minds of economists .
Oil shortages forced western governments to reassess their dependency on imported " black gold " and instigated the first detailed examination of alternative and renewable energies .
But by the beginning of the 1980s the debate had taken a back seat again .
Although oil supplies were no longer as imperiled , global warming was about to make the leap from scientific sideshow to political center stage .
The inherent danger of nuclear power was tragically underscored by accidents at Three Mile Island and Chernobyl .
Some countries , like France , continued to press ahead with their nuclear plans , while others , like the U.S. , took pause .
Unsurprisingly , anti-nuclear protests reached their zenith during the decade .
As the environmental movement gathered pace in the 1990s , the question about the cost and availability of fossil fuels became increasingly overshadowed by concerns about emissions .
But industry lobby groups , such as the Global Climate Coalition , fought hard against the proposals for emission cuts which were drawn up in the Kyoto Protocol .
It is argued , the group helped persuade the U.S. government to turn its back on the Kyoto Treaty , not only because developing nations were n't required to lower emissions but also because it would be bad for the U.S. economy .
So far , the 21st century has seen public and private money pour into renewable energy research and methods of mitigating the use of non-renewable power .
But as yet , we are no closer to knowing how the future will be fueled .
In October 2006 , the highly regarded British economist Sir Nicholas Stern delivered his report into the effects of global warming on the world economy .
His assessment was unequivocal .
" Climate change , " he said , " is the greatest and widest - ranging market failure ever seen . "
It was a stark and high - profile warning which garnered both praise and criticism .
The new collision of science , politics and big business over the issues of climate change and energy economics is making for a highly complex and often confusing debate .

CEOs Rake It In When Their Companies Tank CEOs still make the big bucks when their companies founder in the stock market .
April 30 , 2008  --
Being a CEO these days , according to the people at Forbes magazine , is like playing on a kiddie soccer team : everyone gets a prize ... often a very expensive prize .
" Supposedly , you get paid for performing in corporate America — but you don't , " Forbes senior editor Neil Weinberg said .
" It 's like a fourth grade soccer league where everyone gets a trophy . "
Forbes ranked the worst performing CEOs in America by comparing executive pay to stock performance .
The magazine 's list of " Worst Performing Bosses " includes James Tobin , CEO of Boston Scientific , who made an average of $ 8.2 million while his company stock inched up by an average of 1 percent .
It also included Kevin Sharer of the Biotech company Amgen , who made an average of $ 12.3 million a year while his company 's stock dropped , on average , 4 percent a year .
Another CEO on the list , Michael Perry of Indymac Bancorp , raked in $ 6.8 million while his company 's stock plummeted 23 percent .
But the best paid , worst performing CEO , according to Forbes , is Angelo Mozilo of Countrywide , the nation 's largest home lender .
He raked in an average of $ 66 million a year while his company nearly collapsed , the stock falling an average of 9 percent a year .
That 's not including the hundreds of millions he got cashing in his own company stock .
" The fact that he has been making so much money , $ 102 million a year over the last year , is what people find egregious , " Weinberg said .
" They can't understand why this company is melting down , why it 's having to be rescued from virtual bankruptcy .
yet this man , who 's been talking up the company , has been selling stock , is not really paying the price for it . "
CEOs have advantages that the average American worker does not , that might allow them to get paid for failure .
Critics say that all too often , boards of directors , which set CEO pay , are filled with the CEO 's cronies .
" It 's a very incestuous business , " Weinberg said .
" People are on each other 's boards , they are hired by the chief executive , they are thankful to be a part of the club .
Overall , CEOs were paid 15 percent less last year , but they still make more than 10 times the amount they did two decades ago .
In 1980 , the average CEO once made 40 times what the average worker makes .
Now it 's 433 times , and many CEOs get paid handsomely , even if they fail .
When Gary Forsee , the CEO of Sprint , was fired , he got $ 40 million , an $ 84,000 - a- month pension for life , and help finding a new job as a university president .
Weinberg said it 's all evidence that , in the business world , " the game is rigged " in favor of CEOs .
But some say there have been major reforms in recent years and that most CEOs are fairly compensated .
John Castellani , president of the Business Round Table , said that evaluating CEO performance is more complex than Forbes makes it out to be .
" The outliers are just that — outliers .
You have to look at the preponderance of CEOs and how they 're performing and how their pay matched performance . "
But Weinberg says the examples in his article show there need to be serious changes before CEOs are no longer paid for failure .
Most notably , he says , shareholders should be able to vote on who sits on corporate boards , something the Securities and Exchange Commission proposed , but corporate leaders fought tooth and nail to defeat .
" It 's called shareholder democracy right , and that 's what we need in this country , " Weinberg said .
" We have something more akin to [ President Vladimir ] Putin in Russia right now than we do to a representative democracy . "
Only when there 's democracy in corporate America , he says , will the playing field truly be level .
Presidents do n't usually veto farm bills .
But now President Bush seems intent on making good on his threat to reject the nearly $ 300 billion farm monstrosity advancing through Congress .
Back in November , the White House threatened to veto the legislation because – in addition to the usual pork barrel projects – it contained trade - distorting subsidies .
These would sow havoc in our international agreements , and perhaps lead to markets being closed to American products .
Congress ...
With the presidential nominations still very much up for grabs , the 2008 primaries have quickly shaped up as the most interesting in recent memory .
Some early predictions were that the nominations would be a foregone conclusion by now or , at the latest , after Feb. 5 , when 24 states , including California , hold primaries and caucuses .
But both parties ’ races are still so tight and in flux that there is a chance in each party that no candidate will capture enough votes to secure the nomination before the conventions .
This development would lead to great upheaval for either party , but it may be a significantly bigger danger for the Democrats because of a rule enacted in 1982 by party leaders .
In 2008 , the result may be a Democratic convention choosing a nominee who lacks the legitimacy of being the “ people ’s choice . ”
Until 1972 , there was no uniform primary - and - caucus system ; the nominees of both parties were chosen by the convention delegates .
But after the tumultuous 1968 Democratic primary races , and after party leaders ensured then - Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey received the nomination despite not running in any primary , the party opened up the process .
Suddenly , primaries and caucuses became the important component to the nominee selection process .
However , this did not help the party win the presidency .
The 1972 nominee , George McGovern , did very well in the primaries but went on to a crushing defeat in the general election .
The party leaders saw further erosion of their own power in the two succeeding elections , as little - heralded Jimmy Carter won the nomination and the presidency in 1976 , and Edward Kennedy was able to mount an unsuccessful but damaging primary challenge to Carter in 1980 .
In response , party leaders made a significant revision to the selection process .
Advertisement
In 1982 , party leaders allocated for themselves a heaping portion of the delegates , creating positions called super delegates .
Every Democratic member of Congress , every Democratic governor and all of the elected members of the Democratic National Committee ( the majority of the super delegates ) were each granted a vote at the convention .
Party leaders assumed this would help them retain a measure of control over the process -- and of course continue to be granted the bounty of political favors that historically flowed from backing the right horse at the convention .
In 2008 , the 796 super delegates will make up about 20 % of the entire convention .
Winning the nomination requires 2,025 delegates .
In creating the super delegates , Democratic Party leaders sought to show that although they respected the popular will as expressed in the primaries and caucuses , they also expected that the super delegates could play a significant if not necessarily decisive role in the selection process .
However , it did not work out that way .
Popular will has put one candidate far enough ahead by the convention that the super delegates have n’t come into play .
Every nominee since these reforms has been decided based on the primary and caucus votes .
This year might be different .
Because no front - runner has emerged , and the compressed time frame of the election may prevent any candidate from gaining enough momentum , no candidate may have enough delegates by convention time .
In that case , the super delegates , the majority of whom currently support Hillary Rodham Clinton -- but who could switch sides at any time -- could well be the decision - makers at the convention .
And this could be a real problem for the Democratic Party .
In general , the last place the public would want the nominee selected is on the convention floor .
In the heyday of the conventions , when the presidential candidates were selected in backrooms and on the floor , there were always rumors of vote buying and corrupt bargains for the nomination .
Today , such events could fatally weaken the candidate in the public ’s eyes .
The existence of super delegates would compound the problem .
Advertisement
The elected delegates , though virtually unknown , are at least selected by the voters and pledged to the candidate those voters chose .
Most of the super delegates are n’t chosen by the general populace , and they are not bound by the votes in their respective states .
If they end up making the difference in the nomination -- especially if the winner came into the convention in second place -- there is a strong possibility of disenchanting a good portion of the party ’s base , potentially costing the party the election .
Democratic Party leaders should be forewarned :
The 1982 attempt to control the nomination could very well come back to haunt them in 2008 .
Eight ' clone farm ' cows born in Britain - and their meat could be on sale in months
Eight ' clone farm ' cows have been born in the UK , the Daily Mail can reveal .
Their mother is a clone – created in a U.S. laboratory with cells taken from the ear of a prize - winning animal .
Meat or milk from the calves , flown into Britain as frozen embryos and implanted into a surrogate , could be on sale here within months .
Though food from clones is barred from the food chain , there are no legal safeguards over their offspring .
Clone concern : Eight cloned calves have been born in the UK
Details of the births came as a study found an overwhelming majority of consumers object to all ' clone farm ' plans .
Research published by the Food Standards Agency showed they consider it a dangerous manipulation of nature and are unhappy that scientists are racing ahead .
The Daily Mail revealed last year that clone farming had become a reality in Britain .
We identified the births of a Holstein calf called Dundee Paradise and her brother Dundee Paratrooper .
Now six more animals with the same clone mother have been born in the Midlands - taking the total to four males and four females .
Embryos from another clone are known to have been imported , although none has yet been born .
The food and farming department DEFRA has been accused of shocking complacency over clone farming .
Its officials admitted yesterday that they had no idea how many clone offspring are on British farms .
Four of the calves were born at Smiddiehill Holsteins in Albrighton , Shropshire .
This herd has since been broken up and sold and it is not known where the animals are now .
The FSA study , conducted by analysts at Creative Research , is the first in - depth investigation of public attitudes to clone farming .
It found that the more consumers learned about cloning , the more they objected .
Authorities in the U.S. gave their approval to clone farm food in January .
There are suggestions that meat and milk from clones or their offspring could soon be in shops and restaurants there .
As the law stands , there is nothing to stop this food being imported to the UK without any controls or labels .
In theory , meat from any of the eight British calves could also go into stores at any time .
Creative Research director Dr Steve Griggs , said : ' The majority of people came to the conclusion that they would not want to eat such food .
' There was a strong sense from the public that this represents a quantum leap .
They characterised animal cloning as very much interfering with nature and struggled to identify any convincing benefits for consumers . '
Dr Griggs stressed that the survey was carried out with consumers who were given a lot of information about cloning , rather than a simple opinion poll .
Advocates of cloning say the technique will let farmers create herds of supersize cows , able to produce vast amounts of milk – and better profits .
A number of laboratories have been set up in the U.S. to fulfil the demand for cloned cows and their offspring .
There is now evidence that British businessmen farmers , some of the UK 's leading breeders of Holstein milking cows , are buying into the idea .
But consumers are worried about the welfare of the animals involved .
Removing eggs needs painful techniques while cloning attempts have produced a high number of stillbirths and malformed young .
Dr Griggs said : ' There were concerns about the ethical side , whether we have the moral right to go down this road .
People were concerned this was a step on the road to cloned humans . '
On food , he said opinions were strongly affected by the scandal over human BSE , from eating beef , and the attempted introduction of GM food without proper checks .
' Most people were concerned that cloning could result in food that was unsafe for human consumption , ' he said .
' There is a very strong fear that something in this process of could do something to create a new disease or affect the food so it could be harmful . '
The researchers found most people want extensive testing of clone farm meat and milk over a five to ten - year period – similar to the tests on new drugs before they are cleared for use .
The public reaction is at odds with Government thinking .
Defra has rejected recommendations from its own farming experts to set up a system to police the introduction of clone farming .
The Daily Mail 's revelations last year triggered a review of the law by the FSA and its EU counterpart , the European Food Safety Authority .
The EFSA is due to publish its decision on whether to impose controls on all forms of clone food , including from offspring , in the summer .
Its experts have signalled that there is no risk involved in eating the food , but its ethical advisers have warned against clone farming because of the harm to animal welfare .
Criminal investigation of Halliburton ’s Nigerian operation widens
Evidence of corruption during Cheney ’s tenure
By Brian Smith
26 May 2008
Criminal investigations of former Halliburton subsidiary Kellogg Brown and Root ( KBR ) , for alleged bribery in the construction of Nigeria ’s $ 10 billion liquefied natural gas ( LNG ) export plant on Bonny Island , have been widened to cover the past 20 years of Halliburton ’s operations in Nigeria .
Investigators will also probe accusations of embezzlement by senior executives , and Halliburton ’s relations with other multinationals , including Royal Dutch Shell .
Halliburton recently dismissed two of its most senior executives , Robert Stanley and William Chaudin , on suspicion of embezzling $ 5 million from a Nigerian energy project .
The initial claim , which started the investigation some six years ago , was that Halliburton and others working on a gas export project conspired to win a $ 5 billion construction contract in 1995 by establishing a $ 180 million slush - fund to bribe Nigerian officials , and to reward Western contractors between 1994 and 2002 , which includes the period when US Vice - President Dick Cheney was Halliburton ’s chairman and CEO ( 1995 -2000 ) .
Such payments are illegal under a 1997 convention barring “ bribery of foreign public officials in commercial negotiations , ” adopted by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development .
Cheney was also at the helm when , on March 18 , 1999 , Halliburton and the consortium paid $ 37.5 million to British lawyer Jeffrey Tesler , who served as a consultant to KBR after it was formed in a 1998 merger between Halliburton and Dresser Industries , which Cheney engineered .
This and three other similar payments to Tesler are some of the key points in the investigation by French , British , US and Nigerian police .
Halliburton ’s April 25 , 2008 quarterly filing to the New York - based Securities & Exchange Commission ( SEC ) , which regulates companies that sell stock on public markets , marks the first time that specific evidence was cited to support claims that Halliburton bribed Nigerian officials in violation of the US Corrupt Foreign Practices Act ( CFPA ) while Cheney was the company ’s CEO and , as such , responsible for its books .
According to a footnote in the April 25 filing , US Department of Justice officials told Halliburton that they have “ evidence of payments to Nigerian officials by another agent in connection with a separate KBR - managed project in Nigeria called the Shell EA project , ” worth some $ 350 million .
The filing also notes that Halliburton and KBR have suspended the agent and another agent who had worked for KBR on “ several current projects and on numerous older projects going back to the early 1980s ” .
This is the first time that Shell has been formally mentioned in the criminal investigation .
The Shell EA oil and gas field is involved in the supply of gas to the LNG export plant on Bonny Island .
KBR built the giant floating production , storage and offloading vessel , the “ Sea Eagle ” , which has a 170,000 barrel - a- day capacity , for Shell Nigeria .
Foreign shareholders hold a 51 percent equity stake in Nigeria LNG ( NLNG ) , and Shell is the biggest foreign shareholder in NLNG , along with Total ( France ) , ENI ( Italy ) and the Japan Gas Corporation .
Shell provided the technical consultants to evaluate bids for the NLNG project , which were submitted by rival consortia Bechtel , and KBR and partners — Technip ( France ) , Snamprogetti ( Italy ) and the Japan Gas Corporation — a consortium known as TSKJ .
NLNG ’s decision to award the contract to TSKJ was unanimous , although Nigerian officials have since complained of heavy political and commercial pressure .
In its quarterly filing to the SEC last October , Halliburton said it was subpoenaed by the US Department of Justice and SEC over the use by TSKJ “ of an immigration services provider , apparently managed by a Nigerian immigration official , to which approximately $ 1.8 million in payments in excess of costs of visas were allegedly made between approximately 1997 and the termination of the provider in December 2004 and our 2007 reporting of this matter to the government ” .
Halliburton now admits that it is “ unable to estimate an amount of probable loss or range of possible loss related to these matters as it relates to Halliburton directly ” from claims against it by third parties , for special , indirect , derivative or consequential damages , if it were to be successfully prosecuted by the US authorities for violation of the CFPA .
Halliburton also noted in its SEC filing that federal investigators had “ expressed concern regarding the level of our cooperation , ” suggesting suspicion of a cover - up or at least delaying tactics .
Three years ago Halliburton ’s lawyers , Baker Botts , gave the US Department of Justice 500 pages of notes compiled by its consultant , Wojciech Chodan , between 1993 and 1999 , which has helped investigators to understand the plans by TSKJ to pay off Nigerian officials and Western businessmen .
Africa Confidential recently obtained a set of Chodan ’s notes , which outline the involvement of TSKJ in planning the establishment of the slush - fund .
The notes record TSKJ meetings with oil companies such as Shell , Elf and Agip , and also debates by members of TSKJ about the merits of making “ secret ” and “ open ” payments to agents .
At the bottom of each page is printed “ FOIA CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED BY HALLIBURTON ” , i.e. , that the government should not pass the documents on to journalists who might request them under the Freedom of Information Act .
This is not the first time that Halliburton has been pursued by the SEC .
During the 2004 US presidential campaign , the company agreed to a $ 7.5 million settlement with the SEC over suspect accounting practices that took place during Cheney ’s affiliation with Halliburton .
The accusation was that Halliburton had changed the way in which it accounted for construction revenues in 1998 and did not report that change to investors for more than a year , a violation of securities rules .
This caused the company ’s public statements regarding its income to be materially misleading in boosting Halliburton ’s paper profits by $ 120 million , and giving Wall Street the false impression that Halliburton was profitable between 1998 and 1999 , so boosting the value of its stock and helping Cheney earn more than $ 35 million when he sold his shares in 2000 .
Accounting irregularities at Halliburton exceeded $ 234 million during Cheney ’s tenure , according to documents obtained by the watchdog group Center for Public Integrity .
However , the lack of media coverage of this issue , especially within the US , is indicative of the fact that it is highly unlikely that the US Justice Department will pursue Cheney over the Nigerian scandal even if the alleged bribery and embezzlement did take place on his watch .

What if our affordable housing laws actually increased the cost of housing by 20 percent and decreased the number of available new homes by 10 percent ?
Wouldnt that encourage us to take a serious look at what our housing policies are doing these days ?
Californias courts dont think so .
In 2001 , when homebuilders challenged a local inclusionary zoning  law ( also known as an affordable housing law ) requiring them to sell 10 percent of any homes , townhomes , condos , or apartments they build at an average of $ 300,000 less than the fair market price , the Court of Appeal sided with the government .
Writing for the majority in Home Builders Association of Northern California v. City of Napa , former Circuit Court Judge Scott Snowden said , ... it is beyond question that [ the City of Napas ] inclusionary zoning ordinance will substantially advance  the important governmental interest of providing affordable housing for low - and moderate - income families . 
The ordinance , he concluded , will necessarily increase the supply of affordable housing .
The Court based its opinion partly on economic arguments .
Now , in hindsight , we are able to test those arguments and see how they hold up against the evidence .
We recently analyzed how inclusionary zoning laws requiring builders to set aside a given percentage of new construction for low - to moderate - income individuals have affected both new home prices and the quantity of new homes over time .
During the period we studied , the number of California cities with inclusionary zoning laws increased from 15 to 56 .
We compared the changes in housing prices and supply in these cities to those without a similar ordinance .
The cities that adopted inclusionary zoning laws saw a 20 percent jump in housing prices and a 10 percent decrease in the number of new units built .
This is the basic law of supply and demand at work .
Affordable housing mandates have had an unintended consequence : they have discouraged homebuilding , and the diminished supply of housing has driven prices up .
When forced to sell at below - market rates due to this type of zoning , homebuilders must choose between decreasing the number of affordable units versus taking a loss .
And , not surprisingly , they almost always choose decreasing the number of affordable units , which they accomplish by reducing the total number of planned units .
In other words , since inclusionary zoning laws require developers to sell a percentage of all units they build at below - market rates in order to get permission to build market - rate units , the policy forces them to cut back on everything .
With the number of new homes thus limited , buyers end up paying more for their homes .
Housing affordability is a major problem nationwide , but it is particularly acute in California .
In San Francisco , where the median home price is now around $ 846,500 and the median household income is $ 86,100 , only 7 percent of available houses are affordable for those whose income is in the median income range .
In the Los Angeles - Long Beach - Glendale area , it s even worse .
The median home price in this area is $ 515,000 ; the median income is $ 61,700 ; and only 3.7 percent of homes are within a doable price range for the average family .
In the San Diego area , only 10.1 percent of homes are within reach of the average family , and in San Jose , only 14.1 percent .
The list goes on .
The last thing California families need is a law that makes housing even less affordable than it would be in the first place .
Inclusionary zoning does just that .

Profile of Michael Todd Tributes to chief constable
" Last night we became concerned for his welfare and as a result searches started to find him .
" These searches have continued today and unfortunately this afternoon a body has been found .
" I and all the officers of Greater Manchester Police and all the members of Greater Manchester Police Authority are absolutely shocked by what 's happened and what has taken place in the last 16 hours . "
Mr Whatton said although the body had yet to be formally identified , he believed it was that of the chief constable .
Reports of his disappearance emerged after a large scale search was reported in Nant Peris , above the village of Llanberis , Gwynedd .
The Llanberis Mountain Rescue
Team began the task of taking his body off the mountain on foot on Tuesday evening .
It was brought down at about 1930 GMT and transferred by ambulance to Ysbyty Gwynedd , a hospital at Bangor .
Rescue spokesman Ian Henderson said teams had been hampered by " appalling " weather conditions , including heavy rain and high winds , which meant rescuers could not use a helicopter .
Mr Henderson confirmed that the alarm was raised by walkers who found " personal effects " belonging to Mr Todd while out on the mountain .
His body was spotted just before 1500 GMT about 200 yards away from the spot where the items were found , he added .
Sources at Greater Manchester Police said that among the items found with him were personal letters written to his loved ones , the BBC's Nick Ravenscroft said .
Home Secretary Jacqui Smith led a series of tributes to Mr Todd , saying she was " saddened " to learn of his death .
" Chief Constable Todd has had a long and distinguished career in various forces and has contributed greatly to the fight against crime and terrorism , " she said .
" My thoughts are with his family , friends and colleagues . "

Tributes also poured in from police bodies , chief constables from other forces , senior MPs and political figures in Manchester .
Mr Todd , a former Met Police assistant commissioner , joined GMP in 2002 .
He also worked in Essex and Nottingham .
He was appointed chief constable in Greater Manchester , England 's third largest force , in October 2002 following the retirement of Sir David Wilmot .
He had been a police officer for more than 30 years , having joined Essex Police in 1976 , and was tipped to become Britain 's highest - ranking officer - a future Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police .
Mr Todd 's most high - profile media appearance was when he allowed himself to be hit by a Taser stun gun to prove they were a safe alternative to firearms .
Well Ohioans , you ’ve been hoodwinked .
You thought you were stopping gays from getting married last November when you voted for that amendment .
Apparently , you were all too damn lazy to read the language or listen to the debate .
Bottom line : it affects more than gays according to an Ohio Court .
According to the Cleveland Plain Dealer , a judge struck down part of the state ’s domestic violence law today based on the “ gay marriage ” amendment :
Ohio voters who approved a constitutional amendment last fall that denied legal recognition of unmarried and gay couples probably did n’t envision the measure being successfully used as a defense in domestic violence cases .
But that became a reality Wednesday when Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Judge Stuart Friedman ruled that the amendment , approved by voters as Issue 1 , made part of the state ’s domestic violence law unconstitutional .
Friedman said that because Ohio ’s domestic violence law recognizes the relationship between an unmarried offender and victim as one “ approximating the significance or effect of marriage , ” it represents a direct conflict with the amendment ’s prohibition against such recognition and is thus unenforceable .
It ’s a matter of time before other Ohio laws are challenged based on this amendment .
The ironic thing here is that gays did n’t really lose anything under the amendment .
See , gays ca n’t get married anyway .
It ’s those straight Ohioans who voted against their own interests …. again .
Who knew they ’d be supporting domestic violence ?
Who knows if they also voted to end divorce ?
We ’ll see .
It was to be one of the biggest science experiments ever seen yet there was not a bunson burner or test tube in sight .
The Best N64 Games That Still Matter Today
Note from racketboy : Special thanks goes to andymol21 for putting the majority of this guide together !
It ’s pretty easy to find a list of “ The Top Nintendo 64 Games ” or some similar ranking , but most of them were written back when the system was cutting edge and almost all of them only compare the games against other N64 games .
This is all fine if the N64 is the only console you own and ever plan to own .
Because of this , I thought it would be a good idea to develop a list of games that are still relevant in today ’s market because of their unique gameplay that has not been improved upon on other systems .
Our basic rule of thumb for this list is to determine which games are still worth playing today , even if you have a Gamecube and / or a Wii with its more modern game library at your fingertips .
( But other consoles are considered as well ) I thought this was an especially good metric to use as Nintendo has a habit of upgrading their biggest games each generation .
Even if you do n’t plan on getting an actual N64 , this could also serve as a list of ones to look out for on the Virtual Console ( although not all of them are available for the service )
Legend of Zelda : Ocarina of Time
It should come as no surprise that the highest - ranked games of all time is the number one reason that the N64 is still relevant .
The Ocarina of Time tells the story of a young boy , Link , whose destiny leads him on an adventure that crosses two time periods and the entire land of Hyrule , in order to become the Hero of Time .
The defining game of the N64 , OOT was Shigeru Miyamoto ’s masterpiece , and is praised by many as being the best game ever made .
Whether you enjoy western RPGs , action packed combat , fiendish puzzle solving , or just a damn good story , this game has it all , and would still be regarded as one of greatest games of all time even if it was released tomorrow for the PS3 .
As the story develops , and the game progresses , you are drawn into the world of Hyrule and care about its inhabitants and future , you form a strong sentimental attachments to you horse Epona , and you dive deep into a world full of secrets and treasures to be discovered .
Never is the games direction linear ;
If you ever feel like you ’ve had enough dungeon crawling then you can come out and search for Gold Skultula ’s , or play some of the games in Hyrule Town Market , or just watch the sun set across Hyrule Lake as you ride Epona to the fishing gallery for a go at catching the Hylian Loach .
On the other hand you always know what is expected of you , and what needs to be done next .
Never in my life have I played a game that is so utterly engrossing , that offers so many diversions and distractions to the main quest , and that tells a story so brilliant , that I would happily pay money to go and see it at the cinema .
If there is just one N64 game that you must own today , it is The Ocarina of Time .

Super Mario 64
Even after 12 years ( yes , it ’s been that long ! )
Shigeru Miyamoto ’s portly plumber is still used as the yardstick by which all 3D platformers are measured against .
The reason for that is simple ; it is still one of the best , if not the best , examples of its genre in gaming .
On Nintendo ’s first strike , they hit the ball out of the park !
Every level in the game is a masterpiece , from the simple opening stage of Bob - omb Battlefield , to the magical cloud journey of Rainbow Ride , all 15 levels are distinct , challenging and interesting , and are a joy to play on .
The simple graphical style means that the graphics have not aged much over the years , the music and sound effects are spot on for the actions on screen , and the mechanics are nigh on perfect .
Every jump of Mario can be judged to pinpoint precision , every shot from the cannon angled perfectly to get you to the place you want to be .
This , I feel , is the main reason it is still relevant .
The physics engine used in Mario 64 is so predictable that you never feel out of control , and that is something that a lot of platformers , even to this day , lack .

Conker ’s Bad Fur Day
Ah Rare … .
I remember when I was a lad , reading N64 Magazine , being so excited about the new Conker game that was to come out .
With gameplay that would rival their own great Banjo Kazooie , it was going to be the pinnacle of N64 platformers .
How things changed !
Conker ’s Bad Fur
Day is an adult oriented game involving a hung - over squirrel , a good looking bunny , and a giant poo .
The brilliance of Conker comes from its writing and voice acting .
The wit and charm that can be put into such despicable creatures is amazing , and a testament to Rare during their glory years .
You have to sympathize with Conker , who , after a heavy night of drinking , wakes up the next morning in a field , just wanting to go home .
The game is hilarious the whole way through , though it does sink quite low with its toilet humor ( see giant poo ) .
The reason that it is worth playing today is the same reason that it was a good buy when it was new , it ’s a one of a kind game , and the humor , unlike the graphics ( which are still some of the best on the N64 ) , have not succumbed to age .
On a side note , in 2005 , after Rare was acquired by Microsoft , an XBox remake was made of this game featuring update graphics and sound , and an improved multiplayer .
In my opinion , do not bother with this remake .
Microsoft brutally censored the game , removing many of the jokes ( The Great Mighty Poo Song being a notable absence ) and leaving just the core Conker platforming mechanics .
The N64 version is getting harder to find , and sells for high prices on eBay , but do n’t go for the semi-skimmed version .

Sin & Punishment
This gem from Treasure may be one of the best N64 games of all time , but most gamers outside of Japan never got a change to play it .
Until now Sin and Punishment was a rare import that was only known to the hardcore gamers that either imported the expensive cartridge or emulated the game .
Now its significantly easier to obtain now that its on the Virtual Console .
Much like the rest of Treasure ’s well - known shooters ( such as Gunstar Heroes and Alien Soldier ) Sin and Punishment is filled frenetic , high - energy action that keeps pulling you further into the game .
Armed with a gun and a sword , you character continues along a path while you jump , double jump and roll to avoid obstacles and enemy attacks .
Much like other on - rails shooters like Rez or Panzer Dragoon , you can manually shoot your weapon in different places or set it to lock on to enemies .
The sword is primarily to be used for defense and deflection for those pesky missiles that can be bounced back with a well - timed melee strike .
Sin and Punishment is one of Treasure ’s few 3D games , but as usual , the skilled development house pushed the N64 hardware to the max with some impressive visuals , massively detailed levels , intricate character and enemy models and , of course , action that will make you dizzy with excitement .

StarFox 64
I have not been the biggest StarFox fan in the past .
I admit it wholeheartedly , but I recently took it upon myself to have a go and see what StarFox 64 was like .
I can now admit that I have been wrong about this series for many years .
Starfox sees you , Fox McCloud , fight off the evil Andross in your trusty Arwing , and is an on - rails shooter at its core .
In fact , it is the last StarFox game so far that is a pure air - based combat besides StarFox Command for the DS , which has ackward stylus - based controls .
The game does not follow a linear path , meaning that any mistakes or achievements you make through a level , such as letting one of your wingmen be hit too much , directly affect the order you go through the levels .
This means that you have to play through the game multiple times in order to even see all the levels the designers included .
What surprised me most about the game , is how similar the mechanics and gameplay are to some of the best vertical shooters that I have played .
You find yourself using the same techniques that you use in games such as Radient Silvergun and 1942 .
The N64 never had a proper shump released in the west , so for anyone who wants their fix of methodical bullet dodging and mindless shooting , Starfox is a great new twist on a simple genre .
The graphics actually are n’t too bad for the N64 and complement the game quite nicely .
Of course it does n’t have quite the polish that the Gamecube installments have , but it is a definate step up from the original StarFox on the SNES .
So when it comes down to it , if you want the best pure - on rails shooting in the StarFox universe , StarFox 64 is still your best bet .

Blast Corps
Who does n’t love blowing stuff up and causing massive damage to the world around them ?
While open - ended destructive abilities may show up in a number of more modern games , very few , if any have destruction as such a large percentage of their focus as Blast Corps .
In Blast Corps you control around ten different vehicles and machines in order to clear out buildings and landscapes to make way for an out - of - control truck carrying nuclear missiles .
The equipment you use to take care of business range from a speedy bulldozer to a robot with a jet - pack and “ ground - pound ” capabilities to take out large buildings .
Since you do n’t always know exactly what you need to do at the beginning of each level , there is a bit of puzzle solving and experimentation involved .
Even for experienced players , it will test your efficiency in accomplishing your goals .
Even if you take care of the required damage , you can always cause extra destruction to rack up extra points .
You might think that a game like this would get boring after a while , but Rareware did an excellent job of increasing the difficulty as you go along and the diversity of the equipment you use ( each of which takes some learning ) keep things interesting .
If you want a fast and furious game that is unique enough to keep your attention , Blast Corps should definitely be in your library .

The Legend of Zelda : Majora ’s Mask
Initially , I had Majora ’s Mask on the Honorable Mentions list , but after reconsidering , I ’ve added it to the main list .
While it is n’t on my list of favorites in the series , there are quite a few Zelda fans that adore it due to its originality and involving storyline .
The main turn - off with Majora ’s Mask with most gamers is the three - day cycle that the game revolves around .
Many people found it annoying and hard to get used to .
However , as reddit commenter , satertek mentioned “ I guess it comes down to whether or not you liked the 3 - day aspect .
That was the game .
Having all these people that would go about their schedules whether you were there or not made the game feel alive , and then getting to relive those 3 days over and over so that you get to meet and help every one of them . ”
In the end , there are many other Zelda games I enjoy playing more than Majora ’s Mask , but considering you can find it affordably , there is n’t a a good reason you should skip it if you are a Zelda fan .

Mario Kart 64
Due to popular demand , I ’ve also included Mario Kart 64 on the main list .
Personally , I have more fun with Mario Kart DS , but there are many die - hard Mario Kart fans that swear by the first 3D installment .
While Mario Kart Double Dash and Mario Kart
Wii have more refined graphics , Nintendo added new gimmicks that focused on teamwork instead of the flat - out competition and multiplayer moded .
I think a comment on Reddit from “ ickingfudiot ” was what convinced me most to include it in the main list , “ Sadly , he ( and Nintendo in releasing Mario Kart Wii ) completely missed out on the utter glory of FFA Balloon Battle on Block Fort or Skyscraper .
We still bust that out on Virtual Console .
Sadly , MK
Wii turned it into a team - based snorefest , particularly because of the removal of permadeath .
RIP Balloon Battle ”
Also just recently , racketboy member , Ack shared his fond memories of Mario Kart 64 ’s Battle Mode , “ I used to go to all - night parties where all we played was Mario Kart 64 ’s Battle Mode .
Some of the most fun I ’ve ever had at parties , to be honest .
It was a feature that I do n’t think ever got enough attention , and to this day I still say Mario Kart 64 was one of the two best in the series , if not the best ( I ca n’t in good faith say that something was better than the original … I love them both ) . ”
Even though some of the graphics might be a little rough around the edges , Mario Kart 64 still puts up a mean fight against its newer siblings and it a cornerstone of N64 - based gaming parties .

Ogre Battle 64
Ever since Squaresoft transitioned the bulk of their development from the Super Nintendo to Sony ’s Playstation , Nintendo has never had a very strong RPG lineup .
However , the Japanese development house , Quest , took it upon themselves to create a wonderful RPG that makes the most of its cartridge - based limitations .
As you could expect from the Ogre Battle series , the N64 sequel is a wonderful blend of both RPG and Tactical elements .
And of course , instead of only focusing on the strategy , experience points , and item management , Ogre Battle also is blessed with an engaging story and plot that will keep you coming back for more .
Ogre Battle 64 also bucks the trend of many of the games on the N64 in that it does n’t use 3D just because it can .
Instead , this sequel actually stays true to the original game with sprite - based graphics being the focus and using 3D elements in places that they are suitable such as the overworld map and as subtle accents .
It ’s actually quite refreshing to see such beautiful 2D graphics on a console that had such a focus on 3D .
Strategy RPG fans seem to fall in love with just about any installment in the series ( on both the SNES and Playstation ) , but the N64 version still falls right in line with the level of quality and enjoyment .
And when you look at the Gamecube and Wii lineup , the only other games that really match up would be the Fire Emblem series .
The Fire Emblem series gets very high marks , but I do n’t think it should disqualify Ogre Battle 64 from this list .

Wetrix
The best way to describe Wetrix is by imaging a 3D Tetris that has been drowned underwater … with rubber ducks thrown in .
The objective of the game is to build lakes on a flat playing board step by step , raising the ground level with “ uppers ” to form lakes , lowering it with “ downers ” and filling these lakes with water .
As more pieces fall , you have to constantly adapt your lakes to accommodate the extra water , or divert the water away from a hole in your land created by a bomb .
As water leaks off the side , it is collected into a tank on the right hand side of the screen , and once this tank is full , it ’s game over .
You can lower the amount of water in the tank by dropping a fireball into one of your lakes , evaporating it and allowing you to fill it again .
Wetrix is a novel twist on the simple block - based puzzle genre established by Tetris and is one of the few games of this type that works in 3D .
It ’s an addictive , but challenging game which rewards solid playing hours with the sight of rainbows and the aforementioned rubber ducks sprouting up across your lovingly crafted lakes .
The multiplayer in Wetrix is one of the best of its kind , with a game between two good players being a highly enjoyable frantic dash to get ducks and evaporate water , while throwing earthquakes and ice at the other player to hamper them .
A sequel , Aqua Aqua , was released for the PS2 but failed to capture the magic of the original .
All in all , a very good original puzzle game , and by far the best on the N64 .

Pilotwings 64
Pilotwings 64 is the sequel to the popular SNES game , Pilotwings .
In it , you take to the skies in an assortment of flying contraptions , ranging from Gyrocopters to Rocket Belts , in order to complete a series of predefined tasks , such as flying through floating rings or taking pictures of the pretty scenery .
You are judged after each event on several factors and given an overall score .
The goal of the game is to achieve as high as possible score in each event , unlocking new challenges and vehicles .
What separates Pilotwings from most other flight sims is the sense of freedom , of exploration , of flying !
Like most of Nintendo ’s greatest games , a lot of the fun of Pilotwings comes from jumping into the assortment of vehicles and taking to the skies with no aims in mind , just to see what you can do .
Personally , the joy of Pilotwings did n’t really display itself to me until I unlocked the Birdman stage .
There are no objectives in this stage , no stress of fuel supplies or ground rushing towards you .
Just you , the sky , and a pair of feathery wings attached to your arms .
This stage really captures the freedom of flight .
Flying through the well constructed islands , exploring each crevice , then soaring high above the skyline of a city , makes for a relaxed gaming experience and one that just ca n’t be found on modern games consoles ( well , until Pilotwings Wii comes out )

Body Harvest
Around the time of the N64 launch , a small company by the name of DMA Designs Limited started work on two projects : A top down racer codenamed Race ’n ’ Chase for the PC , and a free roaming shooter for the then under development N64 .
The PC game morphed several times and eventually became the original Grand Theft Auto , which , of course , propelled DMA ( now known as Rockstar North ) into the limelight and made them a lot of money in the process .
However , their other game , Body Harvest , came out to a muted fan fare .
It was given very positive reviews at the time of its launch , but was generally forgotten as the N64 progressed .
Body Harvest is a 3rd person shooter in which your character is a genetically enhanced soldier sent back in time to defeat a human devouring race of aliens that landed on Earth , killing most of the population .
You travel through 5 different areas at 5 different times of the invasion : Greece 1916 , Java 1941 , America 1966 , Siberia 1991 and finally the Alien Homeworld 2046 .
You might say that Body Harvest is a pretty standard 3rd person shooter , but the thing that makes Body Harvest stand out from other shooters of its time is the interactivity of the world and the ability to hop into any vehicle on the map .
Essentially , Body Harvest was the foundation blocks for GTA3 , where the developers were first trying out the designs and techniques that would later go into their prime franchise .
Although the graphics have dated a bit , the manic gameplay and free roaming elements make this an enjoyable and overlooked game .
If you are interested in the heritage of GTA , or are just looking for a fun way to kill a few bugs , Body Harvest is well worth your time .

Space Station Silicon Valley
Space Station Silicon Valley is gem by DMA Designs , and is still a classic to this day .
To be honest , I ca n’t quite put my finger on what makes this 3D action platformer so good .
The level design is superb , ranging from pathetically easy in the opening stages to joypad - crushingly - difficult as you reach the games climax .
The animal switching mechanism ( another nod to future GTA projects ) works wonderfully , meaning that each new level usually has you playing as an entirely new character , with different abilities and stats .
This also means that any enemy that you kill within the game can be “ possessed ” and you can use all of their own abilities against other animals , leading to a leap frog effect as you climb the food chain up to the top .
The game plays for the most part like a puzzle game , with challenges being presented to you through the environment and the tools to solve them given by the animals you can inhabit , but has some hardcore platforming stages too , which rival some of the best in the business .
The most striking thing about the game though , is its style .
Diesel - powered foxes chase electric mice with sharp tails and turbo boost , while buoyant penguins throw snowballs at steam powered polar bears , who are laying mines in order to kill the wolves on skies , as they fire missiles launched from their back .
The wackiness and brilliance of the character design meant that there is always something to come back to , always some new and inventive way of killing that damn Rocket Dog !
Needless to say , Space Station Silicon Valley absolutely floored me when it came out , and has continued to impress me every time I plug the cartridge in .

Honorable Mentions :
You may be wondering why one of your all - time favorites are not included on the list above .
There are many games that were ground - breaking in their day and are still very fun , but have either been much improved upon or are in a genre that has experienced a great leap in quality since the N64 era .
Here are a few of the most popular N64 games that are n’t quite as good as their newer counterparts .
WASHINGTON ( AP ) 
The Bush administration wants to rewrite the official evidence against Guantanamo Bay detainees , allowing it to shore up its cases before they come under scrutiny by civilian judges for the first time .
The government has stood behind the evidence for years .
Military review boards relied on it to justify holding hundreds of prisoners indefinitely without charge .
Justice Department attorneys said it was thoroughly and fairly reviewed .
Now that federal judges are about to review the evidence , however , the government says it needs to make changes .
The decision follows last week 's Supreme Court ruling , which held that detainees have the right to challenge their detention in civilian court , not just before secret military panels .
At a closed - door meeting with judges and defense attorneys this week , government lawyers said they needed time to add new evidence and make other changes to evidentiary documents known as " factual returns . "
Attorneys for the detainees criticized the idea , saying the government is basically asking for a last - minute do - over .
" It 's sort of an admission that the original returns were defective , " said attorney David Remes , who represents many detainees and attended Wednesday 's meeting .
" It 's also an admission that the government thinks it needs to beef up the evidence . "
Justice Department spokesman Erik Ablin declined to comment on the plan .
The discussions were confirmed by several attorneys and officials who attended or were briefed on the meeting with the judges and defense lawyers .
" It 's a totally fishy maneuver that suggests that the government wants , at the 11th hour , to get its ducks in a row , " said Jonathan Hafetz , an attorney representing several detainees .
He was briefed on the plan .
The documents include the government 's accusations and summaries of the evidence that was presented to the military review panel .
The records were filed in federal court in many detainee cases in 2004 and 2005 , before Congress stripped those courts of the authority to hold hearings .
Detainees ' attorneys who have reviewed the records criticized much of the evidence as hearsay cobbled together from bounty hunters and border guards who accused people of being terrorists in exchange for reward money .
At Guantanamo Bay , the traditional rules of evidence do not apply in trials run by the military .
In a Washington federal courtroom , they would .
The government wants to submit new records , which would allow it to add new intelligence and expand its reasoning for holding the detainees .
Since the hearings will decide whether the detainees are lawfully being held now — not whether they were lawfully being held over the past several years — the government wants to provide the court its newest , best evidence .
It will be up to federal judges to decide whether the Justice Department can rewrite those documents .
The question is part of a broader dispute over what the upcoming hearings will look like .
Attorneys for the detainees want judges to review all the evidence and decide whether each prisoner should be released .
The government believes the judges should look only at limited evidence prepared by officials at Guantanamo Bay .
That 's why defense attorneys are troubled by the idea that authorities now want to rewrite that evidence .
If the court limits arguments to just the government 's record , and gives the government a chance to improve that record , they believe the detainees ' chances will be hurt .
" They 're not just talking about making a little supplement where they 've learned something new , " said attorney Charles H. Carpenter , who was in the meeting .
" They 're talking about possibly amending every single one . "

The Bush administration faced criticism when details emerged of its programme to monitor the phone calls of foreign targets in the US without warrants .
President Bush said the scheme was needed to prevent attacks on the US .
Telephone companies were facing as many as 40 lawsuits for their involvement in the scheme .
Sticking point
The bill was passed in the House of Representatives with bipartisan support , after House Democrats reached a compromise with the Republicans over the provisions to grant telecommunications companies immunity from prosecution .
Previous attempts to pass the bill - and allow the warrantless wiretap scheme to continue - had foundered on the issue of immunity for telecom firms .
Democrats had been reluctant to grant the firms immunity , saying the courts should first determine what the companies did .
President Bush - backed by Republicans in Congress - wanted to ensure that firms which had helped his administration would not be liable for prosecution .
The two sides reached a compromise , whereby telephone companies would not be automatically immune , but courts would be obliged to dismiss a suit against a firm if it is able to produce written certification that the White House asked it to participate in the programme and assured the firm it was legal .
The bill is expected to pass the other house of Congress - the Senate - without any difficulties and will shortly become law .
Earlier this year , The Onion made a hilarious video , which jokingly suggests that FDA officials have been smoking lots of weed .
Reporters for the Wall Street Journal health blog might agree with the spoof .
Since the regulatory agency announced on Monday that it may accept as much as $ 275 million in funding for the upcoming year , the WSJ blog has been rife with criticism :
Why was the agency so reluctant to accept more cash for its food and drug safety programs ?
In the light of several consumer nightmares this year — including tainted pet food , heparin , tomatoes , and toothpaste — congress has practically begged the agency to accept more money and strengthen its safeguards .
Until this week , FDA officials were unwilling to play ball — sticking to a Bush administration rule not to criticize their own budget .
From the WSJ health blog :
The Bush administration ’s Office of Management and Budget instituted a rule–see Section 22 of the snoozily named Circular A - 11 – forbidding government employees from criticizing or disagreeing with the president ’s budget , and saying so to Congress .
That ’s why the FDA balked , and then daintily nosed towards asking for , but not actually asking for , more money this year .
When Michael O. Leavitt , Secretary of the Health and Human Services , told the New York Times that he has been urging Congress to give his agency more money , Sen. Arlen Specter was shocked and sent the bureaucrat a nasty note .
What else has the FDA grossly mishandled ?

À Smolensk , à 400 kilomètres de Moscou , une équipe d’archéologues franco - russes déterre pour la première fois les vestiges de la bataille oubliée de la Valoutina - Gora , en août 1812 , lors de la campagne de Russie menée par Napoléon .
As I sit here behind this laptop , I now realize that this definitely was n’t the brightest idea I have ever had .
I was going to rope a deer , put it in a stall , feed it up on corn for a couple of weeks , then kill it and eat it .
The first step in this adventure was getting a deer .
I figured that , since they congregate at my cattle feeder and do not seem to have much fear of me when we are there ( a bold one will sometimes come right up and sniff at the bags of feed while I am in the back of the truck not 4 feet away ) , it should not be difficult to rope one , get up to it and toss a bag over its head ( to calm it down ) then hog tie it and transport it home .
I filled the cattle feeder then hid down at the end with my rope .
The cattle , having seen the roping thing before , stayed well back .
They were not having any of it .
After about 20 minutes , my deer showed up — 3 of them .
I picked out .. .. a likely looking one , stepped out from the end of the feeder , and threw .. .. my rope .
The deer just stood there and stared at me .
I wrapped the rope around my waist and twisted the end so I would have a good hold .
The deer still just stood and stared at me , but you could tell it was mildly concerned about the whole rope situation .
I took a step towards it … took a step away .
I put a little tension on the rope and then received an education .
The first thing that I learned is that , while a deer may just stand there looking at you funny while you rope it , they are spurred to action when you start pulling on that rope .
That deer EXPLODED .
The second thing I learned is that pound for pound , a deer is a LOT stronger than a cow or a colt .
A cow or a colt in that weight range I could fight down with a rope and with some dignity .
A deer– no chance .
That thing ran and bucked and twisted and pulled .
There was no controlling it and certainly no getting close to it .
As it jerked me off my feet and started dragging me across the ground , it occurred to me that having a deer on a rope was not nearly as good an idea as I had originally imagined .
The only upside is that they do not have as much stamina as many other animals .
A brief 10 minutes later , it was tired and not nearly as quick to jerk me off my feet and drag me when I managed to get up .
It took me a few minutes to realize this , since I was mostly blinded by the blood flowing out of the big gash in my head .
At that point , I had lost my taste for corn-fed venison .
I just wanted to get that devil creature
off the end of that rope .
I figured if I just let it go with the rope hanging around its neck , it would likely die slow and painfully somewhere .
At the time , there was no love at all between me and that deer .
At that moment , I hated the thing , and I would venture a guess that the feeling was mutual .
Despite the gash in my head and the several large knots where I had cleverly arrested the deer ’s momentum by bracing my head against various large rocks as it dragged me across the ground , I could still think clearly enough to recognize that there was a small chance that I shared some tiny amount of responsibility for the situation we were in , so I did n’t want the deer to have it suffer a slow death , so I managed to get it lined back up in between my truck and the feeder – a little trap I had set before hand …kind of like a squeeze chute .
I got it to back in there and I started moving up so I could get my rope back .
Did you know that deer bite ?
They do !
I never in a million years would have thought that a deer would bite somebody , so I was very surprised when I reached up there to grab that rope and the deer grabbed hold of my wrist .
Now , when a deer bites you , it is not like being bit by a horse where they just bite you and then let go .
A deer bites you and shakes its head –almost like a pit bull .
They bite HARD and it hurts .
The proper thing to do when a deer bites you is probably to freeze and draw back slowly .
I tried screaming and shaking instead .
My method was ineffective .
It seems like the deer was biting and shaking for several minutes , but it was likely only several seconds .
I , being smarter than a deer ( though you may be questioning that claim by now ) tricked it .
While I kept it busy tearing the bejesus out of my right arm , I reached up with my left hand and pulled that rope loose .
That was when I got my final lesson in deer behavior for the day .
Deer will strike at you with their front feet .
They rear right up on their back feet and strike right about head and shoulder level , and their hooves are surprisingly sharp .
I learned a long time ago that , when an animal — like a horse — strikes at you with their hooves and you ca n’t get away easily , the best thing to do is try to make a loud noise and make an aggressive move towards the animal .
This will usually cause them to back down a bit so you can escape .
This was not a horse .
This was a deer , so obviously , such trickery would not work .
In the course of a millisecond , I devised a different strategy .
I screamed like a woman and tried to turn and run .
The reason I had always been told NOT to try to turn and run from a horse that paws at you is that there is a good chance that it will hit you in the back of the head .
Deer may not be so different from horses after all , besides being twice as strong and 3 times as evil , because the second I turned to run , it hit me right in the back of the head and knocked me down .
Now , when a deer paws at you and knocks you down , it does not immediately leave .
I suspect it does not recognize that the danger has passed .
What they do instead is paw your back and jump up and down on you while you are laying there crying like a little girl and covering your head .
I finally managed to crawl under the truck and the deer went away .
So now I know why when people go deer hunting they bring a rifle with a scope so that they can be somewhat equal to the prey .

In a universe stocked with sentient robots and faster than light travel , you 'd hope that science would have mastered something as mundane as the human reproductive system , yet the fictive cosmos are littered with unplanned pregnancies , bastard children , and all manner of unpleasant critters bursting from one 's internal organs .
Is any form of contraception safe in world of science fiction ?
We looked at seven tried and true methods and started to worry that the future we 've envisioned is one in which we 're all paying child support .

Socially - Mandated Birth Control
How it works :
When the world is on the verge of overpopulation and resources are strained , sometimes a government 's got to put the breaks on reproduction and restrict baby - making to the desirable few .
After all , after thousands of years spent clawing to the top of the Darwinian ladder , we can't have every Tom , Dick , and Beowulf Shaeffer dumping his DNA into the newly limited gene pool .
Fortunately , there 's a veritable buffet of methods for de-fertilizing the populace .
The body - numbing " ethical birth control pills " of Vonnegut 's Welcome to the Monkey House make sexual contact utterly uninteresting , while Andrew Neiderman 's The Baby Squad opts for the simpler solution of mass sterilization .
The women of Sarah Hall 's Daughters of the North are fitted with an outwardly visible IUD , and Brave New World does away with childbirth entirely , making pregnancy the pinnacle of personal disaster and arming women with a birth control utility belt that would make Batman proud .
Advertisement
Why it fails :
It turns out that the long arm of the government can only reach so far .
In Hall 's book , women occasionally slip off the reservation to join the Carhullan Army , where they 'll take out that contraceptive device post haste .
And , despite the looming threat of execution , women in The Baby Squad and Larry Niven 's " Known Space " stories have been known to get pregnant on the sly .
Of course , sometimes birth control just plain fails .
Even with a lifetime of practice at the Malthusian Drill , Brave New World 's beta Linda still manages to get knocked up , and with nary an abortion tower in sight .
Making it with a Robot
G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 - Inch 8K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250

Assuming you 've gotten a hold of one of those fully functional models and not one that 's genitally lacking , robots may be the perfect lovers – all that stamina with no messy gametes .

Why it fails :
While this might work with entirely abiological specimens , the rules get tricky when your partner 's a Cylon .
If you 're a human doing a Cylon , do n't fall in love .
If you 're a fellow toaster , then plug away – unless you 're one of the Final Five .
Which you might be .
On second thought , it 's best just to use a rubber .
Male Birth Control
How it works :
As modern researchers are tirelessly working to staunch the flow of sperm , Starfleet has long known the benefits of offering contraceptive injections to men .
It reduces the odds of accidents and prevents alien - loving starship captains from leaving little Kirklets across the Alpha Quadrant .
Advertisement
Why it fails :
As with its modern female analog , the male contraceptive injection is only good as long as you keep it up .
And captains like Ben Sisko are just too busy bringing down evil empires , battling Pah - wraiths , and preserving the timeline to stop by Sick Bay for a hypospray .
But not too busy , apparently , to get it on with Kasidy Yates .

Living in a World Without Men
How it works : Maybe all the men died off one day in a mysterious and bloody event .
Maybe women have gone off and formed their own society without thinking to take a few Y chromosomes along .
Maybe a whole species is kept female to control their breeding .
Whatever the reason , the absence of sperm would seem to take pregnancy off the menu .
Why it fails :
Even in the face of gendercide , men are not so easy to fell .
There are bound to be a few hiding out in secret labs , in orbit , or dangling in straitjackets from the ceiling , ready to impregnate the first female who pounces .
Or , as in Jurassic Park , the absence of males may prompt a handful of females to tiptoe across the gender line .
And maybe men are n't a necessary component after all ; the women of all - female utopia Herland opt for parthenogenesis , making themselves pregnant without the benefit of a partner .

Being Male
Advertisement
How it works : Thomas Beatie aside , it 's unlikely that a man is going to find himself pregnant at the gonads of another human being .
Even exclusively male societies , like that in Lois McMaster Bujold 's Ethan of Athos , tend to rely on external gestation devices rather than construct a male womb .
Why it fails :
While human fetuses find the male body hostile , other species may not be so discerning .
From the Octavia Butler 's Tlic to Ridley Scott 's chestbursters to that Alien in Red vs .
Blue , there are plenty of extraterrestrials perfectly happy to place their embryos in our bodies , regardless of a uterus .
Advertisement
Abstinence
How it works :
We all learned it in school : the only surefire way to avoid pregnancy is abstinence .
Or sodomy .
Why it fails :
As Deanna Troi and Shmi Skywalker will tell you , keeping your knees shut does n't exactly guarantee a baby - free existence .
When those microscopic or incorporeal beings want something from you , be it a Force - balancing messiah or a chance at fleshy life , they are n't going to wait around for a little thing like sexual intercourse .

Death
How it works :
In olden times , death generally put a damper on one 's ability to become a new parent .
But with today 's medical advances , it 's best to dispose of every last shred of genetic material – ova , sperm , and any gestating alien life forms .
Why it fails : Giving birth to an Alien queen was just the sort of thing Ellen Ripley was trying to avoid when she jumped into a vat of boiling lead .
Little did she know that , in the hands of Joss Whedon and a handful of ethically - challenged scientists , even death is no match for the miracles of the reproductive process .
Between Lowell and Lawrence , Mass. , last Tuesday mid-afternoon , the temperature reached 102 degrees .
By the time I got to Boothbay Harbor , Me. , the thermometer had dropped 40 degrees .
To my surprise , the price of fuel had dropped too .
In my experience , gas is always more expensive where you ’re going than where you ’re coming from , unless you ’re going to Indiana .
At stations along the secondary roads in New York State , diesel fuel , which is what my pickup takes , was over $ 5 a gallon .
In Boothbay Harbor , it was $ 4.79 , and the lobster rolls were cheaper too .
At these prices , driving simply feels different .
For one thing , the margins of America ’s highways are turning into a used - car lot .
If gas stays this expensive , grass will soon be growing through the floorboards of the Range Rovers and Suburbans I saw parked  for - sale signs in their windows  at the ends of driveways .
I found myself wondering whether their fuel tanks were absolutely empty and whether , in fact , those vehicles would n’t be worth more as scrap steel  chopped and crushed and shipped to China .
What these gas prices really do is let you see through the illusion of shiny new cars .
One of the basic automotive laws is that nearly every vehicle is losing value from the moment it ’s driven off the lot .
As traffic slowed , and fuel - mileage dropped , through Portland , Me. , I looked out at the cars around me and could practically feel depreciation  economic rust  eating away at them , and at me too , and all the faster thanks to high gas prices .
My pickup was dwindling in value even as the value of the fuel in its tank was going up .
It was a puzzle , really .
It may have looked like we were all trying to get somewhere , there on I -295 .
What we were really doing was burning the gas in our tanks before it became too valuable even to think of burning .
I filled up before I left Boothbay Harbor , of course : 24 gallons , $ 118 .
My plan was to get home before I could n’t afford to .
I had driven to Maine to speak at a conference named in honor of Rachel Carson .
You can imagine how that felt .
The Moral High Ground does n’t live here anymore

Today ’s NY Times contains a story titled “ A Year Under Hamas Alters Life in Gaza ” about how things have changed in the Gaza strip since Hamas , the terrorist group , took over control of the territory from Fatah , a former terrorist group , by shooting their opponents in the knees and tossing them off buildings .
The US and Israel reacted immediately , of course , attempting to isolate the people and force them to turn on the new leaders by cutting them off from the world .
But , as anyone who has ever read “ Animal Farm ” knows , isolation only makes it easier for the leaders to control the situation , as now they control the flow of information as well as the means of government , becoming providers for the people .
Especially now that goods like food and fuel are scarce and Hamas controls everything being smuggled into the country ( which is everything ) through tunnels from Egypt .
And that taxes it , of course .
It ’s like the mob back in the prohibition days , controlling every aspect of business because of a failed policy on the part of the controlling authority ( in this case , the US and Israel ) .
So not surprisingly , life is n’t good .
The Israel and American blockade surely does n’t add to the quality of life , but inside the fences , the religious fundamentalists get to rule over the territory like their own , private West Texas compound .
“ The Palestinian criminal code says there should be no improper behavior in the streets , ” the new chief justice , Abed al - Raouf Halabi , explained in an interview , pulling the code book from his breast pocket .
“ It is up to judges to interpret what that means , ” he said .
“ For us that means no cursing , no drinking and no kissing in public .
In the past these things were ignored . ” …
Compared with a year ago here in Gaza , more women are covered , more men are bearded , Internet sites are filtered and non-Hamas public gatherings are largely banned .
With the Israeli closure greatly reducing the supply of fuel , spare parts and other vital goods , less sewage is treated and more fish are contaminated .
Gazans feel trapped and helpless .
Political dissidents also seem to disappear , discouraging those who may no agree with what the government is up to .
“ Everything that has happened here has been a terrible mistake , ” [ a store owner ] says of the election victory and subsequent takeover .
“ It is a mistake for Islamists to get into power .
But what can we do ?
Hamas is even stronger than a year ago .
They can take me and put me away whenever they want . ”
That is apparently what happened to Mohamed Zughbur , a Fatah supporter who was taken from his home two months ago by Hamas forces , imprisoned and tortured and accused of collaboration with Israel , according to Moustafa Ibrahim , a researcher for the Palestinian Independent Commission for Citizens ’ Rights .
It ’s the kind of thing that has always happened in dictatorial states where the often - elected leadership uses fear and a common , “ evil ” enemy to expand its authority and power to overwhelm the basic human rights of its people .
[ Ibrahim ] said that when his organization complained to the Hamas authorities , they pointed to the United States and the Guantánamo Bay prison ; a collaborator , they said , can not be treated with kid gloves .
Ouch .
That means that terrorist groups and fascist dictatorships are now using the United States of America – a nation once seen as a light of liberty , hope and opportunity the world over – as an example and inspiration and excuse for their evil ways .
And they ’re not even making a stretch in doing it .
Over the past seven years here in the good old US of A , an elected administration has used fear and a common , “ evil enemy ” to systematically subvert the rights and beliefs that make this great nation great , including making people disappear into a little prison camp on a communist island where they have no right to a trial and sometimes no right to even know why they are held with no chance of being released .
There is no doubt that some of the people held in Gitmo are vicious terrorists , but the fact is if they are , the evidence should bear it out and those folks should be tossed back in a hole forever .
But that sort of thing should be easy to prove or maybe that particular prisoner should not be there .
Thankfully , this past week , the United States Supreme Court tried to remind the administration that their power has limits and that the Constitution serves to remind us of our basic principles of human rights , separation of power and limited government control .
The issues that were weighed in Thursday ’s ruling went to the very heart of the separation - of - powers foundation of the United States Constitution .
“ To hold that the political branches may switch the Constitution on or off at will would lead to a regime in which they , not this court , say ‘ what the law is , ’ ” Justice Kennedy wrote , citing language in the 1803 ruling in Marbury v. Madison , in which the Supreme Court articulated its power to review acts of Congress .
The ruling , by the way , was 5 - 4 , with the “ conservative , ” constructionist judges ( who are supposed to believe in limited government , personal liberty , letter - of - the - law constitutional interpretation ) all ruling in favor of more government control , less personal freedom , a more closed and secretive government and to ignore part of the Constitution itself .
Gotta love that .
So now that the USSC has made its ruling – citing , just in case they forgot , the case that reminds us that the presidency is not above the law .
The administration will have to change their ways to come back into compliance with the the rule of law , right ?
After all , only dictatorships and their ilk ignore the rule of law when it does n’t go their way , right ?
You ’d think , but this administration is proceeding as if nothing happened and is trying to get new laws written .
Of course , since this is a ruling on the Constitution , one has to remember that the new legislation would have to be a constitutional amendment or it too would be shot down .
But at least this is almost over , right ?
I mean , this lame duck son - of - a- bitch has only a few months left to tear down 230 years of good will and the whole world is breathing a sigh of relief , the Democrat trying to replace him is opposed ot this sort of thing and the Republican has actually had a government strip him of his rights and dignities while keeping him in a tiger cage for five years .
So even he must agree that this is no way for the United States of America to operate .
Again , you ’d think , but …
“ The United States Supreme Court yesterday rendered a decision which I think is one of the worst decisions in the history of this country , ” McCain said to applause from a crowd of supporters in New Jersey .
“ Our first obligation is the safety and security of this nation and the men and women who defend it , ” he continued .
The Declaration of Independence , disagrees with him , of course , but why should a presidential candidate believe in that old thing anyway :
We hold these truths to be self - evident , that all men are created equal , that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights , that among these are Life , Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness .
–That to secure these rights , Governments are instituted among Men …
Sounds to me like securing rights is the primary function of government , but then again , what does Thomas Jefferson know , anyway ?
That was a long time ago .
Seriously , what has the Declaration done for us lately ?
But from a strictly modern perspective , our enemies are now using our tactics , perhaps it ’s time to rethink some of that foreign policy and make some changes .
Hamas is nasty company to be keeping and it is costing us the moral high ground we so desperately need to show the difference between us and the evildoers from whom we are trying to protect ourselves and all of civilization .
Just a thought .

Obama hits back at Bush over ' appeasement ' inference RAW STORY
Published : Friday May 16 , 2008
|
Print This Email This Senator Barack Obama hit back at President Bush today during a speech in Watertown , South Dakota for " dishonest and divisive " comments made by the president in Israel , which inferred that the presumed Democratic presidential nominee 's calls for talks with Iranian officials resembled appeasement with the enemy .
" The president did something that presidents do n't do , " Obama said , charging that Bush 's words targeted other Democrats , as well .
" He said that we were appeasers no different than those that appeased Adolf Hitler . "
" That 's exactly the kind of appalling attack that 's divided our country and alienates us from the rest of the world , " Obama added , before taking aim at McCain also for also " embracing Bush 's comments . "
Obama said , " That 's the kind of hypocrisy that we 've been seeing in our foreign policy , the kind of fear - peddling , fear mongering that has prevented us from actually making us safer , " adding that McCain had a " naive and irresponsible belief that tough talk from Washington will somehow cause Iran to give up it 's nuclear program and support for terrorism .
Obama also blasted McCain for linking him to Hamas , and noted that he has never called for talks with Hamas leaders , while the Republican presidential candidate once had .
The Illinois senator challenged Bush and McCain to take him on anytime on the question of patriotism , and noted the Iraq war 's effect on the global war on terror .
" If George Bush and John McCain want to have a debate on protecting America , that 's a debate I 'll be glad to have happen , " Obama said .
Fox commentators noted that Obama was sporting a flag pin during his speech .
In response , a McCain spokesman told Fox that Obama 's speech was a " hysterical " attempt to pretend he 's not liberal .
The White House has denied that Bush was referring to Democrats in his speech , but reporters have noted that behind the scenes before Bush spoke staffers had made references , and that it was n't until after Democrats loudly condemned the president for taking the presidential race to a foreign land that the denials were issued .
In short order , the controversy spilled across the presidential campaign .
John McCain , the Republican nominee in waiting , said Obama was showing " naivete and inexperience and lack of judgment " in his willingness to meet with U.S. foes .
Hillary Rodham Clinton then called Bush 's original comments " offensive and outrageous , especially in light of his failures in foreign policy . "
As the workday began stateside , Bush gave a speech to Israel 's Knesset in which he spoke of the president of Iran , who has called for the destruction of the U.S. ally .
Then , the president said : " Some seem to believe that we should negotiate with the terrorists and radicals , as if some ingenious argument will persuade them they have been wrong all along . "
" We have heard this foolish delusion before .
As Nazi tanks crossed into Poland in 1939 , an American senator declared : ' Lord , if I could only have talked to Hitler , all this might have been avoided . '
We have an obligation to call this what it is - the false comfort of appeasement , which has been repeatedly discredited by history , " Bush added .
With the president abroad and those seeking to succeed him campaigning at home , the transcontinental tiff signaled the early direction of the general election .
Bush seemed to assume the traditional lame - duck presidential role in trying to help the Republican nominee - in - waiting , and Obama tried to maneuver for advantage - and to show strength - while on the cusp of clinching the Democratic nomination .
McCain played his political role as well in tandem with Obama , notable for two White House hopefuls who are campaigning for a bipartisan governing approach free of the often divisive discourse in Washington .
By tradition , partisan politics comes to a halt when a U.S. president is on foreign soil , and Bush 's remarks led Obama to quickly cry foul .
The first - term Illinois senator responded to the comments as if they were criticism of his position that as president he would be willing to personally meet with Iran 's leaders and those of other regimes the United States has deemed rogue .
" It is sad that President Bush would use a speech to the Knesset on the 60th anniversary of Israel 's independence to launch a false political attack , " Obama said in a statement his aides distributed .
" George Bush knows that I have never supported engagement with terrorists , and the president 's extraordinary politicization of foreign policy and the politics of fear do nothing to secure the American people or our stalwart ally Israel .
In turn , White House press secretary Dana Perino denied that the Knesset remark was aimed at Obama .
In fact , the language is fairly typical for Bush speeches , and Gordon Johndroe , a national security spokesman for the president , said Bush was referring to " a wide range of people who have talked to or suggested we talk to Hamas , Hezbollah or their state sponsors " over a long period of time .
One such person most recently was former President Carter , who held talks with Hamas leaders , leading to criticism from Bush officials as well as Obama and McCain .
Even as the White House said Bush meant no dig at the Democrat , Perino could n't resist the opportunity to get in a small one .
" I understand when you 're running for office you sometimes think the world revolves around you .
That is not always true .
And it is not true in this case , " she said .
Meanwhile , in Columbus , Ohio , McCain said he took the White House at its word , but then he weighed into the spat himself , saying : " This does bring up an issue that we will be discussing with the American people , and that is , why does Barack Obama , Senator Obama , want to sit down with a state sponsor of terrorism ? "
Asked if Obama was an appeaser , McCain said Obama must explain why he wants to talk with leaders like Iran 's Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and added that Obama 's position was a serious error .
" It shows naivete and inexperience and lack of judgment to say that he wants to sit down across the table from an individual who leads a country that says Israel is a stinking corpse , that is dedicated to the extinction of the state of Israel .
My question is , what does he want to talk about ? "
Clinton , campaigning in South Dakota in advance of a June 3 Democratic primary , said Bush 's statement had " no place in any presidential address .
... " I have differences with Senator Obama on certain foreign policy matters , but I think we are united in our opposition to the Bush policies and to the continuation of those policies by Senator McCain . "
Clinton has criticized Obama in the past for his pledge to meet with prominent adversaries of the United States without precondition .
Although his political interest is keen , Bush has mostly tried to refrain from injecting himself into the presidential race .
He largely remained silent during the Republican primaries but appeared with McCain at the White House after the Arizona senator clinched the nomination and , since then , has talked up McCain frequently .
As for the Democratic race , the president typically avoids naming names , but he has publicly disagreed with the positions of the Democratic front - runners , including Obama 's expressed willingness to meet leaders of U.S. adversaries .
The debate over whether a president should directly negotiate with such leaders has been one of the most prominent issue differences in the race for the Democratic nomination .
Obama has said he would be willing to meet with heads of state in places like Iran , Cuba and North Korea .
Democratic rival Hillary Rodham Clinton has argued that those meetings could be used for propaganda and her first response would be outreach through diplomatic channels .
By criticizing Bush , Obama sent a signal that he 's ready to take on the sitting president and the incumbent party - and tried to counter the notion that Clinton would be the stronger Democratic general election candidate .
Democrats also are working to link the unpopular Bush to McCain at every turn as the public craves change , and even if it was n't directed at Obama , Bush 's remark gave Democrats an opening to claim more of the same .
" It is time to turn the page on eight years of policies that have strengthened Iran and failed to secure America or our ally Israel , " Obama said in his statement .
" Instead of tough talk and no action , we need to do what ( Presidents ) Kennedy , Nixon and Reagan did and use all elements of American power - including tough , principled , and direct diplomacy - to pressure countries like Iran and Syria . "
For their part , McCain and Republicans increasingly see Obama as their November rival and have been taking every opportunity to raise questions about his readiness to be a wartime commander in chief .
The GOP also hopes to make national security - historically a Republican strength - a focus of the campaign when the political terrain favors Democrats .
Indicating what 's to come , McCain said : " Peace through strength is the way we achieve peace in the world .
That 's the point .
I will debate this issue with Senator Obama throughout this campaign . " ( with wire reports )

There is very little information that can be gleaned with confidence about the authorship of the remaining opinions from the Term .
It does look exceptionally likely that Justice Scalia is writing the principal opinion for the Court in Heller " “ the D.C. guns case .
That is the only opinion remaining from the sitting and he is the only member of the Court not to have written a majority opinion from the sitting .
There is no indication that he lost a majority from March .
His only dissent from the sitting is for two Justices in Indiana v. Edwards .
So , that 's a good sign for advocates of a strong individual rights conception of the Second Amendment and a bad sign for D.C .
Backing up to February , there are two remaining cases ( both argued , like the guns case , by Walter Dellinger ) : Morgan - Stanley ( an energy regulation case ) and Exxon ( the maritime punitive damages case ) .
Six Justices have n't written from the sitting , making predictions very dicey .
The best guess is that Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Stevens are writing .
Justices Scalia , Souter , and Kennedy are unlikely because they had already written twice in a sitting before February .
Justice Ginsburg wrote twice in later sittings .
For April , there are four opinions remaining : Plains Commerce ( involving Indian tribes ) , Kennedy ( death penalty for child rape ) , Davis v. FEC ( campaign finance ) , and Giles ( a Confrontation Clause case ) .
Justices Scalia , Kennedy , and Alito have not written and therefore almost certainly have three of the opinions .
The most likely author for the remaining decision is Justice Souter ( who needs another opinion to take him to seven for the Term ) .
With the exception of Heller , these predictions have no genuine value .
They are just informed guesses and none says anything about the outcome of the cases .
The total fertility rate in Israel is currently estimated at 2.77 children born per woman , one of the highest rates in the world .
Ronit Haimov- Kochman , a gynaecologist at Hadassah Mount Scopus Medical Center in Jerusalem , recently led a team of doctors that successfully performed in vitro fertilization ( IVF ) on a 16 - year - old girl .
The patient , AH , had had extensive medical and surgical fertility treatment since the age of 14 .
Haimov - Kochman tells Ewen Callaway why she helped a teenager get pregnant – and why other Arab teens are likely to follow .
What was your team ’s initial reaction when AH asked for treatment for her infertility ?
Usually at this age we are approached by teenagers searching for effective contraception .
We had many reservations over infertility treatments of this very young patient .
We were fully aware of the obvious cultural gaps between the patient ’s world and ours .
However there were several moral , social , legal as well as medical aspects to these reservations .

Women who marry and conceive early tend not to complete primary education .
We were concerned over the patient ’s right to grow up and achieve basic formal education .
Adolescents generally are not authorised to sign informed consent to medical therapies .
Infertility therapies may be dangerous to the adolescent ’s recent and future health , Moreover , the impact of infertility drugs in adolescence is completely unknown , whereas teenage pregnancies have evidently more risks .
Was there pressure from the patient ’s family ?
In the conservative Arab society , the fertility of a woman plays a major social role .
The bigger the household , the more honoured the woman and the more respected and esteemed the husband and his family .
A recently - married adolescent couple is totally dependent on the husband ’s family in terms of income and residence , and thus particularly vulnerable to family pressure .
Adolescent brides usually quit high school and live with the husband ’s family .
So what contributed to your team ’s eventual decision to treat AH ?
Treatment of AH was based on the couple ’s decision to start therapy .
Respecting the patient ’s mentality and cultural norms , the patient ’s right for therapy , and its wide availability in Israel all contributed to our decision to treat the patient .
It is understandable that in a society with an exceedingly high fertility rate , where the major role of the female spouse is to bear and rear children , strong peer and family pressure is imposed on infertile patients – especially the young and less educated ones .
Teenagers are considered as minors by Israeli law , who are legally incapable of making independent decisions .
Still , on special occasions , such as in cases of termination of an unwanted pregnancy , adolescent consent is fully respected .
The dilemma of teenage autonomy has grown further when a teenage mother , as a parent and a guardian of her child , is authorised to give informed consent regarding an operation for her child , while she is not allowed to consent to fertility treatments or an appendectomy that she may need .
Legally speaking , laws are set for the rights of patients rather than the physicians .
Physicians may not abstain from delivering fertility treatment , whereas a patient ’s right to fertility treatment is well established .
Do you expect adolescent IVF to become more common ?
We hope that IVF and other fertility treatments will not be prevalent among adolescents , in order to give them their natural right to achieve proper education and maturity before parenthood .
But we are aware that in communities where girls tend to marry young and with the development of easily - reached IVF technologies , this phenomenon may expand .
Should there be legal or professional restrictions on treating adolescents for infertility ?
The European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology task force on ethics and law recently issued professional guidelines for physicians focusing on the welfare of the future - child in medically assisted reproduction .
The welfare of the mother - child was ignored .
Apart from health reasons that may carry a potential risk for the welfare of the future child , psychosocial factors may be significant as well .
However , the immaturity of the teenage mother has not been mentioned .
From our experience , it is obvious that as long as there is no law restricting treatment prior to the age of 18 , the majority of teenage patients will elect to go further and receive assisted reproduction technologies , mostly because of the socio-cultural reasons .
What are your personal thoughts ?
In the atmosphere of the Israeli multiculturalism , my position as a female physician touches the lives of many women in places where women are still suppressed and unprivileged under norms of religion and tradition .
I cannot help but cry out for their inequality and suffering .

Senator Obama faced journalistic sniper fire over words , he himself never said .
The video of Pastor Wright was played around the clock , news anchors were repeating the scenes over and over again and are still introducing the topic , whenever they can .
Hillary Clinton ’s farcical story about dodging sniper fire in Bosnia , told to underline her claim of experience and readiness to be commander in chief , has not received the same media attention at all .
Here ’s what Hillary Clinton said :
Here ’s what happened :
This deserves to be aired as much as the Wright sermons have .
But where are “ the best political team on TV and their colleagues now ?
This story merited four Pinocchio awards from the Washington Post Fact Checker , four Pinocchios represent a whopper !
Exclusive to STR
June 5 , 2008
While reading the Lew Rockwell blog , I noticed a mind boggling essay from the Libertarian Vice Presidential candidate Wayne Allyn Root .
The complete ravings are extraordinary and could serve as fodder for several columns , but I want to focus on what seems to be the heart of it : his belief that Muslim anger towards America stems not from perpetual intervention , but from their hatred of the American culture and lifestyle .
Here is the key statement and the ten reasons he lists to support it :
If America had never interfered in the affairs of any Arab country the Islamic extremists would still be trying to destroy us .
They hate us because we 're not Islamic .
They hate us because we 're a Democracy .
They hate us because we allow dissent .
They hate us because we treat our women like human beings and equals .
They hate us because we let young girls go to school .
They hate us because we believe in progress .
They hate us because we celebrate music , art , dance , literature , and sexuality .
They hate us because we believe in equality of races .
They hate us desperately because we actually allow Jews to survive and thrive in our society .
They hate us because we do n't murder gays in the street for the ' crime ' of being gay .
The first commandment bluntly states that the Muslims hate whatever is n't Islamic .
This is interesting since Muslim countries also have large numbers of non-Muslims who do n't appear to be hated .
There 's also the small matter of Muslims not hating a whole host of other non-Muslim countries that share one common trait : they are n't trying to colonize the Muslim world .
The second commandment assures us that ' Democracy ' is why Muslims hate America .
This one has the same problem as the first commandment , namely that Muslims do n't hate the democracies that refrain from murdering and torturing large numbers of Muslims .
Perhaps there 's a connection ?
The third commandment is that they hate America for allowing dissent .
Yes , in America no one would ever be tasered for asking one of their overlords a question .
There are also the countless Iraqis who have been imprisoned , tortured , exiled , and massacred simply for expressing their ' dissent ' with the occupation .
The fourth commandment states that Muslims hate women being treated as ' human beings and equals . '
If he means ' equality ' derived from government , laws , and whatnot then I 'll mention that the Lebanese constitution declares that Tous les libanais sont ' gaux devant la loi .
( All the Lebanese are equal before the law ) , and there are women in the parliament .
Interestingly enough , this has n't prevented the Americans and Israelis from repeatedly invading Lebanon .
Perhaps they hate the Lebanese for their freedom ?
The fifth commandment claims Muslims hate that American kids go to school .
Before America had even finished ' liberating ' the Iraqis in April 2003 : U.S. soldiers killed at least 13 Iraqi civilians who marched on a school west of Baghdad to demand the troops leave the building and get out of Iraq , doctors and witnesses said on Tuesday .
In case it is n't clear , the Iraqis are angry that invaders are occupying their land ( and schools ! ) .
They are not angry that the invaders also have schools .
The sixth commandment alerts us to the Muslim hatred of ' progress . '
This is a rather nebulous thing to hate , but I 'll point out that the Iraqis had electricity , fuel , and water before America invaded and destroyed the place .
Deindustrialization certainly is n't a good definition of progress .
The seventh commandment stipulates that ' music , art , dance , literature , and sexuality ' are hated by Muslims , and therefore must be absent from the Muslim world .
Leaving aside the improbability of a billion people not having an interest in either reading or sex , can anyone watch this and say it is n't a celebration of dance , music , and sexuality ?
The singer is Lebanese and her brother died fighting the Israeli occupation of Lebanon in the 1980s .
Please note that no one in the audience appears to hate her freedom .
The eighth commandment insists that Muslims hate America for believing in the ' equality of races . '
This only makes sense if you view it as America believes in treating all the colonized races ' from the American Indians to the Filipinos , Vietnamese , and Iraqis ' as equally subhuman .
All other interpretations are simply too ludicrous to consider .
Can anyone honestly claim that the American government views Arab lives as equal to American ones ?
The ninth commandment is the venerable chestnut that the Muslims hate America for allowing Jews to live .
If the Muslims want to kill Jews , would n't they start with the ones living in their own countries ?
Would the 20,000 Jews living in Iran still exist if Muslims were genocidal madmen ?
The final commandment informs us that Muslims hate America for not murdering gay people .
What has Matthew Shepherd been up to recently ?
I 'm mystified that anyone with opposable thumbs could still believe that someone hates them for their freedom .
Surely even Americans are able to understand that people do n't like being bombed and tortured ?
They are n't angry about what their bombers and torturers wear , or eat for lunch .
They 're angry about the endless interference in the affairs of their countries .
In spite of all that , I 'd like to congratulate the Libertarian Party for choosing such a charming man to help carry their electoral banner .
What could do more to convince people of the futility of voting than to have the party of liberty advocating perpetual war ?
Chicago
SENATOR HILLARY CLINTON should probably be forgiven for not remembering the course on the state Constitution that she would have had to take as an eighth grader in Illinois .
But had she remembered it , she would have known that Senator Barack Obama was not ducking his responsibility in the Illinois Senate when he voted “ present ” on many issues .
Unlike Congress and the legislatures of most other states , each chamber of the Illinois Legislature requires a “ constitutional majority ” to pass a bill .
The state Senate has 59 members , so it takes 30 affirmative votes .
This makes a “ present ” vote the same as a no .
If a bill receives 29 votes , but the rest of the senators vote “ present , ” it fails .
In Congress , in contrast , a bill can pass in either the House or the Senate as long as more people vote for it than against it .
If 10 people vote in favor and nine against , and the rest either vote “ present ” or do n’t vote at all , the bill passes .
It can actually pass with just one vote , as long as no one votes no .

In the Illinois Senate , there can be strategic reasons for voting “ present ” rather than simply no .
A member might approve the intent of legislation , but not its scope or the way it has been drafted .
A “ present ” vote can send a signal to a bill ’s sponsors that the legislator might support an amended version .
Voting “ present ” can also be a way to exercise fiscal restraint , without opposing the subject of the bill .
As regular readers know , I ’m a very happy user of ING Direct .
They provide my checking services , my savings services , and all of my online bill pay services .
They even allow me to set up sub-accounts so that I can save for specific goals .
In my opinion , ING Direct is the best of the full - service online banks , and I ’m a happy customer of theirs .
Because they offer all of these useful tools , over time , I ’ve begun to use ING Direct as my primary budgeting tool .
I can set aside money in specific small pools , automatically transfer money back and forth , set up automatic bill payments , and so on .
These tools allow me to effectively manage my money .
A Step - by - Step Guide to Full Service Online Banking
Step Zero : Get An Account
You do n’t necessarily have to have ING Direct as your bank to do the following .
You merely have to have a bank that has online checking and savings access and online bill pay .
Many banks offer this – Washington Mutual and E*Trade Financial are two well - known national banks that offer similar services , and your local bank may offer it as well .
Switching to a new checking account is easier than it might sound .
I ’ll quote the steps you need to take from an earlier post :
1. Open the new checking account .
The first step is the most obvious one .
Open the account and get the information you need : account number and routing number .
Order checks if you need them .
In other words , be prepared .
Your new bank may also need the information for your old checking account so you can transfer money from the old account into the new .
2 . Make a list and check it twice .
Make a detailed list of all automated withdrawals and deposits from your current primary checking account .
The best way to do this is to simply watch the account for a period of two to three months so that you pick up as many of these as possible .
3 . Balance your checkbook .
Make sure you ’ve accounted for everything outstanding so there are no nasty surprises during the transition .
Figure out what you have in the old account down to the cent so that you can avoid overdraft dangers .
4 . Switch over all deposits and withdrawals at once .
I find this is easiest to do by switching over the deposits a bit earlier than the withdrawals , so that there is money already in the new account when deposits begin to be set up .
I ’m also incredibly careful about such things .
5 . Leave the old account open for a while with a balance in it to catch any missing deposits or withdrawals .
Even though it might feel like the balance in the old account is just sitting there wasting time , it ’s actually there to protect you against your own poor memory .
Just be patient and give it several months ; you might surprise yourself .
6 . Close the old account .
Be sure to leave a correct address behind .
You might also want to end other services at that bank , such as a safety deposit box .
If you ’re switching to ING ’s Electric Orange checking , it may be useful to skip step # 6 and leave the old account open , especially if there are no fees on it .
I ’ve kept my old checking account open for two conveniences – cashing checks with a teller and the ability to write paper checks ( on the rare occasions when I do this any more , maybe once every three months ) .
Step One : Set Up Automatic Bill Payments For Monthly Bills
For every regular monthly bill you have , you can set up an automatic bill payment for that bill so you do n’t have to worry about paying it on time .
It ’s quite simple .
First , click on the “ Electric Orange ” tab on the top , then click on “ Free Bill Pay . ”
Add a new business ( with the name , address , and account number ) by clicking on the appropriate link , then add that bill in below .
You can specify the amount , the date to pay it , or the regular date to pay it .
Once you ’ve done this , the next scheduled payment shows up in your basic checking account screen , so you can easily see what ’s coming up and when .
Step Two : Set Up A Sub - Account For Each Irregular Bill and Savings Goal
What about the other bills , the ones that only come around every several months and seem to always crunch the budget , like homeowners ’ insurance or car insurance ?
For those , it ’s useful to set up a sub- account to slowly set aside money so that when the big bill comes , you ’re ready .
Here ’s how .
Once you ’re logged in , in the upper left , click on the “ Open Account ” option .
You can see it clearly in the picture above .
Choose to open a new savings account on the next screen
The “ Open Now ” link in the image above is where you should go .
From there , the process is really straightforward – you can call each account you create whatever nickname you like to identify it as a distinct fund : an emergency fund , a “ house maintenance fund , ” a “ vehicle replacement ” fund , a “ house insurance ” fund – whatever works for you .
After that , you should set up an automatic transfer into that account .
You can do that by clicking on the Transfer Money tab along the top .
Then , fill out the information below .
As with the automatic bill payments , these will appear on your default checking account view so you can quickly see the money that ’s going to be automatically withdrawn from your checking account .
My recommendations ?
I leave the amounts for the regular but varying monthly bills in my main checking account – things like the cell phone bill and the electric bill just come straight out of the checking .
Other bills , especially large ones with longer periods like car insurance and homeowners ’ insurance , are handled by having a tiny weekly deduction from my checking account into a special fund just for that purpose .
For example , our car insurance is about $ 400 every six months , so I transfer $ 15 a week into an account just for that .
This way , I do n’t really notice that $ 15 going away , but when the big bill comes , it ’s not a panic time – the money ’s just sitting there .
So I transfer it back into my checking and pay the bill , all online .
Step Three : Pay Your Bills As They Come In
After this is all set up , your only real responsibility is to pay the bills as they come in .
I usually pay all outstanding bills once a week , on Sunday afternoon .
Keep on top of these bills , so that you ’re not dinged with a late fee .
With many of the bills handled now by automatic transfer , you wo n’t have that much to deal with – I usually just have one or two bills a week to pay attention to .
Step Four : Use Your Debit Card as a Mastercard and Use It For Regular Purchases Like Groceries
If you wish to completely centralize all of your spending until you get things under control , ING ’s Electric Orange checking service will issue you a debit card that also functions as a Mastercard .
If you ’re just getting your budgeting under control , it may be useful to spend a few months just running all expenses through that card , so you can keep a careful eye on what you ’re really spending .
Once you have a strong grip on your spending , you can move on to using other mechanisms for your expenses , but sticking with a check card for a while is a great way to make sure your spending is under control .
These steps , all together , create a centralized view of your day - to - day finances and also form the basics of a budget .
This is exactly how I do things right now in terms of day - to - day money management .
I use ING Direct to do all of those things , and it ’s done wonders for keeping my money in line .
This plan requires you to do some basic math with a calculator .
Since you ’re already at the computer , using the simple calculator tool on your computer for addition and subtraction should do the trick quite nicely .
I tend to use Excel because I usually already have it open in order to update my net worth calculations .
Good luck !

Soldier is my most played class in TF2 and I ’d like to think I am pretty good at it .
Soldier was my favourite class in TF1 : if you were good , you could take out a whole team and cap the flag on many maps by yourself .
TF2 is a bit different : you need a medic and you ca n’t really do a whole lot to most of the classes .
There are a lot of issues I have with the class .
Some of them may be a weakness in the soldier class , while others may be other classes being too strong , but the points are usually a mix of both .
The main issue with soldiers is they ’re worse than a demoman in almost every situation .
Whether or not this means the demoman is overpowered or the soldier is underpowered is a larger question on the balance of the game , but nevertheless there are distinct cases where soldiers are clearly and irrefutably weaker .
1 . You ca n’t kill sentry guns
So soldiers are supposed to be this well rounded offensive class that is capable of dealing with all sorts of obstacles .
I guess when Valve designed the game , they thought soldiers should be able to deal with challenging obstacles like staircases and hills , and just those two , because as soon as you run into a sentry gun it ’s basically game over .
It takes three unanswered rockets to kill a sentry gun .
It ’s 3 / 4 of your clip and requires at least 3 seconds .
If an engineer is hiding behind his gun with a dispenser , and they are not against a wall , you are not going to kill the gun .
You may get two rockets in , but an engineer is capable of repairing both his dispenser and his sentry in that time span , so again , you ca n’t kill either one .
The biggest problem though is that rocket splash damage does n’t go through sentry guns .
Or other people , too , for that matter , but that ’s another issue entirely .
So an engineer can duck behind his gun and heal his sentry while you shoot it ineffectually , without fear of being killed .
The only real solution is to shoot the ground near the sentry gun and try to kill the engineer first , then take out the gun , but this is problematic at a range that allows you to outrange the sentry .
First of all , rockets are slow , so the engineer can dodge the rockets if they ’re smart .
If they do n’t crouch behind their gun , dodging is easy at range .
If you ’re close enough that they ca n’t dodge rockets in time , then you ’re in sentry range and taking fire .
Keep in mind here I ’m talking about well placed sentries , not ones built near doorways or something similar .
Think the elevated platform or covered enclave at the 2nd capture point of the 2nd map of Goldrush .
There is no way you can hit an engineer or the gun without being shot at ; at best you ’re going to have to shoot a wall near them , but the healing from their dispenser will take care of that damage and you ’re still not going to kill the sentry .
A laughable “ strategy ” for killing sentry guns is apparently firing at the sentry until the engineer runs out of metal .
I do n’t know what game the people who suggested this strategy have been playing , because apparently they did n’t notice you get 20 rockets to start with now and that ’s it .
Assuming you have full ammo by the time you reach the sentry gun , you still require 6 seconds every time you want to fire 4 rockets at the gun .
That ’s 26 seconds for all 20 of your rockets , during which time no one can come interrupt you in your sentry destroying quest .
Dispensers generate 40 metal every 5 seconds and hold 400 metal max .
I ’m not sure of the exact numbers but each rocket hit requires approximately 25 metal to repair .
Over 26 seconds a dispenser will regenerate 200 metal .
So the engineer has about 800 metal to play with including the 200 he ’s got on him .
That ’s 32 rockets worth of damage that can be healed ( assuming my numbers are correct , which they might not be ; comments are welcome if you know the exact numbers ) .
How many rockets do you get as a soldier ?
20 . So , slight problem there .
So basically , there ’s some maps where you run into a sentry gun and you are totally useless .
Even if you are ubercharged running straight into a sentry ’s coverage , blowing your whole clip will basically only let you kill the engineer with rockets .
Then you have to whip your shovel / shotgun out to finish off the gun , or suffer through the painfully slow rocket reload which is great for wasting that 10s of uber .
And if you planned on making it out of there alive , well , too bad for you because most likely your ubercharge will run out just as the gun goes down , and chances are the rest of the enemy team is waiting for that to focus fire and kill you .
Why the demo is better :
Demos are better at sentry killing because they can burst damage and because their splash damage goes through sentry guns .
They have two options : fire 3 stickies at a gun and detonate them all at once to kill the gun , the engineer , and the dispenser at the same time , or fire grenades directly at the sentry gun and barring the annoying bug where your grenades just bounce off engineer buildings , the splash from 2 grenades will kill the engineer and then the gun is easy pickings .
Demos can also lob grenades at elevated platforms around corners and have them land near the gun , whereas a soldier cannot , which allows the demo to kill the guns I mentioned on Gold Rush 2 - 2 as well as numerous other locations where sentries are built on elevated ground .
The best counter an engineer has against a demo is to wrench / shotgun the stickies away , but using the wrench for that is a quick way to die and the demo can fire stickies faster than you can shoot them away , so really it ’s just a stall tactic rather than a counter .
2 . You ca n’t kill Heavies with a Medic unless you crit
A Heavy and a Medic is one of the most difficult combos to take out in TF2 .
If they ’re the two players are good , spies are ineffective , and on some maps sniping is effective or possible to take out heavies .
Especially on Gold Rush , where you can just duck behind the cart , sniping becomes a very difficult counter against heavies .
Heavies can also cause a sniper to flinch constantly with fire from across the map , so there may be further balancing issues required there .
As for the soldier , well , soldier cannot kill a heavy with a medic without crits , period .
According to tf2 wiki.net , a splash damage rocket does about 60 - 80 damage at close range and only about 40 - 50 damage at medium range Heavies have 300 health , and when you add in the +50 % hp Heavies get 450 health .
Your rockets do 240 - 320 damage total at close range and 160 - 200 damage total at medium range .
Then you have to reload .
So at close range it would take at least 6 splash rockets to kill a buffed heavy , and at medium range it would take at least 9 splash rockets .
Now that ’s assuming the medic just buffs the heavy and then leaves .
If he continues healing the heavy at a rate of 20 health per second and you fire around twice per second the situation gets even worse .
To fire 6 rockets at close range takes at least 4 seconds ( due to reload ) which means the heavy does n’t have 450 HP , he has 530 HP ( 450 + 20HP/s * 4s ) .
At medium range under the same assumptions , it takes 9 seconds to fire 9 rockets , which means you have to deal 630 damage to the heavy ( 450 + 20HP /s * 9s ) .
Good luck with that .
Now some of you might be thinking ok , that ’s with splash rockets but what about direct rocket hits ?
I ’ll touch on this more later , but direct rocket hits are harder to get than they sound .
At medium range , direct hits are out of the question .
Even with reduced speed , hitting a heavy directly with rockets is hard if they ’re constantly strafing .
You ’re also going to be taking fire , and maybe it ’s just me but it seems like heavy damage has been upgraded in the recent patch , so it seems like you go down even faster than before to heavy fire .
At close range , you ’re only going to get off 4 direct hit rockets on a heavy before he kills you if the heavy is terrible .
Assuming he ’s not , you ’re toast .
At long range soldiers suck .
Period .
Rockets are slow .
The heavy is n’t going down at long range unless he stands perfectly still and lets you shoot him with direct - hit rockets repeatedly .
This is not a situation that arises frequently .
To top that all off , according to tf2 wiki , a direct hit rocket deals 112 damage ( which seems low to me , but I ca n’t really test right now so I ’ll go with it ) .
4 direct hit rockets on a heavy will deal 448 damage .
How much HP do buffed heavies get ?
450 . 448 < 450 .
Doh .
Granted you could still reload and shoot off one more rocket to kill the heavy , but again , that ’s 3s of fire and a heavy with a medic under fire for 3s essentially has 510 HP .
Ugh .
Unless you get a magical 225 damage splash crit , that heavy / medic is not going down before you do no matter how many times you shoot him .
Why the demo is better :
I ’m going to start sounding like a broken record here , but the reason demos are better than soldiers at heavy killing is because they can burst damage and because their grenades fire faster than rockets .
Their grenades also do n’t lose damage over distance .
You can lob 4 - 5 stickies at a heavy and unless he spins his gun down and runs , he ’s basically dead .
Even if he does do that , your stickies have cut off the medic from him , so the medic has to back off , or take a long route around them to continue healing the heavy .
You can det those stickies and then continue placing more to try to kill the heavy and your damage output is greater than the medic can heal .
Plus you have 8 stickies and 4 regular grenades to get the job done .
So 12 rounds vs 4 rocket rounds and a shotgun .
Grenades also fire slightly faster than rockets , and are capable of doing more damage , so the medic has less time to heal the heavy before you have to reload .
In my experience , a heavy with a medic can be killed in 3 - 4 direct hits with the grenade launcher .
If you run out of regular grenades , switch to stickies .
As an added bonus , if you get a crit grenade and the medic is standing close enough to the heavy , you can kill the medic with splash damage , since demoman splash damage goes through people and engineer buildings .
To top it all off , if the medic hits his ubercharge , your stickies can still launch the heavy or medic out of uber range even if the heavy is firing or has his gun spun up at the time .
Soldiers on the other hand are totally worthless when a heavy / medic ubers .
3 . Your splash damage does n’t go through people / engineer buildings
Soldier crits are everyone ’s favourite punching bag .
True , there is some element of luck involved , but it ’s not like that luck aimed the rocket for you .
If there ’s a crowd of people and you fire off a crit into it , you might initially feel pretty darn good as that rocket leaves your launcher , but you ’ll be surprised to see that you kill just one person .
If a person at the front of the crowd is hit with the crit rocket , they absorb the full 270 damage , and none of the splash damage goes through to nearby enemies .
So one guy eats the crit and everyone else tries to kill you .
True you could splash the ground , but then you ’re only dealing 225 damage , not 270 , and if people are buffed and you crit splash them they just go flying in different directions , which makes landing a follow up hit even harder in some cases .
Even if we ignore the case of critical hits , a direct rocket hit will only injure the person you shot , not anyone around them , which is aggravating in and of itself since you only get 4 rockets .
Lack of splash through buildings is also the main reason why soldiers suck against sentry guns .
Engineers just duck behind them and laugh at you .
Why demomen are better :
Demo splash goes through people and buildings .
A crit grenade will kill pretty much everyone around your target .
It ’s common to see 2 kills per crit and not uncommon to see 3 kills per crit if people are bunched at bottlenecks as in Gold Rush / Dustbowl .
Also , demos can take out sentry guns with regular grenades fired directly at the gun .
They ’ll get the engineer too .
4. 90 % of the time rockets do n’t do full damage , they do splash damage
Unless you are the god of leading shots and aiming , and your opponents do n’t know how to dodge , you are going to be hitting people with splash rockets .
This means rockets for all intents and purposes will not be doing 112 damage per hit .
They do either 70 or 50 .
Looking only at direct - hit rocket damage is like looking only at sniper headshots and spy backstabs ; it ignores the other cases in which you will be doing damage .
Did anyone notice the spy knife damage buff in the last patch ?
Previously spies could never critical strike with their knife from the front , and it did something like 30 damage .
I thought this was fair since a backstab was a one - hit kill , but evidently Valve thought differently and buffed the spy knife damage so it does about 50 damage per hit now .
So Valve understands that even though full charge sniper headshots and spy backstabs are one hit kills , not every hit is going to be a full charge headshot or one hit kill .
Evidently though they do not understand that rockets do n’t do 110 damage per hit , they do either 70 or 50 .
Go figure .
Why demomen are better :
This one ’s a toss up .
Demomen can be hard to play because you have to be good at leading and aiming .
My friend CdTrix taught me a trick as a demo though : just aim upwards with your grenades so you lob them .
Grenades are incapable of getting direct hits as soon as they hit the ground .
This is a change from TF1 where you could bounce grenades off the ground into people and was actually a good strategy in some cases since the bounce actually took some forward velocity off the grenade and made it possible to sort of create a “ screen ” of grenades where a scout or other fast class could n’t run past for fear of collsion .
As soon as I started aiming upwards with my grenades , I started getting significantly more hits than when I was just aiming straight ahead ( due to grenades not landing on the ground first ) .
The hit box also seems to be pretty large for lobbed grenades as well .
And do n’t forget they do full damage at range , so you can lob a fair distance and still be quite lethal if your grenades strikes anything .
5 . Your rocket damage decreases with distance
No one gets hit at long range with rockets unless they are terrible players .
Rockets are slow .
If you see one coming , you move out of the way .
This is known as dodging .
Good players know how to do this .
Long distances are not really the concern here , it ’s the medium distances that really kill you .
You ’re already ca n’t get direct hits and so you ’re relegated to splash damage , and then to add insult to injury your splash damage decreases if you ’re any distance from your target .
This is in addition to the above point regarding killing engineers hiding behind sentries and heavies .
Why demomen are better :
Grenade and sticky damage does not decrease with distance .
Other than crits and snipers , they ’re the only class with this distinction .
QED .
6 . Self rocket damage is too high
Soldiers have great mobility because they can rocket jump .
Too bad it takes off 1 / 4 of your health .
I hate to compare to TF1 , but just as a reference , in TF1 soldiers had 200 armor and 100 health .
A rocket jump would cost you about 40 armor and 10 health .
Not a big deal .
In TF2 , though , a single rocket jump takes off a quarter of your health , and puts you in easy - to - kill range for a number of classes from demos to scouts .
The other big problem with rocket self - damage is that an easy counter to soldiers is to just hug them .
Being backstabbed by a spy is bad enough , but now with increased front melee damage , I get spies stabbing me in front for 50 damage .
If you rocket them direct hit , you take about 50 damage as well , so now you ’re down to half health … and the spy is n’t dead yet .
He ’ll stab you again for 50 damage .
Now you ’re at 50 health and another rocket self - hit will kill you .
Another stab will kill you .
You ca n’t run away .
No matter what you do , you ’re dead and there is no counter .
So much for the mighty soldier .
The same problem is true with scouts , snipers , or any other class that just runs up to you , which is n’t as hard as it might sound on most maps .
Keep in mind the soldier is the 2nd slowest class in the game , and is only slightly faster than a heavy .
Backpedalling incurs a 10 % speed penalty , so if you are backpedalling against a heavy that is n’t firing his chain gun , he actually moves faster than you .
Essentially once someone gets close to you , you cannot get them away without incurring some self - damage , and it ’s not a trivial amount of damage either .
1 / 4 of your health per hit is a lot , and considering it takes 2 non -crit rockets to kill any full - health enemy in the game , you ’re really only playing with half your full health , or about 100 HP .
If your enemy takes off 100 damage of your life , you ’re basically dead unless you whip out the shotgun and can kill them before they kill you .
As far as I know none of the other classes have this problem .
It ’s not so much that rocket self - damage on its own is a problem , it ’s that combined with soldiers ’ inability to get people away from them once they are close , resulting in you killing yourself along with the enemy .
On all maps this is a losing situation ; your respawn timer is longer if you ’re on defense than the opposing team , and most likely you ’ve killed a “ lighter ” class such as a scout or engineer than you , a soldier .
Once people are close to you , you no longer have 200 health , you essentially have 100 health .
Why demomen are better :
This one ’s pretty close .
Demos take pretty much the damage damage from self - splash as soldiers do .
They have slightly less health too .
Where demos have the advantage is in using stickies to cut an enemy off from even getting close to you .
If someone ’s rushing you , you can just look down fairly close to yourself , drop a few stickies , and continue backing away .
Your enemy has to go around the stickies or die , as 2 stickies is enough to kill any unbuffed class in the game other than a heavy , and a heavy ca n’t catch a demo even if he ’s backpedalling .
So demos can really avoid having people get in close on them , whereas soldiers have a bit of a harder time since you have to score a direct rocket hit to bounce someone , whereas demomen can deny a fairly large area to an attacker quickly and effectively with sticky grenades .
7 . Your are constantly running out of ammo
I ’m still not sure why Valve found it necessary to reduce the soldier rocket count from 40 to 20 .
All it seemed to change was that I ca n’t do anything without running out of rockets now , or I ’m constantly looking around for ammo .
This is exacerbated by the system Valve uses for ammo collection .
You have 4 rockets in the clip but only 16 in reserve , and when you pick up a weapon , the ammo only goes into your reserve .
This makes perfect sense , but it also means that you typically only get 1 or 2 rockets when you pick up a weapon after a kill .
The reason being , you most likely used 3 or 4 of your rockets to kill your enemy , but by the time you grab their weapon you ’ve only reloaded 2 of your rockets from your reserve into your clip , not 4 , so you go from say , 2/14 ( clip / reserve ) to 2/16 rockets .
This takes 2 seconds to do with reload time , and if you want the full 4 rockets you have to reload for 4 seconds .
Maybe it was Valve ’s intention to make soldiers wait around 4 seconds after every kill to collect the full ammo amount .
Net result is the first time you kill someone and do n’t wait around their corpse for 4 seconds you are down 2 rockets at the least and potentially 3 or 4 if you were closer to the weapon when it dropped and accidentally picked it up .
That does n’t sound like a lot , but it ’s 10 - 20 % of your ammo reserve you are missing out on .
That makes it sound a bit worse , no ?
The other big thing is that your rockets push dropped weapons away , so when you kill someone , their weapon potentially goes flying into a corner across the map or into enemy firing lines .
This makes it rather difficult to pick the ammo up as you kill things without you yourself being killed , and you slowly run out of rockets .
Granted other classes are affected in the same way by the ammo pick - up system , but realistically because their ammo reserve is larger , it is n’t as much of a problem .
The rocket change was immediately felt by myself and others , and I ca n’t count the number of times I ’ve run out of rockets since then , without even realizing it just because I ’ve been backpedalling and laying down suppressing fire against a superior number of enemies or I ’ve just been under constant pressure as I kill things and have n’t had the opportunity to pick up ammo .
I ’m not Valve so I do n’t know why they made the rocket capacity change , but apparently it was to reduce doorway spam on some maps .
I would argue they ’ve done nothing but cripple soldiers as an offensive class .
Doorway spam is still a problem since most maps are set up to provide ammo resupplies to the defensive team , and they are close to their respawn and ammo closet .
On top of that you usually have a few dispensers around to replenish your ammo on defense .
These conditions have led to doorway spam not being fixed at all ; grenade spam is just as much a problem as it was before , but soldiers are stuck always looking for ammo .
Why the demoman is better :
You get stickies and regular grenades .
So twice as many explosives .
Both are replenished when you pick up ammo , so if you fire a mix of stickies and grenades , you can replenish both with one ammo pick up .
Maybe they should give the demo 20 grenades and make stickies and grenades fire from the same reserve …
A soldier having to rely on the shotgun is stupid if the rocket launcher is his main weapon .
Switching to the shotgun in combat before you ’ve exhausted rockets can be effective but also takes a full second now ( they fixed the “ quick shotgun shot ” when switching weapons in the last patch ) and lets the enemy get in more shots than you .
It ’s also like telling snipers to switch to their SMG to finish people off to conserve sniper rounds because they only have 25 of them ; it ’s not really a fair suggestion .
The rocket launcher makes the class , not the shotgun .
Soldiers are not engineers .
8 . You are effective at exactly one distance : medium range
Close range you self - splash .
Long range your rockets get dodged .
Medium range is the only range at which you can kill things without getting hurt , but it also means your rockets do less damage .
Ugh .
This seem stupid to anyone else ?
Even at medium range , other classes may still be more effective than you .
The other day I was killed by a spy with a revolver at medium range because he was strafing around higher ground on Gold Rush .
You have to stay at medium range against a spy due to stab issues , and that revolver is pretty accurate and does about 60 damage per hit at medium range .
They also reload faster than you .
Now maybe it ’s just me , but I do n’t feel like spies should be better than soldiers at medium range even if they do have higher ground .
Scouts and engineers also give soldiers huge problems at medium range if they have a slight terrain advantage .
Why demomen are better :
Demos are better at medium and long range because their damage does n’t decrease over distance .
Your stickies make it easy to cut off terrain where enemies can run at you .
You have enough speed to actually outrun things , unlike a soldier .
At close range , it ’s pretty even .
At medium range , I ’d give the demo the edge because of pipes , and at long range I ’d give the demo the advantage because of damage .
9 . Soldier mobility sucks
Rocket jumping eats a quarter of your HP , excluding falling damage .
For all intents and purposes you are the slowest class in the game .
Yes , heavies are slower , but only marginally ; you basically move at the same speed .
Everyone can outrun you if they want to , which essentially means you are always fighting on someone else ’s terms .
Why demomen are better :
I ’m not sure if this is a recent change or if it ’s always been this way , but demomen can sticky jump ridiculous distances .
Gold Rush has no forward - moving respawns , so on the 2nd and 3rd map the respawn walk begins to matter significantly .
As a demoman on either of these maps , you can sticky jump from the respawn to almost the first cap point .
The travel time is ridiculously longer for a soldier , not to mention it consumes more ammunition and you require a med pack due to the damage you ’ve taken .
You also have to be moving backwards to get maximum rocket jump range whereas demomen can place a sticky and detonate it on their terms while still being able to see what they ’re sticky jumping into .
OK this sucks , but how do we fix it ?
Offering a bunch of complaints about problems without offering any solutions is pretty lame , so I ’ll try to give some suggestions here .
My main concern is that demomen are just as good as soldiers in the majority of situations and better than soldiers for offense and defense a lot of the time .
Each class should have a specific role to play and should have advantages or disadvantages in certain matchups ; one class should not dominate the majority of match ups and pull even in the rest .
If one class is clearly better in almost all situations , then why bother playing the inferior class ?
Fix # 1 : Increase damage
The soldier needs to be able to kill things that have a lot of HP or that are being repaired / healed .
A sentry gun should not be unkillable by a soldier , and yet killable by other classes ( heavy , demo , etc. ) without aid .
It puts the soldier at a disadvantage .
Either increase the damage so a soldier can kill a sentry gun after say 6 hits , or increase the amount of metal required to repair guns dramatically .
800 metal is a lot of metal to burn through if you ’re a soldier with 20 rockets , and I showed above why it may not even be possible if my assumptions were correct .
A heavy with a medic is a trickier situation .
That ’s two players working together , and so one player should n’t be able to kill them .
Two soldiers can kill a heavy , so it ’s balanced enough .
I would n’t have a problem with this if it were n’t for the fact that an individual demoman can kill a heavy , and a soldier can’t .
Direct rocket hits should kill light ( 125 HP ) classes at close range , to prevent hugging and melee mutual kills .
Fix # 2 : Reduce self - splash damage
If soldiers are n’t going to move faster , then make it so they wo n’t die if people melee them twice and they shoot themselves twice .
This would also let soldiers rocket jump more than twice without putting themselves in one - shot range of basically every other class in the game .
Fix # 3 : Change rocket splash to go through other players / objects
If Valve is n’t going to increase damage if rockets over distance or damage to sentry guns , let us at least kill the engineer .
Again , the demo is stronger in this situation than a soldier , which would be ok if they were n’t already so much stronger than the soldier in almost every other situation .
Fix # 4 : Increase soldier movement speed slightly
This is mainly so other classes can’t hug you as easily , which gives you more time to backpedal and fire rockets to stop their forward movement without splash damaging yourself to death .
Other classes can still catch you , but not quite as easily , and they ’ll take more damage doing so .
Tying it all up
I ’m sure there are other possible fixes to the points I mentioned .
Not everyone is going to agree with the points I made .
But other than “ crit rockets ” , does anyone have any problems with the soldier class ?
Anyone feel they ’re overpowered ?
If so , feel free to leave a comment , because I have n’t seen anyone who thinks that .
Most feel demos are overpowered , and I feel pyros and heavies are a bit strong right now , but I have n’t talked to anyone who thinks soldiers are too strong .
What exactly is the soldier ’s role supposed to be ?
The demoman was supposed to be for defense and support , but it ’s turned out on the majority of maps that a demoman is more useful than a soldier in a large number of situations .
If that ’s the case , there ’s no reason to play soldier ; anything a soldier can do a demo can do better .
In which cases should he be better than a demo , and in which cases should he be worse ?
That ’s a pretty subjective question , and one that only Valve can really answer definitively ( since they make the game ) but right now it seems like the soldier ’s role is to play second fiddle to the demoman , waste rockets on sentries and feed points to heavies .
If Valve does decide to patch the soldier and address some of these issues , I hope they do it to the base soldier class , not with soldier unlockables .
That just makes the unlockables mandatory instead of bringing the soldier to where he should be by fixing the underlying problems with the class .

Maybe they did n't mention the candidate name because Dr Ron Paul has quietly been chipping away at McCain 's delegate lead .
The Primary delegate process did n't stop once the mainstream media turned their head away and gleefully ran off to the next race .
Local Paul supporters have not only gotten several hundred delegates ( hopefully to push for a brokered convention ) but have pushed Paul policies into the republican party .

It 's insulting to refer to the Democratic Party as Democrat Party .
You do n't see many in the mainstream media calling the Republican Party the Republic Party .

This website is about edible insects , but it's also about inviting people to open their minds and have some fun .
Lots of folks have a psychological block about eating insects , and while that 's their right , a whole new world of taste sensations is waiting .
And by the way , eating insects is a lot better for the planet , so there 's that to think of too .
Since most of humanity has eaten insects for most of our history on the planet , NOT eating insects is more unusual than eating them .
And here you thought it was the other way around .
How many countries can you name in five minutes ?

Is your sex life good or bad ?
If it 's either one , it 's not good enough because it 's not great .
Do you want to improve your sex life ?
Take the necessary steps to become great at it now .
If you are happy , know all you need to know about sex and have no problems in the bedroom , thats great !
Stop reading and refer somebody that may need help .
If you are confused , unhappy , or curious then this is for you .
You 've been having sex with your partner long enough to the point you feel pretty confident that you know what you 're doing however you still have a lack of interest for some reason .
Sex is just another pass time you do together .
It 's equivalent to going to dinner or watching a movie which is OK because there is sexual communication there .
But its not great .
Its a routine .
And while you learn to live life in this manner , you know deep down inside you want more and your partner most likely but quietly also wants more .
You know there are ways to create the best sex between you and your partner but your not sure what it is , where to start or what to do .
So what can you do ?
You know you can ask her what would she want to be done differently so she could enjoy it more but that process plays on your pride because you want to be able to discover it on your own or you may feel she 's not going to tell you because she has n't mentioned it already ?
However , the trick is to try new things , show that you want to learn new things to do with her and get her involved in the process .
You want her reaction so it confirms if your doing things she likes and desires .
Also do not make it too big of a deal .
You want it to go as smooth as possible .
If it becomes too big of a deal , then there is too much pressure on both of you which can make for a bad / worse situation .
Here are a few tips you can try :
Eliminate a set routine :
If you and your partner have been sleeping together for a while , the same routine can make sex extremely stale .
Spice it up a little and try different times of the day , different positions , unusual locations , and new techniques .
If these things are done spontaneously , it really adds to the enjoyment .
Unusual locations can really create an adrenaline rush if you get my drift ( public places - do n't get arrested ) .
Look for outside help :
Once you become more open - minded to learning new things , your eyes open up and you will see all the tips and tricks that are out and available to you .
It will blow your mind , realizing how much you do not know about sex .
Become more involved in the action : lying there like a sack of potatoes , that will not work .
Men are going to have an orgasm regardless but the woman orgasm requires some effort and you need to make sure
Take charge .
The biggest mistake men make is not realizing you need to make sure her needs are met no matter what and first .
That will not happen if your not active and letting her do all the work .
If your it happens .
Now you may be saying to yourself that is unfair and you should n't have to do all the work but remember , the more and more she enjoys herself and have a great time , the more excited you will be and the more she will be into it and want to please you even more .
The mind is extremely important :
For guys , sex is physical for the most part .
However , for women thats not the case .
Of course it 's physical to a degree but its the mind that gets her going , continues it and ends it for women .
Have you ever seen a man that you thought was just out right non attractive and a woman that was too beautiful for her own good and you say , " how did that happen ? "
Well it 's because he simulated the mind .
For a woman there is no greater turn on than being desired and adored .
Show how much you care about her at all times and you 'll be amazed how much that pays off for you .
She will want to have sex much more often , become enthusiastic about it and go the extra mile to make sure your extra extra happy .
Being committed to improving your sex life between you and your partner is going to create togetherness and hopefully provide you with the best sexual times of your life and that way you do not have to ask yourself , " Is your sex life good or bad ? "
Ready , Set , Go .........

German news weekly Stern reported on Wednesday that invasive employee monitoring is common practice at other retailers , including Penny , Netto , Norma , Edeka , Plus , REWE , Hagebau and Famila .
As was the case with Lidl , the retailers routinely printed up pages of notes detailing intimate aspects of their employee 's lives .
The magazine said that , nationwide , detective agencies have sprung up which specialize in helping employers spy on their staff , including " detailed written observation reports . "
Stern quoted the manager of a supermarket discounter who said that the detective agencies are extremely competitive .
" Many try to set themselves apart by offering additional services , " the manager was quoted as saying .
" I was offered such protocols more times than I can count . "
The manager confirmed that spying efforts were intensified when there were suspicions that certain employees were attempting to organize a union .
" Every measure is used in order to prevent a works council from forming , " the source told Stern .
Workers outside the retail sector also have reason to fear for their privacy .
According to a study by Mummert Consulting , every third office computer in Germany is subject to some sort of monitoring .
Germany 's federal association of detectives also admitted that 60 to 70 percent of their contracts come from companies , and that the most common request is for the detective to observe employee behavior .
Senator Sanders has earned the support of 1832 pledged delegates , about 45.256 % .

The National Identity Scheme will hold data on everyone over 16 in Britain
The government should limit the data it collects on citizens for its ID card scheme to avoid creating a surveillance society , a group of MPs has warned .
The home affairs select committee called for proper safeguards on the plans for compulsory ID cards to stop " function creep " threatening privacy .
It wants a guarantee the scheme will not be expanded without MPs ' approval .
The Ministry of Justice said it had to balance protecting the public with protecting a right to privacy .
The Home Secretary Jacqui Smith told BBC One 's Andrew Marr
Show that many people welcomed the use of devices such as CCTV cameras .
" I know that when as it was then , the Labour - controlled council in my constituency , funded CCTV cameras in the town centre to help to protect people when they wanted to go out and have a night out without being blighted by anti-social behaviour , people supported it .
" So I know for example with the DNA database that tens of thousands of crimes have been solved because of the use of the DNA database . "
' Ambiguity '
The National Identity Scheme is due to start rolling out later this year , and will eventually hold details on everyone in Britain over the age of 16 .
The select committee said in a report : " It should collect only what is essential , to be stored only for as long as is necessary .
" We are concerned ... about the potential for ' function creep ' in terms of the surveillance potential of the national identity scheme .
" Any ambiguity about the objectives of the scheme puts in jeopardy the public 's trust in the scheme itself and in the government 's ability to run it . "

However , " we seek the further assurance that any initiative to broaden the scope of the scheme will only be proposed after consulting the information commissioner and on the basis that proposals will be subject to parliamentary scrutiny in draft form , " it said .
Committee chairman Keith Vaz said there could be " potentially disastrous consequences " if data was mishandled .
HAVE YOUR SAY ID cards are not a problem in my opinion .
The main problem is the Government spying on people who have n't done anything .
FJ , Gloucestershire
Therefore , he said , the government should draw up a " broad outline of contingency plans " to deal with potential security breaches in the ID cards programme .
The report referred to the loss of two discs containing the personal details of 25 m people last year .
" The minister 's assurances that the government has learned lessons , though welcome , are not sufficient to reassure us or , we suspect , the public , " it said .
The report also urged the government to set up new controls on the National DNA Database to prevent " unnecessary invasions of privacy " .
It said the system should be changed to make it easier for people whose DNA is on the system to challenge its retention .
' Public trust '
Mr Vaz said : " What we are calling for is an overall principle of ' least data , for least time ' .
" The public do n't have much choice over the data held on them by public bodies so they must be confident about how it is being collected , stored and used , otherwise we are in danger of becoming a surveillance society . "
The government takes the protection of personal data extremely seriously
Ministry of Justice spokesman Information Commissioner Richard Thomas said he welcomed the report .
" It is essential that positive action is taken to ensure the potential risks of a surveillance society never manifest themselves in this country , " Mr Thomas said .
" Every possible step must be taken to ensure public trust in the way that personal information is collected and stored . "
The report also called for a public consultation on the powers of public bodies , such as councils , to use surveillance powers .
In April , there was widespread criticism when it emerged that Poole Borough Council had carried out surveillance on a family accused of cheating the school catchment system .
The chairman of the Local Government Association , Sir Simon Milton , said he understood there were concerns over the use of surveillance .

A Ministry of Justice spokesman said : " The government takes the protection of personal data extremely seriously and is committed to ensuring that information is shared in a safe and secure way .
" It is necessary to find a balance between protecting the public and protecting a right to privacy .
" Data sharing is not only essential to delivering public service but also has an important role to play in tackling potential criminal activities . "
The government said it would respond fully to the report in due course .

人と何かやりとりをするとき，メールでやりとりをするよりも，直接面と向かって話し合った方が，より正確なニュアンスを伝えることができるというのは，みんなが知っていること。
だから， 「正確なニュアンスを伝える」という点において，メールは弱いメディアだと言える。
でも，メールにはさらに困った点がある。それは，「ニュアンスが伝わった」と勘違いしやすいということ。メールはニュアンスを伝えにくいけど，頑張れば伝わるに違いない！
……って頑張っても，結局，伝わらないんだよね。
ある社会心理学者による面白い実験がある。
Egocentrism Over E - Mail : Can We Communicate as Well as We Think ?
被験者を集めてペアにして，用意された文面を使ってふたつの異なるニュアンス（「真面目に」「皮肉っぽく」）を相手に伝えるという作業を行ってもらう。被験者の半分はメールを使って，もう半分はテープレコーダーを使う。どちらも文面を加工してはだめ。ただ，ニュアンスを伝えやすいと思った文面を選んでいい。
伝える側には，ニュアンスが正確に伝わったかどうかを予想してもらう。受け取った側は，どんなニュアンスだったかを当ててもらう。
結果はこんな感じ 。
（おおっと，縦軸の基準が 50 % なのに注意しよう ）
実線が 「 伝える側の予想」で，点線が「 受け取った側の正解率」。
メールの場合に正解率が低いのは，しょうがないと思うんだ。問題なのは，正解率が低いにもかかわらず，「伝える側」が，ちゃんと伝えられたって勘違いしていること。
ああ，だから，メールで微妙なニュアンスを伝えなきゃならなくなったときに，このグラフを思い出してみるといいよ。きっと伝えたいことの
56 % ぐらいしか伝わらないってね……。

The Python standard library contains a function called thread.get_ident ( ) .
It will return an integer that uniquely identifies the current thread at that point in time .
On most UNIX systems , this will be the pthread_t value returned by pthread_self ( ) .
At first look , this might seem like a good value to key a thread local storage dictionary with .
Please do n’t do that .
The value uniquely identifies the thread only as long as it is running .
The value can be reused after the thread exits .
On my system , this happens quite reliably with the following sample program printing the same ID ten times :
import thread , threading def foo( ) : print ' Thread ID : ' , thread.get_ident ( ) for i in range ( 10 ) : t = threading .
Thread ( target=foo ) t.start ( ) t.join ( )
If the return value of thread.get_ident ( ) was used to key thread local storage , all ten threads would share the same storage .
This is not generally considered to be desirable behaviour .
Assuming that you can depend on Python 2.4 ( released 3.5 years ago ) , then just use a threading .
local object .
It will result in simpler code , correctly handle serially created threads , and you wo n’t hold onto TLS data past the exit of a thread .
You will save yourself ( or another developer ) a lot of time at some point in the future .
Debugging these problems is not fun when you combine code doing proper TLS with other code doing broken TLS .
WASHINGTON  President Bush used a Rose Garden news conference Tuesday to pronounce the state of the economy anything but rosy and blame Congress for blocking his solutions .
The president 's dual goals — assuring Americans he understands their plight and challenging Congress to act — were on display as he cited evidence of " tough times " and recited his proposals that lawmakers have blocked .
When questioned , however , Bush made clear he would block congressional proposals as well — to stop filling the nation 's Strategic Petroleum Reserve , enact a farm bill that includes increased food aid and add help for the unemployed to a spending bill for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Bush acknowledged that Americans are hurt by rising food and gas prices and a depressed housing market , but he refused to call the economic situation a recession .
" The average person does n't really care what we call it , " he said .
" The American people are looking to their leaders to come together and act responsibly , " Bush said .
" I do n't think this is too much to ask , even in an election year . "
Democrats agreed , but they accused Bush of being the one blocking action .
" All of a sudden , he 's realizing the problems , " said Sen. Chuck Schumer , D - N.Y .
" The president and the White House have repeatedly ignored repeated shots across the bow of our economy .
Rising foreclosures , falling home prices , withering consumer confidence and record oil company profits — none of them are being addressed . "
The war of words came one day before the Commerce Department was to release first - quarter statistics on economic growth .
A negative growth rate , if it continued into the current second quarter , could signal that the economy is in recession .
Reporters have tried to get Bush to use that word , but he refused again Tuesday .
" Economists can argue over the terminology , " he said .
" These are difficult times , and the American people know it , and they want to know whether or not Congress knows it . "
He accused lawmakers of " playing politics " and " inactivity on big issues . "
Bush criticized Congress for blocking his proposals on expanding U.S. energy production , reducing subsidies to wealthy farmers and overhauling federal mortgage lending agencies .
He said he would consider proposals to lower gas prices , but he did not endorse Republican presidential candidate John McCain 's plan for a gas tax holiday this summer .
He opposed calls by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and others to stop buying oil for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve as a way to reduce gas prices .
" I have analyzed the issue , and I do n't think it would affect price , " Bush said .
" If there was a magic wand to wave , I 'd be waving it , " Bush said .
" There is no magic wand to wave right now .
It took us a while to get to this fix . "
In a more conciliatory tone , Bush said he would work with Congress to increase Iraq and Afghanistan veterans ' educational benefits .
Democrats plan to attach that and other domestic spending , including extended jobless benefits , to the war spending bill next month .
Bush said he would not accept anything over $ 108 billion .
The news conference — Bush 's first in two months — came as attentions are on the presidential race .
Bush limited his comments on the contest to predicting McCain would win and continue his policies of free trade and fighting terrorism .
On other issues , the president : • Avoided criticism of former president Jimmy Carter 's recent meeting with Hamas leaders in the Middle East .
He said he had not talked to Carter beforehand and did n't know the details of any conversations administration officials held with him .
He blamed Hamas for undermining peace talks with Israel .
• Defended his decision to withhold information from Congress until last week on North Korea 's alleged role in building a nuclear reactor in Syria that was bombed by Israel .
He said 22 lawmakers were briefed after the bombing in September but only now was the " risk of retaliation " reduced sufficiently to speak openly of North Korea 's alleged involvement .
• Said the war in Afghanistan is being won despite slow progress against the Taliban .
" We are in a global struggle against thugs and killers , " he said .
" Is it worth the fight ?
In my judgment , yes , it is . "

About the Show
Mind of Mencia
Carlos Mencia shows no mercy as he skewers current events and culture , unleashing his one - of - a- kind observations in the studio and out on the street .
Click to viewApple 's bought itself a chip company , P.A. Semi , that could make chips for future iPods and iPhones .
The company was founded by Dan Dobberpuhl , lead designer of Alpha chips , who last year announced a 64 - bit dual core processor that is said to be about 300 % more efficient than the nearest competition , using only 5 to 13 watts at 2GHz .
Advertisement
Products using the chips wo n't arrive for a year , at least , but we can assume that Apple would n't spend $ 278 million without some plans to use 'em soon as it made sense , and I 'm sure Intel and ARM are n't stoked .
The negotiations , which finished recently , took place in The Steve 's home .
Owning its own chip design is an interesting move .
While the iPhone 's had a lot of off the shelf componentry , it makes sense that working on its own internal hardware could yield better devices .
Or a PowerPC repeat .. which is the architecture I believe that the above processor is built on .
More research on that chip shows how it achieves such power efficiency .
From Ars : " For instance , the chip sports over 25,000 clock gates so that clock pulses to different regions of the processor can be shut off dynamically to save power ...
All of the PA6T 's major on - die components have their own separate clock and voltage domains , so that the L1 , L2 , DRAM controller , I/ O subsystem , and each of the two cores can all be placed in different low - power states independently of one another . "

Of course , the chips in portable such as an iPhone and iPod ( as Forbes speculates ) would n't be running so fast as the chip above .
While it 's unlikely they 'd use that dual core 64 chip in Macs , given the Intel switch was so recent , it 's my guess that P.A. Semi has a unannounced mobile chip that Jobs lusts after .
Stands to reason , although Owen at Valleywag believes that the lack of economic scale for Semi makes it more likely that the buy is for IP to be implemented by others , as a bargaining chip .
Regardless of tactics , the unnamed chip would have to be very efficient to best other offerings .
Intel 's mobile platform , Atom , by comparison , can do 0.8 watts of usage at 800MHz , and VIA has a 0.1 watt solution that runs at 500MHz .
ARM , designer of the current iPhone chip , is boasting that they can do a 0.25 watt A9 chip with multicores at 1GHz .

Historically , P.A. Semi was trying to be the chip provider for Macs around the time they chose to go for Intel , and it is reported that Dobberpuhl was furious when they went x86 , thinking the Intel talks were just a bargaining chip .
Some think that P.A. Semi lost its chance to be a brand name like AMD or Intel , but clearly , being under the brand name of Apple is n't half bad .

As such , some brothels have endeavored to offer their clientele something more than just a stained mattress and a glassy - eyed companion .
Many , in fact , go above and beyond to make your whoring experience downright magical .
As with all things , whorehouses must adapt and change with the times .
Prostitutes must become better , stronger and more resistant to disease .
It 's free because the dirty , dirty nookie is subsidized by all the people who will be watching you at home on their computers .
That 's what the cameras are for .
So while performing the act , try not to think of the thousands of subscribers , their sweaty buttocks irreparably staining their swivel chairs and their greasy , Cheeto - dusted fingers gumming up their keyboards , occasionally pausing to make a screen cap of you mid-coitus to save as their desktop wallpaper .
The good news is if you feel like dipping your wick in the muddied waters of a Czech prostitute at this establishment you can pretty much do it for free .
The bad news ?
Despite the potentially creepy incestuous nature of the name , it 's actually a play on Big Brother , which is to say this Prague brothel is under video surveillance at all times .
5 Bordels Mobiles de Campagne
If one word is synonymous with the French , it 's whores .
Ask anyone from Europe or every province in Canada except Quebec .
It 's only natural then that , during times of strife , say a war , the French are n't about to give up their whoring just to save their own asses .
During the first and second World Wars as well as the Algerian War and the Indochina war , mobile whorehouses , basically just large trailer trucks with about 10 whores per truck , were set up to service French soldiers who could n't take time away from being shot at to go back to a town and find an old fashioned brothel .
Continue Reading Below Advertisement
According to our friends on Wikipedia , these were officially organized by the army , meaning at some point in time , someone in the French military basically held the rank of pimp , which is probably the coolest thing anyone in the French military has ever done .
In fact , see that image at the top of this entry ?
That 's not a stock photo .
The approach to whoring was so popular , there are still traveling whore vans that roam the French countryside today offering up illicit services that you barely have to get off your ass to receive .
Like this , but slightly more French .
We 're not about to make any jokes at the expense of the French military fighting prowess or their skills at achieving victory and not surrendering , but if we were , we 'd make them in such a way as to suggest a whole army of Frenchmen were apparently too busy getting the clap to bother saving their own asses from , say , the Nazis .
Not that the clap is n't wonderful , it 's just that much sweeter if you can get it during peace time .
So we hear .

Scott McClellan ’s new memoir on his White House days is harsh .
The decision to invade Iraq “ goes to an important question that critics have raised about the president :
Is Bush intellectually incurious or , as some assert , actually stupid ? ” the former White House press secretary writes .
“ Bush is plenty smart enough to be president .
But as I ’ve noted his leadership style is based more on instinct than deep intellectual debate . ”
In 1999 , at a hotel suite “ somewhere in the Midwest , ” McClellan recalls the Bush mind when dealing with rumors that the then - Texas governor had used cocaine .
Writes McClellan : “ ‘ The media wo n’t let go of these ridiculous cocaine rumors , ’ I heard Bush say .
‘ You know , the truth is I honestly do n’t remember whether I tried it or not .
We had some pretty wild parties back in the day , and I just do n’t remember . ’
“ I remember thinking to myself , How can that be ?
How can someone simply not remember whether or not they used an illegal substance like cocaine ?
It did n’t make a lot of sense . ”

An RAF pilot crash - landed a £ 69 million fighter jet at 130 mph after apparently forgetting to put the wheels down .
The state - of - the - art Eurofighter Typhoon careered down a runway without its landing gear down and experts are now investigating how the accident could have happened .
The pilot and the co-pilot , from 17 Squadron , were on a training exercised in California and miraculously walked away from the high - speed crash unhurt .
The plane , which has a top speed of 1,500 mph , was flying in to the China Lake air base .
A Ministry of Defence spokesman said last night : " The damage to aircraft is still to fully assessed and as a Board of Inquiry has been convened it would not be appropriate to comment further until investigations are complete .
Scroll down for more ...
Crash - landing :
The state - of - the - art Eurofighter Typhoon careered down a runway without its landing gear down
" There 's no evidence at present to suggest the airworthiness of the aircraft has been compromised and the aircraft therefore remains safe to fly .
" We are pleased to say that neither the pilot nor anyone else was injured in this incident . "
Engineers will examine the plane to see whether it is safe to fly back to Britain or whether it should be returned to the UK on board a carrier .
None of the other 48 Typhoons have been grounded with any landing gear problems .
The Eurofighter has a warning system to alert the pilot if wheels fail to come down .
All the RAF Typhoons are based at RAF Coningsby in Lincolnshire with their primary task the defence of British air space .
Some are due to be sent to Iraq and Afghanistan to replace older Tornados and Harriers .
An RAF insider said told The Sun last night : " Everything points to the pilot forgetting to lower the wheels , which does happen from time to time . "
Pushed to the brink of collapse by the mortgage crisis , Bear Stearns Cos. agreed -- after prodding by the federal government -- to be sold to J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. for the fire - sale price of $ 2 a share in stock , or about $ 236 million .
Bear Stearns had a stock - market value of about $ 3.5 billion as of Friday -- and was worth $ 20 billion in January 2007 .
But the crisis of confidence that swept the firm and fueled a customer exodus in recent days left Bear Stearns with a horrible choice : sell the firm -- at any price -- to a big bank willing to assume its trading obligations or file for bankruptcy .
" At the end of the day , what Bear Stearns was looking at was either taking $ 2 a share or going bust , " said one person involved in the negotiations .
" Those were the only options . "
To help facilitate the deal , the Federal Reserve is taking the extraordinary step of providing as much as $ 30 billion in financing for Bear Stearns 's less - liquid assets , such as mortgage securities that the firm has been unable to sell , in what is believed to be the largest Fed advance on record to a single company .
Fed officials would n't describe the exact financing terms or assets involved .
But if those assets decline in value , the Fed would bear any loss , not J.P. Morgan .
MIAMI , Florida ( CNN ) --
An illegal immigrant dishwasher who lost $ 49,000 to the U.S. government as he tried to take it home to Guatemala will get some of the money back , his attorney said Wednesday .
Pedro Zapeta , an illegal immigrant , managed to save $ 59,000 while working as a dishwasher for 11 years .
Pedro Zapeta was " very , very happy " when he learned about a federal appeals court ruling that says he is entitled to recover some of the money , said attorney Robert Gershman , who handled the financial end of Zapeta 's case .
Zapeta was carrying $ 59,000 in cash when he was stopped at a security checkpoint at Fort Lauderdale - Hollywood International Airport in 2005 .
He told authorities he was returning home to Guatemala with the money he had saved working illegally as a dishwasher over 11 years .
But federal law requires that anyone leaving or entering the country with $ 10,000 or more must declare it .
Because Zapeta had not done so , he was detained , and his money was seized .
The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled Monday that the judge who fined Zapeta applied an incorrect standard in determining the amount to be forfeited .
The appeals court ordered a hearing to set a new fine .
" I am extremely happy , " Gershman said .
" Even though he is not a citizen , it shows he has equal rights . "
Gershman has said Zapeta , who does not speak English , was not trying to conceal the money but did not know the law .
Zapeta had paid taxes on the earnings , he said , and under legal guidelines should be fined at most $ 5,000 for failing to report that he was traveling with the cash .
Circuit Court Judge James Cohn instead fined Zapeta $ 49,000 , all the money he was carrying over the $ 10,000 limit .
" The government always acted as if the money was their own , " Gershman said .
" They acted almost entitled to it .
But it 's not their money .
It was Pedro's , and the [ appeals ] court affirmed that . "
Zapeta said last year that he had saved the money to build a house for himself and his family in his home village in the Guatemalan mountains .
He returned to Guatemala this year under the threat of deportation , but his lawyers continued to argue that his fine was excessive .
Federal prosecutors in Miami did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the decision or on whether they will appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court .
As Zapeta 's case was publicized , U.S. residents donated money to him , and Gershman set up a trust .
It has received about $ 15,000 in donations , he said .

Illinois man claims largest known diamond
The largest diamond in the known universe has a new owner , or more correctly , its first owner .
Frank Speener , a 53 year - old graphic artist and photographer from Peoria , Illinois , filed a formal declaration of legal claim with the United Nations to become the recently discovered super mineral ’s first owner .
While Speener filed his claim in July of 2007 , he withheld news of the announcement pending an exhaustive investigation of any prior claim .
Illinois man claims largest known diamond
The diamond , estimated at 10 billion trillion trillion carats ( that ’s a one followed by 34 zeros ) and measures 2,500 miles across , is actually the crystallized white dwarf star BPM 37093 located approximately 50 light years from Earth in the constellation of Centaurus , next to the Southern Cross .
A white dwarf is the hot core of a star , left over after the star uses up its nuclear fuel and dies .
This particular object is made mostly of carbon and is coated by a thin layer of hydrogen and helium gases .
For more than four decades , astronomers have thought that the interiors of white dwarfs crystallized , but obtaining direct evidence became possible only recently .
Speener is basing his claim in part on the Outer Space Treaty , formally known as the Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space , including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies , adopted in 1967 by 98 countries of the United Nations .
Speener is quite serious about his claim .
“ It ’s no joke , ” he said , “ There is nothing in the law that prohibits private ownership of any celestial body .
It ’s just something that ’s not done everyday .
I just wanted to be the first to do it . ”
While Speener is the first private citizen to claim the super diamond , he is not the first to claim a celestial body .
In 1980 a declaration to claim title of the moon was filed with the United Nations , United States , and Russian governments by Nevada entrepreneur / promoter Dennis Hope .
According to Hope ’s website , www.lunarembassy.com , over 3,000,000 people from around the world have purchased property on the moon and other extraterrestrial locations .
Speener said that the primary reason for his claim is to draw attention to the astounding number of discoveries in all fields of science , and especially astronomy and space exploration .
“ There is so much out there just waiting for us , ” he said .
“ We have walked on the moon and landed vehicles on Venus , Mars , Saturn ’s moon Titan , and even a comet .
We have navigated deep space probes that have left our solar system , and we have looked deep into space to see the very beginnings of our universe through the Hubble telescope floating in space .
How can you not be totally amazed at that ? ”
When asked what he intends to do with his new super gem , Speener said , “ I do n’t what to do with it , but I would like find a way to use it to help people .
A diamond that size could probably pay off the national debt , or , at today ’s prices , at least buy a whole tank of gas . ”
“ My friends like to joke with me saying that I have it all figured out because while everyone else is trying to figure out a way to take it with them , I already have it waiting when I get there , ” Speener added .
As far as what he may actually do with his claim , Speener said that he will just have to wait and see what the future holds .
After a few weeks when it seemed the harvest in the United States was careening toward disaster , some glimmers of good news emerged on Monday .
The government said recent floods were likely to damage the corn and soybean harvest less than feared , and it also reported that farmers had planted more corn than previously expected , which should bolster output .
“ This will allow a little breathing room  assuming we do n’t have inclement weather during the rest of the growing season , ” said Daniel W. Basse , president of AgResource , a consulting firm in Chicago .
Corn prices , which have repeatedly hit new highs this year , fell sharply Monday to $ 7.25 a bushel after the report from the Agriculture Department .
Wheat , which had been moving up in the general enthusiasm for commodities , also tumbled .
Soybean prices fluctuated but moved above $ 16 a bushel to a new high on supply worries .
James Frederick was in Manhattan cycling west in the Prince Street bike lane on a recent morning when a green Ford parked in the lane forced him to swerve into the narrow roadway where cars and vans were rushing past .
“ It ’s kind of scary because the cars next to you just keep going , ” said Mr. Frederick , 49 , a messenger who lives in the Bedford - Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn .
“ The city just put this lane in a few months ago , but it ’s not respected by drivers . ”
On streets clogged by pollution - emitting cars , buses and trucks , New York City ’s quest to establish reasonably safe cycling paths by adding to its roughly 300 miles of bicycle lanes has been welcomed by cyclists .
But the lanes are often battlegrounds between cyclists and drivers who seem undeterred by the clearly demarcated paths .
Although city regulations forbid cars from blocking bike lanes  a violation that carries a $ 115 fine  those rules are routinely ignored by drivers who use the lanes as parking spots , loading zones and places to pick up passengers .
Such maneuvers have enraged cyclists who say they are unlawful , rude and dangerous .

As John noted the other day , Douglas Feith is one of the most deceitful war architects , a difficult distinction to attain considering the company .
On " 60 Minutes " this Sunday , Feith was confronted by Steve Kroft with all the " miscalculations " he made as one of the primary enablers of the administration 's disastrous march to war .
** For those of you who may have forgotten , General Tommy Franks is on record calling Feith " the stupidest f*cking guy on the planet . " **
Download Download
It 's quite remarkable that Donald Rumsfeld of all people -- in a memo Feith calls " the Parade of Horribles " -- predicted exactly what the " downsides " to war would be .
Even more remarkable is that it seems he took every step necessary to fulfill his own doomsday prophesies .
Literally every single one of these has come to fruition .
Kroft summarizes some of them : * the possibility that the U.S. could become so absorbed with its Iraq effort that it would pay inadequate attention to other serious problems ; * that war could cause more harm and entail greater costs than expected ; * that it would not go on for two to four years , but eight to 10 years ; * that terrorist networks could improve their recruiting and fundraising as a result of the U.S. being depicted as anti-Muslim ; * that Iraq could experience ethnic strife among Kurds , Sunnis and Shia ; * the war could damage America ’s relationship with allies and its reputation in the world community .
Feith 's response ?:
" We certainly understood that these are the things that might happen .
That 's why we wrote them down .
Well , at least you wrote them down .

You know how sometimes your toast does n't quite pop out of the toaster fully ?
And because your judgment is a little impaired that early in the morning , you decide to jam a fork in there to dig it out only to be electrocuted and rushed to the hospital ?
Sure , we have all been there .
However , Freddie Yauner , the dude behind " The Moaster , " will not have to worry about that anytime soon because he has set the record for the " highest popping in toaster the world " according to the Guinness Book of World Records .
Using the power generated by a high - pressure CO2 gas system and mechanical ram , Yauner managed to get his toast to pop up about seven feet into the air - which was enough to set the record .
However , that figure was restricted by the height of his ceiling , so he will try and re-set the record tomorrow with an attempt conducted outdoors ( although I doubt that it will reach heights like those portrayed in the image above ) .
Why build a toaster that pops that high , you ask ?
According to Yauner , " Everyone loves it when a toaster has a good pop to it , so I thought this was the logical next step , to create a new space in the market . "
Indeed , you have n't had a good piece of toast until it has picked up a bit of grime from the floor and the ceiling .

BERLIN , Germany ( CNN ) --
A former top - level German politician has invented what he calls a " suicide machine " for terminally ill patients who want to die .
Roger Kusch says terminally ill people should not have to travel to another country to fulfil their death wish .
" It is the most bearable method for those with a death wish , " Roger Kusch told CNN at a presentation of the machine .
The device is a modified perfusor , a machine normally used to inject medicine over a long period of time , and Kusch has installed a button that allows the patient to set off the mechanism .
Kusch believes that way the patient is technically killing himself , protecting doctors who would assist by mixing the toxins and setting up the device .
According to Kusch 's method , the suicide machine would administer an anesthetic and a lethal dose of potassium chloride , which would lead to death within minutes .
German politicians , the medical community and especially churches are outraged by Kusch 's presentation of the killing machine .
What do you think about the suicide machine ?
" It is against the spirit of our ethics , the spirit of our ethical tradition , the spirit of the Christian image of a human person and against the spirit of our law , " Wolfgang Huber , the head of Germany 's Lutheran Church , told CNN .
Huber says society must help terminally ill patients deal with their pain rather then accepting suicide as an option .
" To those who criticize me , I say : it is none of your business , " Kusch said angrily when confronted with the criticism .
He says churches and politicians are using phony and cynical arguments and that he believes a majority of Germans have already accepted assisted suicide as an option .
" There are people who are suffering , and who can't deal with the pain anymore , and I want to help those people . "
The presentation of Kusch 's machine comes as Europe is engulfed in a debate about assisted suicide , sparked by the apparent self - killing of Chantal Sebire in France on March 19 .
Sebire suffered from a rare facial tumor and had petitioned French courts and the French government to allow doctors to put an end to her life .
She was found dead shortly after losing her case in France 's top court .
Like in many other European countries , actively assisted suicide is illegal in Germany and doctors who help terminally people die face jail .
Many Germans travel to neighboring Switzerland where assisted suicide is not punished .
Kusch , Hamburg 's former justice minister , says he wants to spare terminally ill people from having to undertake a long and difficult journey to another country to fulfil their death wish .
And while many German politicians say the suicide machine is nothing but a sick publicity stunt , Kusch says his goal is to offer terminally ill people an option .
" My motives are strictly humanitarian , " he told CNN , adding that he does not plan to patent or potentially sell the machine , but that he would lend it those wanting to die , only after a strict medical and psychological evaluation .

Recently I found a book in a second - hand bookshop , complete with a letter submitting the book for this years Booker prize .
I guess now we know what happens to those submission copies ...
I used to work in a library ( so perhaps I have an unfair advantage ? ) , but postcards and photos popped up a lot .
My favourite find was an uncashed cheque .

I 've found an eyeglass prescription in a used book called Stalking the Wild Asparagus .
I was interested enough to see my opthalmologist about how that absent reader 's eyesight .
He said --- from the notes -- that the person was suffering from " macular degeneration " -- something .
WHich I think means the person was going blind .
And which would be a sad fate for an avid reader .

One advantage of cataloging with the book in hand are the things in the books .
I 've found recipes in my grandmother 's handwriting on the insides of cookbook covers , dried flowers and leaves , an occasional newspaper clipping .
But the best may have been the sheet of paper with a drawing my son did over a decade ago .
These items have mostly remained in the books to be discovered again someday .

In the course of our business , my wife and I find all sorts of stuff , especially in antiquarian books , even more especially in antiquarian religious books .
Leaves and flowers are common , also some thiongs that look like postage stamps , but have no price and depict religious scenes .
Never quite know what they were for .
We usually pass these things on with the book to it`s next owner .
We did keep a Boots bookmark ( Boots the Chemist , now Alliance Boots , started life as a single shop in a poor area of Nottingham , run by a former agricultural labourer and his wife .
One of their less well - known ventures was the Boots Booklovers Library , which ran from 1898 to some time in the `50s .
Now the company`s a multi-national of course , they`re closing warehouses , shedding staff and have edited the story of the `Booklovers Library` on their web site down to a couple of lines .
C`est la vie . )
Another area I find fascinating is old religious books which have been the property of a priest , and have hand - written notes relating to different services , parishioners etc - usualy on the inside front cover .
We had one with a truncated family tree of a particlar family and notes relating to ( we thought ) a forthcoming wedding or funeral of a family member .
We also had a World War One soldier`s bible at one point with a pencilled name , rank and address of a field hospital in what looked like France .
That went to a collector in the US as I recall .

Nick , those are some sort of " devotional images " , quite common especially among Roman Catholics .
I remember when , as a child , I kind of collected some beautifully drawn ones , vividly colored and gilded .
We used to get them when we went to religious instruction ( mandatory in my Italian childhood days ) , and also in visiting churches .

Just found the business card for a " men 's clothing "
department salesman with John Wanamaker in Philadelphia .
It is noted on the first blank page that the book ( Mahan on Naval Warfare ) , was read in July 1942 .
Not very interesting in itself , but what puzzles me is the upper right portion of the card .
It says : Rittenhouse 9500 , and under that : Race 1000 .
Phone ?
Phone exchanges used to be words , but only 4 digits in a big city ?
And what 's that underneath ?
Extension ?
12 ciciha dec 25 , 2006 , 4:40 pm 25 , 2006 , 4:40 pm myshelves ,
I 'm originally from the Philly area .
Rittenhouse ( Square ) and Race are streets in the city , but John Wanamaker was between Market and Chestnut , not near Race Street or Rittenhouse Square at all .
I bet those were in fact exchanges .
The first two letters in the exchange name acted as digits , so Rittenhouse 9500 would really be the number 74-9500 .
Seems to me the seventh digit came along later in the forties , from what my old dad used to say in his stories .
Wow what a blast from the past !
Thanks for the memories ...

Check out the
They confirm that Rittenhouse was the exchange name in the 1940's for Center City Philadelphia ( where JW was located ) .
The digit 6 was added to RI in 1946 .
In the 1950's ( when my memory begins ) the exchange name was changed to LOcust .
But the Telephone Exchange Name Project explanation for the Race exchange does n't make a lot of sense to me ... maybe it will to you .

Wanamaker 's used to have a heck of a book department .

I 've often found stamps / stickers from used bookstores on the inside covers or frontispieces of books I get at my local used book emporium .

I 've got one from the 1880s with words pencilled inside the cover .
" Mary C. Higginson - September 29th , 1893 - written when in Prides Crossing , Massachusetts ( time ) Friday P.M. at 20 minutes of two just before luncheon time ( where ) in the parlor at the desk . "
Earlier dates hand written by the same person are July 7 , 1895 and November 16 , 1885 and someone else 's name that I can't read writing in 1900 .
I buy most of my old hardbacks at the Salvation Army ( 20 % off on Wednesdays ) and I picked up a copy of the Nancy Drew mystery The Mystery of the Brass Bound Trunk from 1952 and inside was a letter and envelope with a postmark from Horse Cave , Kentucky dated Jan 11 , 1956 at 12:30 pm .
Even the stamp is in excellent condition ( a purple 3 cent Statue of Liberty ) .

I bought some second hand jazz books recently and found some letters tucked away in the back of one - it seemed to be part of a correspondence between an aspiring jazz writer and the proprietor of a specialist jazz magazine ?/ publisher ?/ bookstore ?/ not sure concerning a proposed book .
There were some ( very ) sparse notes which I thought the would - be - author had made for himself .
Truthfully I don`t see much likelihood that the book ever saw light of day as the notes were sketchy in the extreme .

Some of my books date back to the 1940s when I had money to buy them .
. . thru the years I 've inserted newspaper reviews .
More fun than reading the reviews now is reading what 's on the other side of the newspaper or magazine clipping .

Today at work in the children 's room , as I handed a patron a book about bears , a picture fell out .
The picture was of a cute little girl wearing a tiara .
The patron began to giggle , and I thought it was because of the picture .
She replied , " It 's not just the picture , I bought my house from that little girl 's parents . "
The girl in the picture had moved out of town a year ... shows how often that book circulates .

And then there is the ( true ) 2001 story of a message in a Yale electrocardiography book .
If the student had read the book 's copyright notice , he would see he had won a 1965 Thunderbird convertible .
Of the 60.000 copies sold , only 5 found the message .
The winner was then chosen at random .

Not in a library book , but once I bought a used psychology book from the 70's at the thrift store .
It had copies of the student 's quiz grades in it ( he was a C student ) and at the top of the sheet was his social security number .
Just this weekend in a book I found some teenage angst poetry about being invisible .
other stuff -- newspaper clippings , photos , birthday cards , letters .

I have n't been on in a while and was thrilled to find that my message had been Boingboinged , whatever that is .
It felt great to be acknowledged .
The funny thing is that , when I read the message on the Boingboing site I too have many of those sci- fi books that can be flipped over to read the story on the other side .
Having never read one of those I thought I had found something quite special , guess not so much .
What I love about the journals that I have is that the writer is a very strong woman who is unhappily married and yet getting on with her life and spending time with friends and family .
That era was not conducive to quick and easy divorces so she spent her time at the theater , flower shows , etc .
She also spent some time making socks and warm clothing for the armed forces , and there is a part of the journals that is rather difficult to make out but I think she may have hired a private eye to confirm her suspicions .
Some of what she says is difficult to read , not because of her handwriting alone , but also because she is uncomfortabl with the content .
She was only in her thirties and I think she was not sure how much loyalty she shoud show this guy .
I think she would not have put it in her journal anyway .

I think I 'll start placing items in books as I read them , just as a snippet of my life at that time .
Mostly for myself when I come back to all my old books , but also for anyone who might be borrowing / inheriting my books .
Reading a book can be a very personal experience , this will give me a way to share my experience .

Now , I do n't read German , but it 's pretty clear that this was a note of holiday Greetings to " Uncle Karl " in December of 1974 .
The book would have likely been new ( it came out in January of 1974 ) , and I 'm guessing that this Karl fellow was either very big on Southwestern archaeology , or very well off ( as the cover price of the book was $ 18.50 , which is like $ 85.00 in today 's dollars ! ) .
Sometimes you can piece together quite a story from this stuff ...
I bought the book at the Newberry Library Book Fair , which often features the libraries of the recently deceased , the postcard and book were from 35 years ago , so " Uncle Karl " may have died in 2008 , with his books being donated for the Newberry fundraiser .
I almost feel guilty to have paid only $ 4 for this book ( well , it was marked as $ 8 , but I was there on " half - off Sunday " ) , given the steep publication price it had ... makes me wonder how the original owner felt about it .

An interesting post about something found in a book ...... it 's not mine , but thought I 'd pass it along anyway !
Speaking in a Senate committee hearing , the legendary Texas oilman T. Boone Pickens said that world crude oil production has topped out .
" I do believe you have peaked out at 85 million barrels a day globally , " he told the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee Tuesday , according to Reuters .
He noted that the United States is consuming " 21 million barrels of the 85 million and producing about 7 of the 21 , so if I could take just a minute on this point , the demand is about 86.4 million barrels a day , and when the demand is greater than the supply , the price has to go up until it kills demand . "
And when Mr. Pickens speaks about energy , the world listens .
His ability to read markets has vaulted him into the ranks of the world 's wealthiest people .
His hedge fund , BP Capital , manages more than $ 4 billion in assets .
He 's put his money where his mouth is .
He is currently at work planning the world 's largest wind farm , in West Texas .
By saying that oil has " peaked , " Pickens means that right now , the world is producing the most oil it will ever produce .
Soon , production will enter into a terminal decline , and prices will continue to go up .
The theory of peak oil was first developed in 1956 by Shell geoscientist M. King Hubbert .
He predicted – correctly – that the United States would pass its own peak production between 1965 and 1970 .
Since then , US oil production has dropped steadily .
Today , the United States imports about two - thirds of its oil , a phenomenon that Pickens described as " the greatest transfer of wealth in the history of mankind . "
Most analysts agree the slide down the other side of the peak will not be smooth .
In 2005 , the Department of Energy commissioned a report to examine the impact of peak oil .
The Hirsch Report ( PDF ) named for its lead author , energy adviser Robert Hirsch , puts the problem in stark terms :
The world has never faced a problem like this .
Without massive mitigation more than a decade before the fact , the problem will be pervasive and will not be temporary .
Previous energy transitions ( wood to coal and coal to oil ) were gradual and evolutionary ; oil peaking will be abrupt and revolutionary .
The report recommended 10 to 20 years of " accelerated effort " to implement alternative fuels would be needed before the oil peak to avoid " major economic upheaval " .
" Waiting until world oil production peaks before taking crash program action , " says the report , " leaves the world with a significant liquid fuel deficit for more than two decades . "
Not all energy analysts agree with Pickens 's belief that peak oil has been reached .
According to the Hirsch Repors , Royal Dutch Shell has stated that the peak will occur in 2025 or later , and the firm Cambridge Energy Research Associates says that it will occur after 2020 .
But most analysts cited in the report put the peak at around right now .
In response to Pickens 's testimony , Republicans on the committee issued a press release that cited a June 17 Rasmussen Reports survey showing that 67 percent of Americans believe that drilling should be allowed off the coasts of California , Florida , and other states .
Currently , the US bans offshore exploration for oil and gas deposits .
Incidentally , a day earlier , Rasmussen found that a minority of Americans oppose nationalizing America 's oil industry .

Welcome to the Sacramento Area Flippers in Trouble Gallery .
I 'll update this blog once a week or so with the latest Flippers In Trouble listings .
The fact that there exist official statistics on the amount and size of bribes paid in Mexico is perhaps indicative of the level to which corruption and the ‘ informal economy ’ is ingrained in Mexican Society .
The latest figures from Transperencia Mexico show that Mexicans spent 42 % more on bribes last year than in 2005 , splashing out a massive $ 2.6 billion .
That ’s an average of more than $ 24 for each of Mexico ’s 105 million people .
A brief survey of friends shows that some have paid up to 500 pesos to policemen to get out of parking / speeding and drinking infractions .
But the best bribe story has to be a friend who got stopped for having a dodgy back - light , and gave the policeman such a hard time he eventually got off with just giving him a piece of gum as his payoff .
Nice work .
For my part , I recall watching the TV news one afternoon .
The newsreader was talking about how there is a problem in Mexico City with people dumping their trash on the pavement / sidewalk rather than leaving it in their house and bringing it out when the garbage guys pass by .
It ’s an offence , but it does n’t carry a fine .
He went on to say , on network TV , that the police were going to be of no help enforcing the law because there was no money in it for them – people were n’t going to pay a bribe if they were n’t eventually going to have to pay a fine .
Such overt acknowledgement of the city ’s system made me laugh .
There ’s more on the nature of the types of bribes paid through this link – but it ’s important to remember that the poll included tipping garbage collectors and other little ‘ mordidas ’ which in my mind , is more of a tip than a bribe .
You decide .

WASHINGTON , June 25 ( Reuters ) -
When an Israeli cabinet minister said he thought an attack on Iran ’s nuclear sites was unavoidable , the price of a barrel of oil rose 9 percent to a new record in June .
Nice , fat bonus for oil - producing countries , including Iran .
If rhetoric has that effect , imagine the consequences of an actual strike .
The numbers have not been crunched , at least not in public , but a four - month computer simulation and gaming exercise carried out last year by the Heritage Foundation , a conservative Washington think tank , gives an idea .
It was based on an Iranian closure of the Strait of Hormuz , the passageway for 90 percent of oil exported from Gulf producers , in response to a U.S. attack on nuclear sites , air fields and air defense targets .
The simulation showed the price of oil more than doubling , U.S. gross domestic product depressed for 2 - 1 / 2 years , private non-farm employment declining by more than one million jobs , and disposable personal income dropping by more than $ 260 billion .
In terms of oil and gasoline prices , last year were the good old days .
At the time of the exercise , a barrel of oil traded at $ 65 and a gallon of gasoline in the U.S. averaged $ 2.80 .
It ’s now around $ 136 and $ 4.08 respectively and could well reach twice that after an attack .
Tighten your belts !
The exercise did not measure the impact of the closure on Japan , more than 75 percent of whose crude goes through the Straits , South Korea ( 70 pct ) , India ( 65 pct ) , or China ( 34pct ) .
The assumption was that Iran would only succeed in closing the Strait for one full week , after which shipping would slowly resume .
Reaction to an attack on Iran would go beyond severe economic pain to the U.S. and other oil importers .
One of the unintended consequences of the U.S. invasion of Iraq has been to greatly strengthen Iran which has the ability to wage guerrilla war by proxy on Israel ( through Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza ) and has shown it can dial up ( or down ) Shi’ite violence in Iraq .
The military consequences of an American or Israeli attack on Iran are incalculable .
Mohammed El Baradei , the head of the world ’s nuclear watchdog , the International Atomic Energy Agency , has described military action to stop Iran ’s nuclear programme as a “ ludicrous idea ” which would unite Iranians against their attackers and “ turn the region into a fireball . ”
A crash program for building the bomb could begin as soon as the smoke clears .
ISRAELI HAWKS AND U.S. NEOCONS
The man who made the oil price jump on June 6 with his “ unavoidable ” comment was Israeli deputy prime minister Shaul Mofaz , a hawk born in Iran , whose views are close to U.S. neoconservatives who also feel that the only way to stop Iran ’s nuclear programme is to bomb it .
Their ’s appears to be a minority position in the lame - duck Bush administration which is already bequeathing two wars and a battered economy to the next president .
But the U.S. could be drawn into an assault if Israel , impatient with the present diplomatic stalemate and the limited success of sanctions on oil - rich Iran , decided to strike , found itself unable to finish the job and requested U.S. assistance .
In other words , the U.S. would have to finish what Israel started .
This week John Bolton , a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations predicted in an interview with the Daily Telegraph of London that Israel would attack between the U.S. elections on November 4 and the swearing - in of the next president on January 20 .
This was probably more a public expression of wishful thinking by a superhawk than deep insight into Israeli planning .
What has complicated the seemingly endless debate over the nuclear program Iran says is entirely for peaceful purposes is the assumption by many policymakers in the U.S. and Israel that the Iranian establishment is irrational .
“ The problem is that we are putting Iran in a category of one , different from anyone else , ” said Gary Sick , an Iran scholar at Columbia University .
“ There is a strain of commentary that Iranians are so suicidal and martyrdom - inclined they can not be trusted . ”
In Israel , that school of thought was enshrined in a 2004 national security report for former Prime Minister Ariel Sharon .
It argued that Israel has an inherent right to pre-emptive attacks because the Iranian leaders are irrational and do not value self - preservation , according to Trita Parsi , author of Treacherous Alliance , a study of the complex , shifting relations between Iran , Israel and the U.S .
Despite Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmedinejad ’s alarming rants about the imminent demise of Israel , there is no evidence that Iran ’s opaque and many - layered leadership is plotting to commit collective suicide by building a nuclear bomb , promptly launching it at Tel Aviv and dying a fiery death in a retaliatory nuclear strike from Israel .
Israel ’s nuclear arsenal , a key element of the Middle East power equation , has been an open secret for years .
It is still treated with studied silence both by official Washington and Israel , which has neither confirmed nor denied that it has nuclear weapons .
Independent experts put their number at between 80 + and 300 .
Three nuclear submarines provide a second strike capability of which Iran is keenly aware .
Many strategic thinkers both in the U.S. and Israel dismiss the notion of Iranian irrationality and exceptionalism .
“ Iran ’s leaders are more concerned about staying in power than anything else , ” said Mehrzad Boroujerdi , an Iran scholar at Syracuse University .
Just like power elites anywhere else .

And this is , come to think of it , something of an achievement .
What is the opposite of a belly laugh ?
An interesting question , in a way , and to hear lines like “ I think I just made a happy wee - wee ” or “ I ’m making diarrhea noises in my cup ” or to watch apprentice gurus attack one another with urine - soaked mops is to grasp the answer .
Please do n’t misunderstand : I ’m not opposed to infantile , regressive , scatological humor .
Indeed , I consider myself something of a connoisseur .
Or maybe a glutton .
So it ’s not that I object to the idea of , say , witnessing elephants copulate on the ice in the middle of a Stanley Cup hockey match , or seeing a dwarf sent flying over the same ice by the shock of defibrillator paddles .
But it will never be enough simply to do such things .
They must be done well .
Instead Mr. Myers floats through “ The Love Guru ” with the serene confidence that everything he does will have us rolling in the aisles .
He follows nearly every joke with his trademark facial tic , baring his teeth , pushing his head forward and widening his eyes , as if to grant uncertain viewers permission to giggle .
Sometimes he does this to indicate the character ’s attempt at levity 
Guru Pitka making a joke at someone else ’s expense rather than Mr. Myers making a joke at Guru Pitka ’s  but the distinction hardly matters .
The delusional narcissism of the Guru , who dreams of a spot on “ Oprah , ” is of a piece with Mr. Myers ’s own .
The rule seems to be that no one may upstage him and all must adore him .
The “ Austin Powers ” franchise fulfilled the first mandate by casting the star in several roles .
He is supported by a cast that includes Justin Timberlake ( as a well - endowed Québécois goalie ) , Romany Malco ( as a hockey star with love trouble ) and Jessica Alba , as the owner of the Toronto Maple Leafs .
A further list  Stephen Colbert !
John Oliver of “ The Daily Show ” !
Ben Kingsley !
 would only create the misleading impression that there is something worth seeing here .
If there is  Did I miss it ?
Darn ! 
I ’m sure it will show up on YouTube before long .
In the meantime talk amongst yourselves .
“ The Love Guru ” is rated PG - 13 ( Parents strongly cautioned ) .
It has crude sexual humor and naughty words .
The British have long looked to US cities for inspiration .
Now Americans are starting to seek UK solutions to their urban problems , says Dermot Finch of the Centre for Cities .
Gleaming skyscrapers , the land of opportunity , pursuit of the American Dream - many admire major cities in the United States and their dash of extra polish .
In 2006 alone , more than 30,000 Brits left to try their luck Stateside .
Leading Labour and Conservative figures regularly look to the likes of New York and Chicago to fix urban problems back home .
The Tories ' new welfare to work proposals were modelled on existing schemes in New York and Wisconsin .
And John Prescott and David Miliband both made ministerial study tours of the US a top priority .
But the reality behind the shining urban bastions of the American dream is n't always so rosy .
When it comes to preventing urban sprawl and tackling congestion , UK cities are actually further ahead .
So what can UK cities - which have benefited from a decade of strong economic growth - teach their Atlantic neighbours ?
TACKLE GRIDLOCK
Since Ken Livingstone , the previous mayor of London , brought in the congestion charge in 2003 ( amidst a barrage of criticism and only reluctant support from the government ) , the volume of traffic entering the congestion charge zone has fallen by over a fifth - with bus use increasing by 15 % .
Meanwhile the £ 125 m extra cash generated by the charge ( after its upkeep costs ) goes straight back into public transport .
Road rage plagues Miami
This week the Department for Transport announced its support of Manchester 's own charge proposals - although until more of its critics are won over , the future of the charge continues to hang in the balance .
Miami , Minneapolis , Seattle and San Francisco are also currently looking to London 's congestion charge to solve their traffic problems .
The charge in London has its critics , particularly concerning the charge amount and the western extension , and there are still problems with congestion caused by road works in parts of the capital .
But the fact that the charge survived the change in mayoralty is testimony to its success - and the likes of Seattle and San Francisco could learn from the scheme 's successes and limitations .
KEEP TOWN AND CITY CENTRES ALIVE
In 1996 , the Conservative government took action to stop UK city and town centres and their High Streets turning into ghost towns .

Whilst not everyone supports recent city centre redevelopments , by putting town centres first in the planning rules , successive governments have reduced the number of car - dependent shopping centres being built - and encouraged more shops and offices into city centres .
As a result , total retail floor space in UK town and city centres increased from 25 % in the mid 1990s to 34 % in 2003 /2004 .
HOW TO BEAT SUBURBAN SPRAWL
The Labour Government went on to take further steps to stop UK cities and towns sprawling like their American equivalents .
Atlanta and Los Angeles have become known for the segregated neighbourhoods , lengthy commutes and gridlock that resulted from suburban sprawl .
Living in a box , London style Reusing urban land where possible , rather than building on Greenfield sites , has helped cities like Leeds and Bristol to avoid far - flung car - dependent suburbs proliferating .
In 2000 the Government introduced a housing density target for new housing developments of 30 - 50 homes a hectare - where it 's appropriate to do so .
By 2006 , new homes were being built at an average density of 40 a hectare .
The British experience suggests that American cities would benefit from a strong steer from the federal government to make neighbourhoods denser and less dependent on private transport .
LAVISH ATTENTION ON CITIES
The decline of British industry after World War II saw UK cities and towns riddled with social and economic deprivation , and largely neglected by central government .
Liverpool celebrates its cultural legacy
In recent years - starting with Michael Heseltine 's city development initiatives under the Conservative government of the 1980s , UK cities have basked in the attention of senior ministers .
Tony Blair 's Social Exclusion Unit , Gordon Brown 's target to reduce child poverty and John Prescott 's expert Urban Task Force attest to a concentrated effort to help cities improve after a lengthy period of economic and industrial decline .
Ex-industrial cities like Leeds and Sheffield have seen jobs growth of 15 % and 25 % respectively in a single decade .
Who would have thought 10 years ago that Liverpool , the European Capital of Culture , would be welcoming its two millionth visitor so far this year ?
That Gateshead would be hosting the Conservative Party 's 2008 spring conference ?
There has been no equivalent high - profile championing of urban development and regeneration by the US government in recent years - American cities have been missing out .
Boris Johnson show his New York counterpart the view from City Hall
Of course , we can and should continue to learn from US cities .
For one , US city mayors have more control over their own finances - meaning that they can innovate more and grow their economies as a result .
Only 5 % of all tax revenues are raised by local councils in England , compared to 41 % in the US .
Policy learning can go both ways .
A recent visit to London 's new mayor by Michael Bloomberg , the mayor of New York , and the promise to exchange expertise and personnel on London transport and crime reduction in the Bronx could signal an end to this one - way traffic .
British ministers have for too long gone cap in hand to the US for ideas on how to improve our cities .
With cities and towns on both sides of the Atlantic now facing tougher economic times , is n't it time for our two nations ' cities to share the best of both ?
As the US political parties gear up for the Democratic Convention in Denver and the Republican Convention in St Paul , Minnesota , the question is more relevant than ever .

Being a native Bostonian I have witnessed first hand the before and after of the " Big Dig , " a 10 - plus year construction project on the entire city .
On the whole its greener and cleaner , which reminds me of the UK and the rest of Europe .
But still there are problems with traffic due to the spread of suburbs and lack of efficient public transportation .
In that area , Europe has it all over us .
But the comment on how mayors have more control of their economies is a little too rosy .
The tax money is not allocated efficiently to make our towns and cities better places because funds are strained as it is .
In most towns the money is put into " more needed " areas of the budget .
Lia , Boston Ma US
Tackling gridlock in a sprawling city such as Los Angeles requires greater ambitions than simply charging for entry to a city center .
LA has no city centre and is already so infected with sprawl that any treatment to this disease will have to be very dramatic .
For those of us who live here , change such as those mentioned in the article needs to be made by courageous public officials , willing populace , and supportive corporate interests .
I 'm not holding my breath .
Hoot , Los Angeles , CA Is this for real ?
I used to live in Seattle .
I - 5 is a main interstate that runs right though the city .
We have nothing like that in the UK .
It seems the only think the US is taking from us are the scam - the - motorist policies .
As for housing density , all forms of violent crime ( per capita ) increase with housing density .
A detached house with a bit of grass round it is far nicer and stops people getting in each others face all the time .
Like many of the world 's problem , it is overpopulation that is the real root cause .
Simon Ward , Watford , UK
The majority of your comment seems to relate to cars and pricing cars out of affordability and cramming more people into ever smaller boxes .
I 'll bet none of the decision makers want to live in them .
Jim , Herts
While several British cities have made innovative changes to improve life , London 's congestion charge , the majority are examples of how not to carry out urban development .
Housing density is higher in the UK because of land prices , developers have to get as many properties onto a site to make building commercially viable .
Many US cities have better public transport systems than UK ones , subsidy , integration , cleanliness and reliability .
Granted , US city traffic is still generally bad .
I am sure other readers can think of many other instances of why US cities should not apply British ideas .
Personally , I think they would be better off looking at German , Dutch , French or Spanish cities for inspiration .
Kenny Boy , Edinburgh , Scotland Horses for courses .
Each city is a unique combination of geography , communications and cultures which may not work elsewhere .
London 's first congestion zone had an almost - natural boundary in the Ring Road AND a unitary authority covering highways and transport .
Should n't stop people trying as long as they do n't just copy ...

Regular readers will remember the incredible abandoned mines and sunken cities as well as the catacombs and crypts of two previous collections of underground wonders .
This set , however , focuses mainly on amazing underground wonders of the recent past – many of which are still in operation .
From seed vaults to military strongholds , government hideouts to diamond mines and nuclear waste dumps , here are seven more underground wonders of the world .
Know of others that have n’t made the list yet ?
Be sure to leave more information in a comment below !
Underground Seed Storage Vault : Located on a remote island only a few hundred miles from the North Poll , the Svalbard Global Seed Vault was constructed as insurance against the loss of genetically diverse crops around the globe
While other such collections exist this is by far the most comprehensive and secure such endeavor to date and is located in a more safe region of the world than many similar efforts .
The vault currently contains around 1.5 million seed samples and has a capacity of three times that amount .
With the surrounding permafrost , the seismic stability of the region and a state - of - the - art security system this is one of the safest storage places ever constructed – and it looks awesome .
Primary School in a Cave :
One thing that stands out right away about this strange Chinese school - in - a - cave is the lack of a roof on the main school structure – but really , why would you need one with the natural rock shelter provided ?
This naturally occurring cave provides a conveniently sizable space that accommodates not only the primary school proper but also playground spaces and other support structures .
One can only imagine the permitting processes , objections and other complications that of a proposal for something similar in , say , the United States .
Mormon Genealogical Vaults :
The Mormons have some of the most sophisticated and thorough genealogical records in the world – 500 million pages of statistics dating back hundreds of years .
So where does one horde such a rare treasure for safe - keeping ?
There is a nuke - proof underground bunker where the backups are kept carved into a granite cliffside outside of Salt Lake City .
While the data is available to the public these original archival copies are kept completely secure .
The folks of the Long Now project managed to get access but could only photograph the exterior .
Inside , says their intrepid representative , long rows of microfilm storage resemble the endless stacks from The Matrix and a central water - catch zone ( from the rock above ) is reminiscent of Fremen water catches from Dune .
Secret WWI Military Tunnels : Imagine a military tunnel system so elaborate and extensive it housed not only 25,000 soldiers but also contained a church , dining halls , a 700 - bed hospital and even a power station mere feet below the enemy .
Recently excavated below the French town of Arras is an amazing work of wartime ingenuity – the largest underground project in British military history .
By the time the British retook the town in 1916 it was virtually in ruins and still besieged by the Germans .
500 New Zealand sappers worked tirelessly to interconnect a series of existing but isolated underground mines into a 12 - mile network of passages and spaces .
Amazingly , after the war these spaces were put out of site and out of mind until they became a forgotten piece of history .
Only recently did curiosity and clues lead to the rediscovery of this astonishing network and the opening of one small part to the public .
World ’s Largest Diamond Mine : The Mirny Diamond Mine in Siberia may be one of the scariest mines in the world ( in addition to being the world ’s largest open diamond mine ) .
It is over a thousand feet deep and thousands of feet wide .
It is so large it actually creates its own local weather patterns and the space above it has had to be designated a no - fly zone for helicopters ( after this problem was identified the hard way ) .
Gigantic trucks ( like the small dot pointed to above ) can haul over 200 tons of material out of the mine at a time , winding up and down the frightening spiral path that leads to the center of the mine .
Stockholm Art Metro Station :
This amazingly decorated subway station takes the idea of public art to an pervasive maximum with over 100 artists displaying all kinds of work in an enclosed public space .
And really , who could use a daily dose or art more than the bustling workers cramming onto public transportation day in and day out ?
This space has been dubbed the “ world ’s longest art gallery ” with a vast range of strange spaces , designs and artworks including wall sculptures , murals and lighting effects that are as varied as the designers and artists who created them .
Waste Isolation Pilot Plant : Carlsbad , New Mexico , has probably the last underground wonder in the world you would want to visit .
This facility is the first of its kind : a licensed permanent storage space for radioactive waste .
The site has been stable for hundreds of millions of years and the surrounding soil is calculated to fill cracks that could occur in the subterranean storage structures over time .
Markers have been placed around the site to deter future human interference and potential accidental catastrophe .
The bottom diagram above shows the contentious Yucca Mountain nuclear storage facility .

NEW YORK ( CNN / Money ) -
Oil prices reached a record $ 50 a barrel Monday as Nigeria emerged as the latest focus for worries about supply in an already tight worldwide energy market .
The U.S. light crude November contract rose 36 cents a barrel in after - hours electronic trading to reach $ 50 , its loftiest level in the 21 years of trade on the New York Mercantile Exchange , before pulling back to $ 49.80 .
The contract had settled for the session at $ 49.64 , its highest - ever settlement , up 76 cents from Friday 's close .
London Brent , the benchmark for European crude imports , settled 60 cents higher at $ 45.13 , after hitting a new record of $ 46.28 a barrel .
In Washington , the Bush administration said it is closely monitoring crude prices , but spokesman Scott McClellan said the administration will not use the Strategic Petroleum Reserve ( SPR ) to ease prices .
Investment bank Morgan Stanley said it now believes surging crude oil prices could reach as high as $ 61 a barrel .
" We now think that ( U.S. ) crude oil could reach $ 61 before a meaningful sell - off occurs , " investment bank Morgan Stanley said in a report to its private clients .
" Long - term price patterns point to even higher prices , " the report added .
Growing concerns over militancy in Nigeria , OPEC 's fifth - largest producer , are compounding worries about supply security in Russia , Saudi Arabia and Iraq .

" All these factors create apprehension in the market and reinforce the view that we 're on a knife 's edge in terms of supply and demand , " Daniel Hynes , industry analyst at ANZ Bank in Melbourne , told Reuters .
" The uncertainties heighten the risk premium applied to this market . "
Global supplies have risen strongly this year but are still straining to meet the fastest demand growth in 24 years .
World crude output is close to its limit after many years when OPEC producers kept large volumes untapped .
The lack of a supply cushion has reinforced the view among some investors that oil near $ 50 is not overpriced , despite a 50 percent jump in crude prices since the start of the year .
" The market faces the prospect of years without sufficient flexibility or insulation from shocks during a period of extreme geopolitical stress , " analyst Paul Horsnell of Barclays Capital told Reuters .
In Nigeria , rebels seeking political reforms in the impoverished oil - producing Niger Delta forced the closure by Royal Dutch / Shell of 30,000 barrels a day as a security precaution .

The militants , threatening output from the country that pumps 2.5 million barrels daily , said at the weekend they would seek to extend the uprising across the West African producer 's entire southern delta oil region .
Separately , Nigeria already has been forced to cut back output from surge capacity to prevent long - term damage to its aging facilities -- the first sign that efforts by OPEC countries to quell prices by squeezing out extra output may not be sustainable .
Presidential Adviser on Petroleum Edmund Daukoru told Reuters that production was reduced 10 percent to base capacity of 2.25 million bpd in August .
Nigeria had been pumping at surge capacity of up to 2.55 million bpd .
Uncertainty over supplies from Yukos , Russia 's top exporter , also is supporting prices .
Yukos last week trimmed deliveries to China .

What is this ?
In Saudi Arabia , clashes between security forces and suspected al Qaeda followers served as a reminder of the threat to stability in the world 's biggest producer .
In Iraq , insurgents fired mortar bombs at the oil ministry building Saturday , causing minor damage but no injuries .
But Iraqi oil exports , temporarily at least , are as high as they have been since last year 's U.S. - led invasion .
Iraqi pipelines have been the target of frequent sabotage attacks .
But Monday deliveries resumed through the main northern liHne to Turkey after repairs from a bomb attack Sept 2 .
Southern exports were near full capacity .
Extra crude from OPEC , now pumping at a 25 - year high , has failed to make any impact .
The group produced 30.5 million bpd in September , the highest since 1979 , tanker - tracking consultancy Petrologistics said Monday .

' Microtransit ' to replace buses in Montpelier
Smaller buses and vans will soon ply flexible , app - driven routes in Montpelier — and might replace regular bus service in Vermont with " microtransit . "
We ’re continuing to dig into what ’s going on with Women ’s Voices , Women Vote , the DC non-profit behind those suspicious robocalls in North Carolina .
We ’ve looked into the group ’s activities in other states and at least outside of North Carolina it ’s really difficult to figure out whether the group was up to no good or just mind - numbingly incompetent .
Purportedly , WVWV ’s aim was to register unmarried women .
But in state after state ( Virginia , Arizona , Colorado , Wisconsin , et al. ) the group ’s mailings spurred investigations or rebukes from state election authorities for sending people registration forms after the deadlines , or sending mailings that suggested recipients were legally required to return them signed , to just freaking people out .
( For more details , see Facing South , which pulled all this information together . )
That ’s not a good record .
And secretaries of state offices in states around the country seem to have been complaining for months .
But in these other states at least it ’s not clear that WVWV is guilty of anything more than really heavy - handed mailers trying to sign up unmarried female voters , even if the recipients were sometimes married .
Setting aside the incidents in North Carolina , that we ’re still looking into , it seems like in the rest of the country the group was involved in legitimate voter - registration efforts for a targeted group even though they went about it in heavy - handed way and sometimes confused voters by failing to note key registration deadlines .
Late Update : Mike Lux , who ’s on the group ’s board , vouches for the group and Page Gardner , who runs the operation .
Even Later Update : Seems the group flubbed the deadline in Oregon too .
DETROIT ( Reuters ) - Shares of General Motors Corp hit their lowest level since 1955 and dragged down the auto sector on Thursday after Goldman Sachs cut the struggling U.S. industry ’s largest manufacturer to a “ sell ” rating and warned it would have to raise capital .

The panicky slide in GM GM.N shares capped a period of growing concern about liquidity risks to U.S. automakers and suppliers from a domestic auto market reeling from record gas prices and the impact of a housing slump and tighter credit .
The Goldman Sachs warning , including the unusual “ sell ” call on the U.S. auto industry ’s largest player after a period of sharp stock price declines just ahead of the close of the second quarter , prompted selling across the sector .
GM Chief Executive Rick Wagoner said the embattled automaker had enough liquidity to carry it through the year and had financial flexibility beyond that .
“ We ’ve got a very good , solid funding base under any scenario we see , solid through the end of this year , ” Wagoner told reporters after an economic event hosted by U.S. presidential candidate Barack Obama .
“ We have a lot of options to fund beyond that . ”
Chrysler LLC , for its part , denied rumors it was facing a cash crunch or that it had been driven to filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy .
Those rumors had driven down loan prices for the privately held automaker , according to Reuters LPC .
“ The rumor is without merit , ” Chrysler spokesman Dave Elshoff said .
“ There is no basis for the rumor . ”
Debt and equity markets were affected by growing concern for the deepening risks for the auto sector .
The cost to insure the debt of GM and Ford Motor Co F.N hit records .
GM shares were down nearly 11 percent in early afternoon trade and touched a low of $ 11.21 .
Major GM suppliers were also hammered .
Shares in American Axle & Manufacturing Holdings AXL.N , which supplies axles for GM trucks , dropped 12 percent .
Lear Corp LEA.N , downgraded to a " sell " rating by Goldman , tumbled 18 percent .
Shares in Ford , which had its price target cut by Goldman , dropped almost 5 percent .
With the Thursday price fall , GM 's market cap fell to less than $ 6.5 billion .
The company has the smallest market capitalization in the Dow Jones industrial average .
DJI , of which it has been a component since 1925 .
Next above GM in terms of market value in the Dow is Alcoa Inc AA.N , with a market cap of about $ 30 billion .
Walt Disney Co's DIS.N cap is 10 times GM's at about $ 60 billion and Exxon Mobil Corp XOM .N is the leader at about $ 460 billion .
GM shares have lost 38 percent over the last month as more evidence has piled up that U.S. auto sales weakened further in June , raising doubts about the prospect for the second - half recovery that GM and other major automakers had anticipated .
Fitch Ratings on Wednesday cut debt ratings on GM and Chrysler ratings deeper into the “ junk ” category , ” citing the fallout from weaker sales and high gas prices .
Fitch also said it would review Ford ratings over the next six weeks , which could also result in a downgrade .
CASH BURN RAISES CONCERNS
All three U.S. automakers , which have been hardest hit by the collapse in demand for pickup trucks and SUVs , have faced scrutiny in recent days over whether they have sufficient liquidity to ride out the current downturn .
Billionaire investor Kirk Kerkorian , who has invested about $ 1 billion in a contrarian bet on Ford , has offered to provide more capital to support the automaker ’s turnaround .
Kerkorian ’s chief auto adviser , Jerry York , told Reuters on Wednesday that he did not expect the U.S. auto market to bounce back in the second half of this year with an only limited rebound in 2009 .
Earlier this week , Chrysler drew down a $ 2 billion credit line from Cerberus and Daimler AG DAIGn .
DE , the German car maker that sold off a roughly 80 percent stake in Chrysler to Cerberus last year .
Under terms of the sale , Chrysler had until August to draw on the credit line , which included $ 1.5 billion from Daimler .
The credit line pays interest fixed at 7 percentage points above the London interbank rate , Daimler has said .
Chrysler , which lost $ 1.6 billion in 2007 , has said it ended the year with $ 9 billion in cash .
Its U.S. sales are down 23 percent so far this year .
Analysts have also fixed their sights on GM , which ended the first quarter with $ 31 billion in cash and undrawn credit .
Deutsche Bank and JP Morgan both warned last week that GM would be forced to borrow heavily to shore up its liquidity position .
Goldman Sachs analyst Patrick Archambault , who also cut his ratings on Tenneco Inc TEN.N , said he expected GM shares to continue to underperform as market fundamentals deteriorate .
He cut his six - month price target on GM stock by $ 8 to $ 11 .
“ We think GM ’s automotive cash flow burn this year and next is likely to lead it to look to raise capital , which we believe could lead to significant shareholder dilution and / or a cut to the company ’s dividend , ” Archambault said .

The shaking in Jeffrey Tamraz ’s right hand began in 2001 .
It was intermittent , so he paid it little mind .
A six - foot , 260 - pound bear of a man , he ’d played football and thrown shot and discus in high school ; later he got into competitive weightlifting , and worked up to bench - pressing 465 pounds — once , to win a bet , he flipped a Honda Civic on its side .
He brought the same passion to his work .
“ I taught welding for six years , ” he says .
“ I read books on welding .
I loved to weld . ”
But by 2004 , the twitching had grown too persistent to ignore , and the 47 - year - old felt sluggish and clumsy .
He consulted a neurologist and was stunned to get the diagnosis : parkinsonism .
Upon learning that his patient had been welding for 25 years , and knowing that welding fumes contain manganese , a toxic metal , the specialist suggested the symptoms were work related .
Since then , Tamraz has lost not only his livelihood , but much of his easygoing personality .
Gone , says
Terry , his wife of 10 years , is her husband ’s sense of humor and his penchant for impromptu dances in malls and grocery stores .
Driving is difficult , and eating , and sex .
Even the most mundane tasks — brushing his teeth , applying deodorant­ — now require a mental run-through .
“ Pretty much nothing is automatic anymore , ” Jeff says .
“ I can be walking down a straight concrete sidewalk and I just trip .
My toes dig into the concrete . ”
He no longer goes out much , in any case .
“ I became kind of a hermit , ” he says .
“ You get tired of people looking at you .
It ’s embarrassing to shake .
It ’s a sign of weakness . ”
Following Jeff ’s diagnosis , the couple , who live in Grants Pass , Oregon , hired a lawyer and sued Lincoln Electric and four other makers of manganese - containing welding wire and electrodes — also called rods or sticks .
Filed in federal District Court in Cleveland , their claim joined thousands of others pending against welding - products manufacturers in state and federal courts .
( Employers have not been among the targets because lawyers generally concluded they were ignorant of the metal ’s dangers . )
The odds were n’t great .
Since the lawsuits began in the 1970s , the position of the $ 5 billion welding - products industry had remained consistent :
There are no reliable scientific data to prove welding fumes cause the Parkinson ’s - like syndrome known as parkinsonism — or “ manganism ” if manganese - related — that many longtime welders experience .
It was an argument familiar to anyone acquainted with large - scale toxics litigation , and it seemed to work .
Industry had ended up settling a few cases — including a $ 6.5 million payout to four Florida welders in 1985 — but as the Tamrazes went to trial last November , it had won 16 of 17 actual courtroom bouts .
Not long after , though , came a startling revelation .
For several years , US District Judge Kathleen O’Malley — whose Ohio courtroom is the fact - finding venue for Tamraz and hundreds of other cases — had watched lawyers squabble over disclosure of alleged payments to researchers studying the effects of manganese on welders .
Finally , in December , O’Malley ordered both sides to fess up and provide a “ full and complete ” accounting of any such payments .
It ’s hardly uncommon for an industry to pay for research — think Big Pharma — but the payouts unearthed by O’Malley ’s order provide an exceedingly rare view of the system at work .
“ This has every appearance of the industry buying science , ” observed Erin Bigler , a professor of psychology at Brigham Young University who studies brain trauma , aging , and autism , after reviewing the documents .
“ I ’ve never seen anything like this .
I ’ve suspected it forever , but I ’ve never seen it . ”
Court documents obtained by Mother Jones show that the welding companies paid more than $ 12.5 million to 25 organizations and 33 researchers , virtually all of whom have published papers dismissing connections between welding fumes and workers ’ ailments .
Most of the money , $ 11 million , was spent after the litigation achieved critical mass in 2003 ; attorneys for the welders , meanwhile , spent about half a million .
The pattern does n’t surprise George Washington University epidemiologist David Michaels , author of Doubt Is Their Product : How Industry ’s Assault on Science Threatens Your Health .
Corporate - funded research articles are often “ advocacy documents that are being produced purely for use in court cases , ” he says .
“ It ’s unfortunate , because it really pollutes the scientific literature . ”
Judge O’Malley singled out a researcher named Jon Fryzek , whose large studies of Swedish and Danish welders found no significant link between welding fumes and Parkinson ’s symptoms­ — but the studies , based almost solely on hospital records , ignored welders who were never hospitalized .
O’Malley was particularly troubled to learn that industry lawyers had reviewed a prepublication draft of the Danish study .
“ [ T ] here is no doubt that this was not simply an independent study , ” she wrote , “ and that the experts who participated in the study are continuing to act in an advocacy capacity . ”
Fryzek worked for Maryland ’s International Epidemiology Institute ( iei ) ­— known for its industry - commissioned studies , including one that found no link between radiation and cancer in uranium millers .
The institute received more than $ 971,000 from welding defendants .
The embattled manufacturers also paid $ 860,000 to Paul Lees - Haley , an Alabama psychologist and inventor of a widely criticized test that often concludes brain - injury patients are malingering .
Two consulting firms linked by court documents to C. Warren Olanow , a Manhattan neurologist who has published at least a dozen articles cited by defense experts , got almost $ 2.9 million .
And the Parkinson ’s Institute in California got nearly $ 3.4 million to conduct a four - year study­ — not limited to welders — seeking links between Parkinson ’s symptoms and factors other than manganese , including smoking and drinking .
( The institute ’s research director says the work was neither influenced by its funders , nor will she let them see the resulting manuscript until it has been accepted for publication . )
Fryzek , who now works for Amgen , a California biotech company , did not return phone calls and emails ; Olanow and Lees - Haley declined comment .
iei president Joseph McLaughlin insisted in written statements that the manufacturers “ had no say whatsoever ” in the study ’s conduct or content , and that it is “ common ” for funders to view unpublished results .
welders are by and large a stoic bunch .
At 56 , Joe McMahon , a business agent at Steamfitters Local 420 in Philadelphia , has worked in all sorts of hellholes — inside chemical - encrusted cracker units at refineries , for one — and he never obsessed over the acrid white smoke from melted welding rods .
If he ever saw warning labels — most of the time , he notes , the rods were out of the can by the time he got them — they seemed meaningless .
“ It was all small print , ” recalls McMahon .
“ It probably said , ‘ Try to avoid breathing smoke . ’
Well , how the fuck am I gonna do that ? ”
Supplied - air or cartridge respirators , he says , were pressed on welders at nuclear plants ( because of radiation worries ) , but no one else : “ If you wanted a dust mask you could request it , but it was n’t mandatory . ”
Manganese poisoning is hardly a new concern .
In a 1932 German paper , industrial doctor Erich Beintker described two patients who welded inside boilers and tanks .
One complained of dizziness , ringing ears , sudden sweats , and sleeplessness .
The other had developed a speech impediment and balance problems .
“ A nervous disorder appears to be present here because of the manganese fumes , ” Beintker concluded , urging welding companies to share information about the compounds in their products .
In the United States five years later , the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company distributed a welding - safety booklet describing manganese as an “ important poison ” that “ causes a disease similar to paralysis agitans “ — Parkinson’s .
( The welding industry responded by demanding MetLife rewrite the booklet to tamp down the “ scare ” it had created ; the insurer obliged . )
In 1943 , Occupational Hazards Inc. of Cleveland published an industrial - safety handbook warning of the metal ’s paralyzing effects .
“ Manganese victims usually remain life - long cripples , unfit for gainful employment , ” the authors wrote .
They encouraged employers to provide ventilation and examine workers four times a year “ to detect early signs or symptoms . ”
Documents show that welding suppliers knew of the problems .
In an October 1949 memo , an executive from Airco Welding Products ( now defendant the boc Group ) recalled how the National Electrical Manufacturers Association , an industry trade group , had called for warning labels .
“ Some of the manufacturers did not do this and as a result immediately capitalized on the advantage of being able to sell an electrode which did not have to be marked ‘ poison , ' ” the official wrote .
“ As a result , one by one , all of the various manufacturers took this information off the label and all were very glad to get it off . ”
As evidence of the dangers mounted — ” the fumes are far worse than I had any reason to suspect , ” another Airco official wrote in 1950 — the industry continued to resist warning labels .
It was n’t until the 1990s that the warnings were made explicit .
Today , one brand of welding wire bears this caution : “ Overexposure to manganese and manganese compounds above safe exposure limits can cause irreversible damage to the central nervous system , including the brain . ”
like other industries in the crosshairs of litigation , welding - rod manufacturers have zeroed in on the concept of “ safe exposure limits . ”
Manganese is toxic , they ’ve acknowledged , but not at the levels present in their products .
In fact , independent researchers have documented a range of symptoms in welders exposed to ordinary levels of the metal , from depression , memory loss , and irritability to the zombielike state of full - blown manganism .
Some get “ cock walk ” — a lurching , toe - heavy gait resembling that of a strutting rooster .
A recent study described numbness ( 61 percent ) , tremors ( 42 percent ) , and hallucinations ( 19 percent ) among 49 welders working on the San Francisco - Oakland Bay Bridge .
Epidemiologist Robert Park of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health ( niosh ) says there ’s ample evidence that welding fumes wreak havoc on the brain .
One of several Korean studies that yielded such evidence in the 1990s , for example , found a significantly greater incidence of speech impairment , tremors , and gait disturbances among welders than nonwelders .
“ I ’d be amazed if there was something else going on instead of manganese , ” Park says .
And a 2005 study of welders in Alabama ( whose medical screenings were paid for by lawyers suing the industry ) found a 7 - to 10 - times higher prevalence of neurological symptoms among the welders than within a control group .
But niosh toxicologist James Antonini says the existing studies lack good exposure data and fail to quantify “ confounding factors ” such as other workplace neurotoxins .
“ I do n’t think there ’s any really solid information out there , ” he says .
( Antonini accepted an award , albeit no cash , from a prominent welding trade group in 2006 and more recently coauthored , with several industry consultants , a literature review that jibed with the manufacturers ’ position .
“ I ’ve tried to work with everybody , ” he says . )
niosh ‘s official verdict on manganese and welding­­ — an exhaustive state - of - the - science report that will lay the pathway for government regulators — is four years overdue ; a House science committee chided the agency for the delay last December , noting that the health of some 185,000 highly exposed welders hangs in the balance .
niosh division chief Paul Schulte says the delay is nothing unusual : “ We have an array of opinions .
We ’re debating and working through them , and that ’s really the issue . ”
But Park , who worked on the report , is frustrated .
“ Right now , what ’s happening is that the lawsuits are driving the science , and that ’s pretty pathetic , ” he says .
“ I think the fact that it ’s contentious has encouraged people not to move forward . ”
if you were to graph out the welding industry ’s spending on science , you ’d see a dramatic uptick in 2003 — the year an Illinois jury awarded $ 1 million to a welder named Larry Elam .
The verdict , not surprisingly , turned a trickle of lawsuits into a flood , stoking manufacturers ’ fears that welding fumes could become the next asbestos , with the requisite ambulance chasers hopping on the bandwagon of legitimate claims .
Charles Ruth III is no ambulance chaser .
Stout and athletic like Tamraz , the 41 - year - old welder was diagnosed with manganese - induced parkinsonism in 2000 , three years after going to work at the Ingalls Shipyard in Mississippi .
When I met him , his face looked blank , his voice was a dull monotone , and his right hand shook ceaselessly .
Since his diagnosis , Ruth ’s marriage had failed and he ’d lost his job , not to mention hunting , fishing , and the church softball league .
He ca n’t even drive anymore — at one point he was detained by an officer convinced by Ruth ’s erratic driving that he ’d pulled over a drunk .
He ’s had recurring depression and suicidal thoughts , but has n’t acted on them because of his girls , ages 10 and 16 , and his 8 - year - old boy .
“ I ca n’t wrestle with my son because I ’m scared I might fall on him and hurt him , ” Ruth laments .
“ When I eat , food goes all over me . ”
No one at Ingalls ever told him , he says , that welding fumes could do this to a man .
Ruth ’s father Chuck , a retired vice president at the shipyard , says he , too , was unaware of the dangers .
“ For me it ’s a fairly easy fix , ” he says .
“ You put them in an air - fed welding helmet .
They do it with sandblasters and they could do the same thing with welders .
But if they do that , that means the industry ’s got to admit there ’s a problem . ”
Indeed , when a prominent industrial health organization proposed lowering manganese - exposure limits 25 - fold during the 1990s , a trade group that included welding companies griped in a letter that “ respirator use would become mandatory at most of our operations ” if the new limits were enacted .
Ruth ’s case settled on the eve of trial in August 2005 for seven figures .
( The exact sum is confidential . )
Industry lawyers claimed the settlement was merely the product of a procedural misstep that would have weakened their case .
But last fall , while attempting to rebut medical experts during the Tamraz trial , defense lawyer Eric Kennedy explicitly conceded that Ruth has manganism .
Since the Ruth settlement , the industry has let its insecurity show .
Last year , the manufacturers launched a PR offensive , hiring a New York firm to prepare an eight - page “ welding fume litigation status report ” full of statistics designed to steer journalists away from the manganese story ; among other things , the report noted that three cases ( out of the thousands filed ) were dismissed “ after discovery revealed that one plaintiff faked his symptoms and two others lied about illicit drug use . ”
No one could have claimed Jeffrey Tamraz was malingering — and defense lawyers did n’t , arguing instead that 60,000 Americans each year are diagnosed with Parkinson ’s of unknown origin .
“ Doctors , lawyers , teachers , bus drivers , bricklayers , we all get it , ” Kennedy insisted when the case came to court last fall .
“ And so do welders . ”
But his argument was n’t helped when the Tamraz attorneys showed a deposition video in which Toronto neurologist Anthony Lang , an expert witness for the industry , acknowledged that welding fumes likely do cause manganism .
Last December , the jury ordered the five companies to pay Jeff Tamraz $ 17.5 million , and give his wife $ 3 million more for loss of consortium .
“ The manufacturers had 60 years to hide the ball , ” says John Climaco , one of the couple ’s lawyers .
“ We ’ve now caught up . ”
And then some .
In March , Mississippi welder Robert Jowers won a $ 2.4 million verdict against three manufacturers .
Some 2,800 cases are still pending against the industry , with another 11,000 on a legal back burner known as a tolling agreement .
When Terry and Jeff Tamraz learned of their verdict , they wept .
“ I could n’t believe it , ” he says .
“ Man , we prayed and prayed and prayed . ”
But the euphoria has worn off .
There ’s an appeal to get through , and beyond that , an increasingly quiet life .
“ Jeff does n’t laugh anymore , ” Terry says .
“ Back when we were dating , he was the life of the party .
The conversation between us is minimal now . ”

My exposé of what really happened when Norway ’s OOXML vote changed from No to Yes stirred up a lot of interest .
I promised I ’d get back with more background information .
Here it is , hyperlinked into the appropriate parts of the original post .
Some people were surprised to learn that consensus is Standard Norway ’s normal method of arriving at decisions .
Actually , this is a general principle in JTC1 , as clause 1.2 of the directives states :
These Directives are inspired by the principle that the objective in the development of International Standards should be the achievement of consensus between those concerned rather than a decision based on counting votes .
I do n’t have a problem with this as a general principle .
In fact , I rather like it : standards development should be a collaborative process with the goal of unifying the interests of all concerned .
That ’s why I was happy to go along with the general idea , especially given JTC1 ’s proviso that “ consensus need not imply unanimity . ”
The problem was that the Little One ’s notion of “ consensus ” was different .
For him , there had to be total unanimity , otherwise there was no consensus .
This was reflected in the discussion of the Norwegian comments back in August 2007 , when Microsoft was effectively allowed to veto any comments it disagreed with – and in his conclusion at the March meeting that an 80 % majority did not constitute a consensus .
Given that there was never the slightest hope of the Yes and No sides reaching full agreement , his interpretation effectively meant that the committee would not have the final word .
It turns out that there used to exist a formal procedure for resolving such an impasse .
Until the reorganization of Standard Norway a few years back there were rules stating that , in the event of an inability to achieve consensus , the final decision rested with the Chairman .
These rules were scrapped during the reorganization and have never been replaced .
I never had occasion to know about them in the past , and the Little One was clearly not interested in informing the committee about any kind of established practice that might take control out of his hands .
This is one of the issues we will be following up in our appeal against the Norwegian vote .
Since there was no voting – and so far no minutes either – this tally is somewhat subjective .
However , I doubt that anyone ( even those who wanted to vote Yes ) would deny that the great majority were dissatisfied with Ecma ’s resolution of the Norwegian comments .
One indication of the size of this majority is that 21 members of the committee signed an open letter to Standard Norway the day before the meeting .
The letter ( in Norwegian ) lists four main reasons why Standard Norway should reject OOXML , as follows :
There is no need for OOXML as an ISO standard ( since it has already been published by Ecma ) .
Approving OOXML as an ISO standard would be counter to the interests of users ( since there already exists an ISO standard that covers the same ground ) .
An approval of OOXML will damage ISO ’s credibility ( because of the wide perception of unfair play and abuse of the fast - track process ) .
OOXML is substandard from a technical point of view .
These were by no means our only arguments against OOXML , but they were the ones we particularly wanted to bring to the attention of the bureaucracy in Standard Norway .
The letter concluded as follows :
Each of these arguments provides grounds enough to reject OOXML .
There is no consensus in the committee for changing Norway ’s vote , and we therefore ask Standard Norway to uphold Norway ’s No to OOXML .
The letter was signed by the following members of SN / K185 : Steve Pepper , Erlend Øverby , Lars Marius Garshol , Thomas Flemming , Keld Jørn Simonsen , Martin Bekkelund , Knut Olav Bøhmer , Arne S Nielsen , Petter Reinholdtsen , Per Inge Østmoen , Thomas Gramstad , Knut Yrvin , Per - Arne Aas , Henning Kulander , Geir Isene , Trond Heier , Bjørn Venn , Anthony Lærdahl , Tom Wahlgren , Thomas Malt , Håkon Wium Lie .
Two members expressed their complete agreement with the letter but were prevented from signing it because of their employers ’ general policy regarding this form of public debate ; another two , who we were n’t able to get hold of before publishing the letter , have subsequently added their names to the list , making a total of 25 in all .
Most of the signatories were present at the meeting and many of them took part in the debate .
Of the roughly 30 experts present , there were really only three who spoke in favour of approving OOXML : Microsoft Norway ’s chief lobbyist ( who spoke a lot ) , Microsoft Norway ’s VP of Communications , and a representative of Statoil Hydro , the national oil company .
Two others ( one from Microsoft , the other from the lobbyist ’s own company ) sat nodding in assent .
So the 80 % figure is pretty accurate , plus / minus a couple of points .
Another interesting indicator of the strength of opinion against OOXML in Norway is the fact that every single long - time member of the Norwegian committee ( i.e. those who have contributed their expertise over many years and did n’t join just because of OOXML ) signed the open letter and were opposed to the approval of OOXML .
So if you do n’t trust the 80 % figure , go with 100 % of the old - timers …
The argument introduced by the Little One at the end of the meeting ( but without allowing any discussion ) was that we should now think “ tactically ” .
OOXML is here to stay , he said , so from a tactical point of view we should look for the best way to ensure that it continued to be improved .
We have a choice between rejecting it ( and thus leaving it in Ecma ) , or approving it ( and bringing it under ISO ’s control ) .
You can see the logic of this argument from the point of view of a standards bureaucrat : the prestige of an organization like ISO is directly proportional to the importance of the standards it controls .
Rejecting OOXML would mean leaving it in the hands of Ecma , a rival organization , and that could not be countenanced .
I suspect that this is what ultimately motivated the Little One and his counterparts in many other national standards organizations – especially those , like him , who have close ties with the central JTC1 bureaucracy itself .
( The Little One is apparently a member of ISO ’s Technical Management Board , ironically the body that will review any appeal against the OOXML process . )
So was the Norway vote the result of corruption , as some people have suggested ?
That depends on what you mean by corruption , but I have no reason to claim that it was .
Overt corruption is very rare inside Norway , but there is a kind of old boy network ( known as “ gutteklubben grei ” ) that works very nicely according to the principle of “ you scratch my back , I ’ll scratch yours . ”
It will be interesting to see where the Little One ends up once we ’ve removed him from his present position ; I may yet have cause to modify my analysis , but as things stand my conclusion is this : what we have witnessed is an unholy alliance based on a coincidence of material interests between a large multinational corporation and a standards bureaucracy eager to maintain its own prestige .
And because of that I truly fear for the future of ISO .
While we ’re on the subject of corruption , a couple of words about Microsoft ’s principal supporter in Norway , StatoilHydro ( which has actually been accused of tolerating corruption in some of its dealings abroad ) .
They are a big MS Office user , they participated in TC45 ( the Ecma committee responsible for OOXML ) and they clearly feel that OOXML is important to them .
I can understand why .
An enormous amount of their intellectual capital is tied up in proprietary formats – in particular Excel – that have been owned and controlled by a vendor for the last 20 or so years .
StatoilHydro has literally had no way of getting at its own information , short of paying license fees to Microsoft .
Recently the company has started to realize the enormity of the mistake it has made in not treating its information with the care and respect it deserves .
I would go as far as to accuse them of criminal negligence , especially as a state - owned corporation , were it not for that fact that pretty much every large organization has behaved in the same irresponsible way until recently .
So now Statoil Hydro suddenly wakes up to the fact that their intellectual capital is being held hostage and starts to put pressure on the vendor .
The vendor reacts by migrating to XML and publishing their specifications – a praiseworthy move in and of itself .
Now the customer is assured that its information can be stored in a format that will be accessible using a wide range of tools , and that should have been the end of the story .
Instead the vendor decides it needs the ISO stamp of approval in order to maintain market share , discovers an easily tamed organization that has a back - door into ISO , and manages to convince Statoil Hydro that publication of OOXML as a Microsoft specification is not enough .
Ownership of the specification needs to be transferred to a “ neutral ” body .
StatoilHydro agrees to act as a fig leaf in this process by joining Ecma .
They then allow themselves to be convinced that having OOXML approved as an ISO standard is even more in their interests .
Quite why they think this is beyond me .
I have had several conversations with the Statoil Hydro representative and it seems to me that what lies at the bottom is an attempt to find a short - term solution that will help them cover their backsides in terms of the above - mentioned criminal negligence : after all , no - one is going to be fired for maintaining the company ’s intellectual assets in an ISO - approved format .
The long - term problem – that the balkanization of office document standards is going to promote further vendor lock - in – is not something they seem unduly worried about .
That will be someone else ’s problem ten years down the line .

Fears are mounting that Wall Street banks are relying too heavily on tens of billions of dollars in loans made available by the US Federal Reserve .
Their borrowing levels have rocketed by almost 200 per cent to $ 38bn ( £ 19 bn ) a day in just three weeks .
The latest loan data released by the Fed shows that Wall Street banks and investment firms borrowed an average of $ 38.4 bn every day last week , a big jump from the $ 32.9 bn borrowed the week before , but almost three times the $ 13.4bn borrowed when the emergency scheme was launched on 17 March .
The loan programme was part of a wider Wall Street rescue package ushered in to stave off the imminent collapse of Bear Stearns , the troubled investment bank being bought by JP Morgan .
The scheme , called the Primary Dealer Credit Facility , is made available through the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and is designed to help big investment banks oil the wheels of the credit market so they can continue with business as usual , even though the credit crunch shows no signs of abating .
The Fed has capped the amount available to all banks at $ 50bn , although insiders said it never imagined the banks would take advantage of the entire facility .
Analysts and economists now fear it is being too heavily exploited , and that banks may be using it to delay facing up to liquidity problems .
David Wyss , the chief economist at Standard & Poor 's , thinks the Fed loan programme is a good idea , and perhaps the only way that government can keep the credit markets churning .
Even so , he believes taking out such large short - term loans could cause problems .
' My fear is that the banks could become too dependent on this money .
At some point , the Fed will have to wean them off these loans , but how it does that I do not know , ' he said .

While all of the media focus is on Hillary Clinton ’s desire to be vice president , in this edition of Pros and Cons we ’ll take a look at a different woman , Kansas governor Kathleen Sebelius .
Could Sebelius be the non-Clinton ticket option for Obama ?
Resume : Kathleen Sebelius is the currently serving her second term as Kansas governor .
Prior to this she began her career by being elected to the Kansas House of Representatives in 1986 .
She left her seat in 1994 , to run for a win the office of state insurance commissioner .
She is credited with ending the influence of the insurance industry over the office of the insurance commissioner .
Sebelius was born in Ohio , and is the daughter of the former governor John J. Gilligan .
She is a former chair of Democratic Governors Association , and was tapped by the Democratic Party to deliver their response to President Bush ’s 2008 State of the Union Address .
Pros to picking Sebelius :
She is a very popular governor who has not had an approval rating under 60 % in over two years .
Adding her to the ticket would force the McCain campaign to spend some it s resources to keep a state in their column that should be solidly his .
She could help soothe the feeling of many female Clinton supporters who desperately want to see a woman in the White House .
Advertisements
She is from Ohio , and her family history would certainly help the ticket in that critical swing state .
She has been a public supporter of Obama ’s campaign , and she and Obama are ideologically similar .
She is a solid campaigner who has demonstrated a strong appeal with conservative Democrats and some Republicans .
Cons to picking Sebelius :
Even though she a star of the Democratic Party , Sebelius is virtually unknown nationally .
Picking a woman other than Hillary Clinton may only serve to infuriate her supporters .
Sebelius vetoed a bill that would have allowed citizens who get permits to carry concealed weapons .
This might not seem like much , but it is an issue that the Republicans and the NRA would jump on to paint the ticket as anti-gun .
This criticism would hurt Obama most with voters in places like Pennsylvania and Michigan .
It is unlikely that Sebelius would help Obama in the South or West with rural white men .
She is still untested on the national stage , and has no foreign policy experience .
Sebelius would provide a gender balance , but she would n’t help the ticket much on non-domestic issues .
Odds of Obama selecting Sebelius :
Her chances were much better until Hillary Clinton expressed an interest in being on the ticket .
Even with Hillary in the picture , Sebelius should be on the Obama ’s shortlist .
If the campaign decides that they want a fresh face that can help promote their change message , Kathleen Sebelius would be a very good choice .
Even if she does n’t get on the ticket , I ’m pretty sure that when her term is up in 2010 , she is going to challenge , the less than popular Sam Brownback for his Senate seat .
The Choice - O- Meter Says :
OOOOOO ( 6 Os for Kathleen Sebelius )
( 1 O = No Chance – 10 Os = A Sure Thing )
The Supreme Court debated two California cases Monday that could shape the future of law enforcement , one to decide whether sex crimes from the distant past can be prosecuted now and the other to decide whether county sheriffs can carry out raids on Indian reservations .
California is the only state to have repealed its time limit for filing charges for sex crimes against children .
And if the state wins in the high court , Bush administration lawyers say they will press for new national laws that would allow prosecutors to reopen old cases where DNA evidence is found .
“ This could be a watershed in the law , ” says Seattle attorney Jeff Fisher , who represented the National Assn. of Criminal Defense Lawyers in the case .

The outcome could affect dozens of prosecutions for old sex crimes .
It could also have some effect on the civil suits involving priests accused of sexual molestation , because a criminal conviction can be used to bolster a lawsuit seeking damages .
However , if the high court strikes down the California law , the ruling could be used by defense lawyers to limit inquiries into allegations of sexual misconduct from the past .
Until now , most legal experts have assumed the Constitution ’s ex post facto clause bars the government from reopening a case after the time limit for prosecution has expired .
But the California Legislature in 1994 repealed the time limit for filing charges against the perpetrators of sex crimes against people who were younger than 18 at the time .
Advertisement
To screen out false claims , the law also said prosecutors must have “ independent evidence that clearly and convincingly corroborates the victim ’s allegations . ”
Under the new law , Marion Stogner , a 70 - year - old Contra Costa man , was charged in 1998 with sexually molesting one daughter from 1955 to 1964 and another daughter from 1967 to 1973 .
He contended the charges were an after - the - fact punishment , because the time limit for filing most sex charges in California was three years .
The California Supreme Court rejected the same challenge in a separate case in 1998 .
Advertisement
Nonetheless , the U.S. Supreme Court took up Stog - ner ’s appeal , and the justices sounded closely split during Monday ’s argument .
“ The state of California is bound by its laws and its degrees .
And we have a vested right to be free from prosecution and punishment ” after the time limit has expired , said Roberto Najera , a public defender from Martinez , Calif. , who represents Stogner .
“ This court should hold the state to the bargain it made . ”
But Janet Gaard , an assistant attorney general from Sacramento , said the state had not changed the crime or the punishment for it .
Advertisement
“ This does not criminalize conduct that was innocent when it was done , ” she said .
Stogner knew his abuse of his daughter was a crime in 1955 or in 1967 , Gaard said .
He had “ a fair warning , ” she said , so the state has not reneged on a bargain .
Four liberal justices -- Ruth Bader Ginsburg , David H. Souter , John Paul Stevens and Stephen G. Breyer -- voiced skepticism about the state ’s case .
“ This is reviving a dead case , ” Ginsburg commented .
“ And you are making an across - the - board argument , ” she added , not limited to crimes against children .
While the state law reopened cases involving past crimes against children , its legal brief argued that the government could reopen past criminal cases of all sorts without violating the ex post facto ban .
Advertisement
Bush administration lawyers joined the case on California ’s side , arguing that Congress too can revive old cases by repealing the time limits .
Breyer said he was taken aback by this claim .
“ I had thought this was absolutely contrary to the Constitution .
What has changed ? ” he asked .
A Justice Department lawyer replied that the high court had never said it was unconstitutional to reopen cases after the time for prosecution had expired .
Advertisement
Stevens said that was so because it was presumed to be unconstitutional .
“ Is there any precedent of this court that supports this view ? ” he asked , referring to California ’s argument .
No , the government lawyer acknowledged .
However , Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and his conservative colleagues disputed the public defender ’s claims .
“ We have to take state law the way it comes to us , and the California Supreme Court did n’t see it ” as increasing the punishment for a past crime , Rehnquist said .
Advertisement
Because the state is not creating a new crime or increasing the punishment for an old crime , the repeal of the time limits does not violate the ex post facto principle , he suggested .
California has no time limit for bringing charges of murder , embezzlement of public funds and a few other crimes that carry a life prison term .
But most felonies must be charged within three years .
These statutes of limitation are intended to help police and prosecutors deal with fresh cases .
They also protect defendants from being accused of crimes years after the fact , when it might be hard to find evidence or witnesses to rebut the charges .
But these time limits also meant the sexual abuse of children often went punished .
That concern prompted the 1994 repeal .

The case is Stogner vs. California , 01 -1757 .
In the second case debated Monday , the court struggled to clarify when state and county police can enforce the law on Indian reservations .
Generally , state police can go after individuals for crimes , including on reservations , but the tribes and their operations are shielded by the doctrine of “ tribal sovereignty . ”
But sometimes , the line between the two is unclear .
Advertisement
Three years ago , Inyo County prosecutors believed three workers at a tribal casino in Bishop were welfare cheats .
They asked the tribe for its payroll records and were turned down .
Then , armed with a search warrant , they raided the reservation , cut the locks in a storage room and seized the records .
The tribe sued , and last year the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the prosecutors could be held liable for violating tribal sovereignty .
“ This could have disastrous consequences , ” said John Kirby , a lawyer for the Inyo prosecutors .
State and county police need to be able to enforce the law , he said .
Advertisement
But a lawyer for the tribe , backed by the Justice Department , said its sovereignty should be respected .
The justices said they were searching for a narrow way to resolve the case , perhaps by ruling that commercial records can be seized .
“ This [ casino ] was a commercial operation , not the [ tribal ] government itself , ” said Justice Antonin Scalia .
The case , Inyo County vs. Paiute - Shoshone Indians , 02 - 281 , will be decided within several months .
A New Energy Leader Brazil Wants to Join OPEC
Brazilian President Luiz Ignacio Lula da Silva wants to get his country into OPEC -- a move that could lower the price of oil worldwide .
With a booming biofuel business alongside new oil reserves , Brazil is poised to become a global energy leader .
United Launch Alliance ( ULA ) has enough unsold Delta 2 rockets in inventory to meet NASA 's forecasted demand through at least 2015 and could wait until 2012 to decide whether to restart production of the reliable but increasingly expensive workhorse , a top company executive said .
Dan Collins , ULA 's chief operating officer , also said the company is considering ways to reduce the Delta 2's price tag as well as developing a less powerful , lower - cost variant of its larger Atlas 5 or Delta 4 rockets .
Speaking June 25 here at a meeting of the National Research Council 's Space Studies Board , he said ULA of Denver has no intention of ceding the medium - lift launch market it has dominated for decades to new rockets being developed Orbital Sciences Corp. and Space Exploration Technologies ( SpaceX ) .
" There 's been a lot of talk about [ how ] we need to go fill the gap [ with ] the demise of Delta 2 , " Collins told the board .
" Part of my message for you today is we do n't know of any gap .
We have Delta 2s in inventory that are unsold .
We plan on continuing to sell those .
With the change in the requirements that we will see as the [ U.S. Air Force Medium Launch Vehicle 3 ] program goes away , we are adjusting Delta 2 and bringing the price down . "
The Air Force has been using the Delta 2 since 1989 , primarily to launch GPS navigation satellites .
With the last of the current - generation GPS satellites slated to lift off aboard a Delta 2 later this year , ULA 's long - running Medium Launch Vehicle contract is coming to an end .
An internal study conducted by NASA in 2007 concluded that Delta 2 launch prices , already hovering in the $ 80 million range , likely would soar once the Air Force abandons the program in favor of manifesting future generations of GPS satellites aboard ULA 's larger Atlas 5 and Delta 4 rockets .
NASA has been the other big Delta 2 customer in recent years .
The NASA study , conducted by the agency 's in - house rocket buyers , recommended following the Air Force 's lead by phasing out Delta 2 and shifting more payloads to Atlas 5 or Delta 4 until a more affordable medium - lift launcher comes along .
While the Air Force has been the anchor customer for Delta 2 since the beginning , Collins said the service 's abandonment of the program gives ULA the opportunity to reduce costs without compromising reliability .
" There have been requirements in the government mission set that have driven cost , " Collins said , citing as an example the Air Force 's insistence that the Delta 2 be kept ready to launch within 40 days of call up .
" That drives significant cost into a program , " Collins said .
" For instance , it drives having two launch pads at Cape Canaveral .
We will not continue to operate two launch pads . "
Collins said dropping the 40 - day call up requirement also would permit ULA to " significantly lower " the number of people it needs on hand to launch Delta 2 .
" So we will see significant changes in the cost structure on the Delta 2 with a significant inventory to continue flying , " Collins said .
" We plan on being exceptionally competitive in the medium market for the foreseeable future . "
ULA has " around half a dozen " unsold Delta 2 rockets on hand , a sufficient inventory , Collins told the board , to meet NASA 's scaled - back demand through 2015 .
" We do n't see any need to guess what the market is going to be in 2016 , " Collins said , later adding , " When people actually start having programs of record you can start at the time bringing the right vehicle to market . "
If by 2012 , NASA and other potential customers are forecasting a combined eight to 10 medium launches a year beyond 2015 , Collins said , ULA could financially justify restarting Delta 2 production .
But if forecasted demand is only four to seven launches annually , Collins said , ULA would be more likely go after that market with a vehicle that combines a new low - cost upper stage with an Atlas 5 or Delta 4 booster core .
Collins said the medium - lift launch market will be extremely competitive for at least the next several years .
" There are six launchers out there trying to split a market of about six launches a year , " Collins said .
" We 're all going to be out trying to make a living in this market and it 's going to be difficult . "
Collins told the board ULA is determined to stay in the medium market and make Delta 2 , or its successor , competitive with the price point Orbital Sciences is shooting for with its planned Taurus 2 rocket .
" We think there 's a premium that comes with the experience and reliability record [ of Delta 2 ] , but there 's only so much that premium can demand , so we need to get down in that same area , " Collins said .
" Can we get all the way there ?
I hope so .
But if not I think we can get pretty close . "
ULA does not disclose Delta 2 pricing , but Collins said NASA pays the company less than what the agency requires its programs to budget for a Delta 2 launch .
Appearing alongside Collins were executives from Orbital Sciences and SpaceX who gave the board updates on their efforts to field Delta 2 - class competitors .
Robert T. Richards , vice president of Orbital 's Launch Systems Group , said Orbital and its investors are prepared to spend $ 200 million developing Taurus 2 , a medium - class rocket the company expects to launch from Virginia 's eastern shore in December 2010 as part of a NASA - funded demonstration .
He said Orbital also has hardware in production for a second rocket that could fly a few months earlier if the company finds a customer that needs to launch a medium - sized satellite then .
He said Orbital of Dulles , Va. , is aiming to offer Delta 2 - class performance at a lower price , or around $ 65 million a launch .
" There are some edges of the envelope where a Delta 2 Heavy might have a little more performance , but essentially you should think of it as a Delta 2 , " Richards said .
ULA used a Delta 2 Heavy to loft NASA 's Gamma-ray Large Area Telescope into orbit June 11 from from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station , Fla .
The 4,230 - kilogram spacecraft required a Delta 2 augmented with nine strap - on boosters .
Hawthorne , Calif . - based SpaceX , the rocket start - up created six years ago by PayPal co-founder Elon Musk , aims to price its Falcon 9 rocket significantly below Taurus 2 .
SpaceX , like Orbital , is getting financial assistance from NASA under the agency 's Commercial Orbital Transportation Services program .
Larry Williams , SpaceX vice president of strategic relations , told the Space Studies Board that the company is offering Falcon 9 launches for $ 36.75 million to $ 57.75 million depending on the size of the payload and desired destination .
International Space Station - bound cargo flights involving the company 's reusable Dragon capsule , Williams said , will cost between $ 80 million and $ 100 million
Williams said SpaceX believes it can deliver on its promise of lower launch prices by taking the " Wal - Mart approach , " which he characterized as doing hundreds of things 1 percent cheaper than the competition rather than trying to do one thing 90 percent cheaper .
SpaceX has conducted two launches of the smaller Falcon 1 rocket to date , neither of which succeeded in reaching orbit .
A third Falcon 1 launch had been tentatively slated for June , but Williams said that attempt has been pushed off until late July or early August due to " a bit of a range issue " at the Kwajalein missile range , where the company has a launch pad .
The first Falcon 9 rocket is expected to arrive at Cape Canaveral by the end of the year for an early 2009 launch for a U.S. government customer SpaceX says it is not permitted to name .

June 19 , 2008  --
Intelligence agencies in the United States and Canada are warning of mounting signs that Hezbollah , backed by Iran , is poised to mount a terror attack against " Jewish targets " somewhere outside the Middle East .
Intelligence officials tell ABC
News the group has activated suspected " sleeper cells " in Canada and key operatives have been tracked moving outside the group 's Lebanon base to Canada , Europe and Africa .
Officials say Hezbollah is seeking revenge for the February assassination of Hezbollah 's military commander , Imad Mugniyah , killed by a car bomb in Damascus , Syria .
The group 's leaders blamed Israel , an allegation denied by Israeli officials .
There is no credible information on a specific target , according to the officials .
Suspected Hezbollah operatives have conducted recent surveillance on the Israeli embassy in Ottawa , Canada and on several synagogues in Toronto , according to the officials .
Latin American is also considered a possible target by officials following Hezbollah 's planning .
A senior US counter - terrorism official told ABC News , " There are concerns Hezbollah might be ready to do something along those lines . "
Three US law enforcement agencies say they have been briefed on the developments by intelligence agencies .
A spokesperson for the Canadian Security Intelligence Service says the agency does not comment on the existence of ongoing intelligence operations .
Officials say the CIA , the NSA , and British and Canadian intelligence agencies began to pick up a steady stream of information - from electronic intercepts , human sources and surveillance - about a possible Hezbollah attack on Feb. 17 , just days after the Beirut funeral of Mugniyah where Hezbollah leaders publicly declared they would seek revenge .
" They want to kill as many people as they can , they want it to be a big splash , " said former CIA intelligence officer Bob Baer , who says he met with Hezbollah leaders in Beirut last month .
" They can not have an operation fail , " said Baer , " and I do n't think they will .
They 're the A - team of terrorism . "
Alarms were first raised in Canada , where as many as 20 suspected Hezbollah members have been under surveillance after as many as four suspected " sleeper cells " were activated , including one known as " Rashedan , " intelligence officials tell ABC News .
The members also received instruction to send their family members home to Lebanon , according to officials .
Officials have also reported that a known Hezbollah weapons expert was followed to Canada , where he was seen at a firing range south of Toronto , near the US border .
Intelligence officials said the recent Hezbollah activities were being coordinated with the help of Iran 's elite Revolutionary Guards .
" Hezbollah would not carry out an attack in the west , or wherever this attack is going to occur , without approval from Tehran , " said Baer , the former CIA intelligence officer .
Baer says his Hezbollah contacts told him an attack against the US was unlikely because Iran and Hezbollah did not want to give the Bush administration an excuse to attack .
While US officials say there is no credible information of a Hezbollah attack on American soil , the Homeland Security Secretary , Michael Chertoff , told Fox News two weeks ago , that " they make al Qaeda look like a minor league team . "
" Hezbollah remains a threat to security in different parts of the world , " said FBI Special Agent Richard Kolko , section chief for the national Press Office .
" The FBI Joint Terrorism Task Forces conduct investigations into different groups that potentially pose a threat to the US or our interests overseas ; however , the FBI and DHS have no specific intelligence about any group or so called sleeper cells planning an attack .
Our job is to gather intelligence , work with our domestic and international partners to identify and disrupt any terrorism event , " said Kolko .
Toronto has long been considered an important city for Hezbollah fund - raising and organizing , according to officials .
Pro-Hezbollah rallies and billboards depicting Hezbollah 's leader , Hassan Nasrallah , have outraged Jewish groups .
" Because of lax immigration policies , it became a center for Hezbollah operations outside the Middle East , " said Malcolm Hoenlein , of the Conference of Presidents of Major Jewish Organizations .
Hezbollah was declared a terror group by the government of Canada in December , 2002 , leading to an increased surveillance of suspected members .
The last major attack by the terror group outside of the Middle East occurred in Buenos Aires , Argentina in 1994 .
Argentinean authorities formally blamed Hezbollah and Iran for attacks on a Jewish community center that killed 85 people .
Twenty - nine people died in an attack on the Israeli embassy in Buenos Aires in 1992 that was also blamed on Hezbollah and Iran .
As a political organization , Hezbollah , which means " Party of God , " plays a significant role in Lebanese politics as the leading opposition force .
Founded in 1982 , following Israel 's invasion of Lebanon , the group came to represent Lebanon 's Shiite population and has increased its power and influence in recent months .
The mobile software age is here .
Symbian co-founder Nokia announced Monday night that it is buying the 52 percent of the software maker that it does n’t already own and releasing its mobile operating system under an open source license .
With that move , Symbian joins two other major platforms – the Google - backed Android operating system and Apple 's OS X iPhone – that give programmers tools for creating and deploying software for smartphones .
The Symbian OS dominates the world market , with about 60 percent of the installed base among smartphones .
According to Nokia , more than 200 million phones currently in use worldwide are running Symbian software .
But Symbian trails in the United States , where Research in Motion , Palm , Windows Mobile – and now the iPhone – are the major players .
Nokia uses Symbian software across its range of mobile devices , primarily with the extremely popular S60 interface .
Other handset companies also use some variety of the Symbian operating system , including Sony Ericsson , Motorola and NTT DoCoMo .
" Nokia could , if they found inside the corporation the resolve to do so , come out with the definitive open platform , " said Bruce Perens , an open source advocate and CEO of Kiloboot .
" They would have a platform of the type we have n't seen since the original Palm .
When that was dominant , there were 16,000 applications available to install .
The question is , can they find the corporate resolve ? "
The prospect of thousands of mobile apps – instead of the few dozen typically available through most wireless carriers – is something new in the wireless world .
And the 6 million iPhones sold to date show that mobile users like having open , unfettered access to web applications and online content .
In short , what matters to handsets now is not so much features , graphics chips and innovative interfaces – though those do help .
What 's critical is an easy - to - use development platform that enables programmers to create a wide range of software quickly and easily , so that they can give consumers the content and the software they demand .
Android ( whose first handsets are expected later this year ) is clearly aimed at that goal .
And while it 's not open source , Apple has built a complete developer ecosystem around the iPhone , including everything from development tools to a store ( which will open next month ) for selling finished applications .
That 's a significant shift from just a year ago , when programming tools for handsets were specialized and difficult to use , and carriers and handset manufacturers alike kept a tight rein on mobile application deployment .
To support the new open source project , Nokia is establishing the Symbian Foundation , a collective of hardware and software companies that have pledged to donate code and resources to Symbian 's development .
Phone makers Motorola and Sony Ericsson are on board , contributing software from their UIQ project , a touchscreen interface for Symbian .
Japanese carrier NTT DoCoMo has pledged support and is contributing its Symbian interface , MOAP ( S ) .
Other supporters include AT&T , Samsung and Texas Instruments .
" Establishing the foundation is one of the biggest contributions to an open community ever made , " said Olli -Pekka Kallasvuo , CEO of Nokia , somewhat hyperbolically .
But it is true that Nokia has , at one stroke , created an enormous open - source ecosystem , thanks to the huge number of Symbian phones already in use .
Nokia 's move is a defensive one , of course .
The Symbian Foundation plan is strikingly similar to Google 's plan with the Open Handset Alliance , a collective of industry players who have come together to build and nurture the Android open source mobile operating system .
On the carrier side , Google has NTT DoCoMo , Sprint Nextel and T - Mobile on board .
On the hardware side , HTC , LG , Motorola and Samsung have signed on to support Android .
Nokia says it is even taking a Google - like approach to rolling out the open source code .
It will release components of its code under an open source license at first , with the full OS to follow " over the next two years . "
Right now , Nokia says , it intends to release Symbian under the Eclipse Public License ( EPL ) 1.0 .
But not everyone is convinced that open source operating systems are the way to go .
" With the success of Apple 's and RIM 's models , we would have thought traditional handset vendors would develop and maintain similar proprietary OS models , " said Tavis McCourt , a Morgan Keegan analyst .
" We view this move as a long - term positive for the smartphone vendors that own their own OS ( RIM , Apple and , soon , Palm ) . "
And it 's still too soon to tell which mobile platform will win out .
Symbian has the advantage of a large installed base ; Android will benefit from the pure innovation seen when developers take a " sky 's the limit " approach to building a new OS .
And Apple provides a complete , turnkey approach to software sales via its iTunes App Store , which may appeal to consumers .
One thing 's for sure :
The floodgates are opening , and the coming year will see an explosion of mobile software for a wide range of smartphones .

At a campaign stop in Prestonburg , Kentucky , Sen. Hillary Clinton said that an election analysis by a firm led by Karl Rove supports the argument that she is a stronger Democratic candidate than Sen. Barack Obama .
Said Clinton , " There 've been a lot of analysis [ sic ] about which of us is stronger to win against Sen.
McCain , and I believe I am the stronger candidate .
And just today I found some curious support for that position when one of the TV networks released an analysis done by -- of all people -- Karl Rove saying that I was the stronger candidate .
Somebody got a hold of his analysis and there it is . "
Clinton also claimed that she now has won more votes " to be nominated " than anyone in either party has ever garnered in a White House run .
Rove has been a polarizing figure in politics for years .
He was , until August of 2007 , President Bush 's closest adviser and Deputy Chief of Staff .
He has also been drawn into legal battles , including testifying in the Libby CIA leak case and presently defying a request to testify before the House Judiciary Committee on politically - motivated prosecutions in the Justice Department .
In addition to running his consulting firm , Rove now appears as a political analyst on Fox News among other endeavors .

Do Carlin's ' Seven Dirty Words ' Still Shock ?
Comedians argue for more curses on TV ; critics say it wo n't happen anytime soon .
June 24 , 2008  --
You wo n't hear the seven dirty words come out of George Carlin 's mouth again , and it 's doubtful you 'll ever hear them all on broadcast television , either .
Carlin , who died Sunday at age 71 , cemented his reputation as one of comedy 's most crass with his expletive - laced 1972 monologue , " Seven Words You Can Never Say on Television " ( or re-print here ) .
Not only did Carlin 's cavalier ode to curses shock and offend his critics , it also led to a landmark Supreme Court ruling about what could and could not be said on broadcast TV and radio .
Despite that 1978 ruling , the Federal Communications Commission does n't have a list of words it considers profane .
In its consumer fact sheet , the FCC defines profanity as " including language so grossly offensive to members of the public who actually hear it as to amount to a nuisance . "
So , with no black and white rules , it 's up to the networks to decide what words are appropriate for air .
While conventions have changed since the 70s , -- s*** is fine on basic cable past 10 p.m. , and anything goes on premium channels -- for the most part , any slur more vivid than " ass " or " b****" ( neither of which Carlin included among his set of seven ) is verboten on broadcast TV .
Joan Rivers thinks that 's just dumb .
" It 's so silly and so stupid , " said the veteran comedian and fashion critic , who got kicked off British television last week for saying f*** and s*** on a show that she noted was named , of all things , " Loose Women . "
" I think this is such a rough , tough , fast world , and everyone in their house should make their own rules .
But do n't make me fit in with your lifestyle when I 've never met you .
You have a child up at 11 p.m. , and you 're worried about what they 'll hear on TV ?
Put your child to bed and then sit down and hear the word c***.
[ One of Carlin 's ' Seven . ' ] "
Paul Mooney , who wrote for Carlin 's contemporary Richard Pryor , echoed Rivers ' call to loosen standards , given an appropriate time ( after 10 p.m. ) and forum ( comedic ) .
" You do n't go to a topless club and say , ' Why does n't she put a bra on ? '
We should be allowed to say what we want to say , " Mooney said .
" Too many people are trying to control us , period .
That 's the problem .
This is insanity .
It 's double talk .
And I do n't want to hear any double talk , I want straight talk . "
But it 's unlikely the FCC will embrace comedians ' call to let curses run rampant across the air .
More than three decades after Carlin first uttered his monologue , television and culture critics still consider his words too shocking for mainstream TV , especially in an atmosphere made even more sensitive by Don Imus and Michael Richards ' 2007 racially - charged rants .
" The short answer is we 're a long way away before Carlin 's routine can be on broadcast TV , " said David Bianculli , who critiques TV for NPR's " Fresh Air " and tvworthwatching .com .
" Cable 's loosening up more and more , but broadcast seems to be tightening .
There are examples of things that were OK in the 70s that are n't allowed now , like slurs in ' All in the Family ' that just would n't get by today .
" You may just have to wait for a generational power shift at the networks , " he continued .
" Certainly , in the 50s , you could n't even use the word ' pregnant ' on ' I Love Lucy . '
We 've grown up a lot from there , but it 's because a generation grew up . "
The FCC has loosened up in recent years , suggesting that generational shift could be on the horizon .
In 2003 , U2's Bono gushed , " this is really , really f****** brilliant " while accepting a Golden Globe , which sent 234 complaints -- against TV stations that carried the awards show -- flooding into the FCC .
But the FCC did n't levy sanctions .
Instead , it decided the f-word is permissible on broadcast TV as long as it does " not describe sexual or excretory activities or functions . "
That does n't mean the f-word will become as ubiquitous as " b****" or " ass " on broadcast anytime soon .
Certainly , there are more than 234 Americans ready to fight if the FCC embraces f*** in all its scatalogical , sexual glory .
Kristen
Fyfe is one of them .
" We are a less civil society now than we were 30 years ago , and a lot of that comes through language and how we speak to each other , " said Fyfe , a senior writer for the Culture and Media Institute , which , on its Web site , says it aims to " preserve and help restore America 's culture , character , traditional values , and morals against the assault of the liberal media elite . "
" We may be in a place where culturally , people do n't cover their ears when they hear [ f *** ] , but as a parent of two kids , I feel like I need to watch broadcast TV with a remote in my hand to keep some sort of boundaries in my home , " Fyfe continued .
" Maybe people would n't be shocked by the ' Seven Dirty Words ' today , but I think they 'd still find it tasteless . "
So , for the foreseeable future , you 'll have to tune to premium cable ( HBO , Showtime ) or select basic cable programs ( " Secret Stash , " a block of language - unedited hilarity that Comedy Central airs every Saturday and Sunday at 1 a .m. ) to get a fix of filth .
And for those who really want to be shocked , Rivers has a suggestion :
" Come and see me at the Cutting Room , " she said , referring to her upcoming , raunch - filled show at the NYC nightclub .
" There 's still shock , believe there 's plenty .
I 'm still shocking them . "
Google has launched a couple of new features for Google Reader , including the ability to share items with friends even when they are n’t in an RSS feed — through a bookmarklet like the ones that Facebook and about a gazillion other sites have — as well as the ability to add “ notes ” to the items that you ’re sharing from within Reader .
I think these baby steps ( and they are baby steps ) are a nice addition to Google Reader , and a year ago they might have even been groundbreaking , but next to the kind of things that FriendFeed and others are doing with sharing and commenting , they actually look kind of lame .
Do n’t get me wrong — sharing things within Reader from a bookmarklet is a nice feature to have , although as Adam Ostrow ( who also co-owns the new Readburner site , which is a community built around Reader shared items ) notes at Mashable , there have been hacks that allowed you to do pretty much the same thing if you really wanted to .
But I do n’t really see the point of having the ability to add a note to what you ’ve shared .
Maybe I ’m just missing the point ( although I do like the fact that shared items now look different in your Reader items view ) .
One of the biggest problems with Google Reader is that it ’s disconnected from everything .
That was a problem with FriendFeed.com too , until the site — founded and run by former Googlers , including Paul Buchheit and Bret Taylor — added the ability to post comments back to Twitter while also keeping them within FriendFeed as well .
I think that kind of cross-posting ability is a huge plus .
One of the other irritants with Google Reader is that it adds people as your friends even if you ’ve only emailed them once or twice ( Google Chat does the same thing ) .
That ’s just dumb .
In any case , GReader ’s added features are nice , but they ’re going to have to step up the pace a bit over at the Googleplex .
Audit : Up to 400 State Department laptops missing
The State Department has lost track of as many as 400 laptop computers , an internal audit ordered by the Inspector General has found .
" The importance of safeguarding official laptops and office equipment containing sensitive information is not a new concern , " said State Department overseer Rep. Nita M. Lowey ( D - NY ) through a spokesperson to CQ Politics .
" I intend to review the facts about this situation . "
The computers belong to the Anti-Terrorism Assistance Program , run by the Bureau of Diplomatic Security , which protects diplomats during stateside visits and trains and equips foreign police , intelligence and security forces .
Anonymous sources say that officials are " urgently " scouring offices in the Washington , D.C. area to account for the equipment .
The State Department is not keeping good records of its inventory , official John Streufert told a panel at a February 6 meeting on the security of " personal identification information , " citing a " significant deficiency . "
Mark Duda , the Inspector General 's representative , also warned of scandal like the one that erupted in May of 2006 , after the home of a Veterans Administration employee was burglarized and a laptop he was using for a work project , containing names , Social Security numbers and birthdates of more than 26 million people , was taken .
" It s the worst flaw you can have in management control , " said a " close observer . "
The Global War on Habeas JB My Op - Ed on Boumediene appears in this week 's U.S. News and World Report online .
My starting point is John Ashcroft 's abortive proposal to suspend habeas corpus shortly after 9/11 .
The idea was quickly scuttled by Congress ; but if we connect the dots between the treatment of Yasser Hamdi , Jose Padilla , and the detainees at Guantanamo , Bagram , and the CIA black sites , we 'll see that the spirit of the proposal lived on : the Bush Administration sought to get rid of habeas by other means .
The Administration also sought to get rid of other obligations , like those in the Geneva Conventions , that would have required fair processes for sorting out combatants and noncombatants , and ensuring that detainees were treated humanely .
Indeed , one can't understand the fight over habeas in the courts apart from the Adminstration 's decision to avoid procedural obligations of fair treatment under Geneva .
The point of getting rid of habeas and those procedures required under international law was not simply incapacitation of dangerous persons : it was to avoid accountability for what the Administration did to detainees , whether it was driving Jose Padilla literally insane or the abuse and torture at Gitmo , Bagram and the black sites .
The Administration did n't simply want to hold people : it wanted to interrogate people and it wanted to use torture and various forms of prisoner abuse as an interrogation technique .
Like the obligations under Geneva , habeas hearings might get in the way of that strategy , even if habeas only reached the question of the legality of detention , and not conditions of confinement .
Over the course of four years , the Supreme Court limited and hemmed in this strategy , first with respect to citizens , and later with respect to non-citizens held at Guantanamo .
That 's quite surprising in some ways :
Courts generally defer to the executive in time of war , especially if Congress seems to go along .
It was only the radical nature of what the Administration was doing -- and the increasingly dire revelations of its mistreatment and torture of detainees -- that led courts to push back to the degree that they did .
And therein lies the irony of the past seven years :
If the Bush Administration had simply decided to apply Geneva and other international conventions honestly and fairly , it is likely that the Supreme Court would never have made all of this new law under the Constitution .
The Bush Administration 's war against international law led to its war against habeas , and eventually to the Supreme Courts rebuff in Hamdi , Rasul , Hamdan and now Boumediene .
There 's a lesson here :
Act like a tyrant and people will treat you like a tyrant .
Act like you care about the rule of law and courts will give you the benefit of the doubt .
The Bush Administration got far less deference from the courts than usual because it acted like a tyrant .
It reaped what it sowed through its arrogance and incompetence .

If you look at it just right , the universal radiation warning symbol looks a bit like an angel .
The circle in the middle could indicate the head , the lower part might be the body , and the upper two arms of the trefoil could represent the wings .
Looking at it another way , one might see it as a wheel , a triangular boomerang , a circular saw blade , or any number of relatively benign objects .
Whatever a person ’s first impression of it may be , someone unfamiliar with the symbol probably would n’t guess that it means “ Danger !
These rocks shoot death rays ! ”
The U.S. Department of Energy has been grappling with that problem recently , as they designed the warning markers to use at Yucca Mountain and at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant ( WIPP ) nuclear waste storage facilities .
There ’s no telling who might be around to exhume our radioactive sins in future centuries , but the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) mandates that warnings be erected which will warn away potential intruders for the next 10,000 years , whomever those intruders may be .
The offending nuclear waste will be stored far underground at each of these facilities , but there is still a danger that future generations might stumble across it .
WIPP is located in the desert outside Carlsbad , New Mexico , and its storage areas are located 2,150 feet underground .
Yucca Mountain ’s facilities in the Nevada desert are intended to house waste at 1,000 feet deep .
Between the two , they are meant to entomb tens of thousands of metric tons of nuclear waste , most of which will remain dangerous for centuries .
Each of these locations was selected due to its relative geologic stability , theoretically allowing facilities there to contain the waste for the required 10,000 years .
Ten thousand years ago , early humans were still painting images on the walls of caves .
Some of those primitive messages managed to survive ten millennia , and they also remain somewhat meaningful .
But of course our ancient cave - painting ancestors were n’t attempting to illustrate complex ideas as far as we know .
Before one can communicate with unknown future societies about deadly nuclear waste , it is important to consider with whom precisely one is trying to communicate .
Such people may be part of a highly advanced civilization , they may be a society much less advanced than our own , or they may have comparable technology to that which we have today .
Further , they may not be directly descended from local cultures .
Messages will thus need to communicate to anyone⁠ — regardless of their culture , technology , or political structure⁠ — that intruding upon the repository is not in their best interest .
The essence of the message itself is simple : Warning , dangerous materials are buried below .
But how to communicate this to all possible discoverers using an enduring medium ?
To help answer this question during the preparations for the WIPP facility , panels of experts were assembled comprised of individuals with backgrounds in history , future studies , economics , law , physics , sociology , geography , engineering , political science , risk analysis , agriculture , climatology , history , and demographics .
This group was called the Futures Panel , and they were tasked with creatively exploring the possible reasons why a future society might penetrate these deep underground storage facilities .
They were also asked to advise on how to universally warn away would - be intruders .
The potential causes of future intrusion were imagined to be : water impoundment , resource exploration / extraction , scientific investigations , archaeological exploration , reopening the facilities for additional storage , waste disposal by injection wells , explosive testing , underground transportation tunnels , and weather modification .
With these possibilities under consideration , the Futures Panel proceeded with the assumption that intelligent beings would halt any of these activities if the monuments were successful at conveying their warning .
The panel roughly defined the intended message with the following :
This place is a message … and part of a system of messages … pay attention to it !
Sending this message was important to us .
We considered ourselves to be a powerful culture .
This place is not a place of honor … no highly esteemed deed is commemorated here … nothing valued is here .
What is here is dangerous and repulsive to us .
This message is a warning about danger .
The danger is in a particular location … it increases toward a center … the center of danger is here … of a particular size and shape , and below us .
The danger is still present , in your time , as it was in ours .
The danger is to the body , and it can kill .
The form of the danger is an emanation of energy .
The danger is unleashed only if you substantially disturb this place physically .
This place is best shunned and left uninhabited .
The ideas that sprang from the panel were varied and interesting .
It was decided that the markers would need to be designed to impart multiple levels of information , ranging from the rudimentary ⁠— something made by humans is here⁠ — to the more complex , such as the exact composition of the waste .
This approach , coupled with redundancy , was hoped to allow future discoverers to realize that the site was significant , but also providing detailed information should future society have the means to read the data .
They also pointed out that the markers should be made of ordinary materials and absent of beauty , lest the finders see value in removing the markers from the site .
Panelists described culture - independent ideas which are intended to trigger the danger reflex in all of humanity .
One example indicated a massive “ landscape of thorns , ” made up of fifty - foot - high concrete spires with sharp points jutting out at all angles .
Another intriguing idea was an arrangement of gigantic , black , “ forbidding blocks ” which are too close together and too hot to provide shelter .
Ultimately , the decision for the WIPP markers was motivated by cost - effectiveness .
Current plans call for the area over the waste storage panels to be outlined by “ earthen berms , ” which is another way of saying “ large piles of dirt . ”
These berms will be jagged in shape and will radiate out from a central , generally square area .
The jagged nature of the berms is meant to convey a sense of foreboding , and the exact size , shape , and configuration of the berms will be such that they will not quickly be eroded or covered .
The four corner berms will be higher than the others to provide vantage points to see the area as a whole .
Inside the corner berms will also be buried concrete rooms containing highly detailed information , such as maps , the periodic table , and astronomical charts indicating the date that the facility was sealed .
This data will be engraved upon stone slabs which are too large to be removed from the rooms ’ entrances .
Inside of the square arrangement of berms , multiple granite “ message kiosks ” will be engraved with more basic information describing the site ’s contents .
This text will be provided in all of the official UN languages and Navajo ( the local indigenous language ) .
Additionally , space will be left on the kiosks for a future generation to inscribe the message in another language .
The granite surfaces will be protected by a concrete “ mother ” wall , and the messages will be placed up high to prevent them from being defaced or buried by the desert sand .
Lastly , the berms and the area they surround will be peppered with underground “ time capsules ” at varying depths .
These clay , ceramic , glass , and aluminum oxide disks will be inscribed with warning information , and may contain samples of wood to allow a future society to date the
markers using carbon - 14 dating .
Yucca Mountain information center concept
The plans for the Yucca Mountain warning markers are a bit different .
Twenty - five foot monuments are intended to be inscribed with text and pictographs warning visitors of the dangers below , as well as a series of nine - inch markers embedded in the earth .
Surrounding the area will be several large information - center monuments in the shape of the universal radiation symbol .
Other creative suggestions have been put forward for these warning markers , some of them coming from outside of the official panels .
For instance , one individual suggested planting genetically - engineered blue cacti at the site to indicate its importance .
Another suggested leaving significant human remains above - ground at the site , to frighten off any who might stumble across it .
Still others advised against erecting any warning monuments at all , worrying that the markers themselves ⁠ — if not properly interpreted ⁠ — may rouse the curiosity of their discoverers enough that they might explore further , to disastrous ends .
In any case , WIPP is not scheduled to be sealed until the year 2038 , and Yucca Mountain may be operating well into the 24th century ; so humanity still has a little time to contemplate its warning to the future .
This primary has been giving me a heart attack recently so I 'm going to try and make myself sane by posting something on the Internet .
I 'll admit right up front that I 'm a big Obama supporter , and I would have voted the old John McCain over Hillary Clinton ( but not the new , party - line - toeing , I 'm - just - as - conservative - as - Bush - I - swear John McCain ) .
This is basically because I do n't like Hillary 's closed - door politics , I do n't like her relative silence on wiretapping and other civil liberties , and I do n't like her position on Iran .
Obama is also the most tech - friendly candidate out there .
Hell , Lawrence Lessig supports Obama .
This part originally had a blow - by - blow comparison of Obama and Clinton , but I 'm sure people are sick of that , so I 'll just say this : my biggest fear is that we 're going to be completely stuck in the mud .
I think that if Clinton is elected , it 's going to be the same story as 2006 : elation at finally getting rid of all that nasty Republican stuff in the White House , only to watch the Democrats give in on important foreign policy and civil liberty matters .
Yes , Clinton 's a political fighter , and a damn good one , but she only seems to care about fighting on the economic front : health care and tax breaks / hikes .
I 'm also worried we 're going to be stuck even on those fronts because for some reason , everything with the word " Clinton " seems to be tainted to every conservative in the country .
I 'm also worried that she just wo n't be elected .
Let me tell you a story : my mother is against gay marriage .
She 's attending a dinner where George W. Bush and Newt Gingrich are speaking .
My father listens to Rush Limbaugh .
My grandmother has voted Republican since after Roosevelt .
They all want to vote for Obama .
See , my parents are Northwest Indiana Republicans .
They are n't evangelical Christians , they are n't crazy rednecks that want to blow up Muslims ( ok , there are a lot of those around here ) , they 're fiscal conservatives who could n't stand the closed - door approach of the last Clinton administration .
I do n't even think they 're in the 19 % of people that support Bush .
Now , people might look to this as evidence that Obama is going to be just as bad as Bush , but I do n't think anyone can look at Obama 's platform and believe that .
No , I think something else is going on here : Obama is actually convincing people with his arguments ; with his " words " that McCain and Clinton think are so empty .
In fact , they were parroting that talking point to me until I made them sit down and watch Obama actually talk .
Now they 're hooked .
What I think is going on is exactly what Obama is saying is going on : people are tired of feeling like their representatives in Washington are lying to them whenever they open their mouth .
Anyway , now that you 've read why I am biased , let me talk about delegate math .
Since no one will be able to win based on pledged delegates , superdelegates or the convention will have to decide the nominee .
As I see it , there is somehow a question of whether the superdelegates are obeying the will of the people by voting for Obama , or if they are simply breaking a tie in voting for Clinton .
After all , they are only apart by about 100 delegates .
If Obama remains in the lead by that amount through the end of the Primary , that 's a percentage difference of only 3 points : 51.2 % to 48.7 % , not counting superdelegates .
Surely that seems like a statistical dead heat , no ?
Here 's the problem : in a two - person race , proportional voting makes it almost impossible to achieve much higher numbers than that .
But more importantly , it comes down to how voters feel about being represented .
Do they care about a 3 percent difference ?
I think you need look no further than the 2004 and 2000 general elections .
In 2000 , Al Gore beat George Bush in the popular vote by a mere 0.5 % .
Yet you still had people screaming that the election was " stolen " because the Supreme Court refused a recount in a single state .
In 2004 , most of the nation was of the opinion that George Bush was the clear winner , despite winning by only 2 % of the popular vote , and only 53 % - 47 % of the electoral vote .
Clearly the American public loves their small percentages , and the Democratic party has to know that they will self - destruct if they nominate Hillary if Obama has even 50 more pledged delegates than she does .
Hillary , now that fortune is in her favor , does n't seem to think that a small number of delegates is anything to sneeze at .
Let 's put this in perspective .
Obama won the pre-Feb .
5 primaries by 15 delegates .
He won the Super Tuesday contest by about 15 delegates .
He won the rest of February by 120 delegates .
Clinton 's " huge win " in Ohio , Texas , and Rhode Island last night ?
That netted her at the most 18 delegates .
18 . This is somehow " turning the tide " of the race .
Surely she would agree that in the rest of this proportional race , 18 delegates is a significant amount .
But if she ends up 18 delegates behind in the count , she will be screaming bloody murder .
I know that both candidates have been spinning these delegate counts : Obama says " I won more contests " and Clinton says " I won the big important states . "
There 's a simple way to settle the weight of these arguments , and it 's very simple : YOU COUNT THE BLOODY DELEGATES .
By this metric , unless his campaign tanks , there 's no way for her to catch up in the popular vote .
Wyoming ( a caucus state ) and Mississippi ( an Obama state ) have 45 delegates between them .
If Obama gets at least a 60 % chunk of that vote ( which he 's likely to do , seeing as how Clinton enjoys ignoring those states she 's going to lose ) , he 'll get at least 9 delegates up on Clinton , which basically eliminate her victory in Ohio .
Finally , let 's remember that the post - Super Tuesday contests , which Clinton dismissed as some silly little parlor game that she did n't really care about , had more votes at stake than all of March .
The media has such a large influence on how people vote .
They have truly ruined elections .
The " Dean Scream " basically defeated the Democrat 's chances .
Their narrative in the Clinton campaign is going to alter a clear Obama lead into Hillary somehow in the front - runner position again , and that will be truly tragic .

People who attempt to gain access to their home before it has been " cleared " by authorities are being apprehended , and those who attempt to drive around police checkpoints that have been set up in the affected areas are arrested at gunpoint .
Shocking footage out of Cedar Rapids Iowa shows cops and government employee " strike teams " breaking into houses of flood victims and threatening anyone who questions their actions in complete violation of the 4th amendment right that protects against unlawful search and seizure .
No warrant , no knock home invasions are being carried out on the flimsy pretext of " checking for structural damage " as cops harass and threaten with arrest people who refuse to have their homes ransacked by thugs in uniforms .
Cedar Rapids police chief Greg Graham promised residents over the weekend that " Law enforcement officers are not entering homes , " and that firefighters would only enter homes through unlocked doors and windows yet the video clearly shows locked houses being broken in to .
People who attempt to gain access to their home before it has been " cleared " by authorities are being apprehended , and those who attempt to drive around police checkpoints that have been set up in the affected areas are arrested at gunpoint .
" Each strike team consisted of six or seven people , including police , firefighters , utilities workers , and city employees , " reports the Iowa Gazette .
Angela Tague , a member of the STAR 1 search and rescue team from Ames , ran into any angry homeowner on E Avenue NW .
" He was saying ‘ Where do you live ? ’ and ‘ How would you like it if someone busted your door open ? , " Tague said .
Police Officer Josh Bell later had a heated exchange with the man , and told him that if he did n’t go back inside his house and stop harassing the strike team , he would be escorted out of the area .
The man was visibly agitated about his broken door and pointed at Bell .
" It ’s wrong , " the man said , over and over .
So people who are uncomfortable with jackbooted thugs breaking down their door without even knocking and express their distaste for it are to blame for " harassing the strike team " ?
Respondents to the You Tube clip and the newspaper article expressed their outrage at the behavior of those in the video tasked with " helping " flood - stricken people yet doing nothing more than intimidating and invading their homes .
" You break down the door of my private residence and when I object you threaten to escort me off my own property .
Fine example of police work .
Did anyone think to knock first ?
Thomas Jefferson said that the main reason for citizens to be armed was to protect themselves from tyrannical government .
If this is n’t tyranny then I do n’t know what is .
A man ’s home is his castle , " states Steve Delaloye .
" A sad day for America when government thugs abuse the trust of the citizenry like this , " writes one .
" So these cops and fire fighters are part time structural engineers , or what ??
What are they inspecting for in the structures ?
Gas and electric could be shut off at the source , and any spills are so diluted they wont catch fire .
The police chief said no police would enter any homes , and what do you know , mr fat ass cop goes piling through the window thinking he ’s T.J Hooker .
Damn , this is just sad , sad , sad , " adds another .
One Iowa resident expresses her anger that authorities will not let her re-enter her home .
" I sit here with tears streaming down my face .
I have been trying to be patient and await to enter my home .
Now today , I am told there will be no re-entry ’s until further notice .
I cannot express how **** ing mad I am .
I understand the houses can be unsafe .
Just let me at least see my house , so that I can assess if it hit my top floor .
I have pictures and memories on my top floor of my deceased mother , all I want to do is rescue those , " she writes .
As we reported in 2005 , Hurricane Katrina was exploited by the federal government and used as a martial law drill while victims were abused and treated like rats in a laboratory .
Door to door gun confiscations were ordered and cops ransacked homes and took weapons from multi-million dollar homes which were in the high and dry areas and completely unaffected by the hurricane .
In some cases , residents were kicked out of their own homes for no reason .
Outrageous footage showed cops seizing handguns from the home of a grief - stricken old women as they assaulted and punched her in the face .
Where does the government think it derives the authority from to break into people ’s homes whose lives have already been devastated by massive floods on the flimsiest of pretexts ?
The 4th amendment states , " The right of the people to be secure in their persons , houses , papers , and effects , against unreasonable searches and seizures , shall not be violated , and no Warrants shall issue , but upon probable cause , supported by Oath or affirmation , and particularly describing the place to be searched , and the persons or things to be seized . "
Even if there was a legitimate reason to inspect homes , why on earth do they not even bother to knock on the door ?
Cops immediately attempt to break in or climb through windows uninvited because this procedure is all about sending a message – when a crisis unfolds we are the bosses and you – the peasants – will yield to our tyranny .
Lawsuits need to be filed immediately by people in Iowa and elsewhere who have had cops invade their homes in complete violation of the 4th amendment and a pretext needs to be set that will put a stop to the government ’s routine exploitation of natural disasters as an opportunity to impose martial law measures on needy victims that have already had their lives devastated .
With reports indicating that the Mississippi river is in danger of bursting its banks , the precedent that was set with Hurricane Katrina could be set to advance as government minions and jackbooted thugs across the country lick their lips at the prospect of kicking down more doors and harassing innocent people .
Contact the Iowa ACLU and demand they pressure the authorities to stop these illegal home invasions immediately .

Leaked documents are one of the banes of modern western politics .
They reveal exercises and actions being proposed that are generally objectionable to the public .
Such a leak occurred with the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement ( ACTA ) which seeks to turn the internet into a virtual police state .
Again , it ’s one of the few bastions of anti-corruption , Wikileaks , that has spilled the beans on this unsavory topic .
Yesterday the site revealed a document proposing a treaty that will significantly limit the privacy and rights of Internet users , to the benefit of multimillion dollar companies .
“ ACTA ” is basically an attempt to criminalize the Internet , thus allowing a virtual police state to occur by the selective prosecuting of crimes .
In short , it ’s an international treaty , or hopes to be , that will greatly increase already draconian copyright measures , in a poor attempt to appease the copyright and patent industries .
The proposal is based on the assumption that ‘ intellectual property rights ’ ( a term used nine times on the first page of the proposal , and 24 times over the entire 3 Â½ page document ) trump personal privacy , data protection , probable cause , and lots of other important principles in western democracies .
The measure which has received wider publicity is the so - called ‘ Pirate Bay killer ’ .
At the end of page two , there is a list of things that should be included in a signee ’s legal framework , and in the section about criminal sanctions it states “ significant willful infringements without motivation for financial gain to such an extent as to prejudicially affect the copyright holder ( e.g. , Internet piracy ) ” .
Think non -profit , personal use file - sharing .
Of course , this could go two ways , as the MPAA , for instance , has been guilty of ‘ Internet piracy ’ in the past , with it ’s university toolkit .
Worst of all though , are the following two points speaking of “ establishment and imposition of deterrent - level penalties ” and “ ex- officio authority to take action against infringers ” .
It is argued that the current level of penalties are n’t harsh enough ( “ people are still doing it , so they ’re no deterrent ” ) , so there should be room for harsher punishments .
Combine this with the ability to prosecute without a rights holder complaint , which means that people could be liable for millions , or imprisoned ( they are talking about CRIMINAL enforcement ) for sharing Steal this Film , or Paulo Coelho ’s books .
So , these people actively want you to share would have no say in any such prosecution .
There are some other pure gems proposed , such as “ ex officio authority for customs authorities to suspend import , export and trans - shipment of suspected IPR infringing goods ” .
Given that copyright law is so complex and convoluted , and that judges make mistakes in the cases they hear , this is worrying .
Unsurprisingly , the US patent office is backed up beyond belief and dominated by patent trolls that wait until a successful business is established , before pouncing to clean up .
This would mean the death for any new and innovative products , or art .
If that was n’t bad enough , there is a further provision for rights holders to prod customs officials into suspension .
Thus , a company can make an allegation , forcing a competitors products to be held in limbo until sorted .
Protest has been swift .
TorrentFreak occasional contributor Jamie King wrote on his own blog : “ In the form that it currently appears to exist , ACTA would ratchet - up further the rights of Hollywood and Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) at the expense of all of our civil liberties .
It provisions to criminalize information use practices currently allowed under U.S. , European , and international law are completely disproportionate to the ‘ problems ’ it claims to address . ”
Andrew Norton , chairman of the American Pirate Party was much less restrained : “ The very existence of the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement ( ACTA ) , be it in policy or just planning , sends one definite message to people around the world ; Corruption is rife in the interested countries .
There can be no other reason for yet another ‘ intellectual property ’ ( itself a misnomer ) law aimed at protecting business interests and expanding government intrusion into the private affairs of it ’s citizens , in the name of ‘ protection ’ . ”
Of course , the other area most affected by this would be whistle - blower sites like Wikileaks itself .
The owner of any leaked document can claim copyright infringement on its publication , and have it pulled .
In this , ACTA is a very effective censorship tool .
For some reason , though , this aspect has not been widely reported , or even mentioned .

More than 850 million hungry people around the globe can enjoy a better life if the world sets aside less than three per cent of what it spends on the purchase of arms every year , for the development of agriculture .
Pointing out the stark realities of the wasteful spending , United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation director general Jacques Diouf on Tuesday appealed to world leaders for US$ 30 billion a year to re-launch agriculture and avert future threats of conflicts over food .
In his opening speech at the FAO 's Rome Summit , called to defuse the current world food crisis , Diouf noted that in 2006 the world spent US $ 1.2 trillion on arms while food wasted in a single country could cost US $ 100 billion and excess consumption by the world 's obese amounted to US$ 20 billion .
" Against that backdrop , how can we explain to people of good sense and good faith that it was not possible to find US $ 30 billion a year to enable 862 million hungry people to enjoy the most fundamental of human rights : the right to food and thus the right to life ? "
Diouf asked .
" It is resources of this order of magnitude that would make it possible definitely to lay to rest the spectre of conflicts over food that are looming on the horizon , " he added .
" The structural solution to the problem of food security in the world lies in increasing production and productivity in the low - income , food - deficit countries , " he declared .
This called for innovative and imaginative solutions , including " partnership agreements ... between countries that have financial resources , management capabilities and technologies and countries that have land , water and human resources " , he added .
The current world food crisis had already had tragic political and social consequences in different countries and could further endanger world peace and security , Diouf said .
But the crisis was in essence a ' chronicle of disaster foretold , ' he noted .
Despite the World Food Summit 's solemn pledge in 1996 to halve world food hunger by 2015 , resources to finance agricultural programmes in developing countries had not only failed to rise but decreased significantly since then .
Some US $ 24 billion would have been needed to fund an anti-hunger programme prepared for the second World Food Summit held in 2002 , Diouf recalled .
" In cooperation with the FAO , the developing countries did in fact prepare policies , strategies and programmes that , if they had received appropriate funding , would have assured world food security , " he added .
But , he said , " Today the facts speak for themselves : from 1980 to 2005 aid to agriculture fell from US$ 8 billion ( 2004 basis ) in 1984 to US $ 3.4 billion in 2004 , representing a reduction in real terms of 58 per cent " .
Agriculture 's share of Official Development Assistance fell from 17 per cent in 1980 to 3 per cent in 2006 , he also noted .
The Director - General said he had alerted public opinion as far back as last September to the risks of social and political unrest due to hunger and that in December he had appealed for US $ 1.7 billion to help overcome the crisis by facilitating farmers ' access to seeds , fertilizer , animal feed and other inputs .
" It is important to realise that the time for talking is long past , " he stressed .
" Now is the time for action " .
One of the most notable events involving the city is the Siege of Sevastopol ( 1854 -1855 ) carried out by the British , French , Sardinian , and Turkish troops during the Crimean War , which lasted for 11 months .
Despite its efforts , the Russian army had to leave its stronghold and evacuate over a pontoon bridge to the north shore of the inlet .
The Russians had to sink their entire fleet to prevent it from falling into the hands of the enemy and at the same time to block the entrance of the Western ships into the inlet .
When the enemy troops entered Sevastopol , they were faced with the ruins of a formerly glorious city .
A panorama of the siege created by Franz Roubaud and which was restored after its destruction in 1942 is housed in a specially constructed circular building in the city .
It portrays the situation in the height of the siege , on 18 June 1855 .
It was made with two methods – the closer to the observer layers are made with the real objects – cannon balls , cannons , grass , fortification logs , guns – everything is real etc and further from the observer starts the epic drawing on the round walls of the panorama , creating the illusion that the observer is standing on the top of the hill in the center of the battle for the defense of Sevastopol .

Friday afternoons have long been Washington ’s dumping ground for stories that various power brokers would rather see whither and die , and last Friday was no exception .
Shortly after the Clinton campaign finally released Bill and Hillary ’s tax returns , showing they ’ve netted over $ 100 million since 2000 , the State Department announced that it would renew Blackwater ’s security contract to protect U.S. diplomats abroad .
Blackwater ’s involvement in a shooting incident in a Baghdad traffic circle last September remains under investigation by the FBI , although an earlier Iraqi review ( albeit one conducted by the insurgent - penetrated Iraqi Interior Ministry ) characterized the incident as “ premeditated murder . ”
The U.S. private security firm is also the subject of federal probes regarding illegal weapons transfers and tax evasion .
None of this , however , stood in the way of the State Department ’s renewal of Blackwater ’s five - year Worldwide Protective Services contract , originally awarded to the company in 2006 and subject to annual review .
The move has proved controversial in Iraq , where Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki , weakened by his recent failed attempt to crush Muqtada al - Sadr ’s Shiite milita , may be attempting to find an issue around which to rally whatever dwindling domestic support remains for his government .
Indeed , Blackwater is so deeply unpopular with Iraqis that beating up on the company may be just the thing to distract attention from al - Maliki ’s other problems , at least for the moment .
In an interview with CNN , al - Maliki attacked the State Department ’s decision , claiming the Iraqi government was not consulted on the renewal of the Blackwater contract , which it surely would have rejected based on the results of its own investigation in the September shooting incident .
From CNN :
As far as Iraqi government is involved , this issue is still under consideration and we are still discussing principles upon which foreign security companies must operate , especially this company because they committed a massacre against Iraqis and until now this matter has not been resolved .
No judicial action has been taken , no compensation has been made .
Therefore the extension requires approval of the Iraqi government and the government wants to resolve the outstanding issues with this company .
I would say the US side should not move to renew the contract until the outstanding issues of the company are finalized .
I feel the decision was taken without the approval of the Iraqi government .

The attempts by creationists to have their beliefs accepted as legitimate science is a topic we 've touched on more than a few times at Ars Technica .
The past couple of weeks have seen several more acts played out , both in relation to the science that children are taught in schools and the standards to which researchers in academia are held .
Trouble with the Texas School Board
The first of these events happened last week in Texas , where the Texas Education Agency 's Director of Science has been forced out of her job for allegedly not " remaining neutral " over the teaching of evolution in schools .
Christine Comer , a former science teacher , had her nine - year stint as Director of Science ended as a result of an e-mail she sent to colleagues , notifying them of an upcoming talk being given by Barbara Forrest .
Forrest is the author of Inside Creationism 's Trojan Horse , a book that details the movement to have ID taught as science in America 's Schools .
The movement suffered what ought to have been a fatal blow following the Kitzmiller v. Dover legal case , but creationists are readying themselves for another confrontation in the coming year , when Texas reviews its scientific curriculum .
Although the state has taught evolution as fact for the past decade , the new chair of the State Board of Education is a self - proclaimed proponent of ID and it is widely believed that this will be reflected in the upcoming curriculum .
There are ramifications of this happening in a state as large as Texas , due to the large numbers of textbooks purchased .
Textbook suppliers will often design books just for the three largest markets in the US ( Texas , Florida , and California ) and then sell them to all the other states in the country .
If Texas insists on ID being included , the effect will be felt far outside the state 's borders .
The decision to remove Comer was made by Lizzette Reynolds , a former staffer for George W. Bush during his days as governor of Texas .
" This is highly inappropriate , " Reynolds said in an e-mail to Comer 's supervisors .
" I believe this is an offense that calls for termination or , at the very least , reassignment of responsibilities ...
This is something that the State Board , the Governor 's Office and members of the Legislature would be extremely upset to see because it assumes this is a subject that the agency supports . "
Can a Creationist work as an evolutionary biologist ?
As if that were n't enough , this week saw a lawsuit filed in Boston by a former postdoc at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution over his dismissal .
Nathaniel Abraham was fired from his position in 2004 after he informed his Principal Investigator ( PI ) that he was a creationist .
Dr. Abraham was hired to work on an NIH grant concerning how " how aquatic animals respond to chemical contaminants by examining ... mechanisms from a comparative / evolutionary perspective . "
After Abraham brought up his creationist beliefs , his PI , Mark Hahn , wrote to him to say that he would only be paid for the 7 - 10 percent of the work on the project that did not involve evolution .
This did not prove satisfactory for either party , and a month later Abraham was asked to resign :
" ... You have indicated that you do not recognize the concept of biological evolution and you would not agree to include a full discussion of the evolutionary implications and interpretations of our research in any co-authored publications resulting from this work ...
This position is incompatible with the work as proposed to NIH and with my own vision of how it should be carried out and interpreted . "
Abraham now works at Liberty University , the Virginia university founded by the late Rev. Jerry Falwell .
This is n't the first case of a creationist with credentials .
Last year , Marcus Ross submitted his PhD dissertation to the University of Rhode Island for examination .
Although Ross 's field is geosciences and the dissertation was about marine reptiles that died out 65 million years ago , he is also an avowed young earth creationist who personally believes the world to be no more than 6,000 years old .
The granting of his doctorate has raised questions in the academic community regarding his intentions .
Ross has appeared in creationist and ID propaganda materials , and has been accused of using his PhD from a secular university as a springboard to further a religious agenda .
Whether these cases highlight a certain duplicity or hypocrisy on behalf of the scientists working within frameworks they refuse to recognize or instead represent their ability to compartmentalize their beliefs is not for us to say , but it does suggest a new approach by the creationist movement in its fight against science .
Both cases also raise questions about the neutrality of scientific organizations when it comes to the nature of science itself .
Do institutions have a duty to remain impartial or a responsibility to defend central tenets ?
Clem asked about less special PCs in the suggestion pot :
Almost all settings and campaigns seem to assume that pcs are a breed apart .
They may start weak but , if they survive , they can eventually become extremely powerful and / or capable .
Ok , suppose there are such special people in the world and that they are born with something extra that gives them this superhuman potential .
Now suppose that the pcs are not such people .
How to make a game where they are , say , peasant conscripts in some noble ’s war of revenge for some imagined slight or they are henchmen of an adventuring party with a disturbing habit of using them as cannon fodder and trap springers , or perhaps low powered mages specialized in household spells exciting ?
And how do you run such a game where the characters are takers , not givers , of orders without turning it into a railroadfest ?
Finally , what sort of goals can the players have beyond day to day survival that will keep their interest in spite of their knowledge of their limited potential ?
Scope
A good way to make this work is by shrinking the scope .
People do n’t ask random peasants to act like special forces troops - while that ’s fun for heroic PCs to play , it does n’t fit the tone of the world that you ’re trying to create .
If you were running a campaign of say , the hundred years war , you might spend weeks roleplaying the tedium of forced marches , the friendships that spring up under pressure , the difficulties of keeping fed in a hostile land , camp duties and relationships , etc .
Kobolds kidnapping your sister sounds like a cliched opening for a D&D campaign , but kobolds are a difficult adversary for apprentices or first level NPC - classed heroes .
For such characters a dozen kobolds are n’t critters you slaughter casually and just swig a healing potion .
They are a foe that will take planning , cunning , and luck for a few untrained people to beat .
Goals
By picking good goals , you can make any power level interesting .
Spend time during character generation to generate PCs with complex relationships .
Take advantage of their lack of power and embed them in their location .
( They wo n’t move around as much . )
Jealous lovers and cruel guild masters are difficult opponents for anyone under their thumb to oppose .
Make the plots personal .
Whether you ’re level one or twenty , a rival who spits on you will spark passion , even if he ’s just another scribe in the copy room and you ’re only competing to become the Duke ’s seneschal .
A good relationship map of the characters and recurring NPCs can help you brainstorm the new night ’s adventure .
A mysterious threatening note , your character ’s son or daughter caught with their pants down , or the guild master trying to give your hard earned spot to his idiot son can make for a solid plot that does n’t require tactical nukes to solve .
Setting
Another solution is to pick a familiar setting , like a modern day campaign .
Players should have a good idea about how ordinary people can have outsized effects without powers .
Playing mortals in the World of Darkness , you could run a completely mundane game - the characters could be ordinary cops inspired by your group ’s love of The Wire or Law and Order .
Even without magical powers , ordinary police can use their influence for public good or self aggrandizement .
Investigative adventures work well in any setting .
Figuring out what happened does n’t require fiery confrontation - just an interesting mystery .
steady work by the PCs , and specialized knowledge .
Low level divinations can have a huge impact on these types of adventures , as can a good gather information roll , science skills in a CSI game , or Mythos in Call of Cthulu .
Other Issues
The players need to buy in to a low powered game .
If they want to hack and slay but you force them to make low powered characters , they ’ll be frustrated when their actions kill them off .
Once they aim for a different goal it wo n’t feel like a poor man ’s version of the standard game .
The system you pick will influence the characters that result .
If you ’re trying to drive home the horrors of war , abstract damage systems like Hero and D&D might not be your best choice .
( Break out the old Rolemaster crit tables ! )
If you ’re looking for a way to show normal people in extraordinary situations , make sure that your game can handle ordinary people well .
If ordinary people are an after thought in your game ’s design , your players may wind up playing heroes who suck instead of ordinary people who struggle .
Railroading can be avoided just as easily in at low power as high .
You ’ll still need to prepare prompts for the plot , so they do n’t just wander around playing out their lives as accountants .
Connecting them to the plot can be an extra burden , particularly if you ’re used to giving the PCs plots because “ they ’re the only heroes are in town ” .
The best way to ensure that orders do n’t become railroading is to avoid ordering things related to the heart of your game .
If you ’re playing a military game with a focus on how the PCs treat local NPCs , then have the leader give the soldiers tasks ( but not specify how to accomplish them ) .
If the characters are caravan guards and you ’re interested in tactical play , do n’t have the merchants who hire them understand tactics and do n’t let the merchants micromanage the PC deployments .
If you ’re playing a soldiers in war , the whole game can be about the tension of following orders versus your heart and instincts .
Easiest of all is soap opera play - orders become just one more hurdle crowding in the path between you and your true love ( or this week ’s guest star ) .
Are you excited about playing normal people in an extraordinary world ?
What advice did I miss for making this type of game practical and fun ?
Have you played ( or run ) in a campaign like this ?
Tell us about your experiences .

John Parkes has been hunting for life in unusual places for over 20 years and recently , his discovery of bacterial life deep beneath the oceans might mean that we'd have to rethink the definition of life and the possibility of finding it on another planet :
This means it is conceivable – but unproven – that some of the cells are as old as the sediment .
At 1.6 km beneath the sea , that 's 111 million years old .
But in an underworld where cells divide excruciatingly slowly , if at all , age tends to lose its relevance , says Parkes .
Parkes ' interest in prokaryotes goes far beyond those that are buried deep in the Earth .
He thinks the cells found there could lead to life on other planets .
Previously , he has shown that the rocks beneath the oceans could be home to the largest population of prokaryotes on Earth , and account for one tenth of all living carbon .
He estimates the combined undersea biomass could be equivalent to that of all the plants on Earth .
" We are all dominated by our surface existence where everything relates to photosynthesis and oxygen , " he told New Scientist .
The possibility that there could be more forms of life beneath the surface than above it suggests that they have different and effective ways of surviving – ways that could be independent of light and oxygen .
And if these " new " forms of life exist on Earth , they could exist on other planets too .

We ’ve reached the end of Logic of Life , Tim Harford ’s engaging tour of economics and its lessons for everyday life .
Harford ends the book on a highly speculative note about technology , economics , and growth .
Tim does a good job summarizing the emerging consensus .
The “ normal ” state of human life is poverty and near zero economic development .
Once a community establishes reasonable institutions for commerce and trade , people can quickly produce and exploit technological advances .
The effects are cumulative : once a nation allows markets to work beyond a certain threshold , the population experiences exponentially increasing benefits .
The economists ’ summary of world history is : “ no capitalism = no growth , some capitalism = growth , growth , growth ! ! ”
This discussion is interesting because of the connections to ideas outside the normal realm of economics , especially in areas like psychology and , my own area , sociology .
Here ’s just one example .
Harford discusses the idea that population size should correlate with innovation .
Simply put , if you have a hundred million people , you ’ll get a least a few geniuses .
The inventions of these geniuses can be mass marketed , which fuels later growth episodes .
Fair enough .
But where do “ geniuses ” come from ?
Turns out , there is a fascinating literature on creativity and achievement .
A few names : R. Keith Sawyer , a sociologist / psychologist , writes eloquently on the emergence of genius from networks and groups .
Sociologist Randall Collins wrote a highly regarded book on prominent philosophers showing that “ genius level ” philosophers tended to be clustered in space and time , suggesting that genius is made possible by very specific kinds of “ hot house ” situations .
Other research , pioneered by Florida State psychologist Anders Ericsson , shows that high level performance is n’t just a matter of talent .
It ’s also a matter of specific training techniques and immersion in a topic .
Basically , it ’s not just talent that leads to achievement , it ’s also the right kind of social environment . *
What ’s the point ?
It ’s this : Economics , as understood for hundreds of years , has played out .
The major problems of econ 101 have been solved .
We know about supply and demand , marginal utility , choice under uncertainty , and budget constraints .
We have a wide variety of tools , ranging from game theory to econometrics , that help us identify these processes in situations ranging from war , to car sales , to dating .
We are also seeing how these processes plug into classic macroeconomic issues , such as growth and international trade .
However , the market system itself , as indicated by Tim ’s concluding chapter , depends on population , innovation , and liberal economic institutions .
These , in turn , depend on psychology , group culture , and networks , the domain of sociologists , psychologists , historians , and anthropologists .
Economists have shown how the market system processes the inputs , but there ’s still much , much more to be said about where the inputs come from .
That ’s what ’s going to be exciting in the decades to come , and I ca n’t wait to see it .
* Author David Shenk nicely covers this research on his blog The Genius in All of Us .
As I stated in my introductory post , I intend with this blog to delve into some of the implementation details of Rubinius .
However , as I ’ve contemplated various topics to write about , I ’ve realised I first need to introduce some of the core underlying concepts and ( Ruby ) classes unique to Rubinius .
The most important of these ( and the topic of this post ) are those that relate to the Rubinius execution environment : the Shotgun Virtual Machine , and the various Ruby classes that provide access to Shotgun internals .
Shotgun : A Virtual Machine
As mentioned elsewhere , Rubinius is heavily influenced by the implementation of Smalltalk - 80 , and borrows many of the same concepts and even some of it ’s class names from there .
Like Smalltalk and Java , Rubinius compiles Ruby source code into a lower - level machine - independent instruction set that is executed on a virtual machine , known as Shotgun .
The Shotgun virtual machine has many similarities to a real computer , such as ( virtual ) CPUs and an instruction set , but also many higher - level abstractions ( such as managed memory and a garbage collector ) , that make it easier to target as an execution environment for a high - level dynamic language such as Ruby .
Shotgun is currently written in C , although some portions of the source code are actually generated from Ruby ( e.g. the opcode and primitive implementations are defined as embedded C code inside Ruby methods ) .
In the future ( post - 1.0 ) , the plan is to have more of the C code generated from Ruby or a Ruby - like language ( Garnet ) , much as how Squeak ( a Smalltalk implementation ) implemented a virtual machine in Squeak .
Shotgun Architecture
Shotgun is written in a relatively clean and easy to follow style .
It contains no global variables , and consists of a layered architecture : at the root is an environment , within which machines are instantiated .
Each machine represents an entire Ruby / Rubinius virtual machine , and runs in its own native ( OS ) thread .
Machines can communicate via an inter-machine message channel , but are otherwise totally separate and isolated .
Within a machine , there exists a virtual CPU , which runs one or more ( green ) threads .
A Shotgun CPU effectively represents a native thread on the underlying hardware , whereas a Shotgun thread represents a Ruby thread .
Just like a real CPU , the Shotgun virtual CPU pre-emptively multi-tasks ( Shotgun ) threads .
At present , a Shotgun machine always has a single CPU , so all Shotugn threads within a single machine therefore execute on a single native thread .
In the future ( again , post - 1.0 ) it is planned to implement what is known as an m:n threading model , whereby a pool of m native threads are used to execute n Ruby threads .
At the next level down from threads are what are known as tasks .
Each Shotgun task maintains an operand stack ( Shotgun is a stack - based VM ) and a reference to the current execution context .
Tasks are very similar to threads , but lack pre-emption or scheduling .
In practice , they are similar to Ruby 1.9 fibres , although unlike fibres , there is currently no way to co-operatively multi-task ( or yield to a co-routine ) using Rubinius tasks .
A context represents something similar to a stack frame in C or Java .
It represents the current execution context , and as such , it provides :
a link back to the caller of the current method ;
a reference to the compiled method currently being executed ;
instruction ( IP ) , stack ( SP ) , and frame ( FP ) pointers for the current instruction , current stack operand , and the operand stack pointer location at the commencement of the current method respectively ;
the current scope for resolving constant and method lookups ; and
storage for all local variables in the current scope .
Finally , each context has an associated compiled method , which contains the instruction bytecodes to be executed for the method to which the context relates .
Compiled methods are the result of compiling Ruby source into Shotgun bytecode , and are the units of execution in Shotgun .
A compiled method contains :
the bytecode instruction sequence that tells Shotgun what actions to take ;
the number and names of any local variables used in the bytecode ;
the static scope , used for resolving constant and method lookups ; and
a tuple containing the literals contained in the source code that cannot be represented directly as opcode arguments ( e.g. strings , symbols , method calls etc ) .
Key Rubinius Classes
Without further ado , let ’s look at the Ruby classes that correspond to the concepts above … but this time , we ’ll work from the bottom up .
InstructionSequence
In Rubinius , Ruby code is compiled down to bytecode , which is then executed by Shotgun , the Rubinius virtual machine .
The compilation process is reasonably complex ( see here for a detailed overview ) , but the end result is that Ruby code is converted into a sequence of integers , representing the VM opcodes and any arguments they take .
The class that represents this bytecode in Rubinius is InstructionSequence , which is a sub-class of ByteArray .
The InstructionSequence class does not have many useful instance methods , since it is essentially a representation of the Shotgun machine language .
However , the class source file defines a number of related classes for working with InstructionSequences that are useful , including :
InstructionSet
Defines the full set of Shotgun instructions or opcodes , and includes useful metadata about each instruction .
This includes information about the number and purpose of any opcode arguments , whether the opcode changes the flow of execution , the number of stack operands consumed and produced , etc .
Encoder
This class is used to encode and decode an instruction sequence between symbolic and bytecode representations .
It is used by the compiler , to convert a generated instruction sequence consisting of opcode symbols and arguments into the actual bytecode executed by Shotgun and saved to disk in .rbc files .
It is also used by tools such as the debugger to disassemble the bytecode of a Compiled Method into something that can be displayed on screen , or to modify bytecode to support debugging .
CompiledMethod
A Compiled Method represents the compiled source code for a Ruby method ( or top - level script , i.e. Ruby code that is not part of a method body ) .
As such , a Compiled Method contains an InstructionSequence instance containing the compiled bytecode for the method source , the number and names of any local variables used in the method , details of the method scope , and a whole bunch of other attributes .
A CompiledMethod is the main executable unit in a Rubinius program .
It is the output created by the Rubinius compiler that is then passed to Shotgun for execution and / or persisted to disk .
Compiled Method instances can be obtained from any method definition using the #compiled_method accessor on a Method or UnboundMethod object .
Compiled Method objects are also nested ; each Ruby source file that is compiled by Rubinius creates a single top - level Compiled Method object named __script__ , which is then run when the ( compiled ) file is loaded .
Any Compiled Method can contain other Compiled Method objects as literals ; so when a Ruby script is executed that contains , for example , a def statement , the bytecode for the new method will be compiled into its own Compiled Method object , and this Compiled Method will then be added to the literals tuple of the containing Compiled Method .
From there , it can then be referenced by opcodes such as add_method , which hook a Compiled Method up to a symbol in a method table .
MethodContext and BlockContext
The next level up from a Compiled Method is an execution context , in the form of either a MethodContext or a BlockContext ( depending upon whether we are dealing with the execution of a method or a block ) .
Where a Compiled Method represents the executable instructions for a given method or top - level script , an execution context represents the actual execution of Rubinius code .
MethodContext and BlockContext instances provide a way to inspect and modify the execution environment .
Not surprisingly , they are therefore a key component enabling the Rubinius debugger to do its thing .
However , they also make implementation of eval bindings and continuations almost trivial , since an execution context contains all the necessary details to resolve binding references relative to some other context ( e.g. a caller ’s context ) , and to save and restore execution state .
Task
As we saw earlier , a Shotgun task maintains an operand stack and a reference to the current execution context .
Tasks are also the building blocks for Ruby threads , and provide a way to transfer an execution context from one Ruby thread to another .
The Task class provides access to a the current execution contex , via Task # current_context , and to the operand stack ( the latter being of interest primarily to the debugger ) .
Thread
The Thread class provides an implementation of the Ruby Thread class semantics using a combination of Ruby code , Tasks , and Rubinius ( Shotgun ) primitives : the execution context for a thread is maintained via an associated Task , and methods that control thread scheduling and execution are implemented as primitives .
Conclusion
In this post , we ’ve introduced the Shotgun virtual machine , and looked at how it models an execution environment through the concepts of machines , cpus , tasks , etc .
However , there is a good deal more to Shotgun that we ’ve not even touched on , and which will have to be saved for a future post .
I hope you ’ve found this post informative ; feel free to ask questions , provide feedback , or indicate the areas you ’d like to know more about using the comments facility below .

“ THE farther back you can look , the farther forward you are likely to see . ”
Apply Winston Churchill 's aphorism to the internet , and about the farthest back you can look is 1994 , when the previously obscure computer network first became known to a wider public .
Many people first ventured onto the internet from AOL , CompuServe and Prodigy , which were subscription - based online services that offered e-mail , chatrooms , discussion boards and so on .
Having provided their users with access to the internet , however , these venerable digital communities were undermined by it .
Why stay within a closed community when you can roam outside its walled garden , into the wilds of the internet proper ?
Admittedly , it took a while for open and standardised forms of e-mail , discussion boards and file downloads — not to mention a new publishing technology called the world wide web — to match the proprietary , closed versions that preceded them .
Today only AOL survives , and in a very different form : as an open web portal supported by advertising .
Now history seems to be repeating itself .
Two of the biggest online phenomena of the past couple of years — social networks such as Facebook , and virtual worlds such as Second Life — look an awful lot like AOL did in 1994 .
They are closed worlds based on proprietary standards .
You cannot easily move information in and out of them : try shifting your Facebook profile to MySpace , or moving a piece of clothing or furniture from Second Life to Entropia Universe .
True , the walled - off nature of these communities is part of their charm .
And their proprietary nature is also inevitable : only when a technology is established do standards emerge .
But that is now starting to happen with social networks and virtual worlds .
The gate in the corner and the meadow beyond
Just as the web 's open standards , embodied in the Netscape browser , displaced AOL and its ilk , so Netscapisation awaits Facebook and Second Life .
As new standards make it easier to pipe data in and out of social networks , the need to visit a particular website to catch up with friends may come to seem as quaint as AOL 's “ You 've got mail ” alert ( see article ) .
Similarly , work is under way to allow links , akin to those between websites , to be set up between virtual worlds based on open standards and hosted on different machines .
Why bother with an island in Second Life when you can build your own world ?
Marc Andreessen , Netscape 's co-founder , now runs Ning , a start - up that lets people set up their own social networks ; and Multiverse , founded by several Netscape veterans , is one of several firms providing virtual - world construction tools .
The question for Facebook , Second Life and the rest is how fast they can adapt .
Philip Rosedale , Second Life 's creator , is keenly aware of the historical precedent and scans old news reports about AOL in an effort to avoid a similar fate .
Facebook , a little reluctantly , is starting to open up .
Most curious of all is AOL 's acquisition of Bebo , an up - and - coming social network , earlier this month .
Has AOL forgotten the lessons of history — or might it just be uniquely well - placed to apply them ?

What is Kilim ?
Kilim is a message - passing framework for Java that provides ultra- lightweight threads and facilities for fast , safe , zero - copy messaging between these threads .
It consists of a bytecode postprocessor ( a " weaver " ) , a run time library with buffered mailboxes ( multi - producer , single consumer queues ) and a user - level scheduler and a type system that puts certain constraints on pointer aliasing within messages to ensure interference - freedom between threads .
Why ?
Hardware facilities are getting distributed , from the micro to the macro levels -- increasing numbers of cores , CPUs in a box , boxes in a data center to a multitude of data centers .
The current crop of software architectures , languages and idioms are not suited to this trend .
Here are a few reasons :
A multi-core / CPU box is internally a distributed system , but operating systems and hardware manufacturers go to great lengths to provide an illusion of local shared memory .
In reality , the illusion is never complete , which is why programmers have no option but to learn about non-trivial memory models and consistency schemes .
The problems with shared memory has been well documented [ PDF ] .
Different mindset between " concurrent programming " and " distributed programming " .
Programmers have to deal with both ( even embedded systems have network interactions ) and require separate sets of tools for verification , profiling and debugging these two patterns .
The " events vs. threads " debate unnecessarily conflates two problems : threads are considered bad because they are ( a ) heavyweight ( which does n't have to be the case ) and ( b ) the thread paradigm is implicitly associated with shared memory locking constructs that are error - prone , which again does not have to be the case .
As Kilim demonstrates , it is possible to have lightweight threads that are just as lightweight as state machines , yet provide the automatic stack management feature ( there 's no need for the " return to the mainloop " mentality ) .
The combination of lightweight threads plus message - passing is a good fit for the emerging world .
It permits us to blur the line between concurrency and distribution -- the API ( send / receive ) is the same ( although the failure modes and frequencies may be different ) , and allows a uniform set of tools for debugging , profiling , and verification .
For example , the most common verification tool in practice , the SPIN model checker , is based on a message passing mindset .
There is a good reason why Tony Hoare used " communicating sequential processes " as a model for verification .

We love solar , but our development has a deed restriction prohibiting solar panels on roofs .
We ca n’t wait to do a solar driveway instead and help the planet while saving us money !
We are so excited to run our home on a driveway that will light the way to family game night and save the planet !
We cannot even imagine the joy our Christmas decorations will bring .
Roads cover a big chunk of the land on Earth .
Generating power from them is ingenious !
Look forward to Solar Roadways ’ production for commercial use .
Solar power has intrigued me since I was a kid when I helped my baby sister race a mini solar powered car .
The fact that we have energy being wasted on asphalt and concrete hurts the “ efficient - side ” of my mind and I wonder just how much the world could change with this amazing technology !
Will be very beneficial for first responders .
Help to redirect traffic or even alert drivers that we are coming out of the station , not to mention not worrying about when the plow guy will come .
The idea of protecting the earth by using solar power instead of coal and fossil fuels is something I have wanted to do for some time .
I was researching solar panels for my roof and found Solar Roadways .
I immediately thought of their technology for my driveway .
A perfect solution for the needs of my house and the neighborhood .
I am very excited for the prospect of having Solar Roadways develop a plan and implement their technology to help me reduce my carbon footprint .
This is a great opportunity for each parking lot , side walk , or playground to make the buildings they are next to a source of clean energy .
An amazing invention to set the future of the world on a path to such great eco-friendly promise .
We at the self - build in St. Werburghs Bristol UK would love to improve our community further by installing Solar Roadways to our cul - de- sac so the kids can play in a safer environment and we can generate power .
At the same time , we can show how we all can do small things that make a big difference whilst at the same time we can save money !
Win Win .
Excited about having a negative carbon footprint !
It ’s time for every citizen to be accountable and be responsible to save the environment .
( Actions speak Louder than words !! )
Solar panels that allow people to walk on are a perfect fit for our Marina Pod solutions .
We are eagerly waiting for the first available solutions .
The panels will generate power to light the accessible parking area and pathways of our Nature Center .
The ability to have blue lights in the panel will enable us to identify these spaces for our users who need fully accessible parking , improving safety and efficiency !
Exciting product which we hope can become the standard everywhere and save energy !
I have been following your progress for a while now , ever since I was shown your viral video .
This may be one of the best ideas to take better advantage of the wasted space on our roadways , not to mention reduce wasted spending and resources on road salt that hurts the environment , time spent putting up unnecessary power poles and hiding utilities in the road and away from animals and the elements , and reduce or eliminate construction zones and protect lengths .
In Wisconsin we joke that we have two seasons : Winter and Construction .
How nice would it be to return to our regular 4 seasons and get rid of construction season .
Your viral video showed all the fancastic applications and improvements your product would make , and I got excited about every one of them .
In my personal and family quest to take our house off the grid , either through solar shingles , house batteries , and electric vehicles , I think a Solar Freakin ’ Driveway would be a great addition that would add value and be fun to have , all while reducing our carbon footprint .
Thank you !
Given the steep incline of our Homeowners Associating roads , we have not been able to get year - round access to all lots due to snow removal issues .
We are looking forward to bringing Solar Roadways to our HOA and our member ’s driveways .
I think solar roads would greatly offset the much - needed supply gap in Nigeria .
I believe your solar roads will help add to what my business is trying to achieve as well !
We believe that there are better ways to be able to eat healthier , and also to be able to be conscious of the way we get power to be able to help reduce the environmental impact on the earth .
We are always looking for ways to reduce costs in our subdivision and are at the place where the road needs to be replaced soon .
This would be an excellent choice for us .
We at Yoga Nature love the idea of welcoming clients to our yoga retreat sanctuary with a softly lit ( customizable ! ) driveway and parking lot and encouraging them to explore the grounds at night without the need for harsh traditional outdoor lighting .
Never having to plow and shovel snow again means we can spend more time focusing on our business and clients !
I want to use SR panels on my driveway , which is very steep , and we get a lot of snow .
It would make it much easier in the winter if we could melt ice on the driveway with solar panels .
I am so excited and think you guys have a brilliant product which is going to help us save the world as well as save me from breaking bones when I slip and slide on my driveway .
As we at Snedicor ’s Green Earth Cleaners continue to move our 101 - year - old dry cleaning business away from the use of petrochemicals and into eco-friendly cleaning processes , we are excited about the prospect of building eco­friendly , energy - positive parking lots and sidewalks at our new cleaning facility !
Due to the amount of crime that has taken place in our back alleys , we have worked hard with the City of Phoenix in developing a pilot program called Gated Alley Program ( GAP ) .
GAP will remove trash service from the alley and move it to the front of the house leaving a big piece of land behind our properties with gates at both access points restricting access to unwanted foot , bike , and vehicle traffic .
What better use of this land then to install Solar Roadways ® that produces clean energy while providing an aesthetically pleasing surface for neighbors to enjoy !
Arizona has plenty of sun to take advantage of and we hope revolutionize the use of alleys across the Country !
Our driveway has a ton of sun , and our electric bills in FL are out of control .
We ’d love to replace our driveway pavers with something to help us lower those bills AND our carbon footprint .
Solar Roadways brings innovation that is the perfect fit for BlackSheep Development ’s sustainability goals for their buildings and village development .
I like Solar Roadways panels because I want to help this planet and reduce waste of energy .
I am also intrigued by the idea of being able to plug my electric car into the driveway 🙂
My roof is too weak for solar panels ; my driveway needs to be redone and it gets beat up by the sun all day ; I have a garden next to my driveway and I do n’t like that every time we use a blower or it ’s windy , all the asphalt dust flies on my edibles and on my soil ; my one year old keeps on trying to eat pieces of asphalt .
I want to support Solar Roadways ®!
Driveways are large surfaces , which if harnessed by products like Solar Roadways panels could likely produce a considerable amount of a home ’s energy needs , while also providing high quality , long lasting surface .
I love the idea of never having to shovel my driveway again and the fact that the panels would power my home
Anything we can do to work with our planet instead of against it … just imagine if we all had solar Roadways !
The difference it would make in the health of our planet .
I believe in better ways of doing things .
SRPs represent just some of the ways we can do things better .
Safer roads while generating more sustainable , cost effective electricity that , I hope will benefit all someday .
Keep it up , we are rooting for you .
Hopefully Trump and the DOT will start using this to make our roads safer .
We love solar , but our development has a deed restriction prohibiting solar panels on roofs .
We ca n’t wait to do a solar driveway instead and help the planet while saving us money !
Solar Roadways is leading us into the energy future with new solar technology .
I am inspired by Solar Roadways commitment to revisioning roads to build a sustainable , and secure energy future .
For greener energy , fun designs for kids , and NEVER SHOVELING SNOW AGAIN !
We were early contributors to Solar Roadways Crowd funding site with a tote bag to prove it !
We want to install this product so mo re people will see it and demand it .
We want to be one of the agents of change !
Decentralize power production – Power to the People !!
Long Iowa winters , restrictive covenants on rooftop solar , a geothermal heat pump and an electric car sitting in the garage with a plenty large driveway with the typical suburban basketball hoop make your Solar Roadways the perfect solution .
We would like to be a renewable energy house .
Solar shingles , solar panels and driveway in the near future .
I am very interested in how the Solar Road Panels can be used for lighted walkways and driveways .
I think that they can be used in a creative landscaping scheme .
I ’m also curious about how viable the generation of energy is in the Pacific Northwest considering how often it rains in this part of the country .
And I love the creative innovation they represent .
Take me into the future !
I so look forward to saving money on electricity AND not having to shovel snow in the winter !
Plus , the lighting will make my patio look spectacular .
All without putting holes in my roof .
Solar Independence for the future of our planet and survival
Solar Roadways is the most exciting product to fight climate change and save money that I have seen !
It ’s versatile applications and technological possibilities are truly remarkable and offer an inspiring peak at a possibly bright future !
We want to be as self - sufficient as possible and keep this planet GREEN !
We want to use these panels to lower our bills , get rid of the need for shoveling ever again , add value and fun to our home , and make it possible for us to live without energy bills and to live without using more fossil fuels !
To help power our home and being in Canada having a heated driveway to reduce or get rid of the need to shovel HUGE BONUS !!!
I would like to maximize my solar capacity .
My driveway would be an ideal application and I very much look forward to this technology !
Hoping to help the environment by using alternative to fossil fuels .
In one of the previous posts we were speaking about nuts .
Here is something to the topic .
I have found beautiful pictures of squirrels , really cute .
Enjoy !
City lawyer ' faked nervous breakdown to claim record £ 19 m sex discrimination payout '
' A very plausible liar ' : Gillian Switalski
A lawyer in line for a record £ 19 million payout over claims that a sexist bullying campaign ended her career was yesterday described as a liar .
Gillian Switalski , 51 , said harassment and sexual discrimination at a finance company had left her ' mentally disabled ' and effectively unable to work .
But lawyers for the City firm revealed that she had secretly applied for three high - powered jobs while on sick leave , and accepted a £ 160,000 - a- year post while still claiming she could not work .
They said the married mother - of - two had an ' exit strategy ' to win a seven figure compensation payout from F&C Asset Management , which controls assets worth £ 102 billion , then resume her high - flying career .
Monica Carss - Frisk QC , for F&C , told an employment tribunal : ' The new evidence shows that she simply did not tell the truth , and was a very plausible liar . '
The tribunal had been told at an earlier hearing that Mrs Switalski's treatment at the City firm had left the self - confessed workaholic suffering from depression and unable to concentrate enough to even read a newspaper .
But yesterday 's hearing was told she had applied for three jobs , including a demanding role on the organising committee of the 2012 London Olympic Games , while on sick leave .
One businessman who met her during the interview process said he was struck by her ' huge energy and drive ' .
Mrs Switalski previously won an employment tribunal against the firm over her claims that she was undermined , bullied and marginalised while head of legal affairs .
She had asked for £ 19 million to compensate her for psychiatric damage , loss of earnings , pension rights and her future career prospects .
But the firm said it had learned she had applied for other jobs after the original tribunal ruling .
It is now seeking to overturn that decision and avoid a compensation payout which is believed would be the biggest of its kind in British legal history .
Miss Carss - Frisk said : ' The evidence fundamentally undermines Mrs Switalski 's credibility to the extent that some , if not all , of the evidence you heard must now be doubted . '
Mrs Switalski claims she was bullied from late 2004 and was unable to work from August 2006 , when she went on sick leave following an operation .
But she applied for a job as legal director at the finance company Royal London in July 2006 and attended three interviews before being offered the job in November that year .
On the same day as one meeting her psychiatrist diagnosed her with post - traumatic stress disorder and said she should be offered medical retirement from work .
Miss Carss - Frisk said : ' She was evidently intent to present to her psychiatrist a very different picture to what she had presented to Royal London – a picture designed to present someone who was mentally disabled , all part of a strategy to claim loss of career and compensation . '
Gillian Switalski sold her family 's £ 3.4 million home in Virginia Water , Surrey , to fund her legal fight
Mrs Switalski , who has sold her family 's £ 3.4 million home in Virginia Water , Surrey , to fund her legal fight , broke down as she insisted she had been treated unfairly at F&C .
She said : ' They had taken my career away from me and I was being forced out of the door for no reason except that face did n't fit and I was a woman . '
She said she had taken the Royal London job because she had hoped to recover , adding : ' I 'm the breadwinner and I had to earn money .
My husband is a teacher .
' If you are seriously suggesting I would sell my family home and go into debt of seven figures in the hope of getting something from a tribunal then I should actually be certified , not just on medication . '
The hearing continues .
At a Midtown hotel ballroom on Thursday , Vice President Dick Cheney declared that the United States was “ succeeding brilliantly ” in Iraq and assailed Democrats on taxes , gas prices , and national security .
As the keynote speaker at the annual dinner of the New York State Republican Party at the Sheraton New York Hotel and Towers , Mr. Cheney predicted victory in November for the presumptive Republican presidential nominee , Senator John McCain of Arizona .
He also criticized Democrats in Congress for refusing to extend President Bush ’s tax cuts .
Reprising language from a speech he gave at the Coast Guard Academy this month , Mr. Cheney said of the war in Iraq that the “ only way to lose this fight is to quit  but that would be an act of betrayal and dishonor , and that is not going to happen on our watch . ”
Mr. Cheney made no mention of two controversial issues : Scott McClellan , the former White House press secretary who recently published a book sharply critical of his former colleagues in the Bush administration , and the topic of the day in New York , Gov. David A. Paterson ’s decision to order state agencies to recognize same - sex marriages performed in other jurisdictions .
Python for JavaScript Programmers
By Atul Varma
I could n't find anything on the web that attempted to teach Python to readers who already knew JavaScript , so I thought I 'd give it a shot , since a number of my friends at Mozilla do n't know much about Python but know JavaScript incredibly well .
The languages actually are n't that dissimilar -- in fact , some of JavaScript 's latest features have been borrowed directly from Python .
Many thanks to those who have commented in my blog post about this tutorial ; this rendition of it contains a number of changes as a result of that feedback .
Whitespace
This is a good time to explain a bit about Python 's design philosophy ; hopefully it will give you a better idea of whether this is a language you 'd like to use .
While not syntactically enforced by many languages , whitespace is semantically meaningful during the reading and writing of code .
Take the following example of C - like code : if ( someVar == 1 ) doSomething ( ) ;
The line doSomething ( ) ; is indented after the if statement to indicate that it should only be done if the statement above it is true .
Given this , consider what the following code does : if ( someVar == 1 ) doSomething ( ) ; doSomethingElse ( ) ;
It 's clear from the use of whitespace that doSomethingElse ( ) ; should also only be executed if the statement it 's indented under is true , but this is not the case for C - like languages .
Indeed , the programmer must add additional code to tell the compiler what he or she means : if ( someVar == 1 ) { doSomething ( ) ; doSomethingElse ( ) ; }
Why does the programmer have to write more code to tell the computer something it should already be able to infer from the use of whitespace ?
This is actually a violation of the Don't Repeat Yourself ( DRY ) principle popularized by Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas .
Because extra work is required when moving from a single - line clause to a multiple - line clause , it 's a constant source of errors in C - like languages , and stylistic rules and arguments have been spawned as a result of this mistake in language design .
Python is one of the few languages that takes the simpler and more humane approach : whitespace has a consistent semantic meaning to the humans who write code , so the computer should take this into account when it processes the code .
This reduces the burden on the programmer from having to repeat their intent in multiple different ways .
So , you wo n't see any brackets in Python .
Instead , if a statement ends with a colon , the next statement needs to be indented and begins a new block .
The block ends as soon as an unindented line is encountered , like so : if someVar == 1 : doSomething ( ) doSomethingElse ( ) else : doOtherThing ()
Python is technically like JavaScript in that semicolons are optional , but its community prescribes the opposite convention : that is , semicolons should never be used to delimit statements unless absolutely necessary .
This is yet another decision that reduces the cognitive burden on the programmer ; indeed , many of the language features covered below were designed with a very careful eye towards readability , reducing cognitive load , and making the process of programming as enjoyable as possible .
The Interactive Shell Python , when executed with no parameters , just presents an interactive interpreter .
It 's similar to the SpiderMonkey / Rhino shell and xpcshell if you 're familiar with those .
All following code examples in this tutorial will be displayed as though they 're being executed in it , like so : >>> 1 + 2 3 >>> #
Here 's a comment that does nothing .
>>> print " hi ! " hi ! >>> print " This is a long " \ ... " statement that spans multiple lines . "
This is a long statement that spans multiple lines .
One built - in function in particular that helps explore things in the built - in shell is dir ( ) , which returns a list of all the attributes attached to an object : >>> dir ( " a string " ) [ ' __add__ ' , ' __class__ ' , ' __contains__ ' , ' __delattr__ ' , ' __doc__ ' , ' __eq__ ' , ' __ge__ ' , ' __getattribute__ ' , ' __getitem__ ' , ' __getnewargs__ ' , ' __getslice__ ' , ' __gt__ ' , ' __hash__ ' , ' __init__ ' , ' __le__ ' , ' __len__ ' , ' __lt__ ' , ' __mod__ ' , ' __mul__ ' , ' __ne__ ' , ' __new__ ' , ' __reduce__ ' , ' __reduce_ex__ ' , ' __repr__ ' , ' __rmod__ ' , ' __rmul__ ' , ' __setattr__ ' , ' __str__ ' , ' capitalize ' , ' center ' , ' count ' , ' decode ' , ' encode ' , ' endswith ' , ' expandtabs ' , ' find ' , ' index ' , ' isalnum ' , ' isalpha ' , ' isdigit ' , ' islower ' , ' isspace ' , ' istitle ' , ' isupper ' , ' join ' , ' ljust ' , ' lower ' , ' lstrip ' , ' partition ' , ' replace ' , ' rfind ' , ' rindex ' , ' rjust ' , ' rpartition ' , ' rsplit ' , ' rstrip ' , ' split ' , ' splitlines ' , ' startswith ' , ' strip ' , ' swapcase ' , ' title ' , ' translate ' , ' upper ' , ' zfill ' ]
If there 's a function you 're interested in learning more about , you can look at the built - in documentation metadata associated with the object -- known as the docstring -- by calling the built - in help ( ) function on the object .
For instance , here 's how to get help on the string object 's join ( ) method : >>> help ( " a string " .
join )
Help on built - in function join : < BLANKLINE > join ( ...) S.join ( sequence ) -> string < BLANKLINE >
Return a string which is the concatenation of the strings in the sequence .
The separator between elements is S. < BLANKLINE >
This makes it easy and fun to explore the language and its environs .
Batteries Included Python comes with a standard library that provides a great deal of functionality , from enhanced introspection to serialization , logging , XML processing , database access , testing , networking , data archiving , and more .
Extensive documentation for it all is contained in the Python Library Reference .
To use the functionality of a module , you 'll use Python 's import statement , like so : >>> import sha
This particular line imports the sha module , which provides access to the SHA - 1 message digest algorithm .
At this point , sha is an object in your namespace and can be used , for instance , to create a sha object from which to generate a hex digest : >>> sha.sha ( " hello " ) .hexdigest ( ) ' aaf4c61ddcc5e8a2dabede0f3b482cd9aea9434d '
It 's not hard to create your own modules ; you can learn how to do it in the Modules section of the official Python Tutorial .
Strings Strings in Python work a lot like they do in JavaScript , but with some added benefits .
Strings -- or any sequence - like object in Python , for that matter -- can be indexed by character like they can in JavaScript , with the addition that negative indexes may be used to denote items from the end of the sequence : >>> " Hello " [ - 1 ] ' o '
Any indexable item can generally also be sliced ; this is similar to String . slice in JavaScript , only built - in to the language : >>> " hello " [ 2:4 ] #
Just like " hello " . slice ( 2,4 ) in JS 'll ' >>> " hello " [ 2 : ] # Just like " hello " .slice ( 2 ) in JS ' llo ' >>> " hello " [ : 4 ] # Just like " hello " . slice ( 0,4 ) in JS ' hell '
It 's also easy to format strings in Python .
If you 're familiar with C's sprintf ( ) function , Python 's string interpolation operator , % , behaves a bit like it : >>>
" Hello %s , I need %d dollars . " % ( " bob " , 5 ) ' Hello bob , I need 5 dollars . '
You can find out more in the String Formatting Operations section of the Python Library Reference .
Expressions Python 's expression syntax is much like that of JavaScript , or any C - like language for that matter : >>> 9 & 1 # Bitwise operations 1 >>> 2 << 2 # Shifting 8 >>> 5 >= 3 # Comparisons True >>>
8 + 2 * ( 3 + 5 ) # Arithmetic 24 >>> 1 == 1 # Equivalence True Some C - like expression constructs have been substituted for more readable alternatives : >>> not True # ' not ' instead of '!'
False >>>
True and True # ' and ' instead of ' && ' True >>>
True or False # ' or ' instead of ' | | '
True
But there 's some elements of C - like expressions that are n't supported , because they tend to be more trouble than they 're worth .
For instance , some constructs that can be used in expressions in C - like languages can only be used in statements in Python : >>> a = 5 # Assignment works in statements . >>> a += 1 # Add-assignment does too . >>> if a = 1 : # But you can't assign in an expression .
... pass Traceback ( most recent call last ) : ... SyntaxError : invalid syntax
The ++ and -- unary assignment operators are n't part of the Python language .
Nothingness Unlike JavaScript , Python does n't have a concept of undefined .
Instead , things that would normally cause undefined to be returned by JavaScript simply end up raising an exception in Python : >>> " a string " .
foo Traceback ( most recent call last ) : ... AttributeError : ' str ' object has no attribute ' foo '
In most cases , this is for the best , as it makes debugging easier .
Python also has an analog to JavaScript 's null : it 's called None .
Equality
There are some differences between Python and JavaScript when it comes to equality ; when using the == operator , for instance , Python compares the value of objects rather than their locations in memory : >>> a = [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] >>> b = [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] >>> a == b True
The above expression is valid JavaScript code , but it would evaluate to false .
Python 's is operator compares object identity : >>> a is b False
Functions Functions are defined like so : >>> def foo( x ) : ... print " foo called with parameter : %s " % x
They are called as you 'd expect : >>> foo ( 5 ) foo called with parameter : 5 Unlike JavaScript , though , it 's not possible to call them with fewer or more arguments than they 'd expect : >>> foo ()
Traceback ( most recent call last ) : ... TypeError : foo( ) takes exactly 1 argument ( 0 given )
Though it is possible to provide defaults for arguments : >>> def bar( x , y=1 , z=5 ) : ... return x + y + z
And it 's also possible to specify arguments using keywords : >>> bar ( 1 , z=6 ) 8
You can also write documentation for functions by providing a string immediately following the function signature : >>> def foo( ) : ... " Does something useless " ... pass
As mentioned earlier , this string is called the docstring ; it 's actually attached to the function object as its __doc__ attribute .
Creating docstrings for your functions not only helps document your code , but also makes it easier for Python users to interactively explore your code , too .
It 's also possible for Python functions to have arbitrary argument lists , which is similar to JavaScript 's arguments array .
And as in JavaScript , functions are first - class citizens and can be passed around as parameters to other functions , returned by functions , and so forth .
Variables Python , like JavaScript , is lexically scoped when it comes to reading variables .
However , Python 's scoping rules for assignment to undefined variables works opposite to JavaScript 's ; instead of being global by default , variables are local , and there is no analog to var or let .
Rather , the global keyword is used to specify that a variable be bound to global instead of local scope : >>> a = 1 # Define our global variable . >>> def foo( x ) : ... a = x + 1 # ' a ' is a new local variable . >>> def bar(x ) : ... global a # Bind 'a ' to the global scope .
... a = x + 1 >>> foo ( 5 ) >>> a 1 >>> bar ( 5 ) >>> a 6
This is for the best : as it's well - known that global variables should be used as sparingly as possible , it 's better for a language interpreter to assume that all new assignments are local unless explicitly told otherwise .
Sequences Lists are a lot like JavaScript arrays : >>> mylist = [ " hello " , " there " ]
Iterating through them is easy : >>> for i in mylist : ... print i hello there Strings are just sequences of single - character strings , so they can be used similarly : >>> for c in " boof " : ... print c b o o f Tuples are just like lists , only they 're immutable and differentiated from lists by using parentheses instead of brackets : >>> mytuple = ( " hello " , " there " ) >>> mytuple [ 0 ] = " bye " Traceback ( most recent call last ) : ... TypeError : ' tuple ' object does not support item assignment Tuples with a single item look a little weird , though : >>> mytuple = ( " hello " , ) # Without the comma , it 'd just be a string .
It 's also not possible for there to be " holes " in Python lists like there are in Javascript arrays : >>> a = [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] >>> del a [ 1 ]
# Deletes ' 2 ' >>> a [ 1 , 3 ]
It 's also possible to index and slice lists and tuples , just like you can with strings : >>> [ " hello " , " there " , " dude " ] [ - 1 ] ' dude ' >>> [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] [ 1:2 ] [ 2 ]
In fact , if the datatype is mutable like lists are , you can even assign to slices : >>> a = [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ] >>> a [ 1:3 ] = [ 5 ] >>> a [ 1 , 5 , 4 ]
Control Flow
You 've already seen examples of for , if , and if ... else .
Python also supports if ... elif : >>> if 1 == 2 : ... pass ... elif 1 == 1 : ... print " Hooray ! " ... else : ... print " Boo . " Hooray !
It also supports while : >>> while False : ... print " This should never display . "
However , Python does not have a do ... while loop .
To loop through a range of numbers , you can use the range ( ) built - in function , which returns a list of numbers in the range you specify : >>> for i in range ( 3 ) : ... print i 0 1 2 Python also has break and continue statements , which work as expected .
Dictionaries Dictionaries are a bit like Object literals in JavaScript : >>> d = { " foo " : 1 , " bar " : 2} >>> d[ " foo " ]
1
Their properties can't be referenced using dot notation , though : >>> d.foo Traceback ( most recent call last ) : ... AttributeError : ' dict ' object has no attribute ' foo '
Since Python does n't have a notion of undefined , the easiest way to check whether a dictionary has a key is through the in keyword : >>> " a " in { " a " : 1 , " b " : 2} True Dictionaries can also be used as operands for string formatting operations : >>> d = { " name " : " bob " , " money " : 5} >>>
" Hello %( name ) s , I need % ( money ) d dollars . " % d ' Hello bob , I need 5 dollars . '
Keys for dictionaries can actually be any immutable type ; this means that , for instance , tuples can be used as keys : >>> a = { ( 1,2 ) : 1}
But lists can't : >>> b = { [ 1,2 ] : 1} Traceback ( most recent call last ) : ... TypeError : list objects are unhashable Python dictionaries generally are n't used to create arbitrary objects like they are in Javascript ; they do n't have prototypes , nor do they have meta - methods .
Instead , classes are used to do that sort of thing .
In some ways , this is unfortunate , since the simplicity of conflating objects with dictionaries , as JavaScript and Lua do , makes understanding and using them easier .
But in exchange , dictionaries do come pre-packaged with a bevy of useful methods .
Classes Classes are pretty straightforward : >>> class Foo( object ) : ... def __init__ ( self , a ) : ... self .a = a ... print " Foo created . " ... def doThing ( self ) : ... return self .a + 1 Here Foo is a subclass of object , which is the root object class that any class should ultimately descend from .
The constructor is always called __init__ ( ) and is invoked like so : >>> f = Foo(1 ) Foo created .
So you do n't need to use a new operator or anything as is the case with JS .
Calling methods and accessing attributes is straightforward too : >>> f.a 1 >>> f.doThing () 2
An object 's methods are also bound to the object itself once it 's created ; that is , the self parameter that 's passed to them is always the same , unlike the this parameter in JavaScript which changes based on the object the function is attached to : >>> f = Foo(5 ) Foo created . >>>
doThing = f.doThing >>> doThing ( ) 6
Do make sure that you always remember to include self as an explicit parameter in class methods , though ; failure to do so can lead to some strange results : >>> class Foo( object ) : ... def bar(x ) : ... return x + 1 >>> f = Foo( ) >>> f.bar ()
Traceback ( most recent call last ) : ... TypeError : unsupported operand type(s ) for + : ' Foo ' and ' int ' >>> f.bar(1 ) Traceback ( most recent call last ) : ... TypeError : bar ( ) takes exactly 1 argument ( 2 given )
As you can see , classes in Python are n't particularly elegant ; it 's hard to understand exactly why things work the way they do unless you understand how classes are implemented " under the hood " , which is unfortunate .
Because classes in Python are n't really prototype - based , it 's not easy to dynamically add or remove methods to existing objects on - the - fly - - though some will probably tell you that doing such a thing is n't a good idea in the first place .
In practice , all of Python 's built - in types come with a well - designed retinue of methods , so there 's little need for one to want to add methods to them on - the - fly , which certainly is n't the case in JavaScript .
Another advantage of Python 's class mechanism is that you get inheritance for free : >>> class A ( object ) : ... def foo( self ) : ... print " In A.foo ( ) . " >>> class B ( A ) : ... def bar( self ) : ... print " In B.bar ( ) . " >>> b = B( ) >>> b.foo() In A.foo ( ) . >>> b.bar () In B.bar ( ) .
Overriding superclass methods is a bit odd syntactically , though : >>> class C( B ) : ... def foo( self ) : ... super( C , self ) .foo ( ) ... print " In C.foo ( ) . " >>> c = C( ) >>> c.foo() In A.foo ( ) .
In C.foo ( ) .
Properties
You can achieve the equivalent of JavaScript 's getters and setters by creating a property in a class definition : >>> class Foo( object ) : ... def _get_bar( self ) : ... print " getting bar ! " ... return 5 ... bar = property ( fget = _get_bar )
Not quite as elegant as JavaScript 's get keyword in an object initializer , but it gets the job done : >>> f = Foo( ) >>> f. bar getting bar !
5
Note that since we did n't define a setter , we 've effectively created a read - only attribute : >>> f.bar = 5 Traceback ( most recent call last ) : ... AttributeError : ca n't set attribute
Operator Overloading and Special Methods Classes can define methods with special names to do all sorts of dynamic things , from operator overloading to custom attribute access and more .
You can read about them more in the Python Reference Manual 's section on special method names .
Exceptions
They work as expected , and there 's a number of built - in ones .
Python prefers the term raise to JavaScript 's throw , and except to JavaScript 's catch .
Given this , the following code is fairly self - explanatory : >>> try : ... raise Exception ( " Oof " ) ... except Exception , e : ... print " Caught an exception : %s " % e Caught an exception : Oof
Closures Function closures are available in Python : >>> def myfunc ( ) : ... a = 1 ... def wrapped ( ) : ... return a ... return wrapped >>> myfunc ( ) ()
1 Unlike Javascript , however , the variable bindings in the closure are " read - only " : >>> def myfunc ( ) : ... a = 1 ... def wrapped ( ) : ... a += 1 # Does n't work !
... return a ... return wrapped >>> myfunc ( ) ()
Traceback ( most recent call last ) : ... UnboundLocalError : local variable ' a ' referenced before assignment
This means that closures can't be used to access private variables like they can in JavaScript ; instead , everything is visible , and implementation - specific variables are conventionally preceded with one or two underscores .
Caveats
As with any language , there 's a few wrinkles in Python 's design and history that any newcomer should be aware of .
I 'll try to outline the most important ones below .
Unicode Sometimes , strings are the bane of Python programming .
Unlike JavaScript , in which every string is unicode , strings in Python are really more like immutable arrays of bytes .
Unicode strings are an entirely different type , and unicode literals must be prepended with a u , like so : >>>
u" I am a unicode string . " u'I am a unicode string . ' >>>
" I am a non-unicode string . "
' I am a non-unicode string . '
The non-intuitiveness of this is due to historical reasons : Python is an older language than JavaScript and dates back to 1991 , so the language did n't originally support unicode .
When support was added , it was added in a way that did n't break backwards compatibility .
This situation will be resolved in Python 3000 , the first version of Python to break backwards compatibility with previous versions .
A string with a character encoding may be converted to a unicode object through the decode ( ) method , like so : >>>
" Here is an ellipsis : \xe 2\x80 \x a6 " . decode ( " utf - 8 " )
u'
Here is an ellipsis : \u2026 '
Conversely , you can convert a unicode object into a string via the encode ( ) method : >>>
u" Here is an ellipsis : \u2026 " .encode ( " utf - 8 " )
' Here is an ellipsis : \xe2\x80 \x a 6 '
An exception will be raised if there are characters that are n't supported by the encoding you specify , though : >>> u" hello\u2026 " .encode ( " ascii " )
Traceback ( most recent call last ) : ... UnicodeEncodeError : ' ascii ' codec can't encode character u'\u2026 ' in position 5 : ordinal not in range ( 128 )
As such , it 's a good idea to optionally specify an algorithm to deal with characters that are n't supported by the encoding : >>> u" hello\u2026 " .encode ( " ascii " , " ignore " ) ' hello ' >>> u" hello\u2026 " .encode ( " ascii " , " xmlcharrefreplace " ) ' hello … '
Old - Style Classes
There are also some bumps in the history of Python 's class mechanism : until version 2.2 , Python 's built - in types were n't part of the class heirarchy , and there was no root object class ; these kinds of classes were known as old - style classes , and are being mentioned here solely because you may run across them when reading old code .
They do n't support a lot of the things that new - style classes do , and should be avoided if at all possible .
You can tell that an object is an instance of an old - style or new - style class by using the type built - in function : >>> class OldStyle : # No superclass means it 's old - style .
... pass >>> class NewStyle ( object ) : ... pass >>> type( OldStyle ( ) ) < type ' instance '> >>> type( NewStyle( ) ) < class ' NewStyle ' >
A number of the class mechanisms outlined in this tutorial , such as the property ( ) and super ( ) built - in functions , do n't work with old - style classes .
Fortunately , as with the string / unicode schism , this confusion will be resolved in Python 3000 , which abandons old - style classes to their well - deserved fate .
Coding Style Python has a coding convention that 's generally been embraced throughout the community ; almost all libraries use it .
It 's contained in PEP 8 .
Documentation Testing
One of the most useful features of Python is one of its standard library modules .
The doctest module allows you to test interactive interpreter excerpts embedded either in the docstrings of your Python code or separate files to verify their correctness .
It 's an excellent way to turn your documentation into your unit tests , and it's also how the document you 're reading right now is tested for accuracy .
More Resources
If you like what you 've seen of the language , I highly recommend reading David Beazley 's Python Essential Reference , which features a much more thorough and concise overview of the language .
It 's also a good idea to become involved with the Python community ; it 's very friendly and helpful .
In particular , you may want to join the tutor mailing list , and a local user group if your area has one .
The Crimes of the Century
The FBI Looks Back at Some of the Most Celebrated Cases of the Last 100 Years
On July 26 the Federal Bureau of Investigation will celebrate its 100th anniversary .
To commemorate , the bureau has put together a history series , " FBI 100 , " that details some of the most significant and high - profile cases of the last 100 years .
The bureau originated with the passage of a 1907 law prohibiting Secret Service operatives from conducting federal criminal investigations .
Attorney General Charles Bonaparte , under President Theodore Roosevelt , assembled 10 former Secret Service agents to become special agents within the Department of Justice .
Bonaparte 's successor , Attorney General George Wickersham , later named the force the Bureau of Investigation .
Considered the birth of the FBI , the small group of 10 later grew into the agency that now employs more than 30,000 people .
Since its creation in 1908 , the FBI has been involved in some of the most celebrated criminal cases of the century .
Here are some of the nation 's most sensational crimes , challenging investigations and compelling criminals :
( For more information , click here for the FBI Web site . )
Bonnie and Clyde
Immortalized on the silver screen , Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow were the most notorious crime couple in American history .
They were said to fall in love instantly when they met in January 1930 .
Just a few days later 19 - year - old Bonnie helped Clyde — at 21 already a multiple felon — escape from jail .
After that , they were forever partners in crime .
From the summer of 1932 to the spring of 1934 , the Dallas couple crossed the country in stolen cars , robbing gas stations , grocery stores and sometimes banks .
Though Bonnie never fired a gun , Clyde murdered at least a 12 people , including policemen and bystanders .
After joining the chase for the infamous couple in 1933 , the FBI discovered ties to the Methvin family in Louisiana and ultimately persuaded them to help .
In May 1934 the unsuspecting couple slowed to help Ivy Methvin on the side of the road with an apparently broken down truck .
Hiding in bushes , the FBI ambushed the duo and killed the lawless lovers .
The Odd Couple Bank Robbers
Deemed the Odd Couple of Crime , Albert Nussbaum and Bobby Wilcoxson were complete opposites .
All they shared , it seemed , was a lust for crime , and together they robbed banks across the nation .
Nussbaum , believed to be the brains of the pair , was a student of crime , constantly perusing books on explosives , electronics , criminal investigations and firearms .
Wilcoxson brought the brawn to the team , carrying heavy weaponry and intimidating bankers with his intimidating size and booming voice .
The unlikely pair met in an Ohio prison and reconnected after release , robbing their first bank in Buffalo in 1960 .
But by June 1961 , they made their first mistake : the FBI lifted Nussbaum 's fingerprint from a homemade bomb , meant to distract police from the bank robbery , that failed to detonate .
Their fifth bank robbery , in which they recruited accomplice Peter Curry , landed them on the FBI 's " Top Ten " fugitive list after it went terribly wrong .
A customer fled to alert police while Wilcoxson killed a guard , and the three barely escaped .
Curry was arrested soon after and revealed all he knew about the murderous pair .
Forced into hiding , Nussbaum and Wilcoxson used alias and disguises and robbed three more banks before going separate ways after a falling out .
Lost without his partner , Nussbaum contacted his estranged wife , who turned him in .
Wilcoxson was caught six days later and the two ultimately pled guilty and were sentenced to life in prison in February 1964 .
The Lindbergh Kidnapping
After making his historic nonstop flight across the Atlantic , aviator Charles Lindbergh and his wife hoped to avoid the media spotlight by retreating to rural Hopewell , N.J .
But their dreams of private peace were shattered on March 1 , 1932 , when someone leaned a ladder against their house , climbed through a window and took the couple 's sleeping 20 - month - old son from his nursery , leaving behind only a ransom note demanding $ 50,000 .
More ransom notes led to a meeting , where Dr. John Condon represented the Lindbergh family and paid a man who called himself " John " $ 50,000 in gold certificates for the child 's safe return .
It did n't work .
The boy 's body was found on May 12 of that year — less than five miles from the Lindbergh home — killed by a blow to the head soon after the kidnapping .
Working with Condon , the FBI developed a sketch of " John " and determined from studies of the ransom notes handwriting that he was German .
Following reports of gold certificates that matched the ransom money , the FBI closed in on New York City .
A gas station attendant wrote down the license plate of a car used by a man who cashed one of the gold certificates .
Bruno Richard Hauptmann , a German carpenter living in the Bronx who closely resembled the FBI 's sketch of the suspect , was arrested in September 1934 .
Hauptmann 's handwriting matched the ransom notes , and more ransom money was found in his home , as were and tools matching tool marks on the ladder from the crime scene .
He was convicted and sentenced to death in 1935 .
The World Trade Center Bombing
On Friday , February 26 , 1993 , a massive eruption in the parking garage beneath the World Trade Center in New York created a nearly 100 - foot crater extending many stories deep and several more high .
The blast killed six people instantly , and many more were soon trapped by the smoke and flames that began to fill the void and permeate the structure above .
With injuries ranging from crushed limbs to sprains , more than 1,000 people were hurt .
Before the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terrorist attack , the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center was one of the worst acts of terrorism the city had ever seen .
A van stolen the day before the attack was suspiciously destroyed in the rubble .
On March 4 an FBI SWAT team arrested Mohammad Salameh , an Islamic fundamentalist who had rented the vehicle and tried to get the deposit back .
Clues from his arrest led to the discovery of the apartment where the bomb was created , a storage locker with enough cyanide to wipe out an entire town , and ultimately the arrest of three more suspects — Nidal Ayyad , Mahmoud Abouhalima and Ahmed Ajaj .
Each was convicted and sentenced to life in prison .
The arrests led the FBI and New York 's joint terrorism task force to a greater plot to simultaneously bomb multiple New York landmarks , including the United Nations building and the FBI building .
In June 1994 , the FBI stormed a warehouse and caught other members of a terrorist cell assembling bombs .
The mastermind , Ramzi Yousef , was ultimately captured in Pakistan in 1995 .
He was planning an attack on the U.S. involving airplanes .
His uncle , Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , later became the alleged mastermind behind the Sept. 11 terror attacks .
The Unabomber
Ted Kaczynski , known as the " Unabomber , " is now almost a household name .
But during the 20 - year investigation following his first bomb at the University of Illinois at Chicago in 1978 , he was the perfect anonymous killer .
During his 17 - year bombing spree he killed three Americans , injured 24 and instilled widespread fear and panic with threats to blow up airliners in flight .
His nickname is derived from the 1979 task force created to investigate his crimes , called " UNABOM " for the UNiversity and Airline BOMbing targets involved .
Forensic examinations were virtually useless , as Kaczynski was extremely careful to avoid leaving clues by creating bombs from untraceable scrap materials available anywhere .
And his victims were targets randomly chosen from library research .
In 1995 the Unabomber sent the FBI a 35,000 - word essay detailing his motives and objections to modern society .
Despite initial hesitations , the FBI released the manifesto to the public , and David Kaczynski contacted the FBI and suggested it might have been written by his troubled brother Ted .
On April 3 , 1996 , the FBI arrested Kaczynski in his 10 - foot - by - 14 - foot cabin near Lincoln , Mont. , where they found an arsenal of bomb components , 40,000 revealing journal pages and one live bomb .
Kaczynski pleaded guilty and was sentenced to life in isolation at a " Supermax " prison in Colorado .
Jonestown Cult Murder - Suicide
Jonestown was a makeshift settlement of more then 900 people in the jungle of Guyana created by Jim Jones and his cult - like following , called the People 's Temple .
Reports began to surface about the group , suggesting abuse , forced labor , imprisonments , the use of drugs to control behavior , suspicious deaths and mass suicide rehearsals .
In November 1978 , California Rep. Leo Ryan brought the press to check out the rumors and learned that many members wanted to leave with Ryan .
The congressman ordered two planes to bring the entire group to escape together , but as they assembled on the airstrip , armed men from Jonestown emerged in trucks , opening fire on one plane while one member of the sect , Larry Layton , began shooting from inside the plane .
Ryan and many others were killed .
Arguing that their attack on the planes would bring Jonestown residents harm , Jones persuaded more then 900 sect members — including more than 200 children — to drink a fruit drink laced with cyanide .
Along with the poisoned followers , Jones was found dead , with a gunshot wound to the head .
An extensive investigation involving the few survivors of the Jonestown disaster led to the arrest of Larry Layton , who was the only member of the Peoples Temple tried in the U.S. for crimes at Jonestown .
He was sentenced to life in prison .
The 1963 Birmingham Baptist Church Bombing
On Sept. 15 , 1963 , a dynamite bomb exploded in a Birmingham , Ala. , Baptist Church , killing four African - American girls and injuring more than 20 others inside .
The crime was an act of racial hatred on the church , which hosted key civil rights meetings and had been the target of many bomb threats .
The FBI launched an investigation immediately and continued throughout September and October as agents infiltrated the Ku Klux Klan and other local anti-black groups .
By 1965 the FBI had serious suspects , including KKK members Robert E. Chambliss , Bobby Frank Cherry , Herman Frank Cash and Thomas E. Blanton , Jr. But locals were hesitant to talk and there was little physical evidence .
Ultimately , Chambliss 's conviction and life sentence in 1977 led to the cooperation of previously reluctant witnesses , and after the case re-opened in the mid-1990s , Blanton and Cherry were convicted and sentenced to life in prison in 2000 .
Cash had died in 1994 .
Wall Street Bombing
One of the first acts of terrorism on U.S. soil still remains a mystery .
The flood of Wall Street lunch - goers did n't notice a nondescript man on a horse - drawn cart outside the U.S. Assay Office on Sept. 16 , 1920 .
After the man quickly disappeared into the crowd , the cart exploded , killing more than 30 people and injuring near 300 as metal fragments rained from the sky .
Speculations of conspiracy and terrorism abounded , but crews cleaned the damage overnight ( not realizing they were destroying crucial evidence ) , leaving almost no clues behind .
The best tip came prior to the explosion .
A letter carrier found four crudely spelled and printed flyers in the area from a group demanding the release of political prisoners .
The group , called the " American Anarchist Fighters , " resembled the Italian Anarchists that used similar flyers in two prior bombing campaigns .
The FBI originally suspected followers of Italian Anarchist Luigi Galleani , but the case could n't be proved and promising trails became dead ends .
The case remains unsolved .
Hollow Nickel , Hidden Agent
A Brooklyn newspaper boy dropped a nickel in 1953 and the coin split in half , revealing a miniature photograph with a series of numbers too small to see .
As he picked it up , he was unaware that he held the nation 's security in his hands .
Deemed evidence of counterintelligence , the nickel made its way to the FBI .
The bureau began questioning people who handled the nickel and novelty store owners who might sell similar products , but they got no leads .
FBI Lab scientists in Washington , however , realized the coin 's type - print came from a foreign typewriter , and that the photograph was a coded message , but they could n't crack it .
Four years later , when Russian spy Reino Hayhanen defected to the U.S. , he led agents to a " dead drop hiding place " where the FBI found a hollowed - out bolt with a typewritten message inside .
He shared similar hollowed - out items , including a coin , and the connection was made .
Hayhanen aided in cracking the code , which put them on the trail of Soviet spy Colonel Rudolf Abel , who Hayhanen believed to be the nickel 's owner .
Abel was convicted and sentenced to jail in 1957 , but he evaded his prison time as he was exchanged for an American pilot , Francis Gary Powers , who was shot down over the USSR .
Mississippi Burning
The so - called " Freedom Summer " marked a massive three - month initiative to register southern African - Americans to vote as a counterattack to the Ku Klux Klan 's campaign of fear and intimidation .
In June 1964 , the Klan in Mississippi responded , targeting New Yorker Michael Schwerner , a key figure in organizing local boycotts of biased businesses and voter registration .
On June 16 , acting on a faulty tip , the Klan searched a local church meeting for him .
When the discovered he was n't there they burned the church and beat the churchgoers .
Schwerner arrived on June 20 to investigate the fire .
He and two fellow activists were arrested by Deputy Sheriff Cecil Price shortly after leaving the church , allegedly for speeding .
KKK members followed Schwerner 's car after their release , and the three were never heard from again .
On June 23 , the FBI discovered the remains of Schwerner 's blue station wagon and commenced a search for the bodies .
More than 15 suspects , including Price , were indicted and arrested .
Years of court battles led to only seven guilty convictions of the 18 defendants , but none for murder charges .
In 2005 , the 41st anniversary of the murders , Edgar Ray Killen , one of the conspirators , was convicted of manslaughter .
UNCACS : How To End A Story [ Jun. 20th , 2008 | 12:01 pm ]
Nick Mamatas vylar_kaftan critique service ( slots still available — I 'll critique your novel with copious marginal notes and an editorial letter for two smackers a page ! ) but sent me ten bucks to write this post on ending a story .
Warning : Eddie Campbell in How To Be An Artist , his wonderful autobiographical comic , explains that the advice within should be taken as how to be an artist successfully , not how to be a successful artist .
All advice here is the same .
This is how to write a good ending , not how to write an ending that will make the story saleable .
There actually is a difference , which I will discuss at the end of this .
And now , another anecdote — this past weekend I was at Mo*Con , and at Mo*Con was a Celtic rock band called Mother Grove who played an extended set .
I 'm not much for diddly - diddly music , but it was good and fun and their fiddler player was cute so I stuck around .
For most of it .
Mother Grove , like many artists who are given free rein , ruined themselves by playing too long .
I went to bed before they covered Public Enemy 's " Do n't Believe The Hype " , which should have been how they ended the set an hour before .
Then the experience would have been much better , though shorter .
Actually , though is the wrong word — because it would have been shorter .
That 's how you end a story : with a ) a bang and b ) leaving the reader hungry for more .
The bang is easy enough , but what about hunger ?
Too many stories make one of two errors — they cop -out on the implications of the story or exhaust the reader .
Both serve to stop the story rather than end it , both fail to leave the reader hungry for more .
The most obvious cop -out is the well - known " it was all a dream ... " ending , which erases the implications by erasing the plot .
There are others — wiping out the protagonist for ill - considered reasons , having any evidence of the revelations of the story left obscure or hidden , or just unstated are others .
I read two stories in the CW slush , one good , one not .
The good one was quite exciting ; it was one of those times where , as I was reading , I said to myself , " I 'm buying this if he does n't mess up the ending . "
And he messed up the ending .
The story involved a weird discovery of a new world ( in broad strokes , to hide what story this is ) and Person A telling Person B all about it , and then saying , " Well , see ya ! " and then diving in to that new world .
Person B worried that he might be questioned by the police , so dove into the new world too .
The end .
Awful .
The implication of the story is the discovery of the new world — what will it mean , how might it change things , what 's Person B gonna do now !
By eliminating Person B , the implications of the story are eliminated .
The story is not ended but rather STOPPED as there is no pleasure to be gained by contemplating the story or its thematic and mimetic implications anymore , unless you ignore the ending .
Indeed , I 've daydreamed about several alternative endings for this story , just because the first 97 % of it was so interesting .
But , as a reader , I do n't want to do the work of fixing the ending to allow for these post - reading daydreams and musings , I want the story to actively inform them .
This story did n't leave us hungry for more because of a bad dessert which upset our collective stomach .
We 're full and bloated and do n't want to ever eat again .
Bad .
The second story was just the sort of bad story tyros write .
Time traveling guy buttonholes a scientist , says he has something for Mr. Science ( the " Huh ? " No ! " " Impossible ! " guy for this particular dialogue - driven story ) , and that thing is ... a Presidential assassin .
Mr. Science says , " Oh boy , I 've got some questions for you . "
The end .
Awful .
What are the implications of a long - dead man coming to the narrative present ?
Well , the " questions " for one thing .
What to do with him afterwards for another .
What he may think of the modern world is another .
Is he gonna shoot somebody else ?
That 's a good one too !
Nuffin . '
In this the reader is not left hungry for more , because we did n't get to eat in the first place .
That whole story is the first line of a real story .
The end of a story should connect back to the beginning in some way that makes the beginning more interesting and gives the reader something to linger on afterwards .
This is why it 's not a great idea to title your story after its last line , why ending with protagonist suicides and murders is fraught with the peril of tedium , why tying up every single loose end is not a good idea .
A good ending either takes a step back or pushes one step ahead .
Let that last bit of awe or confusion follow the reader , or the final tragedy or triumph echo a bit after the protagonist experiences it .
Leave that ragged edge at the end , that line — " Gazing up into the darkness I saw myself as a creature driven and derided by vanity ; and my eyes burned with anguish and anger . "
This brings us to readerly exhaustion .
What if our young hero in the line above explained how he went home and cried all night and his mother asked , boredly , " What 's wrong , dear " and he could n't bring himself to say what was bothering him because he was just a kid so instead he said that someone made a mean face at him while he was at the Araby and then , later , while on the commode he wondered why he had said such a thing and so he decided to write a diary entry about it , which is what you are reading right now ?
Awful .
Do n't pave over the implications of the story by repeating the ending — that great moment of revelation above — three or four times .
We 'll get it .
We 're not dumb .
Do n't streeeeetch out the story 's ending to make sure some neat sentence was included , or to hammer home exactly what the reader should experience .
Step back .
Leave the reader wanting to know more about the character , the circumstance , leave room for that post - reading daydream .
Aside : Oh , and for the love of God , if you 're writing a first - person story , think about how that character might actually sit down and tell the story .
If you were attacked by a dragon at the grocery store and called your friend right afterwards , would you say " Guess what , I was just attacked by a dragon .
What happened was ... " or " Guess what , I just went to the grocery store !
And I bought eggs , and pork chops , and I stepped in some gum in the parking lot and I thought back to the time I went to Maine for the long weekend and rolled up my pants to wade in the surf and then a dragon attacked me .
Oh well , talk to you later " ?
In these stories , the major implication is that the story itself is a told thing , and the ending must reflect the reason for its telling , just as the beginning must reflect the reason for the listener to pay attention .
But but but , what about tying everything up in a neat little bow and leaving nothing unsaid or undone ?
No .
That 's common enough bad advice , but it is not advice that serves the story .
Rather it serves the political economy of popular magazines as they existed in the first half of the last century .
Magazine circulations are a function of print run and sales , but only a function of the same .
There is a multiplier effect , the " pass around " of someone leaving the magazine behind on a table , bus , or in an office , and someone else looking at it .
Magazine content is designed to be disposable , so that the artifact can be freed up to be examined by more people , thus exposing the ads — and the magazine itself — to a wider audience .
The magazine as an object is its own best advertisement .
What did this mean for fiction content ?
Essentially , it means that the stories in these popular magazines had to resist rereading or being interesting enough for the buyer to hang on to the issue , or rip out the pages ( and associated ads ) to look at again .
The " well - tied bow " ending is a design feature to make you forget about the story and let the magazine go .
These days , however , the popular magazines no longer carry fiction and content is all going online .
That means that the " pass around " is dead ; modern audiences need to be " pulled " toward content , they cannot have it " pushed " at them .
Thus , a story has to have such an effect on a reader as to make him or her want to share that experience by sending the story to friends , or by broadcasting it via links on a blog , email , twitter , etc .
Only by following through on the implications of the story , and only to the extent that the reader wants more can this happen .
Contemporary editorial advice is still informed by the pulp era , when stories needed to be easily disposable .
However , the economy of the story is changing under the feet of the current generation of editors .
If you want to be good , leave the ragged edge .
You may not sell your stories immediately — not until the current crop of well - entrenched editors die , perhaps — but when they do sell in the new online environment , they will be well - regarded .
So end your stories , do n't just stop them .
Absolute shocker tonight as the special election in MS - 01 , one of the reddest districts on the map , has been won by Democrat Travis Childers .
Russert , Matthews , Olbermann , and even Huckabee all agree : this is very , very bad news for the GOP .
Download Download ( h/t Heather )
Both Darth Cheney ( Russert 's words ) and Mike Huckabee campaigned for Childers ' opponent .
Maybe it's not a good idea to have the least popular guy in America promoting you .
Just a thought .
The Democrats are now 3 - for - 3 in these red district special elections : Along with Childers ' win tonight , Bill Foster took Denny Hastert 's old IL seat , and Dan Cazayoux took the solidly red 6th district in LA .
Another bit of good news comes out of Nebraska tonight , where true Democrat Scott Kleeb beat out fake Democrat Tony Raimondo by a wide margin for the right to take a run at Chuck Hagel 's open seat .
Congrats , Scott .
A WILDLIFE campaigners ' bid to force food manufacturers to list palm oil on product labels has been rejected by federal authorities .
The campaigners blame the expansion of palm oil plantations across Indonesia and Malaysia for rainforest destruction that is pushing orang - utans towards extinction .
They had hoped that manufacturers would be required by law to declare the use of palm oil in their products  including ice cream , biscuits and margarine  but the campaigners ' appeal to Food Standards Australia New Zealand was deemed outside the authority 's jurisdiction .
Mornington Peninsula mother - of - three Amanda Enright was among those who applied to FSANZ to make palm oil use a labelling requirement .
She was motivated by a desire to " give consumers with ethical , environmental , religious or other reasons the ability to make informed choices and avoid certain foods " .
Are You Cool , Man ? ( from Scott )
The interview I was conducting was going great — the candidate answered technical questions well and was honest when he did n't know the answer .
I 'd decided that he would make the short list for an offer and began wrapping up the interview .
" So , do you have any questions about the company , or about the job as a Senior Linux Sysadmin ? " I asked .
I can only assume that since I have tattoo sleeves and happened to be wearing a short - sleeved shirt that day that he felt comfortable asking me a very pertinent question :
" Hey , you seem cool , man .
I 'm a DJ and that 's my first love , and my question is , do they drug test here ? "
I just left the room and had him escorted out .
We Thought You Had Already Graduated ( from Nate T. )
During the last three months of my college career , I had a three week period where I barely attended classes .
It was a bad time to be missing classes , too , since the second round of tests were going on with finals just on the horizon .
Instead of going to class , I was busy interviewing .
First , I had a flight down to Alabama for an interview , then a flight to Iowa for an interview , then a 4 hour drive to Illinois for an interview .
A week or two later I had a flight to Texas for a cousin 's wedding .
I was n't really thrilled with the situation because 1 ) I just wanted the job search to be over and 2 ) I did n't want the extra stress of trying to make up work and get prepped for my last round of finals while in three different states .
With that in mind , I only took interviews where if they offered me a job I 'd definitely accept .
A head hunter had set me up with an interview in Iowa .
It was a small town ( though , come to think of it , are n't all Iowa towns small ? ) so I flew in to Des Moines and drove an hour to the town .
Stayed the night and had my interview the following morning .
I drove out to the plant , met with HR for a few minutes , and she handed me off to a team of three engineers who would be doing the bulk of the interview .
They started with some basic questions about my experience with transistors .
" I do n't have a lot , " I replied , " I 've just taken one electronics course . "
They asked a few more questions and I relayed a bit more about my coursework .
Then it dawned on them — I was still in school .
They 'd looked at my resume and where it had said " University of Missouri — Rolla 1996 - 2000 , " they only saw that I had graduated in 1996 .
They could n't understand how someone with 4 years of experience could n't answer the question .
The interview was over almost immediately , and it was only 9:30 in the morning .
My flight back did n't leave till something like 4 pm .
So they gave me an hour - long tour of the factory that I 'd never work at , a 20 minute tour of the town I 'd never work in , and then treated me to lunch for the next two hours .
On the drive back to Des Moines and the flight back to Missouri , I meditated on what a waste of time and money the interview had been .
Not to be Confused with the Abstract F*cktory Pattern ( from S. L. )
Recently I ( a Java architect ) and one of our IT managers were interviewing a guy for a Java developer position .
He was pretty bright , but unfortunately English was his second ( or perhaps even third ) language .
It was the usual interview story , asking the guy to tell us about the system that he 's currently working on .
He went on to describe in some detail their Hibernate persistence layer , how they used Spring , and how their business layer worked .
I was very impressed with his knowledge .
Then he said " and this is where we used the f*ckhead pattern . "
...silence ...
Regaining my composure , I asked what was on everyone 's mind .
" The what ? "
" The f*ckhead pattern " was the response , enunciated perfectly .
... prolonged silence ...
After taking a few moments to think of how to phrase the question , I finally asked " ... would you mind spelling that for us ? "
" F - A - C - A - D - E. F*ckhead . " he replied .
I had to bite my tongue not to laugh .
You could n't make up stuff like this .
Despite the hillarity of the situation , he was actually very sharp technically , so we ended up offering him the job .

Things got emotional during Sen. Barack Obama ’s visit to a Michigan community college Tuesday .
Obama met individually with student Marilyn Pace , who is studying dental hygiene , and her financial aid counselor , Marcus McGrew , before speaking with a group of students at Wayne Community College in Taylor , Michigan .
Pace broke down in front of Obama and began crying after explaining the financial stresses she is facing while trying to get her education , help take care of her disabled father , and cope with the costs of commuting to school with the high price of gasoline .
Now this is what I call genuine compassion .
In this video , Obama comforts a student , for real , not just for the cameras .
The touching part starts at about 5:15 .
Hey , he may not be a Compassionate Conservative like George Katrina Bush , but then again , who is ?
The answer : Thankfully , nobody .

Wow , this is fun for you design and identity nerds -- 120 scanned pages from a book of logos that appears to be from the mid-70s or so ( nb : the logos for the U.S. bicentennial and Montreal olympics are included ) .
I 'm immediately struck that you could present this many logos in literal black and white ; it 's amazing how many logos today fall apart if you remove the colors or ( God forbid ) the gradients .

Nanotechnology , for all its recent growth and vibrant promise , still feels very sci - fi to us laypersons , what with all those buckytubes and nanoceramics .
Lars Berglund of Sweden 's Royal Institute of Technology , though , is bringing the nanotech treatment to thoroughly familiar , if not boring , material : paper .
By processing wood pulp with enzymes and high - pressure microfluidic chambers , he 's been able to create paper with dramatically finer strands , offering some impressive improvements in mechanical characteristics .
According to the article in MIT Technology Review , this " nanopaper " is " stronger than cast iron and tougher than bone , " featuring a tear strength seven times that of conventional paper , and the ability to stretch by 10 % before failure .
Applications suggested include extra - tough filters , membranes , packaging , and mechanical parts -- making that paper - core messenger bike in Gibson 's Virtual Light one step closer to feasible .

Written on 4/15/2008 by Alex Shalman , creator of the Practical Personal Development blog .
Rising early , the habit of champions , is not statistically proven to increase productivity , happiness , or success .
So why are so many people tooting their own horn about getting up before the rooster squawks ?
It really comes down to the fact that certain early risers take full advantage of their early morning hours , and they ’re very productive in telling us about it .
This minority leaves out an important demographic of people , the ones that stay up late and sleep in , but make huge strides in productivity and innovation .
The benefits your body receives from waking early and enjoying more sunlight are marginal .
Most people wo n’t use this time to be outside , rather they ’ll spend it inside of a fluorescently illuminated cubicle .
In theory , your productivity level should n’t differ if you rise at 4 am or 11 am .
What matters is the quality of sleep that ’s giving your mind and body sufficient time to recover .
So let ’s consider some reasons why burning the midnight oil may be more productive than waking up before sunrise .
Insomnia .
The night owl will not go to sleep until they have hit a landmark in their productivity .
They ’ll work into the wee hours of the morning , and later if they have to .
If going to sleep late is consistent for you , but you do it at the same hour each night , then you still benefit from the synchronization of your circadian rhythm .
Calmness .
The night air is still and tranquil .
No chirping , singing , or buzzing from the animals around you .
When I say animals , I also mean humans .
They ’ve already gone to bed , leaving you with the peace to get done what you want to get done .
It ’s difficult , if not impossible , to get things done in the face of loud noise , honking horns , and other sounds of the day .
The stillness of the night creates a clearing for ideas , innovation , and creativity .
Isolation .
The calmness that I just mentioned is partly because no one is up .
You create an atmosphere where you are separated from the schedules of other people , and thus isolated from their need for your attention .
In essence you are operating on a distraction free basis .
You already know that it takes several minutes to get back into a state of flow after being distracted , so clearly when productivity is our ideal , distractions are our enemy .
An Agenda .
Surprise , people get tired .
If a person is going to stay up late to work , when they could have gone to sleep , they are clearly working on something of significant importance to them .
Working on important things and being passionate about our work fuels us to an unbelievable extent .
This purpose , or worthwhile cause , is the emotional rocket fuel that guides us in maximizing our minds to achieve our goals .
Consistency .
Night owls gain appreciation for the leaps they make in their productivity during the night .
In this way they anchor their positive feelings of accomplishment with working at night .
Feeling accomplished is one of the greatest feelings , in fact is could feel better than any drug .
This is why the night owl will consistently return to the productive underworld of the night , for productivity sake .
Minimal Multitasking .
By now I ’m sure you ’ve heard that multitasking is not as productive as putting focused effort on one thing at a time .
That ’s because being present allows us to get things done more quickly and in a higher quality fashion .
The night affords us with less outside pressure to multi-task .
We ’ll able able to concentrate on that one super important task at hand .
What do you think , could you be productive this way ?
Are you already ?

ONE thing Canada is not short of is lakes .
It has so many that it can afford to set some aside to experiment on .
And that is what Karen Kidd , an ecotoxicologist at the University of New Brunswick , has just done to a small lake in north - west Ontario .
She has poisoned it in the name of science .
Her chosen poison was oestrogen , one of the hormones that make women women and help to control the menstrual cycle .
People flush a lot of oestrogen down the toilet .
Some is natural .
Some is the synthetic stuff used in oral contraceptives .
There is a strong suspicion that if this oestrogen is not removed during sewage treatment ( some works do , some do not ) , it causes serious damage to rivers and lakes .
Until now , however , proof has been lacking .
Dr Kidd wanted to find out if the suspicion was correct .
As she told a session of the American Association for the Advancement of Science meeting in Boston , it is .
The lake 's algae , bacteria and invertebrates appeared unfazed by the extra hormone which she dumped in the lake at regular intervals .
Presumably , its chemistry was not similar enough to their own biochemicals for them to notice .
But the population plunged in the smallest fish species , the fathead minnow .
Male minnows became feminised : their sperm production was delayed and they started producing eggs .
After two years of treatment , the fathead minnow population collapsed .
Other changes took longer .
Pearl dace mature more slowly than minnows and can outlive them by several years .
The dace therefore managed to hold out for three years before the lack of male potency brought about a population crash .
There was damage even to the lake 's largest fish , its trout .
Here the cause was less that boys were turning into girls than that the trout were on short rations — since the minnows had disappeared .
But the upshot was the same : fewer trout , and confirmation that oestrogens are very bad news for fish , even at low concentrations .
The better news was that things quickly returned to normal once the hormone treatment stopped .
Fixing sewage works to prevent them from spewing out oestrogen should therefore help fairly rapidly .
Controlling the sale of contraceptive pills will not be necessary , and fishermen will once again be able to use their rods and tackle with impunity .

A stimulant in many ways
Coffee can do more than just wake you up - it appears that men might also be giving their sperm a kickstart by drinking just a few cups a day .
This , research by a team from Sao Paulo University suggests , increases sperm motility , which could potentially improve the chances of pregnancy .
But caffeine appears to be the only drug that is good for sperm .
Tobacco has no effect on sperm quality but can lead to erectile dysfunction , the same research has found .
Smoking marijuana , though , appears to be bad for sperm and can reduce fertility .
Scientists at Buffalo University found regular smokers had significantly less seminal fluid , and a lower sperm count .
Instead of making sperm slow down and relax , marijuana makes them peak too early : they swim too fast and too soon - they literally burn out before they reach the egg .
The dolphins that died after beaching in Cornwall had ingested debris and mud , leading one of the scientists who examined them to compare their deaths to " mass suicide " .
Vic Simpson , a pathologist who examined some of the 26 dead mammals , said today : " On the face of it , it looks like some sort of mass suicide - but the question is why ?
The dolphins had swallowed and inhaled big chunks of mud from the estuary .
Their lungs and stomachs were full of it .
That is very bizarre indeed . "
Simpson , who founded the Wildlife Veterinary Investigation Centre in Truro and is examining the dolphins on behalf of the Zoological Society in London , said : " We have seen strandings on beaches , sometimes with five to seven dolphins - but never on a scale like this . "
The bodies were found at four sites on the River Percuil in south Cornwall on Monday .
Rescuers guided some surviving mammals back out to sea .
There are several theories , including that the dolphins may have been upset by some sort of underwater disturbance .
The Royal Navy was doing live firing exercises involving a submarine in the area at the time , and the Ministry of Defence said one of its vessels had been using short - range sonar to scan the sea bed .
But a spokesman for the service said the trials were 12 miles off Falmouth .
" It is considered extremely unlikely that this operation could have affected the mammals in any way .
We take our environmental responsibilities very seriously and always carry out an environmental impact assessment before putting energy in the water . "
Another theory is that the dolphins were frightened by a killer whale .
Simpson suggested that they may have had an infection .
It is not thought they became trapped after chasing fish into shallow water because the stomachs of those that have been examined were not full of fish .
Postmortem tests will not be completed for several weeks .
In Iran last year , 152 dolphins washed up on the coast , and the idea of suicide was raised , but this was dismissed as an attempt to project human motives on to a wild animal .
The Department of Interior Inspector General ( IG ) Earl Devaney has just released a report on the Royalty - In - Kind Program ( RIK ) , an obscure multi-billion - dollar oil and natural gas trading program at the Department that has been the focus of controversy .
According to the report , " RIK staff had inappropriate relationships with industry that could compromise their objectivity , " and the Department 's Office of the Solicitor found that some Program 's contracts " provided significant risk to the United States and are inconsistent with accepted contract law generally . "
The report provides further confirmation that the Minerals Management Service , which runs the program , has been too cozy with the oil industry and has failed to protect the public interest .
In addition , it reports that the RIK Program made modifications to bid contracts " that appeared to inappropriately benefit oil companies . "
Today 's report also describes how the oil and gas contracts being done through the RIK Program are no longer subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulations , and how contracts are no longer being run through the MMS Procurement Office , as a result of a decision issued by the Department 's Office of the Solicitor in November 2007 .
According to the report , this removed " the independent oversight that the Procurement Office previously provided . "
In 2006 , the IG , Department of Justice , and FBI reportedly mounted criminal investigations into the RIK Program over concerns that " senior government officials had been steering huge oil - trading contracts to favored companies . "
Four of those employees were re-assigned or have since left the MMS , notably the program 's head Greg Smith .
Smith appears to have been given a highly desirable early retirement package , prompting House Committee on Natural Resources Chairman Nick Rahall to cry foul , saying : " this Administration uses retirement like some perverse witness protection program . "
According to an unconfirmed source , the Department of Justice failed to indict any of the RIK officials in the first Grand Jury which met last year .
So , it remains to be seen if the criminal inquiries will lead anywhere .
The expanded RIK Program today is very much the creature promoted by the largest oil and gas companies drilling on federal land .
Their lobbying campaign to expand the program coincided with the industry 's major loss in 2000 when new royalty collection regulations would have forced them to pay full market value on federal oil .
The GAO documented industry 's stance at the time :
Although states that receive distributions of these royalties generally support the proposed regulations , oil industry representatives generally oppose them , believing that oil companies should not pay royalties on higher prices and that they would suffer increased administrative requirements .
As an alternative , the oil industry has suggested that MMS instead be required to accept , as the federal government 's royalties , a percentage of the actual oil and gas produced from federal leases ( known as royalties in kind ) .
But the RIK Program was troubled from the very beginning , facing stinging criticism from the GAO and a series of failed pilot programs with millions of dollars in losses to the government .
Since 2001 , an increasing share of domestic U.S. oil and natural gas production is being traded under the RIK Program .
The RIK Program accepts compensation from oil and gas companies drilling on federal properties in the form of oil or natural gas products which it then sells .
According to the GAO , 42 % of the $ 9.74 billion in royalty payments made in FY 2006 were done in kind rather than in value ( accepting payment in cash ) .
Central to these talking points is the flawed theory that the government no longer needs to conduct independent audits which reference third party documentation and follow Government Auditing Standards to oversee the program .
While it could be credibly argued that less auditing of oil and gas companies is needed , MMS has taken the position that almost none is needed at all , and that the taxpayers ' interests will be best protected through the use of superficial " compliance reviews " which simply check information provided by oil and gas companies -- in other words , a Boy Scout 's honor system .
According to Bobby Maxwell , a senior former auditor who testified before Congress last year , MMS has also sought to shield its own internal RIK functions from audits , ensuring that no news is good news .
Under the rubric that fewer audits are needed , MMS has shifted resources to reflect its priorities .
According to its 2009 Budget Justifications , since 2001 , MMS has overall downsized its full time employees conducting onshore and offshore auditing and compliance activities by 60 , while at the same time moving 35 positions over to operate the RIK program .

To those those who have expressed their doubts about the authenticity of the poker botting series or the motivation behind it : I appreciate and applaud the skepticism .
95 % of online poker - related material is dubious , spammy , get - rich - quick , Vegas pipe dream BS designed to get you to sign up for online poker or otherwise invest your hard - earned money in something which may or may not be appropriate for you .
And some of you have interpreted this series as another attempt in that vein , which is understandable .
What bothers me is the accusation , however infrequent , that I 'm hoodwinking people for personal gain .
And yet , tellingly , you wo n't find online poker signup links , invitations to purchase botting tools , or any other such garbage , anywhere on Coding the Wheel .
You wo n't find obnoxious , in - your - face , above - the - fold advertising .
What you will find is a lonely sidebar ad , installed months ago and forgotten .
I 'm not even sure how I make money on it .
PPC ?
CPM ?
Both ?
All I know is I 've earned approximately enough money in ad revenue to buy myself a cheeseburger with fries and a Coke .
And it 's like , as much as I appreciate the burger , a few pennies of dubious PPC revenue is not what I 'm after .
Coding the Wheel is a programming and technology blog , not some fly - by - night affiliate scam site .
Employers see the blog .
Clients see it .
Friends and family see it .
People in the community whose opinion I very much respect see it .
I do n't need the few hundred extra dollars per month that " selling out " would afford and if I were really interested in PPC or affiliate revenue , there would be a dozen better ways to do it .
So what 's my motivation ?
One thing : community , and the unlooked - for benefits , the random knowledge , the occasional email offer to work on a side project , the ability to reach and converse with some of the best - informed people in the world on this topic .
That may sound hokey to you , but to me it 's worth far more , both in dollar value , and in other valuations , than any make - money - by - talking - about - botting scheme could ever be .
So while I do n't expect you to trust me completely just yet , three posts deep into a huge subject , I do at least ask that you give me credit for having a healthy amount of self - interest .
Enough to know , for example , that real success is not to be had by posting a thin smear of content and somehow tricking people into clicking on my non-existent poker signup links .
So where 's the code ?
Since the first article broke , I 've had programmers asking for code ; non-programmers asking for poker ; poker - players asking for bot strategy ; and normal people asking for history .
I 've gotten more hate mail than I can shake a stick at , and even the occasional death threat , on account of these posts .
Online poker employees , posting negative comments , often not even bothering to disguise their originating IP .
Fellow bot - builders , some of them established , cursing me for " letting the cat out of the bag " even though all this information is freely available with a little creative searching .
And programmers , many of whom seem to have only the vaguest familiarity with poker , casually dismissing the whole thing as unrealistic ( despite the fact that numerous , proven bots exist on the open market ) .
That 's fine .
Programmers and poker players are tough customers .
The programmers want the choicest nuggets of source code ; the poker players want the exact logic of the bot along with win rates , variance , etc .
And everybody , particularly the non-programmer , non-poker player , wants an interesting read .
And they want it today , not next week .
Meanwhile , there are a lot of people who have no idea what it means to play " short - stacked " or to be " tight / aggressive " .
There are a lot of people who are n't familiar with DLL injection , or any of the other techniques we 've discussed .
And there are a lot of people who know all these things very well , and are ready to pounce on the first inaccuracy or simplification .
I 'm not going to just post the bot source code along with seven winning formulae for beating online poker .
In fact , were I to do so , you could safely assume I was full of crap .
Instead I 'm going to hit you with a large number of posts , ranging from historical fluff to working , in - the - trenches A.I. , to the ins and outs of binary code patching on Windows , and everything in between .
I 'm going to tell you everything I know , which is a fair amount , and I 'm going to introduce everything I 've learnt from the community , which is even more .
And I will quite simply never give you a piece of poker , programming , or poker - programming advice which I do n't 100 % believe ; never try to get you a book which I have n't read so many times the binding splits ; never tell you to sign up for online poker in order to make money off you .
The code is coming , an avalanche of it .
But it 's impossible to address everything at once .
We 're three posts deep into a complex topic covering two or more non-trivial domains - poker , programming , some math as well - and I can only hone in on specific subjects after we 've laid some groundwork and established a basic interest level .
I hope the posts so far have had a decent signal - to - noise ratio , given the complexity of the topic .
I can at least say this : in writing these posts I 've tried to create the sort of content that would 've been helpful to me during the difficult , tedious , and yet ultimately rewarding handful of years I spent building the bot .
As to those of you who claim that building a bot is a superhuman feat of engineering .
Ask yourself what you could have done , given ( as I was ) two , three , or four years of full - time , properly funded development effort .
And let 's assume you 'd been playing poker for years , and botting in chess and MUDs prior to that .
I think you 'll find that with even a basic amount of programming knowledge , you could accomplish a lot .
In fact :
Bots are a permanent reality in online poker and every other online arena where mouse clicks translate to money , including World of Warcraft .
All this sound and fury over botting is just a prelude to the time when any ten - year old will be able to tell his computer , " Fritz , play a theoretically perfect game of poker for me and proofread my book report while I go watch Spongebob Squarepants . "
Believe it .
Count on it .
Trust it .
Take it to the bank and deposit it for a rainy day .
This is where the world is going and rather than tip - toeing around the subject , we need to take a long , hard look at it .
Because it wo n't be long now before poker succumbs to machine intelligence as chess , checkers , backgammon already have .
And after that , domain after domain of human knowledge , falling like dominoes as artificial intelligence starts to come into its own .
I 'm reminded of some famous words by a famous poet :
The darkness drops again ; but now I know
That twenty centuries of stony sleep
were vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle ,
And what rough beast , its hour come round at last ,
Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born ?
Yeats , living in the early part of the last century , probably was n't talking about the rise of the poker bots .
But the words will do for us cavemen , living in the Dark Ages before the wakening ( and wakening is the word ) of the first general artificial intelligence .
Better minds than mine will bring this to you on a silver platter , for better or worse , and use it to build the only real Killer App that ever mattered : MakeMyLifeEasier.exe .
Until then , we can have some fun , learn a lot about programming and poker , and possibly make some money , by studying the construction of an online poker bot .

A Glaring Omission of the Facts
Russert's Doctor Failed Him
The Cardiovascular Drug Quagmire
The Long Plane Flight
The shocking death of Tim Russert last Friday has left an entire nation wondering what happened .
He was a model patient , doing everything his doctors asked .
All major media have run articles trying to explain the nuances and difficulties in treating coronary artery disease .
These articles find little fault in Russert 's care , trying to create the idea that his heart attack was just too hard to predict and that all that could have been done for him was done .
I beg to differ .
His death represents the failure of standard medical care to produce a positive result – an occurrence that is all too common in today 's world .
Talk show hosts lament the death of Russert as the death of an icon and one of the last men of news not suffering from flagrant political bias .
His piercing , accurate , and fair questions often got to the source of many issues and exposed the truth for what it was .
Now that he is gone who is left to ask the questions – even about his death ?
Russert 's doctor , Michael Newman , has not disclosed his medication list or any specific changes in medication doses in the past year .
Why ?
What is he trying to hide ?
Russert 's death is a matter of tremendous public interest , partly because the man was admired by so many and partly because there are millions of men out there wondering if they are the next Tim Russert .
There is no excuse for anything but full disclosure of his health issues so that a proper public dialogue can take place that may help many others .
The most glaring omitted information from Russert 's doctor is telling us what diabetes medication he was taking .
I am willing to bet that he was taking Avandia , the drug the FDA should have pulled off the market because it causes a whopping 43 % increased risk of a sudden heart attack , information the FDA actively sought to sequester during that drug 's approval process .
Why do I think that ?
Because in the scant health data his doctor is giving out he has stated that Russert had high triglycerides and low HDL cholesterol – the exact metabolic profile that Avandia is supposed to treat .
When a treatment has death as a common side effect it can hardly be considered a treatment .
Could it be that Russert is a casualty of one of the great Big Pharma / FDA scams currently going on ?
How ironic , since all news programs are sponsored by this industry 's ads and the media fought tooth and claw in the past year to ensure that dangerous drug ads could continue to run non-stop during all news programs – exposing millions of Americans to drug - induced injury ( while they got their billions in ad revenues ) .
I am stunned that no reporter interviewing his doctor seems to be able to ask such an obvious question .
Russert was significantly obese and had been for many years .
Any doctor that could n't guess his coronary arteries were full of plaque is not very bright .
Once a man 's waistline passes 40 inches you can rest assured plaque is forming in his arteries – you do n't need a test .
The longer you are in this condition the worse the plaque buildup is going to be .
This is not rocket science .
His autopsy showed a number of significantly clogged arteries which seemed to surprise his doctor and other “ experts . ”
Apparently they forgot to take Plaque 101 in medical school .
By the time Russert 's weight problem had progressed to the point of diabetes a major intervention should have been done .
He should have been read the riot act .
He should have been told that his higher blood sugar would now be caramelizing ( cementing ) his arteries and vital organs , like spilling sugary syrup on the counter and letting it turn hard – and that sooner or later something would certainly break .
He should have been told that his excessive abdominal fat clearly predicts that his liver and kidneys look more like a piece of bacon than lean beef .
He should have been told that his low HDL cholesterol was due to free radical damage , meaning his lipids were being oxidized in his blood from some form of toxin or stress ( such as oxidized adrenaline ) .
He should have been told that this same problem will “ cook ” the fat that is marbleizing his liver and eventually make it look like a piece of overcooked meat .
He should have been told that his fat stomach was now his worst enemy , cranking out more inflammatory signals on a daily basis than any other stress he was under .
He should have been told that the outsides of his arteries were also getting fat , and this excess fat was recruiting macrophages to the outer lining of his arteries that were in turn forming abnormal inflammatory gangs along his arteries that were going to drastically alter the function of his arteries .
His doctor should have scared the hell out of him because behavior changes in men seldom take place unless there is adequate pain .
And then he should have given him the facts of the simple solution “ Tim , all you have to do is get in a healthy pattern where you lose 20 % of your weight , at which point your risk factor for a heart attack drops to close to zero .
Then , if you keep losing 1 - 2 pounds a month you will maintain this very low risk pattern while you are getting back in shape .
In fact , by losing the weight you can go a long way towards reversing all of these problems .
” He should have been told that his real risk for a heart attack was based on his overall inflammation burden ( wear and tear ) , and that if he managed this trend well he would have much less risk of any problem .
He needed to start by managing his weight , because that was a major source of inflammation .
He needed to make sure he got enough sleep at night to recover from wear and tear .
And he really needed to watch his work load as pushing himself into the ground was no longer a safe option .
Of course I do not know what conversations took place between Russert and his doctor , but considering that his doctor is also overweight it probably was n't anything like the above and it certainly was n't effective .
What Russert 's doctor did was what virtually all doctors do in this country ; they pull out the Big Pharma tool box and begin aggressively treating numbers on paper instead of the patient in front of them .
Sure we can say that Russert 's problems were self inflicted .
But why then do we need doctors ?
Do n't doctors have an obligation to do everything in their power to help a person get well ?
Or are doctors nothing more than part of the Big Pharma drug cartel ?
Drugs buy you time if you are lucky .
The problem with cardiovascular drugs that make numbers look better on paper is that they make your health worse the longer you use them – and your Big Pharma - trained doctors expect you to use them forever .
It was quite clear back in February of this year , when the ACCORD trial turned in dismal results , that the greater the number of cardiovascular drugs given to a diabetic to manage his condition the more likely he was to die .
Russert 's doctor said he was taking a statin even though his cholesterol was n't high .
Yes , this is now standard medical care .
Anyone at risk gets their cholesterol system placed in a statin straightjacket .
This is one of the dumbest things you would ever want to do , since cholesterol synthesis is the foundation of survival in your body .
The American Heart Association actively promotes this fraud at considerable profit for its bedfellows with consequent death for many Americans .
Tim Russert is a great example proving that statins are useless – and likely dangerous .
Statins are now proven to activate a gene called atrogin - 1 , a gene that is abnormal to activate and directly damages muscle .
This reduces the effectiveness of muscles to perform exercise , reducing Russert 's chance of losing weight .
The heart is also a muscle , meaning that statins can induce direct heart damage via atrogin - 1 activation .
Statins also reduce the production of coenzyme Q10 , leading to cardiac malfunction .
Russert 's autopsy showed his heart was enlarged , meaning it was structurally abnormal and headed in the direction of failure .
This finding surprised his doctor , apparently meaning that this change in his heart was recent .
Was this simply a progression of his condition or was this caused by statins ?
Nobody really knows , but rest assured his doctor and the general statin - prescribing community will blame his underlying health when in fact the accelerated deterioration of the heart often happens after starting statin therapy or when statin doses are raised .
This is why the public needs to know what kind of statin Russert was on , what was the dose , and had it been raised in the past year .
The simple fact of the case is that Russert 's heart was not working well prior to the arterial clot that caused his fatal heart attack – and this means that he had less of a chance of surviving the heart attack .
There is a high likelihood this handicap in heart function was the result of the statin he was taking .
There is also the plain observation that Russert did not have high cholesterol in the first place , yet his autopsy showed that he had a number of coronary arteries full of plaque .
What does that say for the cholesterol theory of heart disease ?
It means that cholesterol numbers on paper are a near useless marker of actual health .
It means that taking statins did n't make any difference to Russert at all , except in a likely adverse way .
And it means that nothing effective was actually done to help him .
In other words , the theory of statins and trying to lower cholesterol to abnormally low levels to prevent a heart attack , as clearly exposed by the massive Vytorin drug fraud , is a 20 - billion - dollar a year racket .
It is propped up by groups like the American Heart Association who will do almost anything to maintain their grip on public health , power , and money – regardless of the hundreds of thousands of Americans who die each year while receiving such treatment .
Russert was being treated for coronary artery disease , which involves the use of blood pressure medications such as beta blockers and calcium channel blockers .
These medications put Russert 's heart in a medical wheelchair .
Maybe one day doctors will learn there is a huge difference between having good blood pressure because you are healthy and having good blood pressure numbers because you are taking medication .
Blood pressure medication restricts cardiovascular function , which means by definition that circulatory pressure and thus circulation to small blood vessels and numerous end points of circulation throughout your body is reduced .
This means that nutrients and oxygen do not reach many cells and organs appropriately ; creating acid pH and inflammation as an undesirable side effect .
This causes many people taking these medications to become fatigued and gain weight or not be able to lose weight , a problem that is generally ignored yet directly makes the underlying cardiovascular problem worse .
In Russert ' case his doctor has not disclosed his exact blood pressure medications , other than to say his blood pressure had risen recently .
This likely meant he increased the dose of medication .
Thus , in the months leading up to his death Russert was going all out trying to cover the elections while at the same time he was taking higher amounts of anti-energy blood pressure drugs that increased fatigue and wear and tear .
The straw that broke the camel 's back was most likely the long plane flight Russert took as he and his family returned from a vacation to Italy the day before his death .
The low cabin pressure for an extended period of time , combined with the lack of movement , places significant stress on both the circulatory and lymphatic systems .
This subjected Russert to a low - oxygen pro-inflammatory stress that is known to be associated with increased clotting risk – especially in somebody who is at risk in the first place .
The pro-clotting strain of that flight would persist for the next several days , at least .
Russert had a combination of factors that were not working in his favor .
He had just been through months of grueling wear and tear covering the elections .
Tom Brokaw reported that Russert had pushed himself too exhaustion a number of times .
This means he had created a baseline of wear and tear that was pushing the inflammatory limits , a problem that tends to congest his lymphatic trash removal processes .
At the same time , flying in an airplane is always a challenge to anyone 's lymph system , based on changes in pressure .
If there is already pre-existing lymph stagnation from wear and tear – a long airplane flight can be a real problem .
It is worth noting that blood pressure medication , especially if the dose is too high , is a significant handicap in terms of being able to tolerate the pressure changes and lower oxygen problem of a long plane flight .
This is because the forced reduction in pressure by the medication causes the lymph system to lose “ tone , ” in turn promoting even further lymph stagnation .
These problems were compounded by Russert 's high level of triglycerides , which are fat blobs just sitting in his circulation .
These are like Mack trucks reducing the flow of traffic – significantly compounding the pressure problem of stagnation induced by the flight along with the other wear and tear factors .
Thus , after his plane flight Russert was left in a significant pro-inflammatory and pro-clotting state .
If he would have taken a few days off to rest and recover he may well be alive today .
But no , he dragged his jet - lagged body out of bed , put it on a treadmill for a while ( inducing further wear and tear considering the circumstances ) , and then went off to work .
He was never to return .
The Tim Russert tragedy does have a take home message for men – wake up .

放送業界は、パソコンに外付けするタイプの地上/BS/CSデジタルチューナーの単体発売を解禁する方針を固めた。早ければ、2008年4月上旬に開催する放送業界関係者の会合で正式決定する。ビーエス・コンディショナルアクセスシステムズ（B-CAS社）によるB-CASカードの発行を経て、早ければ4月下旬～5月に、大手パソコン周辺機器メーカーなどから単体外付けチューナーが量産出荷される見通し。
パソコン周辺機器メーカー各社は、PCIボードやUSB接続型など、複数の外付け地デジチューナーの出荷を準備しており、テレビ機能のない既存パソコンで、2万円前後の価格で地デジの視聴や録画、Blu-ray DiscやDVDへの書き出しなどが可能になる。
Friioの出現が 「 最後の一押し 」 に
これまでパソコンで地デジを視聴するには、地デジチューナーを内蔵した、いわゆるテレビパソコン（地デジテレパソ）を購入するか、解像度の低いワンセグチューナーを利用するしかなかった。これは、外付け地デジチューナーによってテレビ番組のコンテンツ保護が解除され、無尽蔵に録画・複製されたり、インターネット上で流通したりといった事態を放送業界が懸念し、外付け地デジチューナーの単体販売を実質的に認めていなかったためである。
状況が変化したキッカケは、地デジのコピー制御信号を無視して、無制限にテレビ番組を複製できる地デジチューナー「 Friio」が2007年11月に発売されたことである。Friioの出現を機に、放送業界、メーカー側ともに、こうしたコピー制御信号を無視する機器の広がりを警戒する動きが強まった。
現時点で はFriioの販売差し止め訴訟なども提起できておらず、今後テレビ番組を無制限にコピーできる機器がさらに出現することも懸念される。「放送業界公認の外付け地デジチューナーを解禁することで、一刻も早くFriioのような機器の影響力を薄めることが不可欠」（放送業界関係者）との見方から、外付け地デジチューナーを早期に解禁する方向で調整が進んだ。
加えて、2011年7月24日のアナログ放送停波まで残り3年となり、地デジ対応機器の普及を加速させるためにはパソコンでの地デジ利用拡大が不可欠との見方で放送業界、メーカー側とも一致。家庭向けパソコンはここ数年ほど販売状況が低調だが、テレビ視聴という新たな用途の訴求により市場が活性化し、高性能なスペックの製品への移行を促進する効果も生まれそうだ。
ガイドライン案に対しメーカーから修正要求が相次いだ場合や、4月上旬の会合で異論が出た場合にはスケジュールが延期になる可能性も残されている。だが、上述のような背景から、外付け地デジチューナーの解禁は時間の問題とみられている。
外付け解禁のガイドライン案、調整大詰め
デジタル放送推進協会 （Dpa）は3月14日にパソコン用地デジチューナーのガイドライン案をまとめ、電子情報技術産業協会（JEITA）やJEITAの加盟各社、パソコン周辺機器メーカーなどに配布している。3月末をメドにガイドライン案に対する各社の意見を集約した上で、4月上旬の放送業界関係者の会合に諮る。

“ THIS paper is the manifestation of a guilty conscience . ”
With those words , Paul Krugman began the recent presentation of his new study of trade and wages at the Brookings Institution .
Mr Krugman , a leading trade economist ( as well as a New York Times columnist ) , had concluded in a 1995 Brookings paper * that trade with poor countries played only a small role in America 's rising wage inequality , explaining perhaps one - tenth of the widening income gap between skilled and unskilled workers during the 1980s .
Together with several studies in the mid-1990s that had similar findings , Mr Krugman 's paper convinced economists that trade was a bit - part player in causing inequality .
Other factors , particularly technological innovation that favoured those with skills , were much more important .
At some level that was a surprise .
In theory , although trade brings gains to the economy as a whole , it can have substantial effects on the distribution of income .
When a country with relatively more high - skilled workers ( such as America ) trades with poorer countries that have relatively more low - skilled workers , America 's low skilled will lose out .
But when the effect appeared modest , economists heaved a sigh of relief and moved on .
In recent years , however , the issue has returned .
Opinion polls suggest that Americans have become increasingly convinced that globalisation harms ordinary workers .
As a commentator , Mr Krugman has become more sceptical .
“ It 's no longer safe to assert that trade 's impact on the income distribution in wealthy countries is fairly minor , ” he wrote on the VoxEU blog last year .
“ There 's a good case that it is big and getting bigger . ”
He offered two reasons why .
First , more of America 's trade is with poor countries , such as China .
Second , the growing fragmentation of production means more tasks have become tradable , increasing the universe of labour - intensive jobs in which Chinese workers compete with Americans .
His new paper set out to substantiate these assertions .
That proved hard .
Certainly , America 's trade patterns have changed .
Poor countries ' share of commerce in manufactured goods has doubled .
In contrast to the 1980s , the average wage of America 's top - ten trading partners has fallen since 1990 .
All of which , you might think , would increase the impact of trade on wage inequality .
But by how much ?
If you simply update the approach used in Mr Krugman 's 1995 paper to take into account today 's trade patterns , you find that the effect on wages has increased .
Josh Bivens , of the Economic Policy Institute , a Washington , DC , think - tank , did just that and found that trade widened wage inequality between skilled and unskilled workers by 6.9 % in 2006 and 4.8 % in 1995 .
But even with that increase , trade is still far from being the main cause of wage inequality .
Lawrence Katz , a Harvard economist who discussed Mr Krugman 's paper at Brookings , estimates that , using Mr Bivens 's approach , trade with poor countries can account for about 15 % of the growth in the wage gap between skilled and unskilled workers since 1979 .
Even this is almost certainly an overstatement .
Many imports from China have moved up - market from easy - to - produce products , such as footwear , to more sophisticated goods , such as computers and electronics .
As a result , to use economists ' jargon , the “ factor content ” of American imports — in effect , the amount of skilled labour they contain — has not shifted downwards .
Mr Katz says factor - based models suggest trade with poor countries explains only 5 % of rising income inequality .
Mr Krugman argues that the effect is bigger , but that import statistics are too coarse to capture it .
Thanks to the fragmentation of production , Chinese workers are doing the low - skill parts of producing computers .
Just because computers from China are classified as skill - intensive in America 's imports does not prevent them from hurting less - skilled American workers .
Mr Krugman may be right but , as he admits , it is hard to prove .
Blame it on the rich
Robert Lawrence , another Harvard economist , has looked at the same evidence and reached rather different conclusions .
In a new book , “ Blue Collar Blues ” , he points out that the contours of American inequality sit ill with the idea that trade with poor countries is to blame .
Once you measure income properly , the gap between white - and blue - collar workers has not risen that much since the late 1990s when China 's global integration accelerated .
The wages of the least skilled have improved relative to those in the middle .
Some types of inequality have increased , notably the share of income going to the very richest .
But there is little sign that wage inequality has behaved as traditional trade theory might suggest .
Mr Lawrence offers two reasons why .
One possibility is that America no longer makes some of the low - skilled , labour - intensive goods that it imports .
In those goods there are no domestic workers to lose out to foreign competition .
Second , even when America does produce something that is imported from China , it may make it in a different way , with more machinery and only a few high - skilled workers .
If imports from China and other poor countries compete with more - skilled American workers , they may displace workers but will not widen wage inequality .
Given the lack of fine - grained statistics , none of these studies settles the debate .
It is possible that globalisation is becoming a bigger cause of American wage inequality .
But contrary to the tone of the political debate , and the thrust of Mr Krugman 's commentary , the evidence is inconclusive .
“ How can we quantify the actual effect of rising trade on wages ? ” Mr Krugman asked at the end of his paper .
“ The answer , given the current state of the data , is that we can't . ”

[ UPDATE 1 : The Consumer First Energy
Act which would impose a ‘ windfall profits tax ’ on big oil companies , and the Renewable Energy and Job Creation Act both failed to move on .
The second of those two contained a one year extension of the Production Tax Credit .
The votes were largely along party lines .
Kate Shepard at Grist provides a good review of the two bills in this report . ]
The PTC has been the single biggest policy driver of renewable energy development in the U.S. , and the short one and two year extensions ( as well as the absence of those extensions ) have produced a ‘ feast - or - famine ‘ cycle of renewable energy growth in the United States , where all new development is virtually frozen in place , awaiting a tax incentive .
As it currently stands , the PTC will expire at the end of 2008 .
According to the American Wind Energy Association ( AWEA ) , studies show that 116,000 jobs and more than $ 19 billion in clean energy investment are at risk from a failure to extend the PTC and other renewable energy tax credits .
Thus far , the biggest hangup for extending the renewable energy tax credits has been the question of funding .
Ironically , the Democrats have become the party of fiscal responsibility in Congress , and do not want to pass the bill without a way to pay for it .
Last week at WINDPOWER 2008 , I had the opportunity to sit down with Greg Wetstone , Senior Director of Government and Public Affairs for AWEA , and Tom Gray , the Deputy Executive Director .
The pair told me that the tax credit issue was really one of fiscal ideology .
And that unfortunately , many in Congress had been using the renewable energy tax credits as a “ political football . ”
Both Gray and Wetstone expressed concern that a lapse in the PTC would have a detrimental effect on the installation of new wind energy projects , especially considering wind developers are currently in the planning stages for projects that would not go online until 2009 or 2010 .
According to Wetstone :
“ This really has to happen by the August recess … If it drags out beyond that and gets done in some kind of lame duck [ action ] – or does n’t get done – I think it ’s a major problem for the industry , and a major embarrassment for the Congress . ”
Considering the popular support for policies that promote renewable energy development , it seems odd that Congress continues to drag their collective feet on passing the PTC .
The results of a recent poll show that a vast majority of Americans , across all political parties , overwhelmingly support development and funding of solar energy .
Ninety - one percent of Republicans , 97 percent of Democrats and 98 percent of Independents agree that developing solar power is vital to the U.S .
The tenuous position of the PTC was a hot topic at last week ’s WINDPOWER 2008 in Houston .
At the event , virtually all of the industry leaders , advocates , and public officials I spoke with strongly voiced support for passage of the tax credits .
And nearly all of them were maintained that we need the stability of a long term renewable energy policy , as opposed to the one and two year extensions the Congress has favored more recently .
If you want to continue to see sustained growth in renewable energy in this country , I suggest you contact your Senator to urge passage of the PTC today !

The call to prayer is a pervasive , comforting echo across the Middle East , but a fatwa by a prominent Islamic cleric urges Muslims to spend less time prostrating and more time working .
Sheikh Yusuf Qaradawi said worshippers often use prayer to slip away from their jobs longer then they should .
“ Praying is a good thing . . . 10 minutes should be enough , ” according to an edict posted on Qaradawi ’s website .
The sheikh ’s opinion is shared by many clerics and highlights the dilemma between economic productivity and religious devotion in a part of the world where piety is prized .
Devout Muslims pray five times a day , two of which fall during working hours .
They kneel in mosques or unfurl prayer mats and recite the Koran in offices , clogging aisles and bringing work to a halt .
The time between ablution - – washing hands and feet -– and a prayer can take 10 minutes , but many Muslim spend as many as 30 minutes on the ritual .
Companies and store owners have been complaining for years about lost labor minutes and inefficiency .
The problem goes well beyond prayer time .
A recent government study found that Egypt ’s 6 million government employees , a massive platoon of bureaucracy , are each estimated to spend only 27 minutes a day working .
If frustrated citizens or customers ask to speed things up , they are met with a sigh , a roll of the eyes and the centuries - old reply : " Inshallah " ( God willing ) .

On a clear night in September , the Wilcox family got ready for the airplane that would soon fly overhead and spray a pesticide to fight an invasive moth discovered on the Monterey Peninsula .
They shut the windows and stayed indoors .
" I did n't think much of it .
We thought it would n't be harmful , " said Air Force Maj .
Timothy Wilcox , who 's enrolled in the U.S. Naval Post Graduate School in Monterey .
The very next day , the Wilcoxes ' 11 - month - old son , Jack , started wheezing .
It got so bad , his eyes rolled back in his head , the boy 's father said .
The baby spent his first birthday in the hospital on oxygen and medication .
" Jack had been the picture of health , a breast - fed baby who never got sick , " Wilcox said .
" We were shocked for this to happen . "
Now the baby takes two physician - ordered drug treatments a day as a precaution against an asthma attack .
The Wilcoxes are one of hundreds of families in Monterey and Santa Cruz counties that reported health problems last year after the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the California Department of Food and Agriculture ordered an aerial spray of pesticides containing synthetic insect pheromones and other ingredients in a campaign to eradicate the light brown apple moth .
Planes doused houses , decks , yards , cars , city streets - and anybody who happened to be outside .
Afterward , some residents complained of shortness of breath , chest tightness , burning in the throat , eye irritation and muscle and headaches , among other symptoms .
In spite of the complaints , U.S. and state agricultural officials say they intend to aerial spray every county in the Bay Area starting in August .
They 'll return to Monterey and Santa Cruz counties in June .
California Secretary of Agriculture A.J. Kawamura and federal agriculture officials assert that the pheromone pesticides are safe .
Without eradication , they say , the nonnative pest spotted for the first time in the United States in California last year could spread to and damage up to 250 different crops in the state .
Rigorous testing promised
This time around , agriculture officials will give state medical experts an opportunity to sign off on a pesticide product before it 's used in aerial spraying , said USDA spokesman Larry Hawkins .
There will be more rigorous animal testing on the product , he said .
" If none passes muster , we wo n't have any products to use , and we would n't be doing any aerial application , " Hawkins said .
Despite assurances , aerial spraying in California faces steep public disapproval .
Santa Cruz County has filed a suit to stop the spraying , and a dozen cities targeted for spraying have passed resolutions against it pending further study .
The Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary , fearing injury to wildlife , has forbidden spraying into its waters .
Marin Organic , a Point Reyes Station association of farms and nurseries , supports a moth spray moratorium .
Five state lawmakers have introduced bills to control aerial spraying .
Critics question the safety of pesticide products and whether a full - scale aerial campaign is necessary or would even be effective .
Sometime this week , the California Environmental Protection Agency , along with other state agencies , is expected to respond in part to the safety concerns of Monterey and Santa Cruz county residents with the release of a follow - up report addressing about 400 health problems conveyed from citizen groups , physicians ' reports and telephone calls to state and local government agencies .
Until now , representatives of the state Department of Food and Agriculture have appeared to downplay any correlation between the residents ' health concerns and the spraying .
But the Wilcoxes and hundreds of other residents think it 's taken too long - seven months in the Wilcoxes ' case - for the state government that conducted the spray program to seriously follow up on reports submitted in good faith .
They want an investigation into whether the planes have left health problems in their wake before the agencies spray again .
" I think it 's unacceptable that state agencies have n't had feet on the street since day one , actively collecting citizen complaints and making it easy for citizens to make those complaints , " said Michael Lynberg , a Silicon Valley communications consultant who got so frustrated that he set up a post office box to accept reports , which he passes on to the state .
Questions about Checkmate
Sprayed was a product called Checkmate , containing a synthetic moth pheromone - an insect attractant that disrupts mating and eventually curtails the population - and 10 other ingredients .
There has n't been a full panoply of long - term animal tests on the Checkmate product , according to state health officials .
Until officials ordered it sprayed over Monterey and Santa Cruz counties , it had never been used over an urban area .
The USDA obtained an emergency exemption from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to use the Checkmate products .
State agriculture officials went along with the plan , and because of the exemption , the products did n't go through the normal vetting process under California law .
After the spraying , state health officials said the amount of pesticide applied in Monterey should n't have posed severe health risks .
But they 've also refused to rule out that the spray could affect human health , particularly people who are vulnerable such as children , the elderly and the chronically ill .
They have also acknowledged that eye , skin or respiratory irritations reported by some residents could have been caused by high applications , not by low ones .
But they said the pesticide levels used in Monterey were extremely low , making it unlikely that anyone was exposed to a high dose .
Ron Tjeerdema , a UC Davis toxicology professor and a member of the state agricultural department 's task force on the aerial spraying , said in an interview that he reviewed the list of ingredients and did n't find anything of particular concern .
Some of the ingredients are found in other products , he said .
But Dr. Megan Schwarzman , a research scientist in UC Berkeley 's School of Public Health , cautioned that just because the chemicals are found in other products " does n't indicate their toxicity or their safety . "
As for the Checkmate used last year , Schwarzman said , " We do n't have information on the potential long - term health effects in people .
That information could well be reassuring .
Without that information , we have too many questions to feel OK about it . "
Agriculture officials are testing other products for the next series of sprays because the Checkmate used previously remained active for only about a month , and officials want a product that will last at least 60 days , the USDA 's Hawkins said .
They do n't want to have to keep returning to spray , he said .
Dr. William Ngai , a public health medical officer at Cal EPA , has said that before the next spraying , manufacturers will be required to reveal not only the main ingredient - already required by law - but also all of the additional ingredients .
Under law , the manufacturers , claiming proprietary rights , do n't have to declare all of the ingredients .
The agency 's spokesman , Sam Delson , said if the state sprays again , a better real - time system would be established for people to report any illnesses .
The system should make it easier for the state to respond to them more quickly and effectively , he said .
Asked about why the state has n't gotten back to the Wilcoxes about Jack 's reaction , Delson said health officials are now investigating it .
More trouble for boy
When Jack began having trouble breathing , the Wilcoxes called their military pediatrician in the Presidio , then rushed him to the Community Hospital of the Monterey Peninsula .
Emergency room doctors put him on oxygen and started a series of respiration therapy treatments with drugs .
He stayed the weekend .
At home , he seemed fine until the end of September .
Then it started again .
He could n't breathe .
They took him back to the community hospital .
From there , he was sent to Lucile Packard Children 's Hospital at Stanford .
" My wife said it was a scene from ' ER . '
Everyone was rushing around .
He stopped breathing .
They gave him a shot .
He started breathing again . "
Back home , the Wilcoxes worried whether there would be permanent damage or whether he would be sensitive to chemicals and other irritants all of his life .
When the state sprayed again in October in Monterey , they took Jack to Travis Air Force Base outside the spray area to wait it out .
They had him tested for allergies at the end of the month , and he came up negative .
Since then , Jack has had to receive twice - daily treatments of Pulmicort , a corticosteroid , as a preventive measure .
" We hope we have n't any permanent damage . "
Wilcox said .
" What are we doing when we weigh crops , economics and money before health ? "
Seven months ago , Wilcox filed a formal complaint with the state 's hot line and received a brief form confirmation note with a case number and assurances that someone would get back to him .
He has heard nothing .
Finally , he wrote Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and also his wife , Maria Shriver .
" Not one person from the state called to inquire or to request records , " Wilcox said .
" It was almost like they wanted me to go away , to ignore the fact that we had a possible bad reaction . "
At a glance Problem :
The light brown apple moth has been found in the Bay Area .
Its larvae could harm more than 200 types of crops .
Eradication : Officials plan to spray a pesticide over Bay Area cities to disturb its mating .
Spraying is expected to start Aug. 1 , and continue in Monterey and Santa Cruz counties starting June 1 .
Unfortunately , the Port Authority of Allegheny County – Pittsburgh ’s government mass - transit bus and rail monopoly -- is a typical example of how far the American mass - transit model has devolved after 40 - plus years of horrid management , easy federal money and the unconditional support of local and national politicians .
To find out if cities elsewhere have found a better way of providing bus and rail service for their people , I recently called our favorite international transit guru and public policy consultant Wendell Cox ( www.demographia.com) at his office in southern Illinois near St. Louis .
Q : What 's the best mass - transit system in the world ?
A : Tokyo .
The system is largely commuter rail .
There are 10 large , private , profitable commuter rail systems .
There are two largely profitable subway systems in the city of Tokyo -- when I say Tokyo , I 'm talking about 35 million people stretched over about 3,000 square miles -- one and half times the size of Los Angeles .
So I 'm not just talking about the city of Tokyo .
But in this whole area , transit is profitable .
Two big subways in Tokyo actually cover all their operating costs as well as almost all of their capital costs .
If you think of the Port Authority , it 's lucky if it is covering 30 percent of its operating costs .
In Tokyo the commuter rail service is private , they earn strong profits , and they pay for their capital costs and their expansion .
Over all the major systems that account for more than 90 percent of the ridership are profitable .
Q : Why ?
A : It ’s not because they came in later and said , “ Oh , we need to build these rail systems . ”
After World War II , obviously Japan was wiped out , as the cities expanded .
Tokyo in 1940 probably had 5 million people ; today we have 35 million .
While we all know that Japan is losing population , the growth of the Japanese urban areas in the 1960s and 1970s was something to behold .
What happened as they grew , these private railroads -- not public railroads ; there was not an ounce of public planning here , by the way -- expanded their systems .
You have a situation now where , believe it or not , 60 to 65 percent of the movement of people in the Tokyo area and the Osaka area is by transit -- a stunning figure .
When you figure that in the Pittsburgh area the number is less than 2 percent .
By the way , it only exceeds 4 percent in the U.S.A. in New York , which is 9 percent .
Another thing helped them as well -- World War II .
A lot of people do n’t realize that Japanese GDP in 1950 , adjusted for inflation , was under $ 3,000 .
It was at Third World rates .
Japan , first of all , was not rich before World War II , which a lot of people do n’t realize ; and secondly , after the war it had been devastated .
In the process Japan has become one of the five richest large countries in the world .
But in this country , by 1930 , there were .75 cars per household -- an impressive number .
Nobody equaled it until Canada in 1955 .
Japan did not reach U.S. 1930 auto ownership rates until 1990 .
So what this means is that while the cities were expanding and growing , transit was growing up and the auto was not available to most people .
All of this goes to say that these are incredible , unbelievable systems in Japan and they can not be replicated .
Nobody came in with a federal program or a program from the Japanese Diet and started imposing rail lines on the existing urban footprint .
Transit was built as the city expanded .
Q : What 's the best transit system in the United States -- or is there one ?
A : Boy ....
Oh , San Diego .
I would not call it the best .
I 'd call it the least worst .
San Diego has done some wonderful things .
They started contracting out transit service in 1979 .
Their costs are much lower than other systems as a result .
More than 40 percent of their system is contracted out now .
They carry a huge increase in ridership compared to what they had in 1980 -- a ridership increase that 's far greater than the population increase .
Everybody likes to talk about the San Diego Trolley , the light rail line .
It is , again , the least worst trolley in the country .
It is less unsuccessful as a result of its first line that went to the Mexican border .
For example , if those Port Authority tunnels under the Allegheny River in Pittsburgh were ending up at the Mexican border , they might make some sense .
But in the early years , this San Diego line covered 90 percent of its operating cost ; it never covered any capital .
As the system has expanded , it ’s been decimated .
There ’s no other destination like the Mexican border .
When you talk about transit in the United States , you have to be talking about best prisoner awards .
These systems are a scourge on taxpayers .
There are some that do some wonderful things , but nobody does it all right .
I keep arguing in my own mind , who is more responsible for the abject failure of transit in the United States ?
And mind you -- transit expenditures have gone up more than 300 percent adjusted for inflation since 1970 and ridership has gone up less than 20 percent .
There is no other sector of the economy , including health care , where I can find escalation even close to that .
Transit holds the record .
It is a damned outrage how bad transit has been .
I continually argue with myself , “ Well , is it because of the unions ? ” -- and I do n’t blame the unions , because if you are a union leader there in Pittsburgh and there is no competition , why should n’t you ask for the moon ?
You should be thrown out if you don’s ask for the moon .
So there 's this monopoly labor negotiating thing , where the unions play a part and where management plays a part , and where to some extent you will find management rooting for the unions because they know whatever the unions get they are going to get … .
Or is it the vendors -- the people who build these darn light rail systems ?
The whole point of transit is to maximize costs .
The management - labor arrangements maximize costs and so do the vendor arrangements with respect to capital expenditures .
All that being said , there is no hope whatsoever for transit .
Q : Why is there no hope ?
A : The first reason is that it is structurally incapable to be designed to do much more than it does today .
Think about this :
The Port Authority , for all of its problems , probably does a reasonably decent job of getting people to Downtown .
As a matter of fact , something like 40 percent of downtown Pittsburgh workers get their on transit -- one of the highest shares in the country .
I was out in Pittsburgh about a year ago … .
Think about what you ’d need to do if you wanted to increase the transit market share for one of the business centers on the way to the airport .
How would you structure transit to replicate the 40 percent downtown share ?
Well , I ’ll tell you how you do it .
You ’d need to have a series of routes that converge on this one point , just like downtown .
I do n’t care if there is one job there or 50,000 jobs there , because otherwise you are talking about service that cannot compete with the automobile .
That is why if you look at the Western world -- and I mean North America , including Canada , Australia and Western Europe -- you will not find any non-central business center that has a substantial market share for transit .
If you live in the suburbs of Paris , for example -- where 80 percent of the people live and work and 70 percent of the jobs are -- you ca n’t possibly get to another part of the suburbs by transit unless you are willing to go all the way downtown to the core and switch .
There are people that do that because they do n’t have any money , but anyone with a car is going to drive .
So the first reason why there is no hope for transit is that it can not be designed to be competitive with the automobile , except for very specific locations -- that really only being a downtown area .
It has to be a good concentrated downtown area , and they do n’t come much better in my view than Pittsburgh .
The other reason why there is no hope for transit is that whatever you give them will be frittered away without any impact whatsoever .
That gets us back to this whole bit of a 300 percent expenditure increase at the same time you ’ve had a 20 percent ridership increase .
If any one of these bozos wants to think about putting taxes on greenhouse gases and giving the money to transit -- hey , what a loser .
You will get nothing .
Q : A while ago I came across some figures for the Port Authority from the early 1980s .
Ridership then was about 100 million a year ; it had about 2,800 employees , almost 1,000 buses and about 90 trolleys .
In 2006 it had about 3,000 employees , about 1,000 buses and 80 light - rail cars .
Its budget had gone up 42 percent faster than inflation since 1982 -- but they were carrying 70 million people instead of 100 million .
They had lost 30 percent of their business yet everything stayed the same -- and no one even notices this .
A : I know .
You are absolutely right -- and you can find that just about everywhere .
There are some exceptions .
But the point you 're making with respect to the Port Authority makes my point exactly :
For most transit agencies in the United States , if they were to write a mission statement that is reflective of what they do , they would indicate that they exist for the purpose of serving their employees and vendors .
Q : What about Europe ?
Are n't there reforms going on there ?
A : Yes .
I do a lot of speaking in Europe and I tell them , " Do n't think of America as free market .
You guys are far more free market than we are . "
They are contracting out services all over the place .
The entire Stockholm system is contracted out .
Every bus is contracted out .
The commuter rail is contracted out .
A good portion of the commuter rail service in Germany either has been or will be contracted out .
In the United States we have this massive , stupid , inefficient , destructive federal program that in my view has done more to destroy transit than anything else besides the management - labor cabal and the vendors .
In Europe what they discovered about 15 years ago is that centralized funding creates all sorts of incentives for locals to waste money .
So just about everywhere in Europe they have stopped their national transit programs and forced it down to the local level .
They 've said , " If you want to spend all that money on transit , you go right ahead . "
In a sense , they de-nationalized funding and they de-nationalized responsibility .
Q : Is the current model of mass transit in the USA dead after 40 years ?
A : It 's not dead because it is being kept alive by an IV from Washington and taxpayers .
The very idea that Pennsylvania wants to impose tolls on I - 80 with part of the money going to transit shows the bankruptcy of the whole thing .
You are not going to get anything for it .
Transit is on life support .
It is very politically strong .
And you know what , we can keep brain - dead transit alive for as long as there is stuff coming out of those IV needles .
But if you want to talk about people , role in the community and all that kind of thing , not only is the model dead , but my sense is that transit is dead .
That 's because this model has so poorly served the industry and the people that I 'm not sure there is anything that can be done to resuscitate it .
Q : What would you do if you got to run the Port Authority ?
A : If I were given dictatorial powers to go into a place like Pittsburgh and not have to deal with the feds and everything , I would propose that what we do is first offer a program of leased cars to our low - income riders and basically try to move all of our low - income drivers who can drive to cars .
And by the way , the mathematics work very well .
Secondly , I would strengthen dial - a- ride ( Access ) programs to help those people we can’t help with cars .
And thirdly , I would provide whatever service can be provided by bus or rail profitably .
That means that people who work downtown are going to have to start paying their share .
Maybe that hurts downtown .
But the fact is , there ’s no reason why a downtown employee should not be paying the full cost of his transit ride to downtown .
That model might very well in the long run get you more transit ridership and it would provide incredibly better mobility to low - income people who are being held back by their reliance on transit .
But generally , what I am saying is that when you get to a situation where transit represents 4 percent of ridership -- which it does in Chicago , Washington and San Francisco , those being the second , third and fourth to New York City at 9 percent -- it ’s dead .
Now that ’s not to suggest there are n’t things that can be saved .
The downtown - oriented systems are great , but they do n’t need to be subsidized .
Why are we subsidizing downtown ?
It ’s because they have the power -- it ’s very simple .
If somebody were ever to take a serious look at the subsidies to downtown , it would be astounding -- and I ’m not just talking about transit .
Q : Is anyone in the U.S.A. looking at a new model or calling for one ?
A : In terms of anyone thinking of an alternative , you have to recognize that it is sort of a self - supporting , incestuous situation .
The unions never give up .
They hate contracting because it saves 40 or 50 percent .
The politicians in Washington love it .
You 've got a transit industry that 's spending $ 50 billion a year .
I do n't know what the American Public Transit Association budget is , but I know they walk the halls of Congress all the time .
They take members of Congress to their meetings .
If you want to talk about lobbying abuses , I 'd start with the public sector quite frankly .
So the point is , of course , nobody is thinking about changing anything .
McCain advisors created and defend ' Enron loophole ' David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Thursday June 19 , 2008

Print This Email This Keith Olbermann delivered a special report Wednesday on the " Enron loophole " -- a regulatory gap that is the single greatest cause of out - of - control gasoline prices -- and how McCain 's leading advisors created that loophole and continue to defend it .
People who deal in oil routinely use " futures " -- agreements in advance on prices and delivery dates -- to deal with fluctuations in the market .
However , deregulation has allowed commodity speculators to take over this system of futures and use it for their own profit , running up the price of oil in a speculative bubble .
According to Olbermann , the story of $ 4 a gallon gas begins during the presidency of George H.W. Bush , when former Enron CEO Ken Lay started speculating on energy futures .
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission ( CFTC ) gave Enron free rein , and when Bill Clinton was elected in 1992 , CFTC Chairwoman Wendy Gramm moved to lock in the commission 's informal position on Enron as official policy .
Gramm then joined Enron 's board of directors , earning more than $ 900,000 over the next decade .
In December 2000 , during the chaos following the presidential election , Enron got a law passed containing an amendment known as the " Enron loophole , " deregulating not just single trades but entire markets .
This made it possible for Enron to artificially create the California energy crisis -- and left Enron employees chortling over how they had fucked over " Grandma Millie . "
The Enron loophole applied not just to electricity , but to all energy sources , which is why speculators have now been able to take over the oil market .
Two weeks ago , the Senate Commerce Committee heard testimony from a former CFTC director that " the speculators are not just placing bets in these futures markets , they 're saying , ' Gosh , I can control the price of heating oil . ' ... Morgan Stanley is the biggest heating oil owner in New England . "
If the Enron loophole is removed , said this director , " you get at least a 25 % drop in the cost of oil ... some people estimate 50 % . "
John McCain voted to close the Enron loophole in 2002 and 2003 , saying at the time that " we 're all tainted " by Enron 's money .
But , notes Olbermann , " for most of this campaign , McCain has offered explanations other than the influence of speculators , and remedies other than regulation . "
If the Enron loophole is not closed , even alternative energy sources will do little to reduce prices , because speculators will be able to immediately take those over as well .
" John McCain does n't talk about the Enron loophole any more , " reports Olbermann .
" What changed ?
Since 2006 , John McCain 's top economic advisor has been former Texas Senator Phil Gramm , husband of the former CFTC head who then joined Enron . "
" It was Graham who passed the Enron loophole ... with no hearings , no debate , " Olberman emphasizes .
" It was Graham who stopped Democrats from closing the Enron loophole .
... Graham lobbied Congress about commodity trading rules in 2006 . "
In addition , McCain 's senior advisor , Charlie Black , was a lobbyist for the act containing the Enron loophole in 2000 , and McCain 's finance co-chair , Wayne Berman , has lobbied more recently against legislation to prevent price gouging .
Olbermann acknowledges that McCain is now saying , " We must reforms the laws and regulations governing the oil futures market . "
However , McCain has not yet specifically mentioned the Enron loophole , and he still has Gramm and Berman and Black running his campaign and writing his economic policies

Phone Company Under Fire Telekom Promises Quick Investigation Into Spying Scandal
Revelations in SPIEGEL that German phone company Deutsche Telekom spied on top executives and journalists provoked a storm of criticism from politicians and privacy watchdogs this week , and the supervisory board is piling pressure on management to pinpoint the culprits in the next few weeks .
It has now been one week since Industry Minister Jim Prentice unveiled Bill C - 61 .
While the bill yielded the predictable voices of immediate support from lobby groups anxious to import the DMCA to Canada , it did not take long for the government 's communication strategy to go off - the - rails ( a none - too - impressive performance by Prentice at the press conference did not help ) .
By virtually any standard , it has not been a good week for a minister who is often described in glowing terms as future leadership material .
The media coverage has nearly universally criticized the legislation .
A sampling of masthead editorials include :
Further , the online anger has surely exceeded the Minister 's expectations :
The response from Industry Minister Jim Prentice ?
Letters to the editor that repeat already - tired spin about the bill being a " made in Canada " solution or an appearance on the CBC's Search Engine where he dodges questions and hangs up on the interviewer .
Yet no one should rest on their laurels as powerful groups will fight to defend the Canadian DMCA .
Letters , meetings , local events , and raising awareness remains absolutely critical .
To that end , next week I 'll be kicking off another series – 61 Flaws in Bill C - 61 .
Each weekday from June 23rd until September 15th ( the day the House of Commons is currently scheduled to resume ) , I 'll point to a reason why Canadians should reject the bill and demand better .

Google has faced criticism in the past Search engines should delete personal data held about their users within six months , a European Commission advisory body on data protection has said .
The recommendation is likely to be accepted by the European Commission and could lead to a clash with search giants like Google , Yahoo and MSN .
Google and MSN anonymise user data after 18 months , while Yahoo does the same after 13 months .
The body said search companies were not clear enough on data protection .
Google said its privacy policy " strikes the right balance " between privacy , security and innovation .
Peter Fleischer , Google 's global privacy counsel , said in a statement : " Google takes privacy incredibly seriously ; protecting our users ' privacy is at the heart of all our products .
Search engine providers must delete or irreversibly anonymise personal data once they no longer serve the specified and legitimate purpose they were collected for
Article 29 Working Party report " It is the reason we were the first company to commit to anonymising our search logs , and also why we dramatically shortened our preference cookie lifetime . "
In a statement Yahoo said it was reviewing the details of the body 's recommendations .
" We remain committed to striking the right balance between protecting user privacy , providing the most compelling online experience , meeting our legal obligations and preventing fraud , " the firm said .
Many search engines currently collect and store information from each search query , holding information about the search query itself , the unique PC address ( known as an IP number ) , and details about how a user makes their searches , such as the web browser that is being used .
Users who create an account with a search engine hand over more data to the firms , including search history .
Some search engines also enrich personal data held on their users with information from third parties .
The report from the Article 29 Data Protection Working Party said search engine providers had " insufficiently explained " why they were storing and processing personal data to their users .
It said " search engine providers must delete or irreversibly anonymise personal data once they no longer serve the specified and legitimate purpose they were collected for " .
The report said the personal data of users should not be stored or processed " beyond providing search results " if the user had not created an account or registered with the search engine .
The advisory body also said it preferred search engines did not collect and use personal data to serve personalised adverts unless the user had consented and signed up to the service .
Yahoo is one of the world 's leading search engines
The body was set up to provide expert opinion to the European Commission and to make recommendations in the areas of personal data and privacy .
The Commission usually adopts the recommendations the body makes .
The report also said search engines did not need to gather additional personal data , beyond the IP address of a machine being used , in order to deliver basic search results and advertisements .
It added : " Because many search engine providers mention many different purposes for the processing , it is not clear to what extent data are reprocessed for another purpose that is incompatible with the purpose for which they were originally collected . "
It said search engines should not use personally identifiable data to improve their services or for accountancy purposes .
Personal data stored for security purposes should not also be used to improve services , the body recommended .
The report issued a set of obligations to search engines firms , including : Search engines should get informed consent from users if they correlate personal data across different services , such as desktop search
Search engine providers must delete or anonymise ( in an irreversible and efficient way ) personal data once they are no longer necessary for the purpose for which they were collected
Personal data should not be held by search engines for longer than six months
In case search engine providers retain personal data longer than six months , they must demonstrate comprehensively that it is strictly necessary for the service
It is not necessary to collect additional personal data from individual users in order to be able to perform the service of delivering search results and advertisements
If search engine providers use cookies , their lifetime should be no longer than demonstrably necessary
Search engine providers must give users clear and intelligible information about their identity and location and about the data they intend to collect store or transmit , as well as the purpose for which they are collected
The report also warned that if search engines enriched personal data about users from third parties they could be breaking the law unless customers had given explicit consent .
It said users had the right to access , inspect and correct all the personal data about themselves held by search engines , including their profiles and search history .

White House denies story about attacking Iran

WASHINGTON ( AP ) – The White House on Tuesday denied a published report in Israel that said President Bush intends to attack Iran before the end of his term in January .
A story in the Jerusalem Post quoted a “ senior official ” there as saying that Bush plans to attack Iran in the coming months .
The story says the unidentified official claimed that a “ senior member ” of Bush ’s traveling entourage made the statement about attacking Iran in a closed meeting .
Bush was in Israel last week .
The article also says the unnamed Bush official said that Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney “ were of the opinion that military action were called for . ”
“ An article in today ’s Jerusalem Post about the president ’s position on Iran that quotes unnamed sources – quoting unnamed sources – is not worth the paper it ’s written on , ” White House press secretary Dana Perino said in a statement .
“ Let me respond by reaffirming the policy of the administration :
We , along with our international allies who want peace in the Middle East , remain opposed to Iran ’s ambitions to obtain a nuclear weapon , ” Perino said .
“ To that end , we are working to bring tough diplomatic and economic pressure on the Iranians to get them to change their behavior and to halt their uranium enrichment program . ”
Perino said the “ president of the United States should never take options off the table , but our preference and our actions for dealing with this matter remain through peaceful diplomatic means .
Nothing has changed in that regard . ”

Canadian Omar Khadr was 15 when he was captured Guantanamo Bay interrogators were told to destroy handwritten notes in case they were called to testify on detainee treatment , a military lawyer alleges .
The lawyer , Lt - Cmdr William Kuebler , said the instructions were contained in a Pentagon operations manual .
He said this apparent destruction of evidence at the prison camp stopped him from challenging alleged confessions in the case of his client , Omar Khadr .
He would use the document to seek a dismissal of the charges , he said .
Mr Khadr - a Canadian - is the only Westerner still held at the jail .
The 21 - year - old is accused of killing a US soldier and wounding another during a battle in Afghanistan in 2002 .
Mr Khadr was 15 when he was captured during the firefight at a suspected al - Qaeda camp in Afghanistan .
He faces a maximum sentence of life in prison if convicted .
Two weeks ago , Canada 's Supreme Court ruled the Canadian government had acted illegally by handing over documents from an interview with the suspect by its own intelligence services a year after his capture .
' Crucial to the case '
The manual on " Standard Operating Procedures " which reportedly contained the instructions was obtained by Lt - Cmdr Kuebler from prosecutors last week as part of a pre-trial review of evidence , he said .
Keeping the number of documents with interrogation information to a minimum can minimise certain legal issues
Pentagon manual , according to Lt - Cmdr William Kuebler
The lawyer said the evidence was crucial to the case as prosecutors were relying on evidence extracted at Afghanistan 's Bagram air base and Guantanamo .
" The mission has legal and political issues that may lead to interrogators being called to testify , keeping the number of documents with interrogation information to a minimum can minimise certain legal issues , " Lt - Cmdr Kuebler quoted the document as saying in a signed affidavit .
Correspondents say the document could support challenges by other detainees to the use of confessions as evidence .
Last week the trial by military tribunal of five Guantanamo inmates began at the camp .
They face charges relating to the 9/11 attacks on the US .
The trials have already raised questions about not just the treatment of detainees , but also the legitimacy of American military commissions .
Later this month , the US Supreme Court is to rule on the rights of prisoners being held at Guantanamo Bay , threatening a possible delay or even halt to the proceedings .

Vela Supernova Remnant
Credit & Copyright : Robert Gendler
Explanation :
The plane of our Milky Way Galaxy runs through this complex and beautiful skyscape .
At the northwestern edge of the constellation Vela ( the Sails ) the 16 degree wide , 30 frame mosaic is centered on the glowing filaments of the Vela Supernova Remnant , the expanding debris cloud from the death explosion of a massive star .
Light from the supernova explosion that created the Vela remnant reached Earth about 11,000 years ago .
In addition to the shocked filaments of glowing gas , the cosmic catastrophe also left behind an incredibly dense , rotating stellar core , the Vela Pulsar .
Some 800 light - years distant , the Vela remnant is likely embedded in a larger and older supernova remnant , the Gum Nebula .
The broad mosaic includes other identified emission and reflection nebulae , star clusters , and the remarkable Pencil Nebula .

His father Neil Metcalfe , 43 , said he had " no regrets " about his decision to call the police .
" I would think for longer , knowing what I know now .
I only found ammo - I did n't know the weapon was there and I did n't know he was facing five years .
" Of course there 's guilt that he will be locked up for so long and I feel sorry for him . "
His son said he was " minding " the bullets and gun for criminals whom he refused to name .
The minimum sentence for possession of a firearm is five years in prison .
But Judge Christopher Cornwall took into account the fact his father informed police - the defence argued a longer sentence might otherwise deter other public - spirited parents .

Mr Metcalfe said the sentence was unfair .
" The judge has said three years - I was hoping for two .
" He had n't even touched the gun - the police said that before .
It was bagged and sealed .
" He did not go down the street threatening anyone with a gun .
He had no intention of using it and should have only got about 18 months - people get less for GBH . "
In a statement to the court , Mr Metcalfe said he believed his son had fallen into the wrong circle after becoming involved in the drug sub-culture as a cannabis user .
Judge Cornwall said cannabis may have " acted as a gateway from the respectable world your parents intended to the foul and dangerous world of drugs " .
Sentencing him , the judge said : " The grim reality is that the pistol you were looking after was capable of firing live rounds .
" Your intention was to return this lethal weapon to dangerous men who were intent on using the gun to achieve their criminal aims . "
In my view the three year sentence is fair
Det Insp Derek Jones
Mr Metcalfe said were he to do it again he would have accompanied his son down to the police station - something the judge might have given him more credit for .
The semi-automatic gun was originally a blank - firing weapon which had been converted to fire live rounds .
Detectives still do not know where the gun came from and said they were striving to find out .
Neil Metcalfe backed his son's decision not to tell officers where he had got the gun , because of possible reprisals which would " turn his three - year sentence into a life sentence " .
Paul Metcalfe will serve half his sentence in a young offenders ' institution and the remaining half on licence .
Det Insp Derek Jones , of Lancashire Police , said : " In my view the three - year sentence is fair , but Paul Metcalfe has received a slightly lesser sentence because of the commendable actions of his father .
" I would like to remind people that the mandatory minimum sentence for possessing a firearm , under normal circumstances , is five years .
" Handing his son in to the police must have been an incredibly difficult decision for Mr Metcalfe to make , but it was certainly the right one and if he had n't the consequences could have been horrific . "

What are these ?
Monsanto , premier producteur mondial de semences transgéniques , a publié le 4 juin , à Saint - Louis ( Etats - Unis ) , un " engagement en trois points " : la firme s'engage à " doubler la productivité du maïs , du soja et du coton en 2030 par rapport à 2000 " , à " développer des semences qui réduiront d'un tiers les ressources requises " d'eau et d'engrais , et à aider " à améliorer la vie des paysans , dont cinq millions des plus pauvres , en 2020 " .
Intervenant alors que se tenait à Rome la conférence de la FAO ( Organisation des Nations unies pour l'alimentation et l'agriculture ) sur la crise alimentaire , la démarche vise à convaincre que les organismes génétiquement modifiés ( OGM ) sont un atout pour faire face à ce problème et au changement climatique .
Mais pour les chercheurs indépendants d'ETC Group ( Action Group on Erosion , Technology and Concentration ) , basés à Ottawa ( Canada ) , la démarche des grandes firmes semencières vise d'abord à s'assurer des positions commerciales profitables .
Dans un rapport publié en mai ( www.etcgroup.org), ETC Group révèle que Monsanto , Bayer , BASF , Syngenta et d'autres firmes ont déposé 532 brevets sur des séquences génétiques favorisant l'adaptation au changement climatique .
A elles deux , Monsanto et BASF détiennent 49 % des groupes de brevets concernés .
Ces deux entreprises avaient annoncé , en mars 2007 , un partenariat de 1,5 milliard de dollars pour développer des plantes résistantes à des conditions climatiques néfastes - " probablement le plus grand accord privé de recherche jamais enregistré " , dit ETC Group .
Ce dernier détaille les projets des principales firmes qui proposeront dès 2010 des plantes supposées adaptées à la sécheresse .
Les compagnies cherchent à impliquer les grands organismes de recherche publique dans leur démarche , tels le Cimmyt ( Centre international d'amélioration du maïs et du blé ) ou le CGIAR ( Groupe consultatif international de recherche agricole ) .
Un programme pour développer des OGM en Afrique a ainsi été lancé par le Cimmyt avec un soutien de 47 millions de dollars de la Fondation Bill et Melinda Gates .
Pourquoi ces dépôts de brevets par les multinationales des semences sont - ils critiqués par ETC Group ?
D'une part parce qu'ils risquent de distraire des ressources nécessaires à une recherche agronomique plus proche des besoins des petits paysans .
Selon ETC
Group , la recherche biotechnologique prolonge le modèle agro- industriel alors que la communauté des agronomes affirme que la priorité pour faire face aux crises est le soutien à l'agriculture vivrière et aux petits paysans .
Cela a été clairement exprimé dans un rapport de l'ONU élaboré par la communauté scientifique et publié en avril .
ETC
Group cite aussi plusieurs exemples où la recherche agronomique classique parvient à élaborer des riz adaptés à des conditions très sèches .
D'autre part , le dépôt de brevets sur les gènes de familles de plantes pourrait rendre difficile aux organismes publics de recherche et aux groupes de petits paysans l'accès aux banques de semences :
" Si les compagnies multinationales contrôlent les gènes - clés de la résistance à la sécheresse dans des cultures transgéniques (... ) , les chercheurs publics pourraient ê tre accusés de violer les règles de propriété des gènes brevetés " , s'inquiète le rapport .
Enfin , les experts soulignent que la création de plantes OGM résistantes à la sécheresse soulève de nombreux problèmes scientifiques qui sont loin d'avoir été résolus .
Ainsi , selon un phénomène biologique appelé pléiotropie , le gène introduit pourrait commander d'autres caractéristiques de la plante que sa seule capacité à résister au manque d'eau .
La pression pour imposer les solutions transgéniques a été observée sur un autre front , lors de la Conférence sur la biodiversité qui s'est achevée à Bonn le 30 mai .
Face à l'opposition des Etats - Unis et du Brésil , les pays africains n'ont pu obtenir le moratoire temporaire qu'ils souhaitaient sur la diffusion des arbres transgéniques , le temps d'analyser l'effet qu'ils pouvaient avoir sur les écosystèmes .
Les arbres OGM pourraient produire ... des agrocarburants à base de cellulose .

Tom Waits
There ’s no doubt about it , Tom Waits is a very cool cat .
Few people are as slick and sharp as Mr. Waits , a man who ’s virtually portraits the perfect entertainer role , but when you can successfully entertain yourself you reach a whole other level , and seeing how Tom Waits is the depiction of coolness there ’s no doubt about we ’ll be in for some fun .
What I ’m talking about is the latest interview that had Tom at its center , conducted by none other then … Tom .
That ’s right , the man posted earlier today , on the Anti- website , an interview in which he ’s both putting and answering the questions , in a very intriguing , interesting and above all fun , manner .
The interview itself is a real gem , that gives a lot of awesome insight around Tom Waits life , mind and heart .
In the interview you can read , among other interesting stuff , what ’s Tom ’s most curious record in his personal collection ( The best of Marcel Marceau ) , what are the artists and songs that have shaped him into the man he is today , what ’s scary for Tom Waits ( i.e. Jail door closing ) and loads of other fun questions about his artistic life .
Also he did n’t pass the chance to talk a bit about his part in his latest , upcoming movie Dr. Parnassus , a movie by the great Terry Gilliam , in which Tom ’s set to play THE devil ( not just a devil , he ’s too badass to play that ) .
Here he ’ll play next to a stellar cast including Johnny Depp , Jude Law , Christopher Plummer , Colin Farrell , and the late Heath Ledger .
Bellow you can read an excerpt form the Waits - Waits interview , in which he talks about the movie , working with Terry Gilliam and Christopher Plummer .
Q : Tell me about working with Terry Gilliam .
A : I am the Devil in the Imaginarium of Dr. Parnassus–not a devil … The Devil .
I do n’t know why he thought of me .
I was raised in the church .
Gilliam and I met on Fisher King .
He is a giant among men and I am in awe of his films .
Munchausen I ’ve seen a hundred times .
Brazil is a crowning achievement .
Brothers Grimm was my favorite film last year .
I had most of my scenes with Christopher Plummer ( He ’s Dr. Parnassus ) .
Plummer is one of the greatest actors on earth !
Mostly I watch and learn .
He ’s a real movie star and a gentleman .
Gilliam is an impresario , captain , magician , a dictator ( a nice one ) , a genius , and a man you ’d want in the boat with you at the end of the world .
Check out the rest of the interview at Anti- .
The movie , Dr. Parnassus , is set to hit the big screens sometime in 2009 .
The wait may be long and arduous , but seeing Tom Waits playing the devil is well worth it .
Actually when I first heard this , the first thing that popped in mind was his video for “ I Do n’t Wanna Grow Up “ .
For those of you unfamiliarized with it , urgently check this out !
Tom Waits ’ summer tour is still on schedule , so grab the phone or keyboard and order a ticket to a show next to you asap .

What Beanstalk did not do when it took on Stanley as a client was recommend investing in a ladder - production facility and hiring a bunch of workers , plus a sales force to blitz potential retail channels .
Stanley Works , as a company , has actually been moving in the opposite direction , closing factories and outsourcing its manufacturing since the 1980s .
Instead , Beanstalk worked out a licensing deal with Werner , which was already the biggest maker and distributor of ladders in the country .
“ They needed another brand because they could n’t expand the Werner brand anymore , ” Stone said .
So Werner started making and selling ladders with the Stanley name on them .
This gave Werner a way to get more shelf space , reach more consumers and make more sales .
What it gave Stanley was its name on a new product and a licensing fee .
Beanstalk has worked out many such deals , hooking up the Stanley brand with manufacturers of work gloves and boots , power generators and a variety of other things that Stanley never made ( and does not make now ) .
Too many such deals , or the wrong kinds , can boomerang : this happens with some regularity in the fashion world , when a famous designer name gets spread over so many products , with so little regard to quality , that the entire image of the brand sinks .
Still , if you see a ladder made by Stanley , you may well think , Well , there ’s a name I can trust .
What you ’re trusting , though , is n’t Stanley workers in Stanley factories upholding Stanley traditions and values under the watchful eye of Stanley managers .
What you ’re trusting is Stanley ’s recognition that a badly made ladder with the Stanley name on it could be highly damaging to the Stanley brand .
You are trusting Stanley ’s recognition of the value of its brand and its competence in defending that value .
We circled back around to Beanstalk ’s ideas for River West ’s brands , particularly Brim .
Stone mentioned White Cloud .
White Cloud is a brand of toilet paper once owned by Procter & Gamble .
P.& G. also owned the Charmin franchise , so eventually it let the trademarks on White Cloud expire .
These were then acquired by an entrepreneur , who worked out a licensing deal with Wal - Mart to make White Cloud an exclusive Wal - Mart product .
It became , essentially , a store brand , but infused with equity of mass - market familiarity .
It ’s very doubtful that the typical White Cloud buyer is aware that the product is available only at Wal - Mart .
It ’s also very doubtful that P.& G. ( which would surely prefer that its Charmin did n’t have to compete against a brand that P.& G. itself created ) will let anything like that happen again if it can possibly help it .
This is essentially the situation that River West brokered with the Nuprin brand , which was a dead line of ibuprofen painkillers ( once upon a time backed by the widely known “ Nupe it ” ad campaign ) .
Its trademarks were acquired by River West and sold to CVS , where it is back on the shelves as a stealth store brand .
( And presumably enjoying better margins than it would if , like a traditional store brand , it competed solely on low price , not trustworthy - brand familiarity . )
My read was that this is what Stone thought should happen to Brim  and that Earle had mixed feelings , believing , perhaps , that Brim could come back as something bigger .
Even Stone seemed at least somewhat intrigued with the possibilities of licensing a brand that was familiar but dead .
“ With Stanley we have to be careful  this is a famous brand ; we have to do everything right and mitigate all the risks , ” he says .
“ But with Brim , the risks .
. . . ” He paused .
“ There really are no risks . ”
This brings us to Earle ’s ideas about the potential upside of faulty consumer memory .
Maybe , for instance , you ’re among those who remember Brim .
But do you also remember that it was a decaf - only brand ?
That ’s actually why you could “ fill it to the rim . ”
River
West ’s research found that many who recall the Brim brand have forgotten the decaf detail .
The relationship between brands and memory ( faulty or no ) is a specialty of Kathy LaTour , an associate professor at the University of Nevada , Las Vegas .
In one of her most interesting studies , she worked with Elizabeth Loftus , a memory specialist and now a professor at the University of California , Irvine , and a third researcher , Rhiannon Ellis , to take the issue to its logical extreme :
What if , for example , an advertising campaign “ implanted memories into consumers of things that never happened ? ”
The researchers found that subjects presented with a fake Disney World ad inviting them to “ remember the characters of your youth : Mickey , Goofy . . . ” were significantly more likely to say they recalled that as children they had met “ a favorite TV character at a theme resort ” than those who did n’t see the ad .
The fascinating thing was what happened when they repeated the experiment , tweaking the ads to include Bugs Bunny , who , of course , is not a Disney character at all .
About 16 percent of subjects subsequently claimed that , as children , they shook hands with Bugs Bunny at a Disney theme park .
Repeated fake - ad exposure apparently led to higher false - memory rates .
In a separate study , Loftus asked subjects with Bugs in their memories what , exactly , they recalled about this incident ; of these , 62 percent recounted shaking Bugs ’s hand , and more than a quarter specifically recalled him saying , “ What ’s up , Doc ? ”
Remember that incredible Svalbard Global Seed Vault we told you about ?
It protects the Earth 's plants for when aliens blow up our civilization so that they too can enjoy the natural decadence of fried plantains ( that are generously fertilized by our decaying corpses ) .
60 Minutes got a peek inside the vault , and it 's pretty neat stuff .
Here 's a 3 - minute clip exploring the ice fortress :

I ’m sure you ’ve seen the trailer and ads for the new movie Expelled : No Intelligence Allowed ! with Ben Stein on TV or the internet .
The premise of the movie is that Big Science the elitist scientific establishment is keeping Intelligent Design out of the classrooms and ruining the careers of any scientist who speaks in favor of it .
Stein says on the topic , “ Big Science in this area of biology has lost its way , ” says Stein .
“ Scientists are supposed to be allowed to follow the evidence wherever it may lead , no matter what the implications are .
Freedom of inquiry has been greatly compromised , and this is not only anti-American , it ’s anti-science .
It ’s anti-the whole concept of learning . ”
The movie is supposed to be an unbiased documentary on the topic of intelligent deisgn and does n’t try and respresent just one side of the sotry .
They interviewed scientists who believe in intelligent design as well as skeptics suxch as Richard Dawkins author of the god delusion .
Of course if you go to the movie ’s website there is a section called Big Science Academy .
Here is the president ’s welcome :
Big Science Academy we take our motto seriously :
“ No Intelligence Allowed . ”
And this year , we are proud to report that in every subject but Science , students and faculty are free to challenge ideas , and seek truth wherever it may lead .
But Science is different .
In Science , there is no room for dissent , for dissent is dangerous .
That is why we at Big Science simply refuse to allow it .
Like dancing , “ dissent ” can lead to other things .
As Class President Richard Dawkins put it so well : “ Shut up ! ”
As you know …last year we had the misfortune of “ presupposition of design ” rearing its ugly head , with several students challenging Neo - Darwinian materialism , and arguing incessantly for the right to examine Intelligent Design .
They were all Expelled , of course – but still : it just goes to show where academic freedom can lead , if not shut down immediately !
Sincerely ,
Charles Darwin
Principal , President , Admissions and Diversity Affairs Officer ,
Big Science Academy “ No Intelligence Allowed ”
And going to the class officers section we see :
Richard Dawkins
Class President
“ If you meet somebody who claims not to believe in evolution , that person is ignorant , stupid or insane . ”
Wow that certainly is unbiased not like you took comments of his out of context for shock value at all .
Walt Ruloff , co-founder of Premise Media and co-Executive Producer says of the film “ People will be stunned to actually find out what elitist scientists proclaim , which is that a large majority of Americans are simpletons who believe in a fairy tale .
Premise Media took on this difficult mission because we believe the greatest asset of humanity is our freedom to explore and discover truth . ”
The movie is part of a larger grassroots campaign .
The extensive grass roots campaign for Expelled , spearheaded by Motive Entertainment president , Paul Lauer , will include nationwide screenings and endorsements with key leaders , promotional materials , a promotional resource DVD , publicity , radio promotions and Internet .
In addition , a pre-launch campaign will include unprecedented partnerships and a widespread campaign together with educators , youth , scientists , families , faith - based leaders and the media nationwide .
You can even get your own Expelled resource and event kit here .
So let me get this straight this is an unbiased documentary presenting all sides of the issue , but it is also the spearhead of a national campaign to get intelligent design in the class rooms .
Hmm , is it just me or does that not sound right .
Lets take a look at the people behind the film .
About Premise Media : Premise Media Corporation develops , finances and produces independent films , books and DVD ’s for the domestic and international marketplace , “ Producing world class media that stirs the heart and inspires the mind to truth , purpose and hope . ”
Okay inspires truth , purpose and hope , sounds a little odd form a production company .
Most of them I though had the prupose on producing entertainment to make money but okay .
About Motive Entertainment : Los Angeles - based Motive Entertainment , which directed the grassroots marketing campaigns for Mel Gibson ’s The Passion of the Christ , the Tom Hanks / Robert Zemeckis film Polar Express and the record - breaking Walden Media / Disney epic series , The Chronicles of Narnia , is the leading company in faith - based film and entertainment marketing .
The experience of the Motive Entertainment team effectively develops and maintains extensive marketing , radio , publicity and grassroots internet campaigns for most of Hollywood ’s top studios on a consistent basis , drawing in new clients and business partnerships continually , serving the needs of clients like few companies in the entertainment business today .
Did you read that part “ leader in faith based entertainment marketing ” .
So this movie is supposed to be marketed to religious individuals and I ’m guessing that their demographic is Christians .
On the the one hand the movie says its a non-biased documentary , but looking deeper we see that its the spearhead for a campaign to promote intelligent design specifically marketed to Christians .
Is it just me or is this another attempt to get Jesus into the class rooms and do away with Church and state using the issue of “ Intelligent Design ” as a means of doing so .
Basically the religious right has seen how effective documentary films and entertainment can be for mobilizing people around an issue .
Throw in a semi-lebrity such as Ben Stein , the lovable , monotone teacher from Ferris Bueller ’s Day Off and The Wonder Years , and bingo you have a great way to get people thinking about religion in school with out actually saying so .
This kind of thing is disgusting in the way they hide what they ’re really trying to do .
If you want Jesus and religion in schools just make a movie about that do n’t try and create a scientific debate about a non-existant issue , especially do n’t drag out Ben Stein and have him be your poster boy .
I mean Jimmy Kimmle is making more money than him now for Christ Sakes ( no offense ) .
So see expelled if you want to but be aware of the movie ’s agenda and do n’t think that your being a rebel for taking on “ Big Science ” .

REUTERS / Morteza Nikoubazl
TEHRAN ( Reuters ) - Iran rejected on Saturday any suspension of its nuclear enrichment program , after the EU ’s top diplomat handed Tehran a world powers ’ offer of economic benefits to try and persuade it to stop such work .
“ If the package ( from six major powers ) includes suspension it is not debatable at all , ” government spokesman Gholamhossein Elham told reporters .
There are some amazing creatures in the world of nature , but for every cute and fluffy animal there is another animal on standby which is equally strange and mysterious .
Take a look at the this amazing collection of the world ’s strangest animals to find out a little bit more about what nature has to offer .
You will be sure to see some animals that you did n’t even know existed , and which you wo n’t find in your local zoo or wildlife park !
Pelochelys cantorii ( Cantor ’s giant soft - shelled turtle )
The turtle is found primarily in inland , slow - moving fresh water rivers and streams .
Cantor ’s giant soft - shelled turtles can grow up to 6 feet ( about 2 meters ) in length and weigh more than 100 pounds ( about 50 kilograms ) .
Matamata Turtle
The mata mata inhabits slow moving , blackwater streams , stagnant pools , marshes , and swamps ranging into northern Bolivia , eastern Peru , Ecuador , eastern Colombia , Venezuela , the Guianas , and northern and central Brazil .
The mata mata is strictly an aquatic species but it prefers standing in shallow water where its snout can reach the surface to breathe .
Patagonian Cavy ( Mara )
A large rodent that looks sort of like a rabbit , sort of like a donkey .
The Patagonian Mara lives in Central and Southern Argentina .
Maras inhabit arid grasslands and scrub desert
Saiga Antelope
Saiga is classified as critically endangered by the IUCN .
There is an estimated total number of 50,000 Saigas today , which live in Kalmykia , three areas of Kazakhstan and in two isolated areas of Mongolia .
Star nosed mole
The Star - nosed Mole lives in wet lowland areas and eats small invertebrates , aquatic insects , worms and mollusks .
It is a good swimmer and can forage along the bottoms of streams and ponds .
Like other moles , this animal digs shallow surface tunnels for foraging ; often , these tunnels exit underwater .
The incredibly sensitive nasal tentacles are covered with almost one hundred thousand minute touch receptors known as Eimer ’s organs .
Elephant shrew
They are widely distributed across the southern part of Africa , and although common nowhere , can be found in almost any type of habitat , from the Namib Desert to boulder - strewn outcrops in South Africa to thick forest .
Long - beaked echidna
Echidnas are one of the two types of mammals that lay eggs ( the other one is platypus ) .
The long - beaked echidna is found in New Guinea , where it is widespread .
Pink Fairy Armadillo
It is found in central Argentina where it inhabits dry grasslands and sandy plains with thorn bushes and cacti .
It has the ability to bury itself completely in a matter of seconds if frightened .
The Pink Fairy Armadillo burrows small holes near ant colonies in dry dirt .
It feeds mainly on ants and ant larvae near its burrow .
Long-eared Jerboa
“ The Mickey Mouse of the desert ” – mouse - like rodent with a long tail , long hind legs for jumping , and exceptionally large ears .
The jerboa , found in the deserts of Mongolia and China , is listed as endangered on the IUCN Red List .
Sources : 1 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9
These compact islands deliver on their Caribbean promise , with plenty of sun and sand , reef and nightlife .
Conditions :
The islands are very busy around new year , although it can be rainy now at the tail of the wet season .
Later in the month it is drier , with perfect temperatures of 82 °F on average .
What 's On In May
Event 1 is going to be held soon on the amazing 12 - 14 June 2014 .
Event 2 is going to be held soon on the amazing 12 - 14 June 2014 .

reepy things from beneath the sea are clichés of modern exploration , but the abyss has now produced a surprise so bizarre as to have touched off hot international debate : tiny , mysterious , apparently living creatures far smaller than any known bacterium -- so small as to strain the limits on what is needed for independent life .
Dr. Philippa Uwins
An electron micrograph shows filaments projecting from sandstone .
The filaments are called nanobes because of their size , 20 to 150 nanometers , smaller than cells .
Their discoverers call them nanobes ( pronounced NAN - obes ) , because their size is in the realm of nanometers ( or billionths of a meter ) .
At 20 to 150 nanometers in length , they are smaller than cells , smaller than fungi , smaller than the smallest known bacterium and roughly the same size as viruses , which are considered nonliving parasites because they need hosts to reproduce .
Thus , nanobes call into question the minimum size requirements for terrestrial life .
If alive , the find bears on the pervasiveness of terrestrial life , new forms of which are being discovered so deep in such abundance that some scientists suspect the planet has a hidden biosphere of microbes extending down miles whose total mass may exceed that of all surface life .
The find might also influence hunts for microscopic aliens perhaps hidden in the solar system 's deep netherworlds , the discovery of which would prove that life in the universe is not unique to Earth but an inherent property of matter .
Scientists in Australia at the University of Queensland discovered the tiny oddities four years ago in ancient sandstones retrieved from an oil drilling site some three miles below the Western Australian seabed .
Described publicly for the first time in late 1998 , the fuzzy tangles of filaments resembled fungi and appeared to reproduce quickly , forming dense colonies of tendrils .
Laboratory analysis of them repeatedly found signs of DNA , or deoxyribonucleic acid , the master molecule of heredity and life .
" Our recent work provides further evidence " that the tangles are in fact alive , said Dr. Philippa J. R. Uwins , a scientist at the University of Queensland 's center for Microscopy and Microanalysis , who leads the research .
" They 're extraordinary and incredibly pretty , the way they grow between the minerals .
I 'm fascinated by them . "
Dr. Uwins 's team has written two new papers , one being reviewed for publication and the other just submitted , that describe the most recent evidence and experiments .
So far , the main findings are that the colonies grow spontaneously , contain DNA , are rich in biological elements like carbon , oxygen and nitrogen , and when cut in two show distinct outer and inner layers , including a possible nuclear area that holds DNA .
In a bid for skeptical rigor , the team has sought nonbiological explanations but has concluded that none can account for the observations .
Its future research goals include quantifying the growth rate of the colonies and sequencing their DNA , which could help connect them to the known tree of terrestrial life .
It might seem that firm knowledge about the minimal size requirements for life would be old stuff .
After all , it was several centuries ago that Antony van Leeuwenhoek first opened human eyes to the invisible world of microscopic life , describing a riot of " wee animalcules . "
But it turns out that the lower limits of life are still a biological mystery and their elucidation has only recently become a popular scientific objective .
The topic exploded in debate four years ago when scientists reported finding tiny fossil microbes in a 4.5 - billion - year - old , potato - size Martian meteorite that crashed to earth in Antarctica long ago .
At 20 to 200 nanometers , the putative Martian fossils were smaller than any known terrestrial life , and that discrepancy quickly sowed doubts about the veracity of the alien - life discovery .
Since then , many papers have tried to prove the existence of tiny terrestrial analogs and , by extension , the plausibility of the Martian fossils .
The Australian team 's paper is one of the genre 's most recent entries .
To help sort through the rush of claims , the National Aeronautics and Space Administration asked the National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences to convene an expert panel .
It met in late 1998 and recently published a 148 - page report , " Size Limits of Very Small Micro-organisms . "
The 18 experts said that known terrestrial bacteria in the range of 200 nanometers probably marked the lower size limit for current life , but held out the possibility that primitive unknown microbes might have been as small as 50 nanometers , about the size of the Australian nanobes .
" A tremendous number of papers are coming out , " said Dr. John A. Baross , a biologist at the University of Washington in Seattle who was on the panel 's steering group .
" But there 's no way a free - living cell is going to be less than 100 nanometers , " he said , noting that such lilliputian sizes would seemingly leave too little room for the enzymatic and genetic machinery essential for life .
For instance , a single ribosome , a kind of tiny factory that cells use in great numbers to make proteins , could fill a membrane sphere 50 to 60 nanometers wide .
Dr. Norman R. Pace , a microbiologist at the University of Colorado and another member of the research council 's steering group , agreed that nanobes were highly unlikely to be alive .
Their lower size limit of 20 nanometers , he noted , was about the width of 10 DNA molecules , making them too small to support all the other needed cellular machinery .
" I do n't think much of it , " he said of the nanobe claim .
The rough 100 - nanometer size limit for living things , Dr. Baross of the University of Washington noted , " does n't rule out biological entities that are 20 or 30 or 50 nanometers wide .
They 're just not going to be free - living and self - replicating .
We do n't know if these things might exist and have some function .
They might be signaling or doing all sorts of novel things . "
The Australian nanobes , he added , might well represent such components of life , perhaps working together in a primordial kind of communalism only now coming to light and soon to rewrite the textbooks .
" They can't be anything like the traditional micro- organism we know about , " he said of the nanobes .
" We have to think about them in a different way , and one is that they are components " that function as a living organism only in totality , the whole being greater than the sum of the parts .
" We 're very interested in whether these small things are biological in nature , " Dr. Baross said , " and , if so , what their function is . "
In the research council 's report , Dr. Jeffrey G. Lawrence , a biologist at the University of Pittsburgh , laid out a detailed analysis of such hypothetical communal life made up of extraordinarily tiny components , calling the aggregate a meta-cell .
" Such organisms need not maintain a full complement of genes , " Dr. Lawrence wrote , referring to the basic unit of heredity .
His own computer simulations , he added , predicted the existence of stable meta -cell components that held as few as a single gene .
" One may consider the meta - cell to be a single - celled organism whose genome is distributed through a network , " Dr. Lawrence wrote .
In contrast to a hypothetical meta-cell component bearing a single gene , the smallest known living bacterium has 470 genes , making the theoretical entity seem quite puny .
Dr. Jack W. Szostak , a geneticist at Harvard , said in the research council 's report that certain terrestrial environments like compressed sediments might be conducive to the evolution of very small whole organisms of about 50 nanometers .
" Given present uncertainties , " he wrote , " it seems wise to be prepared to detect life - forms of a wide range of sizes . "
In Australia , Dr. Uwins stumbled on her nanobes while examining just the kind of compressed sediments that Dr. Szostak proposed as a possible realm of diminutive life .
The sandstone samples came from deep petroleum exploration wells off western Australia .
Today , Dr. Uwins and her Australian colleagues Dr. Richard I. Webb , Dr. Anthony P. Taylor and Dr. Thomas
Loy are working hard to cut through the theorizing by proving the existence of extremely small life .
The team 's main tool is a Jeol 890 scanning electron microscope , an instrument that is able to magnify objects nearly one million times .
By contrast , most electron microscopes have magnifications less than half as strong .
" That 's an extreme speciality machine , very expensive and very powerful , " said Steve Hamilton of Jeol U.S.A. , in Peabody , Mass .
" There are only two or three in the United States . "
Stunning electron micrographs of the nanobes , printed in the November - December 1998 issue of American Mineralogist , a journal of the Mineralogical Society of America , show riots of filaments and tendrils , their ends often swollen and suggestive of reproductive budding .
Constrictions along some of the filaments " most likely represent septa , " or cavities within the nanobes , the team wrote .
Dissective cuts through the axes of some of the filaments " demonstrate that nanobes have an amorphous membrane structure , " the team wrote .
Such an outer covering , the scientists added , " is consistent with biological material and excludes the presence of crystalline mineral compounds . "
The colonies of nanobes grew so rapidly and so large , the team reported in American Mineralogist , that within weeks of becoming established on growth substrates they became visible to the naked eye , appearing as dense colonies of opaque , white , brown or gray filaments .
In trying to nail down the life issue , the team treated the nanobes with three kinds of DNA stains , in each case getting positive results .
In its new research , the team is doing molecular and structural analyses to see if the organisms are related to bacteria or fungi , or belong to a different evolutionary tree altogether .
New photomicrographs have revealed details of nanobe interiors , have pinpointed areas rich in DNA and have found " a whole range of interesting morphologies that look like life - cycle stages in fungi , " Dr. Uwins said in an interview .
" They 're striking . "
The researchers say they are increasingly confident that their investigations are going to bolster the Martian meteorite find .
Today , a top goal of the Mars exploration program is to see if life started on Mars early in its history , with experts eager to look for Martian microbes and microbial fossils .
Dr. Baross of the University of Washington said the kind of ferment now churning in biology would aid the hunt .
" It 's developing the tools and attracting really smart people into this field , " he said .
" Most of us in microbiology are prepared for any kind of surprise , " including organisms smaller than expected theoretically and tiny alien life .
" Dogma in microbiology is out the window in the past few years , " Dr. Baross added .
" The field has rediscovered itself .
It 's essentially a new science . "
The 2008 National Motorcycle Show in Toronto has always been heavily influenced by the American V - twin crowd and highlights some of the area ’s top custom builders who have on display a fine array of one - off custom machines .
This year ’s show , however , had one very unusual one - off custom , the Uno .
The orange and grey coloured Uno made its first public appearance balanced on its two side - by - side wheels and its footpegs .
Looking more like it should have been ridden by George Jetson as he pulled up to his space platform , it looked out of place amid the other custom creations in the building .
Perhaps that ’s why it garnered so much attention .
Since no one has ever seen a machine like this , the first question asked by on - lookers was :
“ What is it ? ”
Ultra Modern Meets Ultra Custom
The Uno and its inventor , 18 - year - old Ben J. Poss Gulak , hung out in a booth neighbouring the show ’s special guest , Russell Mitchell of Exile Cycles and was the ultimate in contrast of custom creations .
In fact , heavily tattooed Mitchell was seen riding the Uno around the show on Saturday evening .
Ben , as you would expect , fielded a multitude of questions about his strange vehicle once people got over his young age .
As Ben will tell you , the most common question was , “ What ’s your background , how did you get into doing something like this ? ”
A worthy question , and also my first question to Ben .
Ben grew up around his grand - father ’s basement machine shop .
While he does n’t have any formal training , yet , Ben has spent much of his life making projects like ‘ model trains , rockets and other cool stuff . ’
The education he gleaned from his grandfather , who was an engineer , and from simply being a tinkerer prompted Ben to enter into a grade nine school science fair with a ‘ real simple magnetic car that shot around a track using accelerator coils . ’
This is where I started to worry that this guy is going to start speaking a language that is way over my head .
He must have noticed my eyes starting to glaze over and came back to earth for me .
He did well at the grade nine science fair , and as a result , he was chosen to move up to the Regionals , then to the Nationals .
He was then chosen to represent Canada at an International level .
“ Team Canada consists of 18 people that compete against 54 other countries .
The judges at this level all carry PHD ’s in their respective fields , ” Ben said .
The 18 - year - old continued , “ There were astronauts and Nobel laureates speaking to the kids in attendance .
It was a real eye opener , and after the competition I realized I really wanted to get into engineering . ”
About a month after the competition , Ben ’s grandfather passed away and his machine shop was willed to Ben .
He continued to compete in science fairs with progressively more complicated projects thanks to the increased knowledge he gained as every year of high school passed .
A 2006 trip to China prompted Ben to consider a project in electric transportation after seeing the damage done by the internal combustion engine .
“ The smog was so thick , we never saw the sun , ” Ben said .
He then realized that some form of electric transport was desperately needed in the same compact form as a motorcycle or bicycle to help ease congestion and save the environment .
Since Ben had competed at the International level of the science fair before , he was able to apply to Team Canada directly without going through the Regional and National levels of competition .
It was this competition that he submitted his first Uno .
A simple frame made from angle iron and mountain bike wheels , which were of course powered by electric motors .
The First Public Viewing
The Uno model you see here , Ben ’s third prototype , was unveiled at the National Show .
After many hand drawn sketches and complex drawings , he began the machining work of building the basic drive / suspension assembly .
He did n’t know CAD software , but instead used the free Google software called Google SketchUp .
Ironically , a salesman came knocking shortly after , trying to sell SolidWorks , a 3 - D CAD software package .
Ben explained he could n’t afford anything like that , but he did show the salesman what he was working on .
The next day a copy of SolidWorks and a SolidWorks for Dummies book arrived , ( smart salesman , he probably has a customer for life now ) .
Sometimes You Need a Little Help
While Ben did all the work to get the Uno this far , he was in need of some help .
He needed tires mounted on his custom - made wheels and had heard of Motorcycle Enhancements in Oakville , Ontario .
Ben called and spoke with owner , John Cosentini .
It must have been fate as this was a call that would have a major impact on the finishing touches of the Uno .
Cosentini , a well - known figure in the Oakville motorcycle scene , and an accomplished custom bike builder , mounted the tires and since he has an inquiring mind , he began asking a few questions .
Ben sensed the curiosity and a couple of days later brought in his project .
This time , with questions of his own for John .
Ben needed a frame to complete the skeletal structure of the Uno and John suggested a Yamaha R1 frame because of its width between frame spars , a requirement needed to hold the drive / suspension portion of the Uno .
Ben also needed a body to wrap around the framework .
Cosentini , a mechanic and never being one to turn down a challenge , took on the project .
John and Ben began by making a simple frame which they could mount Styrofoam onto .
They carved the Styrofoam into the general shape they were looking for and then began to apply drywall compound over top of the styrofoam .
The drywall mud was used for a couple of reasons ; if fiberglass was applied directly to the styrofoam , it would chemically melt it ; also , the drywall mud could then be fine tuned by building up and sanding for the final shape .
Latex primer and paint was applied to create a smooth surface and the latex would also allow for easier removal of the fiberglass from the mold .
The molding took six weeks to complete and only two hours to destroy once the fiberglass was set .
The body was then cut in half and sent to Roger Pouw at Extreme Measures Kustom Paint ( www.extrememeasures.ca) for final bodywork and paint .
Ben was now well on his way to having a physical entity , but had a lot of fine - tuning to do on the computer side of things .
He had programmed the software to understand what the digital gyros were feeding into the ECU ( electronic control unit ) but could n’t quite get it right , after all , it ’s a pretty grey area .
Soon he was on a plane to meet Trevor Blackwell in California .
Blackwell is a robotics and gyro expert .
After a couple of visits to Blackwell , Ben had the Uno in full operation mode .
Ben claims a single gyro was easy to program , but this project was more complicated because the Uno has two gyros , one for forward and backward motion and the other is for turning , while keeping the forward or reverse momentum constant .
The Operation of the Uno
Operation of the 54.4 kg ( 120 lb ) machine is simple , in fact it ’s so simple there are no controls except for an on - off switch .
To go forward you simply push your body weight forward to tilt the machine .
To back up , just lean back on the seat to tilt it backwards and back it goes .
The farther you lean , the faster it accelerates .
The gyro tells the ECU how much to accelerate and that in turn delivers the proper amount of current to the electric motors , one for each wheel .
If you likened it to being a fancy Segway , Ben will quickly correct you .
“ It ’s much more complicated than a Segway .
The Segway uses a hand control to turn left or right .
On the Uno , you just need to lean in the direction you wish to go .
If you want to turn right you just lean right . ”
The independent suspension allows the unit to lean like a motorcycle during a turn .
The inner wheel will then compress the suspension so the wheel moves up inside the body while the outer wheel continues to make contact with the ground .
The gyro detects the sideways motion and instructs the ECU accordingly .
Since each wheel has its own electric motor , the outer wheel speeds up in order to complete the turn .
If the rider is moving forward and needs to stop , he simply leans back .
The electric motors have inherently high torque so stopping is very quick .
If you continue to lean backward , the Uno will go backwards .
All the while , the Uno feels quite stable .
A full battery pack will provide about 3 hours of travel time and charging time is only 17 minutes if using a fast charger .
In My Own Experience
Ben was kind enough to let me try the Uno and while it takes some getting used to , it is very manageable , at least going forwards and backwards .
I felt stable on the machine and it is even easy to balance while stationary .
I did find it a little unnerving while trying to corner and I did n’t quite get that right .
The Future of the Uno
At this point , the Uno only has the capability of doing 16 km/h ( 10 mph ) .
This is due to software programming .
The fourth generation Uno is in the works as you read this , and Ben assures me it will be able to motor along at a healthy 50 km/h ( 30 mph ) .
He has to programme the ECU in 10 mph increments and will be increasing its speed for the new Uno .
Ben understands there is probably not much of a market for the Uno in North America , but feels very strongly about the possibility for its use in Europe and Asia .
It may just be the way of a greener future in heavily populated cities .
While he has to decide his future education , remember the name Ben J. Poss Gulak .
I have a feeling you ’ll be hearing more of this talented lad in the future .
At press time he had been accepted at MIT ( Massachusetts Institute of Technology ) and Stanford University in California and was expecting acceptance results from other universities .
Ben also proudly mentioned to me that the Uno will be on the cover of Popular Science ’s June issue which will be released at the end of May , and will also be on Discovery Channel ’s Daily Planet in May .
Incidentally , I ’m sure you are wondering if the Uno took home any awards in the custom bike competition at the National Motorcycle Show .
Ben took home the Best Engineering Award , and rightfully so .
This hand - built machine is truly a one - off custom unlike anything you ’ve ever seen before .
It 's widely known that the ultimate driver of the earth 's climate system , the sun , has a variable output .
Short - term variations and an 11 - year solar cycles have been observed , and hints of longer - term cycles appear in the records .
It 's tempting to speculate that this variability can account for the rise in temperatures that we 've seen over the last 50 years ; indeed , editorials in business journals and local papers have done just that .
But attendees of last week 's American Association for the Advancement of Science meeting were told in no uncertain terms that this speculation was badly misguided .
It took a while to get there , though .
The first talk of the session came from Dr. Sallie Baliunas of the Harvard - Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics who has explored the possibility of long - term cycles in the sun 's output using everything from earth - bound isotope records to observations of other stars similar to the sun .
The data she presented suggested a number of possibilities , including a 200 year variability and potentially an even longer 2200 - 2500 year cycle .
Changes in 14C and 10 Be fluxes from various locations around the globe 's sea floors also suggests a millennial scale variation .
The small magnitude of the changes and large uncertainties in the data , however , leave the evidence for these cycles largely suggestive .
And , as Dr. Baliunas noted , without a detailed model of a star 's internal dynamo , understanding long term patterns is difficult .
Dr. Judith Lean of the Naval Research Lab took a shorter - term view , focusing on what we know about solar variability based on observations made since the advent of the space age .
Lean detailed how solar forcings fit into the larger climate system , along with forcings from volcanic eruptions , aerosols , the El Niño southern oscillation ( ENSO ) , and greenhouse gases .
Given satellite data , Lean started subtracting various forcings and explored what happens in different layers of the atmosphere .
For example , the ENSO had a far larger effect than the sun on the lower atmosphere , while the sun 's forcings dominated the stratosphere — except after large volcanic eruptions , in which case all bets are off .
Lean concluded that , over the past 100 years , changes in the sun 's output have driven the temperature up by about 0.1 K , but greenhouse gases have had a seven fold effect compared to the sun — 0.7 K .
The first two speakers focused largely on technical issues , leaving the answers to the big question a bit hard to discern .
The final speaker , Dr. Casper Ammann from the National Center for Atmospheric Research , changed that .
His message , which he repeated a number of times , is that the increase in temperatures since the 1950s is n't due to the sun and , even if the next solar activity cycle does n't arrive at all , temperatures are likely to continue to rise .
He got there in part by noting that the signature of the 11 - year solar cycle is actually really difficult to detect in the climate ; it 's apparent only if one takes the quasi- biennial oscillation ( QBO ) into account and modern statistical tools are used .
While clearly visible , the amplitude of the effect due to the solar variation is still less than 0.1 K .
He also pointed out that increased solar activity should warm the atmosphere uniformly ; instead , we see an increase of temperature at the surface and mid-troposphere , but a temperature decrease in anything above that .
This scenario is exactly what one would see if greenhouse gases were the cause of the global warming .
Dr. Ammann also discussed some climate modeling results .
He showed that modern climate models that take into account natural forcings do a rather good job at predicting past climate data — they 're all within the uncertainty of the temperature measurements .
These models and reality only diverge in the past 50 years and , when greenhouse gas forcings are added in , the two match closely all the way to the present .
The message of the talks was clear : although the sun 's output is variable , those variations have occurred over a defined range for the last 50 years , with no trend once the variation is smoothed out .
It 's not the sun , and the only way to get the rising temperatures we see is to include greenhouse forcings in the climate models .
This was n't a shock , given that Nobel Intent has covered a couple of peer - reviewed papers saying exactly that , but it appears to be worth repeating , given that newspaper editorialists are apparently unaware of it .
Incidentally , those who might have hoped that an unexpected drop in solar activity could bail us out were in for some disappointment .
Ammann calculated what would have to happen to the total solar irradience ( TSI ) to counteract the greenhouse gas forcings .
Apparently , the TSI normally varies around 1365W / m2 give or take 1.4 W/m2 .
To bail us out , it would have to drop to 1330 W / m2 — something that can pretty much be guaranteed not to happen .
Why is the Reddit RSS Feed Broken ?
Like millions of other web users I look to some of the large social news websites to find new content .
Mainly Reddit , Digg and Mixx .
And , like millions of other web users I ’m quite busy , so I rely on the RSS feeds of those websites to keep up with them .
However , recently the RSS feed for the Reddit front page has become as good as useless .
The number of broken links and duplicate stories has steadily increased over the last few months to the point where the noise is drowning out the interesting stories .
Take a look at the image to the right for an example of the duplicate stories .
Out of the 18 stories , 11 are duplicates ( indicated by arrows ) .
That ’s not a great ratio .
What this means is that for one day I saw over 280 Reddit stories in my feed reader , while another popular ( more popular , in theory ) social news site , digg.com only had 75 .
So using the screen to the right as a sample , out of those 280 stories , about 171 ( 61 % ) will be duplicates .
So maybe this is a one - off ?
Unfortunately not .
Scrolling down just one page of RSS entries reveals the following stories from Reddit ( see image to the left ) .
In this snapshot , we ’ve got 13 duplicates .
And not only that , we have one story that appears four times , three of those times consecutively .
I do n’t know what ’s causing these duplicate stories to appear , but it ’s clear that there ’s no quality control happening on the RSS feed side of Reddit ’s business .
I ’d like to introduce you to a friend of mine who ’s been going through a rough time recently .
It ’s the Reddit Alien , and he ’s looking a little beaten up .
This is the image that greats you every time you request a Reddit page that does n’t exist .
Unfortunately , I ’ve been seeing this more and more .
I chose to read 10 stories from the Reddit RSS feed and 4 resulted in a 404 page being displayed .
The important thing to remember here is that these are the Reddit pages that ca n’t be displayed , not the page on an external site being linked to .
The RSS feed is asking me to visit a page that does n’t exist .
I just quickly want to mention something else that annoys me about the Reddit RSS feed .
The URL the item links to is the external site , not the Reddit page .
This is important because the item being linked to could be literally anything .
It could be NSFW when I ’m at work , it could be a virus , it could be a spam site , it could be anything .
And given the opportunity for stories to hit the Reddit front page without that many ( relatively ) up mods , you do , at times , have to tread carefully .
I want check out the comments before visiting the link .
The decision to use the story url in the RSS feed has two problems .
Firstly , I lose much of the social aspect of Reddit if I just visit the story straight away ( actually , I can view the story without ever visiting Reddit ) and secondly , Reddit are losing out on page views .
Contrast this with digg.com , who ’s RSS feed links to the digg page for the story .
For sites such as these , it seems like a no - brainer .
As a fairly long time user of Reddit , I think I agree with others in that its popularity is directly inversely proportional to the quality of the service , and the stories it covers .
So as the site becomes more popular , the stories get worse .
Hopefully it ’s not too far gone , and we can have our Reddit back .
Saddled with a very unpopular president , and losing elections even in heavily Republican districts , the Republicans are trying to grab a piece of the “ change ” mandate .
So on Wednesday , Congressional Republicans will start rolling out their new policy agenda , complete with a new slogan ( drum roll please … )
“ The Change You Deserve “ .
Unfortunately , the Republicans seem to have plagiarized this slogan .
“ The Change You Deserve ” is the registered advertising slogan for the popular drug Effexor XR , used for the treatment of depression , generalized anxiety disorder , social anxiety disorder , and panic disorder in adults .
And it is a red pill with a large “ W ” on it !
Even its side effects will sound familiar — nausea , apathy , constipation , fatigue , vertigo , sexual dysfunction , sweating , memory loss , and ( are you ready for this ? )
“ electric shock - like sensations also called ‘ brain zaps ’ . ”

Let ’s just hope that this new slogan gives Republicans the change they deserve .
Electronic
Arts already has antitrust issues on its plate , given that the company is currently seeking federal approval to acquire Take - Two Interactive .
Last week that plate got a little more crowded when a pair of gamers in Washington , DC and California filed suit against the publisher in the US District Court of Northern California , alleging " blatantly anticompetitive conduct " in the way that it has cornered the football - gaming genre .
The class - action complaint focuses on Electronic Arts ' actions since 2004 , when Take - Two Interactive 's NFL 2K5 was released at a $ 19.99 price point and sold more than 2.9 million copies in the US , according to NPD figures .
Take - Two 's previous football game , ESPN NFL Football , sold fewer than 450,000 copies in the US .
Meanwhile , EA dropped the price of its Madden 2005 from $ 49.95 to $ 29.95 in response .
" This vigorous competition benefited consumers , " according to the suit .
" Electronic
Arts could have continued to compete by offering a lower price and / or a higher quality product .
Instead , Electronic
Arts quickly entered into a series of exclusive agreements with the only viable sports football associations in the United States : the National Football League , the Arena Football League , and NCAA Football . "
With no Take - Two competitor the following year , the suit notes that Electronic Arts raised the price of Madden 2006 back to $ 49.95 , an increase of nearly 70 percent .
The suit also brings up Electronic Arts ' attempted acquisition of Take - Two , saying that it " would remove one of the few companies with the ability and expertise to compete in the market for interactive football software " if EA somehow lost its exclusive deals .
The suit does not address Take - Two 's bid to reenter the football market with former player licenses but no professional league attached .
That game , All - Pro Football 2K8 , sold a little more than 275,000 copies at US retailers , according to the NPD Group .
The plaintiffs are asking for restitution and damages for those who purchased an Electronic Arts football game since August of 2005 , disgorgement of all profits made as a result of anticompetitive actions , and that the infringing agreements be declared null and void .
A representatives with Electronic Arts said the publisher could not comment on pending legal matters .
The plaintiffs had not responded to GameSpot 's requests for comment as of press time .
Religious Belief or Masked Discrimination ? …
You should check out Amanda ‘s follow up to her excellent column yesterday in which she put William " Lord " Saletan in his place for choosing to get the backs of " pro-life " pharmacists instead of backing women .
Saletan argues that these " pro-life " pharmacists are simply adhereing to a strong religious belief that contraception , even condoms , cause the death of the fetus , and that religious beliefs cannot be discriminated agaisnt .
Amanda asserts that :
… when a pharmacist refuses to serve a female customer because he believes she is
sexually active in a way that goes against his religion , he is discriminating
her on two counts that are arguably illegal : 1 ) Discrimination against customers based on gender and
2 ) Discrimination
against customers based on religious affiliation .
The pharmacist is not the
only person with a religious belief .
As I argue in my piece , what happens in a
refusal interaction is the pharmacist gains information that the customer has a
religious belief he disapproves of ( one that allows for the use of
contraception ) and he refuses service based on that religious belief .
Sex . Abortion .
Parenthood .
Power .

Amanda goes on to remind us that in the past we have overcome bigoted ideas to firmly establish personal liberties above and beyond the protective cloak of " religious belief " :
Sexists hope that hiding behind religion will confuse the issue , and sadly
they ’re right that Americans have short memories and are easily confused .
But
let me remind you : Segregation was defended using the religion card .
A great
many white people claimed to sincerely believe that the Bible required that the
races be separated , a belief that was even in the decision of the judge that
sent the Lovings to jail for interracial marriage , resulting in a lawsuit that
ended up overturning bans on interracial marriage .
We would not accept a hotel
manager who felt that his hotel was exempt from the CRA because his religious
freedom means that he can impose his will on black customers and refuse to put
them in any rooms but broken - down shacks in the back .
Nor should we accept a
pharmacist who does the equivalent with his female customers .
In a related note , Scotland approved FREE emergency contraception to be available in the nation ’s pharmacies .
Pharmacists will be able to opt out of providing EC as a matter of conscience .
Contraceptive Pill Outdated , Says Expert … Professor James Trussell of Princeton University warns that 1 in 12 women on the Pill become pregnant because they forget to take tablets at the right time .
He said : " The Pill is an outdated method because it does not work well enough .
It is very difficult for ordinary women to take a pill every single day .
The
beauty of the implant or the IUD is that you can forget about them . "
He said studies have shown women miss three times as many pills as they say they
do .
Computerised pill packs have revealed that where as about half of women say
they did not miss any pills , less than a third actually did .
And where as
between 10 per cent and 14 per cent admitted missing more than three pills in a
month , actually between 30 per cent and 50 per cent missed that many .
While the contraceptive efficacy of the Pill is indeed reliant upon the discipline of the woman using the Pill it is the form of birth control that most women seem most comfortable with .
More permanent options are , of course , available with their own set of advantages and disadvantages .
HealthSquare.com has a very thorough description of birth control options with advantages and disadvantages of each .
A BITTERSWEET HOMECOMING A BITTERSWEET HOMECOMING
Enlarge By Eileen Blass , USA TODAY Salvadoran deportees arrive at the airport tarmac in Harlingen , Texas , en route to El Salvador .
Last year , Immigration and Customs Enforcement deported 72,000 illegal immigrants by air .
SENT BACK HOME SENT BACK HOME Enlarge By Eileen Blass , USA TODAY Oscar Ordonez , 56 , and others are flown by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement back home to El Salvador .
Ordonez worked for 18 years in the USA as a janitor , a landscaper and a fish cannery worker .
He leaves an ex-wife in Iowa .
He says he has been deported 20 times .
After deportation , migrants are determined to return SANTA TECLA , El Salvador 
When Oscar Ordoñez , 56 , pleaded guilty to attempted theft in Colorado , he did n't realize he could lose his right to live in the USA .
Now he sits on his sister 's balcony overlooking the green Salvadoran hills , dreaming of the life he left behind and plotting his illegal return .
Estella Lemus , 27 , cries as she describes the hunger , danger and injuries of her illegal border crossing and says she wo n't do it again .
The seamstress , who earns up to $ 5 a day in her poor neighborhood north of San Salvador , worries about how she 'll repay the $ 3,000 her family borrowed for her trip .
Nearby , Pedro Berrios , 25 , reads to his 5 - year - old son in their cinder - block home next to the filthy Tomayate River .
Berrios will keep trying to enter the USA illegally , he says , because " I do n't see another way out of here . "
The lives of Ordoñez , Lemus and Berrios converged on Feb. 28 when they boarded a plane in Texas with 116 other men and women .
They were being deported to El Salvador , targets of the U.S. government 's crackdown on illegal immigrants .
Immigration and Customs Enforcement ( ICE ) has been raiding job sites , renewing its efforts to track down illegal immigrants with criminal records and stepping up deportations .
Last year , a record 282,548 illegal immigrants were sent home , more than double the number in 2001 .
The government limits legal immigration to roughly 1 million people each year , giving preference to relatives of U.S. citizens .
On top of that , it admits 800,000 or more people on temporary work visas .
Those limits mean immigrants such as Ordoñez , Lemus and Berrios take their chances and try to cross illegally , sometimes again and again .
The government ramped up deportations after 9/11 as part of a broad effort to secure U.S. borders .
Yet , as the Salvadorans ' stories show , the policy is up against the economic reality of life in developing countries .
The three say they went to the USA to escape poverty and crime .
Now that the deportation flight has left them back in their homeland , they say the same things may spur them to try again .
" I do n't want to stay here , " Ordoñez says .
" In the U.S. , you have a chance to work and buy whatever you need . "
Charles Kuck , president - elect of the American Immigration Lawyers Association , says illegal immigrants such as Ordoñez wo n't stay in their homelands .
" They have no reason to stay , " he says .
" Regardless of how hard it is to make it here as an immigrant , it is still better than being back home . "
Kuck says Congress should allow more people to enter legally .
Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff , who oversees ICE , advocates expanding temporary worker programs .
" Many of these people would be happy to work and go home again , " he says .
" It would satisfy our economic needs and be humane and law - abiding . "
But for now , Chertoff says , his department has no choice .
" When we find somebody who 's here illegally , we deport them , " he says .
" To fail to do that essentially would be turning a blind eye to a violation of the law . "
Chertoff says he knows most people who enter the country illegally come to work and many are fleeing difficult circumstances .
" But I ca n't condone their violation of the law , " he says .
" However heart - wrenching the motive is , it is still a violation of the law to sneak in . " 72,000 deported by plane ICE deports illegal immigrants by land and air .
Most Mexican deportees are bused across the border .
Others are sent home on commercial flights or government charters .
Last year , nearly 72,000 illegal immigrants were deported by plane .
" For many of them , it 's the first time they 've ever been on an airplane , " says Michael Pitts , chief of the ICE Flight Operations Unit .
Flying its nine planes will cost ICE $ 135 million this year , up from about $ 100 million last year .
" We 're really serious about enforcing immigration laws and securing our borders , " ICE spokeswoman Kelly Nantel says .
On the last Thursday morning of February , three buses roll up to a Boeing 737 in Harlingen , Texas .
One by one , 38 women and 81 men step off the buses , hands behind their heads , laces removed from their shoes and belts from their pants so they can't be used as weapons .
ICE officials frisk them and check their shoes and mouths for drugs and weapons .
Although one of ICE 's highest priorities is deporting people with felony records , most of these people had no criminal convictions .
Most were caught in Texas trying to enter illegally and 23 had been in the USA before , Nantel says .
The flight , less than three hours , is quiet .
The passengers eat sandwiches and get up , with supervision , for bathroom breaks .
The plane lands at the San Salvador airport at about 11 a.m .
One man steps into the tropical air , throws his arms out wide and yells " Home ! " in English .
Economic , public safety effects
The deportees are funneled into a processing center at the airport , offered tetanus shots and given a traditional Salvadoran meal of pupusas , stuffed corn tortillas .
After being interviewed , photographed and fingerprinted , they 're given up to $ 6 for bus fare and are free to go .
The rising flow of people deported from the USA has had a dramatic effect on the economy and public safety of this Central American country of about 7 million people .
Nearly 20,000 Salvadorans were sent home last year , up from about 11,500 in 2006 .
" The capacity of the United States to catch people who are undocumented in the country or who have committed crimes has increased , " says Rene León , El Salvador 's ambassador to the USA .
There are about 2 million Salvadorans in the USA , he says .
Three - quarters are in the country legally , he estimates .
Last year , Salvadorans working abroad , most in the USA , sent $ 3.69 billion home , equal to about 18 % of El Salvador 's gross domestic product , the central bank reported .
Rising deportations " will affect employment here , " immigration official Balbino Velásquez says .
" It will affect the economy . "
Salvadorans who no longer receive monthly wires of money from relatives in the USA have less to spend , and returning immigrants have trouble finding jobs , he says .
The tide of deportees also affects public safety .
Nearly one quarter of the immigrants deported to El Salvador last year had criminal records in the USA , from theft and drug possession to violent crime .
León says there 's a " positive , clear - cut correlation " between the rise in criminal deportees and a rise in crime in El Salvador .
Of particular concern are gangs and organized crime networks , he says .
Bob Dane , spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform , which advocates more border security and less immigration , applauds the aggressive deportation of immigrants with criminal records .
" Countries can't expect to export their criminals without us sending them back , " he says .
" America ca n't be a sanctuary for the world 's bad guys . "
Jose Castaneda , 34 , was sent back to El Salvador last April after getting out of jail .
He had joined his mother in Los Angeles when he was 13 .
He became a legal permanent resident but lost that status after he was convicted of possessing crystal meth .
" When I got here last year , I was lost , " he says .
" I 'm from here , but I was raised in the USA . "
Castaneda lives with his aunt in the picturesque town of Ataco and earns $ 3 a day unloading trucks .
He left behind four children and a girlfriend in Las Vegas .
" I 'm going to have to go back , " he says .
" That 's where my family is . " ' I do n't have a choice '
About half of Salvadoran deportees lived in the USA more than five years , says Jesús Aguilar , head of CARECEN International in El Salvador , which advocates for migrants .
Aguilar believes most deportees try to return to the USA because jobs at home are scarce and many left family behind .
But the stakes are high .
An illegal immigrant who has been deported before risks a felony conviction and up to 20 years in prison if caught .
Ordoñez , who lived in the USA more than 18 years , is n't giving up .
" My life is not here , " he says of El Salvador .
" My life is there . "
Ordoñez finished the sixth grade and started working at age 12 .
In his early 30s , he went to the USA for the first time and was caught three days later , kicking off a cycle of illegal entries and run-ins with the Border Patrol .
He says he was sent home 18 times , but government records show he was officially deported just once .
What tenacity could n't do for him , marriage did .
Ordoñez met Jean Gibson , an American who helped Salvadorans fleeing civil war .
When he returned to El Salvador in 1987 , she followed and they married .
He got a waiver to immigrate the next year and became a legal permanent resident .
His immigration troubles began not when the couple divorced in 1994 but when he was convicted of a felony in Colorado .
Ordoñez was working as a janitor at a Cripple Creek casino .
In 1996 , his landlords accused him of stealing two rings and other items .
He says he did n't steal the jewelry but that his landlady gave it to him to sell .
Acting on what he says was bad advice from a public defender who did n't advise him of the consequences to his immigration status , Ordoñez pleaded guilty in 2002 to attempted theft .
An attorney helped Ordoñez get the case dismissed and the felony erased from his record in 2005 , but it was too late .
He lost his legal status and returned to El Salvador to live with his sister in Santa Tecla .
He did n't stay long .
Last year , he was caught twice trying to cross the border .
He spent four months in jail .
Despite the threat of a longer sentence if he 's caught again , he says he 'll return .
He wants to earn money for his family in Santa Tecla .
" I do n't have a choice , " Ordoñez says .
" Right now , I do n't have a life in this country . "
A family 's dream Desperate circumstances prompted Lemus to head for the USA .
Her father , Jorge Hernandez , 50 , needs a $ 1,200 operation to remove a tumor from his groin .
Her mother , Maria Reyna Lemus , 48 , has diabetes and needs insulin .
At 14 , Lemus began working as a seamstress in her parents ' home in Apopa , which has no running water and at times is a haven for roosters .
On good days , she says , she earned $ 5 .
She wanted to stay in school , she says , but did n't have the money for books and supplies .
Her younger brother , 24 , went to the USA two years ago to escape neighborhood gang violence that once took 11 lives in two months , she says .
Lemus ' decision to strike out alone on Jan. 25 was part of her family 's dream .
She planned to find work , send money home regularly and return after a few years .
" Some Salvadoran families see the United States as their only option for survival , " her father says .
" Once Estella made it to the other side , everybody was going to be better off . "
Lemus crossed through Guatemala and Mexico on foot , by bus and by hitching rides .
Just south of the U.S. border , she found a smuggler taking a group of migrants to Houston .
She paid him $ 4,000 : $ 1,000 from her boyfriend , and $ 3,000 her family borrowed on their house at 20 % interest .
She recounts a harrowing trip :
She walked for days without food .
She slept in temperatures so cold her hair froze .
She drank from cow troughs .
She has scars from horsefly bites , thorns and wire fences .
A woman in the group nearly drowned crossing the Rio Grande .
The Border Patrol caught her near Falfurrias , Texas , on Feb .
8 . Lemus says it all soured her on going to the USA illegally .
" I do n't want to take my chances again on the trip , but I might change my mind down the road because of this mortgage , " she says through a translator .
" If they take away the house , where will we live ? "
Motivation remains strong Berrios , Lemus ' neighbor , says he has mounting debts .
Because visas are too difficult to get , he says , he 'll keep trying to sneak into the USA .
A construction worker who was on the same deportation flight , Berrios can make $ 20 a day , but sometimes he goes months without work .
" Look at the reality of our house and how we live , " he says of his crime - infested neighborhood and unfinished home , which overlooks a river whose polluted water runs purple , red and brown .
When family members go to the grocery , he says , they run to minimize chances of being robbed .
For now , the home 's windows are boarded with plywood , and the walls and floors are bare , but Berrios says he dreams of making it a beautiful sanctuary for his family : girlfriend Luz Cardenas , 31 ; her daughters Stefany , 12 , and Katherine , 9 ; and their son , Anthony , 5 .
In January , his mother took a $ 7,000 mortgage on her house to finance his trip to join four brothers and a sister in the San Francisco Bay Area .
He was caught in Texas .
" I 'll try again because I have no other way to pay back the money , " he says through a translator .
Berrios says he does n't want to stay in the USA .
He wants to earn money for his family and return to El Salvador to open a business .
He 's unapologetic about his plans .
He says people like him just want to give their families a chance to rise out of poverty .
As he surveys his threadbare home , Berrios says he 's missing a key ingredient for happiness : " I have love and health , but I 'm missing money . …
That 's what 's motivating me to try to cross again . "
Pedro Berrios , at home in Apopa , El Salvador , with his 5 - year - old son , Anthony , says he will keep trying to enter the USA illegally .

According to the ( conservative Christian ) American Center of Law and Justice , Gina — a student at Suffolk County Community College — was wronged by her professor before the ACLJ made things right .
Gina had a 3.9 GPA and was initially doing fine in her philosophy class … until the subject of God ’s existence came up .
Gina read the assigned materials and participated in class discussions , presenting traditional philosophical arguments on whether God exists and whether He possesses certain characteristics such as being all - knowing or all - good .
However , Gina was unwilling to state that she would reconsider her personal religious beliefs on God ’s nature and existence , and her grades suffered as a result .
The ACLJ states that professor Philip Pecorino “ has stated that it is his job to get students to reject a belief in a sacred or unquestionable ‘ truth ’ in favor of the ‘ rational ’ view that science , logic , and philosophy are the only reliable sources of ‘ truth . ' ”
Gina thought she was going to get a D or F in the class because of her faith .
The ACLJ states that after they complained to the school , Gina received the grade she actually earned — a B .
Now , they are claiming “ victory ” — one they will surely cite in their efforts to get donations .
Now , let ’s hear from the other side …
A press release from the Center for Inquiry pulls no punches .
The ACLJ ’s story is untrue , says CFI .
“ The ACLJ ’s spurious claim of a legal ‘ victory ’ is just slightly less outrageous than its brazen attempt to intimidate a philosophy professor from doing his job — which is to get students to think critically , ” commented Ronald A. Lindsay , Executive Director of the Council for Secular Humanism , who has talked to the allegedly biased professor .
“ As far as I can tell , ” observed Lindsay , “ the ACLJ ’s letter accomplished nothing other than providing an excuse for soliciting donations . ”
Dr. Pecorino taught over 13,000 students over thirty - six years , students who were both religious and non-religious .
He “ has a well - deserved reputation for fairness . ”
After the school received the letter from ACLJ , the professor ’s own students began to fight back :
Indeed , after the ACLJ made its baseless accusations , students in Pecorino ’s class , including religious students , defended him , stating that he does not pass judgment on students because of their beliefs , but simply challenges them to examine all beliefs critically , including their own .
His students have stated that they cannot identify Pecorino ’s own views based either on the course materials or the textbook authored for the class by Pecorino , and he does not pressure them to adopt any particular position .
What does the professor himself have to say about all this ?
“ I would not be doing my job as a philosophy professor , ” explained Pecorino , “ if I did not require students to think about their beliefs and provide reasons in support of their beliefs — not my beliefs or anyone else ’s beliefs .
Critical examination of beliefs , including one ’s own beliefs , and training in reasoning are among the primary objectives of a philosophy course , and of a liberal education in general .
Only professors who are negligent or indifferent allow students to earn good grades simply by providing as a reason for an assertion ‘ well , this is what I believe ’ . ”
He wo n’t talk about his interaction with Gina in particular because he deems it inappropriate to discuss a student ’s work with the public .
However he does say the whole case is “ preposterous . ”
I love the explanation of why Gina — along with her classmates — was indeed failing at one point in the class :
“ At no time did I tell her she was in danger of failing .
When I had to project a grade for her earlier in the semester , I projected a ‘ C ’ and that was when she was most resistant to providing any reasoning to support her assertions .
She was not open to examining her own beliefs or to entering into the dialectical process of inquiry in community because , according to her , she already had all the answers . ”
And what of the ACLJ ’s claim that Gina had a failing grade average of 54 prior to the ACLJ ’s intervention ?
“ That is a misleading use of information .
I use a cumulative point system in grading , ” explained Pecorino .
“ In other words , as students progress during the semester , they earn points for each assignment , with a possible total of 100 points by the end of the semester .
Gina at one point probably did have 54 points , but that in no way indicates she was in danger of failing .
She had 54 points , not a failing grade average of 54 .
All students start the semester with 0 points , so by the ACLJ ’s logic , all students are in danger of failing . ”
He adds that when his college received the ACLJ ’s letter , he only received support from colleagues and the administration .
So is this a minor case or does it have far - reaching implications ?
Pecorino says :
“ Essentially , the ACLJ is claiming a religious exemption from the obligation of students in public colleges to engage in critical thinking , and this claim strikes at the core of higher education .
If permitted to go unchallenged , this claim will weaken our democratic and pluralistic society . ”
Amazing how a student can hide behind religion and a religious “ watchdog ” group when she ’s not willing to examine her own beliefs in a class that requires students to examine their own beliefs .
Even more amazing is how this story gets spun for an uncritical religious audience — one that will most likely never be told what the professor has to say about it nor will they try to find out for themselves .

セキュリティホールmemoにまとめられているように、レンタルサーバのさくらインターネットのLAN上で、ARP
spoofing攻撃が発生したのではないかとの疑いが浮上している。しかし、現時点でさくらインターネットは公式にそれを認めておらず、誰も確かな情報として伝えることができない状態にある。
昨今 、Webサイトのコンテンツを改竄されて、ウイルスファイルへのインラインリンクを埋め込まれる手口の被害が多発しており、その際、Webサイトを改竄されたサイト運営者は、サイトを訪れた一般利用者に対してウイルス感染に注意を呼びかける告知を出すというのが、慣例になりつつある。これは、サイト運営者がサイト管理の不備を詫びる意味も含めて、行われている発表であろう。
しかし、ARP spoofingによる「改竄」は、Webサイトのコンテンツが改竄されるわけではない。これは、通信路上での通信データの改竄の一種である。
元々、SSLの必要性が語られるときによく言われるように、インターネットでは通信路上で通信データを盗聴されたり改竄されたりする危険がある。通信路上のどのあたりで盗聴や改竄が行われるかは、いろいろなケースがあるだろうが、危ういのは通信の端点に近いところであろう。
図のA、B、E、Gの矢印は、通信路上の攻撃され得る場所を表す。Gはブラウザ利用者の最も近いところで攻撃されるケースを表しており、たとえば、公衆無線LANやホテルのインターネット接続サービスを利用しているときに、偽アクセスポイントに繋いでしまったり、ホテルの他の部屋から攻撃を受けるケースなどが該当する。この場合、改竄の影響を受けるのは図中の「ブラウザ」のユーザだけとなる。
図のC、D、Fの矢印は、「サーバ」の内容を閲覧する他のユーザに向かう通信の分岐点を表している。「ブラウザ」のユーザは、Fのユーザと比較的長い経路を共有する（同じ経路を使う）が、Cのユーザとは共有している経路が短いことを表している。
レンタルサーバ事業者内ネットワークでのARP
spoofingは、Aのポイントでの攻撃である。その影響は、「ブラウザ」のユーザだけでなく、C、D、Fのユーザにも同様に波及し得る。どこから見てもWebページが改竄されているように見えることから、Webサイト運営者が「お詫び」を発表せざるを得なくなることがあるかもしれない。
しかし、Gのポイントで攻撃が行われたときに、Webサイト運営者が「お詫び」を発表するということはないだろう。この場合、信頼性の低い接続で、https://
でないページを閲覧した「ブラウザ」ユーザにも責任がある。
ならば、Eのポイントで攻撃が行われたときはどうなのか。何割かの多数の人々に影響を及ぼしたとき、サイト運営者が「お詫び」を発表しなくてはいけないのだろうか？
サイト運営者には何の過失もないのに？ なら、Bのポイントで攻撃されたときはどうなのか？
そもそもインターネットとはそんなものなのだから、SSLの必要性が説かれる。盗聴されて困る情報を送信したり閲覧するときは、ユーザ自身が
https:// のページであることを確認して使う。
しかしすべて のWebページ が https:// で提供されているわけではない。通信路上で盗聴されたり改竄されても「まあ、いいだろう」というサービスではそのような判断がなされている。
そうすると、通信路上で < iframe >などでウイルスファイルへのインラインリンクを埋め込まれる可能性があることを、放置してよいのかということになる。もし、「放置してはならない」とする考え方を選択するなら、すべてのWebサイトはSSLを用い、すべてのページを
https:// で提供しなければならないことになる。それは現実的でないだろう。
じつのところ、ウイルスファイルへのインラインリンクを埋め込まれることは、さして重大なことではない。なぜなら、ウイルスファイルへのインラインリンクが埋め込まれていても、Webブラウザ側に脆弱性がないならば、ウイルスが起動することはなく、無問題だからだ。
それなのに 、Webサイトのコンテンツを改竄された企業が「お詫び」を発表するのが慣例になりつつあるのは、ウイルスのことというよりも、サーバの管理に不備があって侵入を許したこと自体が重大であるからであるはずだ。同じ原因によって個人情報の漏洩等も生じ得る状態にあったのではないかという点から、サイト運営者に責任が問われている。
それに対比すれば、ARP spoofing によって通信路上の改竄でHTMLを差し替えられる被害に遭ったWebサイト運営者に対して「お詫びを出さなければならない」とする世論があるとしたら、それはおかしいのではないか。

( CNN ) -- Despite an overwhelming defeat in North Carolina and a narrow victory in Indiana , Sen .
Hillary Clinton vowed to stay in the race until her party has a nominee .
" I , obviously , am going to work as hard as I can to become that nominee .
That is what I 've done ; that 's what I 'm continuing to do , " she said Wednesday in Shepherdstown , West Virginia .
The focus of the Democratic race now turns to the superdelegates , because they outnumber the remaining pledged delegates .
Neither Sen. Barack Obama nor Clinton is expected to win the 2,025 delegates needed to capture the nomination during the remaining contests .
That means the superdelegates -- party and elected officials who are allowed to vote during the national convention -- will probably decide who becomes the nominee .
Obama is ahead of Clinton in total delegates : 1,842 to 1,686 .
Watch how the numbers work against Clinton »
Clinton narrowly leads Obama in superdelegates who have publicized whom they are voting for .
But the superdelegates are beginning to head to Obama 's corner , said David Gergen , a CNN political analyst .
" The superdelegates are starting to move .
The dam is breaking , " Gergen said .
" No matter what happens in these primaries , it 's much less important than the fact that the superdelegates are starting to swing his way , and that , in turn , will try to put pressure on her . "
' The Situation Room ' Sen. Barack Obama talks to Wolf Blitzer on CNN's " The Situation Room . "
Today , 4 p.m. ET see full schedule »
Obama 's campaign announced four new superdelegates for the Illinois senator on Wednesday , compared with one coming out for Clinton .
Only 217 pledged delegates are up for grabs in the remaining six contests : West Virginia , Kentucky , Oregon , Puerto Rico , Montana and South Dakota .
Obama chief strategist David Axelrod said that during the six contests remaining , his candidate and Clinton will " probably end up roughly splitting the remaining delegates . "
" There 's more superdelegates uncommitted right now than there are remaining pledged delegates , " Axelrod noted .
" We feel by May 20 , we will have secured a majority of the delegates .
So , I think we 're in a very strong position here . "
Clinton met with Democratic Party officials on Wednesday and undecided members of Congress on Tuesday afternoon to make her case for the nomination and press for a resolution to seating the delegations of Florida and Michigan .
Meanwhile , House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the race was not over .
She has repeatedly said she remains neutral in the Democrats ' nomination battle but said Clinton 's slim margin of victory in Indiana does n't mean her campaign was finished .
" A win is a win .
Let 's just call it what it is , " Pelosi said , adding that a protracted Democratic fight for the nomination is n't going to hurt the party .
" I believe the races must continue , " she said .
" The people should all have the opportunity to speak as long as two candidates wish to compete in those primaries and caucuses .
In a few weeks , we will be on our way to nominating the next president of the United States . "
Clinton needs to convince superdelegates that she'd be a better matchup against Sen.
John McCain , the presumptive GOP nominee .
Watch Clinton vow to fight on »
" I believe that I 'm the stronger candidate against Sen. McCain , and I believe I would be the best president among the three of us running .
So , we will continue to contest these elections and move forward , " she said Wednesday .
Sen . Dianne Feinstein , a key supporter of Clinton 's White House bid , said Wednesday that the drawn - out race for the Democratic presidential nomination is producing " negative dividends in terms of strife within the party . "
Feinstein , D - California , said she wants to talk to Clinton to " see what her view is on the rest of the race , what the strategy is . "
Obama pulled out a 14 - point win in North Carolina on Tuesday , and Clinton barely took Indiana , winning by 2 points .
Tuesday was Clinton 's last major opportunity to significantly cut into Obama 's lead in the delegate count .
The 187 delegates at stake were awarded proportionally , meaning Obama padded his lead while Clinton slipped further behind .
In Obama 's speech Tuesday night , he looked ahead to the general election , mentioning Clinton only to congratulate her on Indiana and avoiding all talk of recent campaign controversies .
Obama disagreed with the idea that his party is " inalterably divided . "
Watch Obama call for party unity after winning North Carolina »
" This fall we intend to march forward as one Democratic Party , united by a common vision for this country .
Because we all agree that at this defining moment in history -- a moment when we 're facing two wars , an economy in turmoil , a planet in peril -- we can't afford to give John McCain the chance to serve out George Bush 's third term .
We need change in America , " he said .
The New York senator 's campaign is staying optimistic , despite countless headlines that have all but crowned Obama the nominee .
Her senior campaign advisers insisted Wednesday that her loss in North Carolina , a razor - thin victory in Indiana and the revelation she had lent her campaign another $ 6 million over the past month -- for a total of more than $ 11 million since the primary season began --­ all represented positive developments for her White House run .
Contrast that to Pennsylvania , when the campaign was giving hourly updates­ eventually claiming a staggering $ 10 million haul in a 24 - hour period .
Clinton 's image took another hit Wednesday when one of Clinton 's most prominent backers , former Sen. George McGovern , switched his support to Obama .
The 1972 Democratic presidential nominee said he urged Clinton to drop out of the race , saying it was virtually impossible for her to win the nomination .
" It certainly was not out of any less respect for Sen. Clinton , " McGovern said .
" I think she has waged a really courageous and valiant campaign .
She will have my affection and admiration for all of my days . "
" But I think , mathematically , the race is all but won by Barack Obama , and the time has come for all of us to unite and get ready for the general election in the fall , " he said .
CNN 's Ted Barrett contributed to this report .
All About U.S. Presidential Election • Hillary Clinton • Barack Obama
Attorneys for Sirius and XM satellite radio took off the gloves on Friday , sending the Federal Communications Commission a twenty - page screed against the " Consumer Coalition for Competition in Satellite Radio " ( C3SR ) that all but calls the group a pack of liars .
" As the Commission is aware , the Consumer Coalition for Competition in Satellite Radio in actuality is a handful of law students , funded by the National Association of Broadcasters , " Sirius / XM 's Friday statement warns .
Attorneys for the two satellite radio companies call C3SR the " NAB Coalition " throughout their filing and describe the group 's charges as " just another salvo in the National Association of Broadcasters ' long campaign to prevent the merger of Sirius and XM and forestall the creation of a stronger competitor for terrestrial radio . "
C3SR 's accusations are " replete with misstatements of law and false allegations , " XM and Sirius say .
Actually , the two merger candidates do n't have any evidence that C3SR is financially backed by the NAB — although it certainly does appear to be funded by some shady , deep pocketed entity that desperately wants the proposed merger to die , die , die .
Sirius / XM's " evidence " for the NAB funding charge comes from a February 2007 piece in the Corporate Crime Reporter that demonstrates links to the NAB , but no solid trail to money .
But Friday 's Sirius / XM filing responds more fundamentally to the widely - wielded charge that Sirius and XM broke a promise to the FCC , a pledge to build interoperable satellite radio receivers which can access both services .
Whether you think this is true or not may boil down to your interpretation of the word " design . "
Not another inconvenient truth ?
C3SR insists that Sirius and XM blew off " the interoperable receiver requirements in each company 's license , " as the group put it in a May 27th filing .
They deceived the Commission and the public , C3SR charges , and should be " disgorged of their unjust enrichment " to the tune of millions of dollars .
Did Sirius and XM willfully ignore the FCC 's interoperability dictates regarding their licenses ?
True enough , the FCC's 1997 Order authorizing the satellite Digital Audio Radio satellite Service ( DARS ) declared that all licensees " are required to design a receiver which would accommodate all satellite DARS providers [ italics added ] . "
From this language , C3SR extrapolates that the FCC's " clear intent in imposing the condition was to make interoperable receivers commercially available to satellite radio consumers , a fact that the Merger Parties [ XM and Sirius ] appear to have understood . "
But Sirius and XM do n't see it that way .
They insist that the agency required that they design an interoperable system , but neither went any further .
" The NAB Coalition blatantly ignores the inconvenient truth , " Sirius and XM write , borrowing a little flourish from our beloved ex-Vice President .
" In its implementing rules for the satellite radio service , the FCC required all satellite radio licensees to develop designs for an interoperable radio and to certify that they had done so .
Sirius and XM have fully complied with this requirement . "
Sirius / XM 's lawyers say that the firms have not taken the " ultimate step of bringing interoperable radios to market " because ( take a deep breath here ) " it would not make economic sense for them to do so , since they ordinarily subsidize the production of their radios and would not be assured of recouping these subsidies for interoperable radios through subscription fees . "
In other words , we designed the interoperable radios ; we just do n't want to manufacture them because that would cost us money .
The flexibility you need to do nothing
Who is right here ?
Unfortunately , it appears that the legalistic answer is everyone , thanks to the FCC 's bumbling original March 3rd , 1997 Order establishing a satellite radio service .
When the FCC first issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking for DARS , the agency explained ( take an even deeper breath ) ...
" We indicated our concern that licensing diverse satellite DARS systems could increase the cost of manufacturing a receiver that is compatible with all competing satellite DARS technologies and terrestrial formats .
We therefore proposed that each applicant demonstrate that its satellite DARS system is capable of remotely tuning its individual mobile , fixed , and / or portable receivers across the allocated bandwidth 2310 - 2360 MHz .
This rule would have been necessary if we were to license more than one band segment to a particular satellite DARS licensee , ( whether as an interim assignment or in the event that a license is dismissed and the spectrum is re-divided pro-rata ) but in view of our conclusion to license only two satellite DARS systems through competitive bidding , and not to permit interim frequency assignments , such a provision is no longer required .
We adopt , however , the principle behind our proposed rule that satellite DARS licensees are required to design a receiver which would accommodate all satellite DARS providers .
By promoting receiver inter-operability for satellite DARS , we are encouraging consumer investment in satellite DARS equipment and creating the economies of scale necessary to make satellite DARS receiving equipment affordable .
This rule also will promote competition by reducing transaction costs and enhancing consumers ' ability to switch between competing DARS providers .
We decline to adopt a specific standard for satellite DARS receiver designs , though .
This will allow licensees the flexibility to determine the most cost effective way to meet our receiver - interoperability requirements . "
I added italics to those two passages .
After stumbling through this paragraph about three or four times , you might well ask why , if the FCC declined to require tuning capability across the 2310 - 2360 MHz bandwidth , it still wanted to enhance " consumers ' ability to switch between competing DARS providers " ?
How were consumers supposed to do this without accessing the whole satellite radio bandwidth ?
And how do you adopt the principle of interoperability without the rule ?
It is uncertain ( at least to me ) whether the FCC 's original Order actually requires satellite radio receiver interoperability in practice as well as design .
But clearly the agency created language that any competent prevaricator can tune to his or her own purposes .
At this point , a year and a half into this proceeding , all productive arguments for and against the proposed merger of XM and Sirius satellite radio have been made .
All that is left to do , short of the FCC actually deciding the question , is for adversaries to parse vocabulary .
Democrat Barack Obama said yesterday he would bring Osama bin Laden to justice in a way that would n't allow the Sept. 11 mastermind to become a martyr .
At a Washington news conference after huddling for the first time with a newly formed group of national security advisers , he acknowledged that bin Laden might not be taken alive , but suggested that if he is , the Nazi war crime trials at Nuremberg after World War II would be a good model .
" I think what would be important would be for us to do it in a way that allows the entire world to understand the murderous acts that he 's engaged in and not to make him into a martyr and to assure that the United States government is abiding by the basic conventions that would strengthen our hand in the broader battle against terrorism , " he said .
The advisers could end up in high posts if Obama is elected , as secretaries of defense or state , national security advisers , even a running mate .
The panel includes Eric Holder , a former deputy attorney general who is also helping Obama vet running mates ; and Sam Nunn , a former senator and chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee , and someone who could be on Obama 's list for vice president .
The group also includes his existing advisers , plus three former high - ranking officials in Bill Clinton 's administration who advised Hillary Clinton during the primaries : Madeleine Albright and Warren Christopher - both former secretaries of state - and William Perry , a former secretary of defense .
The Republican National Committee pointed out again that Obama has n't been to Iraq for 892 days and counting , though he has pledged to tour the war - torn country before November .
" Taking pictures and shaking hands with a few hand - picked advisers is no substitute for a real briefing or a real understanding of how to keep Americans safe , " an RNC spokeswoman said .

McCain calls for building nuclear , clean coal plants
Republican John McCain called yesterday for the construction of 45 nuclear reactors by 2030 and pledged $ 2 billion a year in federal funds " to make clean coal a reality , " measures designed to reduce the United States ' dependence on foreign oil .
Continuing to campaign on the energy issue , McCain said the 104 nuclear reactors operating around the country produce about 20 percent of the nation 's annual electricity needs .
" Every year , these reactors alone spare the atmosphere from the equivalent of nearly all auto emissions in America .
Yet for all these benefits , we have not broken ground on a single nuclear plant in over 30 years , " he said .
" And our manufacturing base to even construct these plants is almost gone .
We will need to recover all the knowledge and skills that have been lost over three stagnant decades in a highly technical field . "
McCain did not say what steps , if any , he would propose to ease the permitting process for nuclear plants .
Nor did he say how he would dispose of the waste , other than to say " we will need to solve complex problems of moving and storing materials that will always need safeguarding . "

Obama leading McCain in key states , poll suggests
For the first time , Barack Obama leads John McCain in all three key swing states of Florida , Ohio , and Pennsylvania , according to polls released yesterday .
The Quinnipiac University surveys suggest strong backing from blacks , women , and younger voters has pushed Obama into the lead .
Obama has a 47 percent to 43 percent lead in Florida ; a 48 percent to 42 percent edge in Ohio ; and a 52 percent to 40 percent lead in Pennsylvania .
In the three states , Obama leads McCain by 10 to 23 percentage points among women , although the candidates are even among men .
Obama trails among white voters in Florida and Ohio , but gets more than 90 percent of black voters in each state , the polls said .
He also has double - digit leads among young voters in each state .
Researchers noted that no one has been elected president since 1960 without winning at least two of the three big states , which together hold 68 of the 270 electoral votes needed .
The polls were conducted from June 9 to June 16 in each state , and had a margin of error of 2.6 percentage points in Florida and Ohio , and 2.5 percentage points in Pennsylvania .

Our Ratings : Durability 80 % Quality 70 % Value 70 % Check Price on Amazon
The Design Element Moscony is not the cheapest vanity you can find on the market , however , if we combine its sleek yet durable design and the fact that it is made of a solid wood , I think that the price says a lot regarding what can you expect from having such a magnificent vanity in your bathroom .
Design
The Design Element Moscony is available in 4 different sizes and in two color editions , such as the 48 ″ version , 60 ″ ( which we are currently reviewing ) , 72 ″ , 84 ″ and the espresso and white color finish respectively .
In this article , I will be focused more on the espresso finish , but that does n’t mean that you should n’t switch if you prefer different size or color , since this unit can satisfy the taste and the needs even of the most demanding customers on the market !
This particular model is made of a solid hardwood and has a semi-gloss espresso finish which took my attention instantly , but you can also notice the presence of the 2 pull - out drawers which have a satin nickel finish hardware and the 3 soft - closing cabinets .
Each compartment is spacious enough to keep your stuff in place , and to be honest , the manufacturer has succeeded to craft a vanity with multiple compartment that does not look redundant , but instead , it looks minimalist and beautiful .

Furthermore , the package does not contain faucets , so feel free to see the faucets I ’ve listed in this site .
If you prefer different faucets from the ones listed , then just choose whichever you find the most visually pleasing .
Last but not least , if you face difficulties in terms of installation , I ’d suggest you hire a professional that can do everything for you , but still , I think it wo n’t be necessary .
Maintenance and Cost - Efficiency
The Design Element Moscony is incredibly easy to maintain mainly because of the material used throughout the crafting process .
Namely , its rectangular porcelain sink can be cleared from dirt in under a minute along with its quartz countertop .
On the other hand , the cabinet which is made of a hardwood can be easily cleaned as well , so when we combine all these things into one , the chances that you will put a significant effort are literally 0 .
When it comes to the cost - efficiency , well , the Moscony is n’t the most affordable vanity that you can get , however , I still think that the investment is worthy , so , I will leave this up to you to decide whether it is cost - efficient or not .
I ’d consider this to be one of the best bathroom vanities out there .
Pros Spacious

60 ″ ( which I ’m currently reviewing ) , 72 ″ and in 5 additional colors including Dove Grey , Espresso , White , Midnight Blue and Saddle Brown , so from the very beginning , you already have enough options to choose from and get the one that matches your tastes !
For your information , the one I ’m currently reviewing is Dove Gray - colored which measures 60 x 21 x 34.5 - inches , weighs approximately 207 pounds , however , do not hesitate to choose a different model because you can’t lose anything , since all of them look beautiful .
Moving on , the manufacturer has included solid wood , plywood and MDF during the crafting stage , and to be honest , this vanity does look indeed premium !
If you take a closer look at it , you can instantly notice its marble countertop which is surely a great addition due to the fact that it adds a higher level of style and according to most of the users , the marble is durable enough to withstand daily use .
I would also like to express my admiration regarding the body .
To be more precise , I really like the way that the manufacturer divided the body into three parts .
On the far left , you can notice a door with two hinges that will offer you a smooth operation , while slightly above , there is a drawer that also has an easy to operate hinge .
At the center , there are 4 compact drawers which can hold smaller accessories , while on the right , there is a drawer and two doors that can keep bigger stuff without any problem .
What got my attention the most regarding the drawers is that they are unbelievably well - organized due to the fact that they are divided into two sections , and each section can hold literally everything you want .
There is even an integrated power bar that can keep your hairdryer and hair iron safely in place , so you should n’t worry literally about anything !

Installation
The Ove Decors Mayacomes with two mirrors and backsplash , and according to those who have already purchased this product , the installation process is extremely easy because each of its parts can be assembled within a very short period of time .
However , I would like to note that the only place where you should be cautious would be having an electrical outlet already installed , so that you may be able to use the integrated power - strip .
Otherwise , the installation is smooth and I think that you can manage everything by yourself .
Maintenance and Cost - Efficiency
This vanity comes with two included mirrors which is surely a great addition , since you wo n’t have to spend an additional amount of money in order to get a mirror .
But , if we compare its price tag , this is n’t a cheap , but an indeed premium vanity so I can’t really say that it is cost - efficient .
In addition , the Ove Decors Maya is easy to maintain mainly because of the fact that its construction is made in that way .
Namely , its rectangular under - mount sink can be cleaned quickly as well as its countertop .
With one word , each of its parts can be reached easily which by default means that the maintenance will be as smooth as possible .

The UR - 103 watches from Urwerk were interesting , but their new 202 Hammerhead Automatic goes a few steps further with a unique winding system regulated by compressed air .
Instead of a traditional rotating vane , the 202 uses miniature twin turbines to control the rate of automatic winding .
Plus , the level of air compression generated by the turbines can actually be controlled using a 3 - position selector switch .

As far as telling time is concerned , the watch utilizes a rather elegant series of rotating hour blocks built around hands that automatically adjust their length to mark the minutes .
That is a hell of a lot of technology to do what any cellphone or bubble gum machine watch can do , but I have to admit that I 'm pretty damn impressed .
No pricing information has been made available , but think expensive thoughts .

Associated Press :
The evangelist forced out of his job after being caught up in a sex scandal involving a male prostitute has left a " spiritual restoration program " and no longer has any ties to the megachurch he founded , the congregation 's new pastor said Sunday .
Under a severance deal that Ted Haggard reached with the church in 2006 , he agreed to leave Colorado Springs and not talk about the scandal publicly .
The deal expired at the end of 2007 .
New pastor Brady Boyd said Haggard was now free to live where he wanted and has returned to Colorado Springs .
Haggard and church officials clashed last summer after Haggard sent an e-mail to a Colorado Springs television station outlining his plans to work as a counselor at a Christian - run halfway house in Phoenix .
The e-mail also solicited financial support .
A four - pastor team of overseers said that those plans were unacceptable and that Haggard would seek secular employment instead .

PRETTY DISGUSTING , makes me want to stop wasting my time with these republican nazi's
, A MUST READ 100 % TRUE ACCOUNT
Hello ,
On Saturday morning , May 10 , 2008 , I attended the District 1 Annual meeting of the Colorado Federation of Republican Women .
Unbeknownst to me , the 2 - hour meeting would end up being an atrocious display of anti-Republican behavior .
In this letter , I will give the details from the meeting that were repugnant .
Before I begin , I feel compelled to state that I could not believe I was in the presence of Liberty - loving people who stood by and were involved in this complicity .
As the Republican National Committee Party Rules state ( in the first paragraph ) , " BE IT RESOLVED , That the Republican Party is the party of the open door .
Ours is the party of liberty , the party of equality of opportunity for all and favoritism for none . "
The headlining speaker was Michael Eddy from the McCain campaign .
I knew something was fishy about this person , as the card attached to each of the 30 - some roses he had delivered to the meeting on behalf of the McCain campaign had , on one side , a personal endorsement to support him as a delegate to the State or CD Assembly / Convention .
Mike spent the last quarter of his speech discussing his knowledge about the " large contingency " of Ron Paul supporters in Colorado .
He said he was fine with electing people who were Romney supporters to be National delegates , but not Ron Paul supporters .
He said delegates should be " loyal " Republicans and Ron Paul supporters are not .
He said we should not elect people as delegates who will get to the National Convention and " light their hair on fire " .
He said Ron Paul supporters would be a disgrace to the Republican Party .
He went on to state that they know that there are about 50 delegates for Ron Paul who will be at the CD 1 Assembly .
He brought up what occurred with another state 's convention and said that the National organization ( RNC ) is working closely with the remaining states ' organizations to ensure Ron Paul delegates do not get elected .
He said the National Committee will be having a conference call with the Colorado State Republican Party Committee on Monday ( 5/12 ) to discuss this .
He further explained that they would accomplish this by changing the Rules prior to the convention and additionally coming up with their own slate .
After Mike spoke , other members in attendance echoed his inflammatory statements about Ron Paul supporters .
Ruth Dolan , president , spoke in agreement with Mike Eddy 's statements , as well as other officers .
One officer warned everyone to be very " prudent " because there are people among us whom are " wolves in sheep 's clothing " .
I recognized other Ron Paul supporters in the room , so I know I was not the only one who left the meeting in complete disgust that Republicans could conspire against other Republicans in such a way .
This is energy that should be directed towards Democrats , not fellow Republicans !
-- Ron Paul supporter incensed by CFRW District 1 Speaker and Officers .
please tell me why im taking 2 days off work and spending my time trying to support the NAZI PARTY .
YES I 'm A REGISTERED REPUBLICAN who likens the republican party to the NAZI PARTY .....
This revolution must move on without the Nazi Party .
We have associated ourselves with Nazi's , we must seperate from these nazi's ASAP or we kill our message because we have the republican name next to us aka NAZI's .
Paul Vick released some statistics in relation to VB , which for discussion sake I ’ll repeat here :
Visual Basic is the # 1 .NET language ( as reported by Forrester Research ) Visual Basic is the # 1 downloaded and # 1 registered Express Edition ( topping the # 2 position by 20 % ) Visual Basic is the # 1 MSDN language dev center and blog in terms of traffic The Visual Basic Team blog is in the top 1 % in readership of all MS bloggers ( I do n’t know where I fall in that since I host independently . )
I think you ’d have to be taking the happy pills to see anything great in those stats , after all they avoid real numbers and they do n’t tell the underlying trend or growth .
Five or so years ago , before .NET formally launched , Microsoft reported VB as being the * MOST * popular language of * ALL * programming languages .
Reports from Forrester backs this up , and this graph from O’Reilly books shows that VB was the most popular titles .
Note in the above graph that VB was as popular as Java at the start of 2003 but has been on a steady decline .
C# on the other hand was showing a slow but steady increase .
Forrester also in mid 2005 released these figures :
Java ’s 66 % penetration is the highest among strategic programming languages for enterprise applications .
Visual Basic 6 ( VB6 ) and C/C++ have nearly as much penetration as Java ,
Visual Basic .NET ( VB.NET ) had 34 % penetration
C# had 15 % penetration
If all VB6 users converted to VB.NET , its share would increase to 70 % .
The last statistic is an interesting one , what it tells us is that VB was the most popular language , and by mid 2005 VB.
NET had managed to attract less than half of those VB had prior to the move to .NET .
More recent statistics are harder to come by .
Anecdotal reports are that book sales of C# related topics are out selling VB at the ratio of 2:1 .
If books are n’t a great indicator of growth trends perhaps jobs are .
Searches at seek.com .au show C# jobs running at 7 jobs per every 3 that specify VB .
There ’s some overlap but that ’s still a greater than 2:1 ratio .
Likewise jobs at monster.com tally up similarly .
Interestingly both also show J2EE about on par with C# and Java slightly higher .
If you combine VB and C# there ’s not much in it compared to Java overall in the job market .
So what of stats from Microsoft ?
Surely Microsoft would have figures and be touting it ’s success ??
Well no , not really .
These cryptic figures
Paul released are all I can find except for anecdotal quotes such as the quote from Joe Stagner that there are more VBers than “ C# folk but the gap is narrowing ” .
So what is it Paul actually is telling us ?
1. Visual Basic is the # 1 .NET language ( as reported by Forrester Research )
Okay so VB has gone from being the most popular language , to being just the most popular on .NET , a relative decline in market share .
And the titanic was still the biggest floating ship right up till the moment it sunk , even when it was taking on water .
To take a language from the most popular of ALL languages , to one of just a subset of languages is a negative trend 🙁
2. Visual Basic is the # 1 downloaded and # 1 registered Express Edition ( topping the # 2 position by 20 % )
That figure alone is to be expected given VB6 was the most popular .
You ’d expect those people to at least try out VB Express unless marketing really screwed up .
Again it tells us nothing about forward trends , just an indication of the past penetration that was there
3. Visual Basic is the # 1 MSDN language dev center and blog in terms of traffic
Again that related heavily to the previous versions of VB .
If you visit the VB MSDN site , that ’s where you also find info on previous versions .
Look at the downloads for VB , and even today the most popular download is Visual Basic 6 .
4 . The Visual Basic Team blog is in the top 1 % in readership of all MS bloggers
There are about 4500 blogs on MSDN , so 1 % is the top 45 blogs .
What that is telling us is that the team blog for VB only rates in the top 45 of blogs for Microsoft ’s Developer Network blogs .
What are the other 44 ?
And what does that tells us ?
That we should all be programming in Scobble ?
I think the sad truth is that VB continues to decline due to market place perception .
VB is in fact a very capable language .
In fact in many ways it is better than C# .
Form a pure technical perspective VB is the best language of the two for working with COM legacy applications .
In 2008 , VB is also the best of the two for working with XML .
C# ’s only technical feature that gives it a real edge is unsafe code .
So why is VB declining while C# is on the rise ?
Microsoft is heavily to blame here .
Although they say you are free to choose what ever language you like , they do n’t do that , they continue to choose C# over VB and the market place knows that .
Given it ’s their platform we are actually coding on , it ’s understandable that we view their developers as leaders .
And they lead towards C# .
Cost and time also figure into it heavily .
Microsoft has sent out a clear message that if you want to work with Windows Live Id , Windows Search , Health Vault , .NET Micro Framework , XNA , then they do n’t view VB as important enough for them to vest any time on , so why should / would you ?
They ’ve made it clear they are going to pigeon hole VB .
Let me give you an example .
Let ’s say today you wanted to incorporate the latest from the Patterns and Practices team .
If you go over to CodePlex , you ’ll find the latest code in C# .
If you want to build your app , but still have the flexibility to make changes , you ’ll need to go with C# .
In fact if you look over at CodePlex , you ’ll find that C# projects outweigh VB at the ratio of about 7 : 1 . And many of those projects are lead by Microsoft employees as part of their day job .
This leading of community projects , the work being done internally around C# all lead to C# developing greater market share as well as improving C# itself as the language gets “ dog- fooded ” more by Microsoft , thus gaining input from some of the world ’s best developers from practical usage of it .
It ’s self feeding .
For Microsoft as a whole , they look at .NET penetration .
The increase in C# at the expense of VB does n’t really matter , it ’s overall market share that does .
Except perhaps for one really telling statistic .
As Forrester said , if all the VB community switched to VB.NET back in 2005 , VB would have had 70 % market penetration .
Given such a huge potential , it has to be negligent to let that slip away , and instead favor a new language because internally more people at Microsoft used C++.
Really , the question should have been was there ever any need for C# given VB ’s huge market share ?
Now the question is beginning to be the opposite .
And so it goes , we should be happy when they tell us how many deck chairs on the titanic , that the ship is unsinkable , yet we see the water line drawing nearer and nearer …….

Researchers say that references to planets and constellations in the Odyssey describe a solar eclipse that occurred in 1178 B.C. , nearly three centuries before Homer is believed to have written the story .
If correct , the finding would suggest that the ancient poet had a surprisingly detailed knowledge of astronomy .
The Odyssey , commonly dated to near 800 B.C. , describes the 10 - year voyage of the Greek general Odysseus to his home on the island of Ithaca after the fall of Troy in approximately 1200 B.C.
Toward the end of the story , a seer named Theoclymenus prophecies the death of a group of suitors competing for the affection of Penelope , the wife of Odysseus , who is believed to be dead .
Theoclymenus delivers his prophecy as the suitors are sitting down for their noontime meal .
He foresees them entering Hades and ends his speech with the statement , " The Sun has been obliterated from the sky , and an unlucky darkness invades the world . "
Odysseus dispatches the suitors not long thereafter .
Greek scholars Plutarch and Heraclitus advanced the idea that Theoclymenus 's speech was a poetic description of an eclipse .
They cited references in the story that the day of the prophecy was a new moon , which would be true of an eclipse .
In the 1920s researchers speculated that Homer might have had a real eclipse in mind , after calculating that a total solar eclipse ( in which the moon blocks out the sun ) would have been visible on April 16 , 1178 B.C. over the Ionian Islands , where Homer 's poem was set .
The idea languished , however , because the first writings on Greek astronomy did not come until centuries later .
Inspired by an incorrect reference to Homer 's alleged eclipse in an astronomy textbook , biophysicists Constantino Baikouzis and Marcelo Magnasco , both at the Rockefeller University , pored over the Odyssey for additional clues .
Sailing back to Ithaca on a raft , Odysseus navigates by monitoring the constellations Pleiades and Bootes , which share the sky twice a year in March and September .
The morning he arrives in Ithaca , Venus rises in the sky before dawn , which happens on about one third of new moons .
But the crucial clue came from a reference to the god Hermes flying west to the island of Ogygia .
The researchers propose the god 's voyage actually refers to the planet Mercury , which hangs low in the sky and reverses course from west to east every 116 days .
Baikouzis and Magnasco used commercial astronomical software to scan all 1,684 new moons between the years 1250 and 1125 B.C. for dates that matched those conditions .
" Even though each event happens individually often , the pattern does n't repeat that often , " Magnasco says — only once every 2,000 years , he and Baikouzis report in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA .
And one of those matches is April 16 , 1178 B.C. Magnasco says that he had a hunch about Hermes , known as Mercury to the Romans , after coming across the idea that the Greeks used the stories of the gods as mnemonic devices to remember astronomical events .
Taking Mercury out of the mix leaves 15 matching dates in the 135 - year search period , he adds .
According to Magnasco , the references imply that Homer chose to set the slaying of the suitors on the day of the eclipse .
( He notes that he has " no clue " whether similar events to those described in the Odyssey actually occurred on that day . )
Sen . Barack Obama won his 11th consecutive primary Thursday when Democrats Abroad announced that he had prevailed in their global primary .
Even a scientist from Antarctica participated .
The Illinois senator and Democratic presidential candidate won 65.6 percent of the expatriate American vote .
Rival Hillary Clinton was supported by less than half that number with 32.7 percent .
This is the first U.S. primary ever to allow voters to pick their candidate online .
About half of the more than 22,000 votes were cast over the internet , says Jody Hedeman Couser , a Democrats Abroad spokeswoman .
Voters were also able to cast their ballots by fax and mail .
But U.S. citizens from 164 countries and territories – for the first time ever in this process – voted for their candidate online .
Voters literally chimed in from the ends of the earth – even all the way from Antarctica .
That voter was Adam Lutchansky , who is an American on a scientific expedition .
" The online Democrats Abroad Global Primary expanded the frontier of voting opportunities , and it works easily , even from the harshest continent on Earth , " Lutchansky said in a statement issued by Democrats Abroad Thursday .
" With the U.S. image so badly damaged by the present administration ,
American Democrats living overseas were eager to have their voices heard , " said Christine Schon Marques , International Chair of Democrats
Abroad in Geneva .
" Across the board we saw an enormous diversity in participation , including many first - time voters . "
The upshot of the global primary : Obama will be allocated an additional 2.5 delegate votes for the Democratic National Convention in August , and Clinton will be allocated two .
Another 2.5 will be determined at an April convention in Vancouver , British Columbia .
Democrats Abroad also hold four votes .
Obama currently leads with 1,319 delegates , 161 of whom are superdelegates , according to numbers compiled by CNN .
Clinton has 1,250 delegates , 234 of whom are superdelegates .
2,025 are needed to win .
Thanks for the tip , Joe !
The guys and gals over at Kieffe & Sons Ford have had enough of people wanting to remove God from our money and the Pledge of Allegiance , and they 're spending valuable advertising dollars to tell Californians all about it .
The brash Ford dealer has been running a commercial since February with the main goal of pissing off secularists , and if all goes right , bringing the rest of the car - buying public to the showroom floor .
The main point of the spot is that 86 out of every 100 U.S. citizens are Christians who believe in God , so " believers " should just tell the other 14 % to " sit down and shut up " .
The commercial then goes on to say that if those 14 % are offended , then that 's too bad because the dealer was asserting its first amendment right .
That 's great , but then why tell others to " sit down and shut up " when they 're simply asserting their first amendment right ?
The saddest part of the commercial is that it appears to be nothing more than a lame attempt to use religion to get Christians to buy Fords .
For the record , Ford corporate can't do anything about the commercials since the dealership is an independent franchise .
Hit the jump to read the transcript of the commercial , and try not to break into a holy war in the comments .
[ Source : Consumerist
Did you know that there are people in this country who want prayer out of schools , " Under God " out of the Pledge , and " In God We Trust " to be taken off our money ?
But did you know that 86 % of Americans say they believe in God ?
Now , since we all know that 86 out of every 100 of us are Christians who believe in God , we at Kieffe & Sons Ford wonder why we do n't just tell the other 14 % to sit down and shut up .
I guess maybe I just offended 14 % of the people who are listening to this message .
Well , if that is the case , then I say that 's tough , this is America folks , it 's called free speech .
And none of us at Kieffe & Sons Ford are afraid to speak up .
Kieffe & Sons Ford on Sierra Highway in Mojave and Rosamond : if we do n't see you today , by the grace of God , we 'll be here tomorrow .

Lectures can be downloaded from an academic iTunes service University College London , the Open University and Trinity College Dublin are putting lectures onto iTunes .
Educational content is already available in the United States through the non-charging " iTunes U " section of the music downloading service .
But European universities are now joining , providing video and audio material for students to use on iPods or computers .
The service will include recordings of lectures from leading academics .
" Our students will be able to revisit materials presented to them in lectures , so they can learn anywhere and anytime , " says Professor Peter Mobbs at University College London ( UCL ) .
Lecture on demand
The initial offerings from UCL will include material about neuroscience , the university 's " lunch time lectures " and an audio news round - up .
The Open University is promising to make available 300 audio and video files with material from current courses .
Trinity College Dublin is promising lectures from journalist Seymour Hersh , scientist Robert Winston , author Anita Desai and politician Alex Salmond .
This will be available from iTunes U , launched by Apple computers last summer as a free education area within the iTunes online music and video store .
It is intended to make lectures available to students at the institutions and to a wider public audience .
This has been used by leading US universities to provide lectures and research news , including Harvard , Yale , Stanford , UC Berkeley and MIT .
Many universities in the UK have been making their own podcasts of lectures , but this will be the first time they have been distributed on the iconic iTunes service .
Open University vice - chancellor Brenda Gourley said it was an exciting new opportunity for anyone , anywhere in the world to gain easy access to its courses .
" Our aim is to partner our established distance learning expertise with the power of the internet to provide as mobile , flexible and personalised learning as possible , whatever your current educational level , personal circumstances or technological abilities . "
A recent market survey showed that four billion songs have been sold through the service since it launched five years ago , making it the biggest music retailer in the United States .
The iTunes service gained its dominant position in online music as the downloading service for the iPod player .
A spokesperson for University College London said that the service would appeal to " techno - literate students " and " reach new audiences around the world " .

What are these ?
Make sure your driving record is clear , citizen .
See that you 've paid off your parking tickets and paid up your child support , and remembered to bring two forms of ID before showing up to the polls on Thursday .
That 's the preposterous , predictable refrain of the voter " information " flyers and robocalls that crop up like clockwork — usually in minority neighborhoods — during election season , touting ersatz endorsements , fictitious voting requirements , and precisely - wrong times , dates , and places at which to make your voice heard in the democratic process .
With old - fashioned smear campaigns already proving disturbingly effective in digital form , civil rights activists worry that it 's only a matter of time before voter suppression tactics make the leap to the Internet .
Earlier this week , at the annual Computers , Freedom and Privacy conference , they braced for the inevitable .
As NAACP attorney Jenigh Garrett explained , traditional vote - suppression campaigns often targeted African - American communities .
African - American voters have for decades supported Democrats by huge margins , making race a reasonable proxy for partisanship , while geographic clustering makes it possible to contain the misinformation .
The best lies often contain some small kernel of truth , making them seem more plausible to their intended audience .
So often , Garrett noted , voter suppression fliers capitalize on the combination of aggressive policing practices and high incarceration rates in urban black neighborhoods , as well as the fact that many states do disenfranchise felons , to attempt to persuade potential votes that any interaction with the law renders them ineligible .
Online misinformation campaigns , panelists suggested , would necessarily look different in some respects , but are likely to operate on many of the same fundamental principles as their real - space precursors .
Tech strategist Jon Pincus , campaign software entrepreneur John Aristotle Phillips , and Lillie Coney of the Electronic Privacy Information Center discussed a variety of tactics we 're likely to see deployed — perhaps as early as November .
Young people — who have been turning out in large numbers for Barack Obama , and who disproportionately seek their information online — would be likely targets , most believed , though online affinity groups and social networks would also permit targeted messaging .

Taking a cue from phishing con artists , political scammers might seek to hijack or spoof the official sites of campaigns or local election boards , giving their misinformation an added veneer of credibility .
Similarly , spoofed e-mails could be employed to persuade recipients that information is coming from a trusted source .
In addition to conventional denial of service attacks , the Internet might also be used to facilitate distributed phone - jamming , of the sort often used to disrupt get - out - the - vote efforts .
The Internet offers some distinct advantages for both voter suppression campaigns and their opponents .
The timing of misinformation efforts is vital :
The bad information needs to be disseminated relatively close to election day , with enough lead time to be spread to voters , but not enough for opponents to employ countermeasures .
The speed of online communications allows scammers far greater precision on this front , but also allows for the rapid collation and correction of false information .
Campaigns targeted by deceptive flyers often are n't even aware of their existence until it 's too late .
Similarly , the social networks that are apt to make such attractive targets for deceptive tactics also create fora for the exposure of those tactics .
And while well - planned campaigns should be effectively untraceable , less competent scammers may leave electron trails that can be traced .
Also on hand at the panel was Rachana Bhowmik , legislative counsel for Barack Obama , who touted the senator 's Deceptive Practices and Voter Intimidation Prevention Act , which has passed the House of Representatives but stalled in the Senate .
The bill would criminalize the knowing dissemination of false election information for the purpose of vote suppression , though in order to avoid encroaching on protected political speech ( parody , for example ) , certain forms of misinformation , such as bogus endorsements , are not covered .
While the law would not necessarily deter deceptive tactics , Bhowmik hopes it would at least convince journalists that such misinformation campaigns were newsworthy .
Until then , be sure to check Snopes before you head to the polls .
You can take care of the parking tickets later .

Gordon Brown today acknowledged a " bad night " for Labour after the party 's national share of the vote plummeted to 24 % - its lowest level since the 1960s – in his first electoral test as prime minister .
With about two thirds of the results declared , the Conservatives had 44 % of the national share of the vote – enough to give David Cameron a landslide majority if it were replicated in a general election .
The Liberal Democrats , on 25 % of the vote , pushed Labour into third place for only the second time in their history .
In what could be a further blow for Brown , Labour and Tory sources were both privately predicting that the Conservative candidate , Boris Johnson , would be elected mayor of London when the results of the mayoral contest are announced this afternoon .
Turnout in London was estimated to be 45 % , better than in the previous two mayoral elections in the city .
Brown today promised to listen to the concerns of voters .
" This has been a disappointing night , indeed a bad night , for Labour .
We have to listen and learn from that and then we will move forward .
My job is to listen and to lead and that is what I will do , " he said .
In another blow to Brown , Labour announced today that David Pitt - Watson , a banker appointed as the party 's new general secretary with strong personal backing from the prime minister , would not now be taking up the post .
Pitt - Watson , who was appointed in March but had not yet taken up his post , was due to replace Peter Watt , who resigned last year after the controversy about Labour accepting proxy donations .
Labour said it hoped to find a new general secretary soon .
The prime minister suggested that " difficult economic circumstances " were a factor in Labour 's defeat .
He insisted that the government was taking steps to help people with their mortgages and their food and fuel bills .
" The test of leadership is not what happens in a period of success but what happens in difficult circumstances .
And the challenge is to show that we have the strength and the recognition , as well as the convictions and ideas , to take the country forward .
And that is exactly what we are going to do , " he said .
With the final results available all 159 councils in England and Wales where there were elections , the Tories were up 256 seats , Labour down 331 and the Liberal Democrats up 34 .
The Conservative result was four percentage points higher than in the 2007 local elections .
According to the BBC , the 4 % increase applied in the north of England as well as the south .
The extent of the Conservative gains would put the party on course for a majority of 138 if they were replicated in a general election , although electoral experts insist this is never an exact guide to what will happen in future .
The Tories said that five cabinet ministers - Jacqui Smith , the home secretary , James Purnell , the work and pensions secretary , Ruth Kelly , the transport secretary , John Denham , the universities secretary , and John Hutton , the business secretary – would lose their seats if people voted the same way in a general election as they did on Thursday .
Under this scenario , the Conservatives would be returned with a landslide and Labour would lose 182 seats .
The party would be left with just 169 MPs .
David Cameron , the Conservative leader , who embarked on a victory tour of areas where his party won councils , told the BBC : " This is a very big moment for the Conservative party , but I do n't think anyone would think that we would deserve to win an election on the back of a failing government .
I want us to prove to people that we can make the changes that they want to see . "
Harriet Harman , Labour 's deputy leader , said this morning that the results were " very disappointing " for her party .
" People are concerned about food prices and increases in fuel bills and there are worries about financial instability .
We have got to really recognise these concerns and do everything we can to protect people from the economic problems that are out there , " she said .
The Tories , who have taken control of 12 councils , hailed their performance in the bellwether boroughs of Bury in Greater Manchester and North Tyneside as a sign that the party was breaking through in northern England .
Their gains also included Southampton , a battleground city with Labour in a general election , the Vale of Glamorgan in South Wales , and Harlow , a highly marginal parliamentary seat in Essex held by the higher education minister , Bill Rammell .
Although Labour lost control of Reading , which had been their only council in south - east England , they picked up another one in the region when they took control of Slough .
A Conservative spokesman said : " Gordon Brown has had his Life on Mars moment .
He went to sleep in 2008 and today he 's waking up with support back to the worst his party has seen since records began in 1973 . "
The shadow chancellor , George Osborne , claimed it was a " truly shocking night for Labour " as the Conservatives made gains in town halls across the country .
He said : " There 's always this argument that the Conservatives can't win in the north .
If you look across the north , we are doing extremely well . "
But his party failed to clinch Worcester city council in the Midlands .
Labour sources described the result as " a mauling " and admitted that Ken Livingstone is likely to lose the London mayoralty to Boris Johnson , the Conservative challenger , later today .
Vincent Cable , the Liberal Democrats ' deputy leader , said earlier he believed that Johnson had won .
Were the votes to be replicated in a general election , cabinet ministers John Denham ( Southampton Itchen ) and James Purnell ( Stalybridge and Hyde ) would have lost their seats .
Denham told the BBC : " We will get over the difficult times we are going through at the moment . "
He admitted that voters felt " shaky " about the economic climate , but added : " We will come back from this and win the next general election . "
Geoff Hoon , the chief whip , insisted : " There is no crisis . "
But Brown is likely to face intense and conflicting pressure to provide a solution to Labour 's electoral woes .
Charles Clarke , the Blairite former cabinet minister , said : " We have got to focus on how and when and what we do .
This is a real message to us from the electorate saying : ' We do n't like some of the things [ you ] are doing , ' and we have got to get our act together .
We have to get our message and purpose across in a more convincing way than we have done . "
The Lib Dems narrowly clung on to Liverpool city council .
The party had 45 out of 90 seats but clinched control when an independent switched allegiances , giving the Lib Dems a majority of one .
A BBC survey conducted by ICM and published on the BBC website suggested that Cameron was seen as the most effective of the main party leaders .
Of 1,005 people who took part , 68 % said the Tory leader was an asset to his party , compared with 43 % for Clegg and 42 % for Gordon Brown .
Councils changing hands by 7.15 pm
Conservative gains : Nuneaton and Bedworth ( from Labour ) , West Lindsey ( from Liberal Democrats ) , Redditch , Basingstoke and Deane , Bury , Cardiff , Elmbridge , Harlow , Maidstone , Southampton , Wyre Forest , North Tyneside , Solihull , Rossendale , Vale of Glamorgan ( all from no overall control )

Reality Distortion Fields
Joel Spolsky wrote an article about the IE8 engine modes .
The article starts with good and insightful general technology strategy wisdom and then proceeds to make bad specific conclusions .
The Insightful Part
The general compatibility strategy treatment in the article with the example of Martian plugs is very good .
Everyone who works on Web specs needs understand compatibility and network effects .
Joel has a history of being insightful on applications of microeconomic theories to software — particularly the network effects of complements .
Drawing the Wrong Conclusions
After the insightful general part , the article proceeds to make two mistaken assumptions along these lines :
IE is the primary and necessary DHTML / Ajax / Web 2.0 development platform .
Standards are written by idealists who do n’t understand economics , business or compatibility strategy .
Platform
I live in one kind of reality distortion field — where people do n’t use or need IE .
I , my girlfriend , my parents , my grandfather and most of my friends from university use either Mac OS X or Ubuntu ( or both ) .
Those friends ( of computer science background or otherwise ) who do run Windows tend to run Firefox or Opera — not IE .
Joel seems to live in another kind of reality distortion field — where “ 98 % of the world will install IE8 ” .
( It ’s a “ high as a kite ” kind of reality distortion field . )
Joel seems to be assuming a world where the way IE 5 through 7 behave is the only serious DHTML / Ajax platform around .
That is , the conclusions he draws after presenting the general technology strategy insightfully are based on the assumption that IE is the platform and the Web standards are n’t .
After the IE dungeon time , this is no longer the reality against which conclusions should be drawn .
In reality there ’s another serious DHTML / Ajax platform — the standards - based one implemented in Gecko , WebKit and Opera .
The fact that people like me and people around me can live in the Gecko / WebKit / Opera reality distortion field shows that the IE part of the reality is today much less important than the Martian mindset of Microsoft apologists assumes .
So the current platform situation is that there ’s the standards - based multi-vendor platform and there ’s IE .
From the Web app developer point of view these overlap to a great extent — the problems are the divergent bits .
Web 2.0 apps run on both platforms .
You do n’t need the old IE runtime to participate on the Web ( the Boeing intranet and Windows help files you burned on a CD - ROM in 1998 are not part of the Web ) .
The argument Joel puts forward assumes that IE is the preferred and necessary development platform .
And that ’s where the conclusion goes wrong .
Today , the standards - based multi-vendor platform implemented by Gecko , WebKit and Opera not only works for Web users but is the preferred platform for developers .
IE is a legacy platform that gets the backport .
When Microsoft tries to bring the next IE closer to the standards - based multi-vendor platform , the breakage is n’t caused by defects in the standards - based multi-vendor platform — after all , Gecko , WebKit and Opera work with real sites and Web apps .
The problem is that sniffed IEness is tainted by the old IE platform .
Where can we find a case study of addressing this issue successfully before ?
The answer is the default browser of Mac OS X .
Mac OS
X used to have a default browser that used the Tasman engine .
Then the browser based on that engine was discontinued and Mac OS X got a default browser that uses the WebKit engine .
Different engines , successfull transition .
How did that happen ?
First , there are things that are not relevant :
It is not relevant that the engines came from different companies in the Mac OS X case .
It also is n’t relevant that the browsers had different UI brand names ( although it did help with user expectation management ) .
The reason why Mac OS X changed browser engines is not relevant .
The relevant parts are :
The new browser did not report its UA string as a new version of the old one .
Instead , it spoofed itself as an unrelated browser it was more compatible with ( Mozilla ) .
The old browser was kept as an optional install for a few years .
So emulating the Safari success would involve giving IE8 a new UA string identity , making document .
all evaluate to false as an if condition , and keeping the old Intranet Explorer as an optional side - by - side install for a few years .
Standards
The other mistake Joel makes is assuming that standards are necessarily written by idealists who do n’t understand market realities or well - known compatibility strategies or who think it is more expensive to change the spec than to change shipped software .
Indeed , there are examples of utter disdain for well - known compatibility and network effect leveraging strategies in the Web standard space .
Consider , for example , what happens in legacy text / html browsers when XHTML +SVG documents served as application / xhtml+xml .
It does n’t have to be that way , though .
Specs can be written to codify behavior that is compatible with existing software products .
This is how the parts of HTML5 that deal with existing functionality are defined .
Furthermore , specs can be written to describe well - defined behavior with all inputs .
Draconian failure on error is not the answer to the problems of Postel ’s law .
Draconian error handling creates an unstable equilibrium in Game Theory terms — it only lasts until one player breaks the rule .
One non-Draconian XML5 implementation in a key client product and the Draconian XML ranks would break .
Well - specified error recovery is the right way to implement the liberal part of Postel ’s law .
This is how CSS and the HTML5 parsing algorithm are defined .

Living Constitutionalism :
If the " living Constitution " metaphor is understood in the way that Rehnquist and Scalia understand it , then it is easy to see why the metaphor -- if taken as a jurisprudential roadmap - - would be bad for democracy .
When judges rely upon the Constitution itself to hold a legislative act invalid , they serve the higher law , duly adopted pursuant to the rigorous ratification process .
However , when judges " substitute " their own values for the Constitution 's values , and then use those substituted values as the basis for invalidating legislative action , they illegitimately take important decisions away from the people 's elected representatives .
Yet the foregoing is a valid critique only if champions of the living Constitution really think that they have a warrant to substitute their views for those of the Constitution .
In fact , however , no serious judge , lawyer or academic argues for that .
Originalists and living - Constitutionalists both agree that where the constitutional text is clear , it controls .
For example , Article II states that no person under the age of 35 can be President , and no champion of the living Constitution would argue that nonetheless an especially precocious 32 - year - old should be deemed Presidency - eligible simply because she dislikes the textual limit .
Originalists and living - Constitutionalists part ways over how to interpret ambiguous provisions of the constitutional text .
Originalists say that judges should resolve textual ambiguity by consulting the prevailing views of the Founding generation .
( I explored the relation between this formulation of originalism and the more traditional focus on " framers ' intent " in an earlier column , but we can put aside these nuances here . )
The act of ratification by that earlier generation of Americans gave the text its power as law , and therefore , that earlier generation 's understanding should prevail , originalists say .
By contrast , living - Constitutionalists believe that while the original understanding has some bearing on the Constitution 's contemporary meaning , it is not the whole story .
For living Constitutionalists , the act of ratification by people who are long dead , and whose numbers did not include any women or enslaved African - Americans , does not suffice to make the Constitution effective today .
For us living - Constitutionalists , the Constitution 's current authority derives at least in substantial part from the fact that we the living people accept it as authoritative .
And if our acceptance validates the Constitution , then , as Justice Powell said in the Rummel case , the way in which contemporary Americans understand the Constitution 's language should play a substantial role in how the courts interpret that language .
But the contemporary theoretical landscape is a lot more complicated than that .
( Dorf is writing a short column and certainly is n't obliged to do a literature review in that context . )
Dorf is assuming a theoretical move that might be called " incompatibilism " -- the view that originalism and living constituitonalism are incompatible .
But this view has been challenged , most prominently by Jack Balkin , who argues for " compatibilism " -- the view that adherence to original public meaning is consistent with " living constitutionalism " in what we might call the " zone of construction " ( relying on the Whittington - Barnett distinction between " interpretation " and " construction " ) .
There is , however , a much deeper problem with Dorf 's description of the theoretical landscape .
Dorf says " Originalists and living - Constitutionalists both agree that where the constitutional text is clear , it controls , " but " clarity " is itself a poor term to describe what is going on here .
There are two distinct sources of constitutional " underdeterminacy " : vagueness and ambiguity .
Ambiguity occurs when a constitutional unit of meaning ( term , phrase , or clause ) has more than one sense .
When original public meaning ( conventional semantic meaning at the time of constitutional utterance ) is ambiguous , context usually resolves the ambiguity .
Living constitutionalism is usually irrelevant in cases of ambiguity .
The constitution uses the phrase " domestic violence " to refer to insurrection or revolt within the territory of the United States .
No one sensible thinks that the fact that " domestic violence " has now acquired a new sense , referring to spouse and / or child abuse creates an ambiguity that should be resolved by reference to " living constituitonalism " .
Originalists and living constitutionalists should be agreed that when the context of constitutional utterance resolves an ambiguity , the disambiguated semantic content of the constitution has the force of law .
Vagueness occurs when a constitutional unit of meaning has borderline cases .
For example , phrases like " executive power " or " freedom of speech " are vague .
The central insight of the " New Originalism " is that the original public meaning of the Constitution can just be vague - - original meaning can run out .
When the constitution is vague , resolution of the vagueness ( line drawing ) requires what Keith Whittington calls " constitutional construction . "
But precisely because construction operates in the zone of vagueness where " original public meaning " ( conventional semantic meaning at the time of constitutional utterance ) runs out , there can be no deep disagreement between originalists ( qua originalists ) and living constitutionalists on the proper method of construction .
Of course , particular originalists can disagree among themselves and with living constituitonalists about methods of construction .
But when originalists turn their attention to methods of construction , they move beyond the core commitment of originalism to the proposition that the semantic content of the constitution wax fixed at the time of constitutional utterance .
That is , the views of particular originalists about proper methods of constitutional construction are outside the core of originalism as a theory .
Although eclectic interpretive theories customarily list authoritative text as the first consideration in ascertaining meaning , I shall defer consideration of the Second Amendment ’s text as such until Part II .
I do so not simply because the Second Amendment lacks a “ plain meaning , ” but because , contrary to conventional wisdom , constitutional doctrine typically trumps constitutional text – at least absent arguments of sufficient strength to overcome the principle of stare decisis .
Commenter :
So what do originalists propose in the situation in which the Constitutional text is vague such that neither the text nor its history provides any clear answer ?
Such cases seem to me to be quite common among the tiny sliver of cases that reach the Supreme Court .
Me :
There is no consensus " originalist " answer to your question .
This is something originalists should be debating respectfully among themselves .
What originalists should not do is default to " framers intent " without a serious defense of that method of constitutional construction .
A lot will depend on your theory of constitutional legitimacy .
If you think the legitimacy of the Constitution rests on ( someone 's ) consent , you may do it one way .
( But you had better have a reasonably well worked out theory of consent . )
If you reject consent theories , as I do , and think the Constitution 's legitimacy rests on the justice of the government it establishes coercively imposing laws on those persons who do NOT consent , then you may do it another way .
In this spirit , I propose the adoption of a " presumption of liberty " to replace the current " presumption of constitutionality " as currently qualified by the Supreme Court doctrine of " fundamental rights . "
Be this as it may , any constitutional construction must stay within the " frame " provided by original meaning .
Just because original meaning cannot completely handle a particular case and controversy does not mean it does not limit the range of possible constitutional constructions available to a conscientious interpreter .
An originalist rejects contradicting or overriding what original meaning there is with something the " interpreter " likes better .
While this leaves considerable room for an evolving constitutional law , that is one reason why the Constitution is still useful after all these years .
It is a feature not a bug .
Michael Dorf has a new Findlaw column up on Who Killed the " Living Constitution " ?
in which he argues that " that the living Constitution is a problematic metaphor , but only because originalists like Justice Scalia either misunderstand or mischaracterize what it stands for . "
According to Dorf : There is much that can be said about Dorf 's column .
Larry Solum has a nice response on his Legal Theory Blog .
There he notes that Dorf has confused the problem of ambiguity with that of vagueness , and failed to take into account the degree to which the New Originalism allows , indeed requires , nonoriginalist constitutional construction when the language of the Constitution is vague .
This is why Jack Balkin thinks that originalism is compatable with " living constitutionalism " and why back on 1999 , I dubbed my approach to be " an originalism for nonoriginalists . "
Here is how Solum explains this distinction :
The phrase " natural born citizens " is .
It could be a term of art at the time of the Founding that refers in part to persons born in the United States and subject to its jurisdiction ( or something even more particular as described here ) , or it could have the modern meaning of someone born naturally , i.e. not by cesarean section or in vitro fertilization .
No one thinks , including Dorf , that we make this choice based on which meaning we like best .
Everyone thinks we must ascertain the original public meaning of this term , whatever it may be .
Most of the words and sentences in the Constitution mean the same today as they did then but sometimes the meaning of a specific phrase like " natural born citizen " is no longer part of our lexicon and is archaic .
We then need to investigate and discover its original public meaning .
By the same token , the original meaning of whole passages of the Constitution , like the Privileges or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment , are now ignored because judges thought they got in the way of government power .
These passages are now " dead " or , to switch the metaphor , they are " lost .
"
In contrast to ambiguity , as Solum notes , any word can bedepending on the context , and so can the original meaning of a term in the Constitution .
For instance , while the meaning of " search " has not changed since the founding , whether a particular activity is a search or not cannot be decided historically .
Is the thermal image of a house to detect increased heat emanating from grow lights a search ?
All modern courts can do is apply the original meaning of " search " and then decide whether this activity is sufficiently close to the core or paradigm meaning of the term to be included .
And judicial opinion on this question can evolve as part of a " living " constitutionalMoreover , Dorf is correct to note that some originalists might try to answer the question of construction by asking what the framers would have intended , but this is a residual carry over from the prior original intentions originalism that , at least in the abstract , has been largely abandoned .
To ask how the framers would have decided a question is to pose a counterfactual not a factual question , and one that has no historical answer .
Dorf would be right to criticize such originalists as back - sliders from original public meaning originalism , but he is wrong to tar all originalists , especially the New Originalists , with the same brush .
Similarly , I also think he he wrong to deny that some who famously used the term " living constitution " did so to justify the judicial alteration of the Constitution , especially by eliminating the parts they deem to be archaic .
Consider Dorf 's own views on the Second Amendment in which he posits that Supreme Court precedents should trump the original meaning of the text :
Notice that he does not repeat this formulation of his approach in his Findlaw column probably because it would tend to conform to , rather then undermine , the stereotype of living constitutionalism .
In his article , Dorf is careful to allow some role for precedent to be deemed mistakenly in conflict with the text when such conflicts are " clear . "
But , as typically practiced , the ( selective ) use of and adherence to precedent to " trump " an inconvenient original meaning of the text works precisely to substitute the judges meaning for that which was originally enacted .
As practiced , therefore , this is " living constitutionalism " in its bad sense .
But Balkin 's reconciliation of original meaning and living constitutionalism subtly alters the term " living constitution " to one that should be acceptable to originalists .
So too has former Attorney General Ed Meese who initiated the modern debate over originalism with a series of speeches in the 1980s .
I once heard Meese say something like this : That would be the whole Constitution .
Even the " lost " parts like the Ninth Amendment and Privileges or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment that restrict the powers of the federal and state governments , despite the fact that the Supreme Court in all its wisdom has decided these provisions of the text are meaningless .
I should also add that there are a great many " easy " cases resolved by original meaning , including some that the Supreme Court has long gotten wrong .
Gonzales v. Raich is one recent example .
Inonly one justice even purported to apply original meaning , and that was Justice Thomas .
Justice Scalia 's concurring opinion was squarely within the New Deal Court 's misreading of the " living " Constitution .
The existence of hard cases of constitutional construction is no good reason to wrongly decide cases that are easily handled by original meaning , even if such a decision cuts against the grain of the four " liberal " justices ' preference for strong federal power .

What critical news story received less overall mainstream media coverage than Dennis Kucinich ’s introduction of 35 articles of impeachment against President Bush ?
What same news , with immense impact on our First Amendment rights , got even shorter shrift than last week ’s Senate Select Committee on Intelligence report confirming that the Bush administration “ led the nation to war on false premises ” ?
Give up ?
Here ’s a hint : Fox News , if inadvertently and riddled with falsehoods , devoted more attention to this story than almost any other news outlet .
The answer ?
The National Conference for Media Reform ( NCMR ) .
You know , where all those “ fascists ” and “ loons , ” who “ live in an alternative universe , ” come together to revivify freedom of the press even though “ about 50 % of the liberals say [ the media ] is unbiased . ”
( Please click on that link to see video of Bill O’Reilly , “ journalist ” Juan Williams – who officially forfeits any remaining semblance of journalistic credibility – and “ political analyst ” Mary Katherine Ham discuss the conference ; it ’s a cartoonish example of what inspired the media reform movement to begin with . )
But “ We ’ll Do It Live ! ” O’Reilly also sent his Factor producer - turned - “ reporter ” to ambush journalism legend Bill Moyers at the conference , with not quite the desired outcome .
This , in turn , resulted in the only other coverage the NCMR received on TV , courtesy of O’Reilly nemesis Keith Olbermann .
Aside from O’Reilly ’s ludicrous Orwellian attacks on the NCMR and Olbermann ’s skewering of them , along with O’Reilly ’s little capo , news of the conference was blacked out on air , in print and online by big media outlets .
With one interesting exception .
Four of our nation ’s largest sources for business news – CNBC , CNN Money , BusinessWeek and Forbes – all reprinted an online variation of an Associated Press dispatch about the media reform conference .
And this makes perfect sense , does n’t it ?
Even with massive losses in viewers and readers , big media conglomerates have no desire or intention to improve journalism .
They fear a truly vigorous press , which is why their only interest in the National Conference for Media Reform is how such efforts might one day impact their bottom line .

His name is Chilli and he's
described as a gentle giant .
Which is just as well for his
handler , Tara Nirula , pictured
by his side .
His owners have contacted the Guinness Book of Records who are currently assessing his credentials and comparing them to other big bovines .
The black and white Friesian bullock weighs well over a ton and at the same height as a small elephant , casts a shadow over his cattle companions who are about 5ft .
Scroll down for more ...
Chilli the giant bullock stands at 6ft 6ins and weighs well over a ton
Despite his grand stature , Chilli only grazes on grass during the day and enjoys the occasional swede as a treat .
The heifer , who is almost as high as he is long , lives at the Ferne Animal Sanctuary in Chard , Somerset , after he was left on their doorstep aged just six - days - old .
Nine years on , Chilli has kept on growing , and staff believe the giant will smash a record for Britain 's tallest ever cow .
Naomi Clarke , manager at the sanctuary , said : " As Chilli was growing up we began noticing that he was bigger than our other cows .

Chilli dwarfs most horses , is the same height as a small elephant and casts a shadow over his cattle companions who are about 5 ft in height
" He now stands at 6ft 6ins from the floor to the top of his shoulder and he is massive when he holds his head up .
" We have made an application to Guinness Book Of Records and we are quite confident he will get it . "
Chilli , who is 6ft 7ins long , was left running around on the doorstep of the sanctuary along with his twin sister Jubilee in 1999 .
Over the years , staff noticed Chilli begin to tower over his sister and companions .
But it was only when he failed to fit in a standard cattle cage to have his hooves clipped that they realised just how big he had grown compared to normal bullocks .

Miss Clarke said : " For some reason a farmer decided he did n't want Chilli and Jubilee so dumped them with three others on our doorstep nine years ago .
" He was only six days old and did n't look that big but as the years passed we noticed he was getting rather tall .
" People would always comment on how much bigger he was from the other cows and bulls when they visited the sanctuary .
" He does weigh over a ton but is quite lean and not as fat as some of his companions . "

She continued : " We do n't know what has made him so tall .
He does n't eat that much and his feet and head are in proportion - he is just very large .
" He is a very friendly and gentle cow so we hopes he manages to break the record - he deserves it . "
At present , the tallest bovine in the world is 6ft 8ins Fiorino , who lives in Italy .
A spokeswoman for the Guinness Book Of Records said : " I can confirm that an application has been received for Chilli which is currently under research . "
Six months ago another bullock vying for a record breaking spot was The Field Marshal who weighed in at 3,000lb .
At the time he was on course to over take the current British record - holder , his former stablemate The Colonel , who stood 6ft 5in tall and weighed 3,500 lb .
He died in 2005 .
Actor / scientologist / couch jumper Tom Cruise is reportedly miffed that a new strain of medical marijuana has been nicknamed in his dubious honor .
The weed , dubbed “ Tom Cruise Purple ” on the street , reportedly is so potent , it makes you see things that are n’t there .
Although , since it ’s named for Cruise , it should make you dance around your house in your underpants and socks to “ Old Time Rock n’ Roll . ”
Cruise , who has been embarrassingly vocal about his objection to prescription drugs , is n’t flattered by the moniker and wants his legal team to put the kibosh on it , according to rumors .
Tom Cruise is n’t getting any giggles from a new strain of medical marijuana being marketed as “ Tom Cruise Purple . ”
Word is that the actor ’s lawyers are taking a serious look at the strong brand of bud after we brought it to their attention .
One of Cruise ’s friends found it “ outrageous ” that licensed cannabis clubs in Northern California are selling vials of pot featuring a picture of Cruise laughing hysterically .
Like other followers of Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard , Cruise is opposed to the use of psychotropic drugs .
Staffers at several California clinics we called said they were forbidden to discuss any of the herbal varieties in their “ inventory . ”
But one weed devotee said , “ I heard it ’s the kind of pot that makes you hallucinate . ”
[ From Rush & Malloy ]
Tom– if it were n’t prescription strength , would that make you feel better about it ?
What a bunch of rubbish .
What is his lawyer going to do - bust into every pot party in Southern California and slap the hippies with an injunction every time their client ’s name is mentioned ?
Good luck with that .
Just when I thought Tom might actually be getting his sense of humor back .
Jackson Katz , an internationally recognized educator on violence prevention among men and boys , asks why rape is a " women 's issue " when over 99 percent of rapes are perpetrated by men .
Jackson Katz , an
internationally recognized educator on gender violence prevention among
men and boys , argues society must first transform how it thinks about
violence against women if it wants to prevent these acts from
reoccurring .
" As a culture , Americans first must take the step in
acknowledging that violence against women is not a women ’s issue , but a
men ’s issue , " Katz said .
" This is the foundation strategy for engaging young men and boys in
gender violence prevention , " Katz told an audience of school
counselors , social workers , teachers , University of Iowa psychology students , social
workers , and community members at a forum in Iowa in April .
" The first problem I have with labeling gender issues as women ’s issues is that it gives men an excuse to not pay
attention .
This is also the problem with calling them gender issues ,
because the majority of the people in the status quo see gender issues
as women ’s issues . "
Katz is an educator , author and filmmaker and has been long recognized
as one of America ’s leading anti-sexist male activists , in particular
in the sports and military cultures .
In 1993 he conceived and
co-founded the Mentors in Violence Prevention ( MVP ) Program at Northeastern University ’s Center for the Study of Sport in Society .
The multiracial , mixed - gender MVP program was the first large - scale
attempt to enlist high school , collegiate and professional athletes in
the fight against all forms of men ’s violence against women .
Today MVP
is the most widely utilized gender violence prevention program in
college and professional athletics .
Drawing upon his most recent book , " The Macho Paradox : Why Some Men
Hurt Women and How All Can Help , " Katz shared some strategies with the
audience , providing them with what he hoped was a foundation they could
build upon in their professional and private lives .
" My goal here today
is to give you some concrete strategies on how to approach issues
regarding violence against women and prevent gender - violence issues
among men and young boys . "

Katz spent a significant portion of the session driving home his first
strategy and why a paradigm shift in thinking is imperative to the
prevention of gender violence .
At the root of the problem is language
and how , historically , language has helped cement and legitimize how
people view gender violence .
Katz used race and gender to illustrate how , over time , language has
helped perpetuate and maintain the dominant culture ’s dominance .
" In
the United States , when we hear the word `race , ’ people generally think
of African Americans , " Katz said .
" When people hear `sexual
orientation , ’ they tend to think that means homosexual , gay , or
lesbian .
When people hear `gender , ’ they think of women . "
" In each , the dominate culture is left out of the equation .
This is one
way that dominant systems maintain themselves in that they are rarely
challenged to think about their own dominance , " Katz said .
" This is one
of the key characteristics of power and privilege and why the dominant
culture has ability to go unexamined and remain invisible . "
Katz admits this is one of the key challenges he faces when working
with men , the dominant group in our society .
Katz reminds the audience
that his focus is on men .
" I hope nobody in this room is under the
delusion that this is sexist , " Katz said .
" I know women have made great
historical strides in recent history , but when we talk about the
dominant group in our society , we are talking about men .
I ’m also aware
that members of dominant groups have been strong supporters of
subordinate groups , but let ’s not be naïve , for there have been members
of dominant groups who have resisted reform and responsibility . "
A woman walks in a food department in a supermarket in Nice southern France , February 25 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Eric Gaillard
AMSTERDAM ( Reuters ) - A shoplifter looking to make a quick getaway from a Dutch supermarket after stealing a packet of meat left police a crucial piece of evidence -- his 12 - year - old son .
In his haste the 45 - year - old thief made a solo dash to his car , batting away a supermarket worker who had flung himself on the vehicles ’ bonnet in a bid to stop the escape .
Police in the southern Dutch town of Kerkrade said they managed to contact the thief via the boy , but he had refused to return and collect his son .
The man told officers to get hold of the youngster ’s mother instead .
The thief later turned himself in Thursday , a police spokeswoman said .
Customers who have purchased music from Microsoft 's now - defunct MSN Music store are now facing a decision they never anticipated making : commit to which computers ( and OS ) they want to authorize forever , or give up access to the music they paid for .
Why ?
Because Microsoft has decided that it 's done supporting the service and will be turning off the MSN Music license servers by the end of this summer .
MSN Entertainment and Video Services general manager Rob Bennett sent out an e-mail this afternoon to customers , advising them to make any and all authorizations or deauthorizations before August 31 .
" As of August 31 , 2008 , we will no longer be able to support the retrieval of license keys for the songs you purchased from MSN Music or the authorization of additional computers , " reads the e-mail seen by Ars .
" You will need to obtain a license key for each of your songs downloaded from MSN Music on any new computer , and you must do so before August 31 , 2008 .
If you attempt to transfer your songs to additional computers after August 31 , 2008 , those songs will not successfully play . "
This does n't just apply to the five different computers that PlaysForSure allows users to authorize , it also applies to operating systems on the same machine ( users need to reauthorize a machine after they upgrade from Windows XP to Windows Vista , for example ) .
Once September rolls around , users are committed to whatever five machines they may have authorized — along with whatever OS they are running .
The news will likely upset a number of Microsoft 's customers , who bought music from MSN Music before the company launched the Zune Marketplace and decided to ditch the old store .
Microsoft 's decision to turn off the MSN Music authorization servers serves as a painful reminder that DRM ultimately severely limits your rights .
Companies that control various DRM schemes , as well as the content providers themselves , can yank your ability to play the content which you lawfully purchased ( and now , videos ) at any moment — no matter what your expectation was when you bought it .
Some Major League Baseball fans learned this the hard way last fall .
Bennett insists that MSN Music keys are , in fact , not yet expiring .
Technically speaking , that 's true — if I authorize one of my PCs , never get rid of it for the rest of my life , and never upgrade its OS , I will be able to play my tracks forever .
But as some of our readers note , this technicality is not rooted in reality — the authorizations will now expire when the computer does , for whatever reason .
DRM - free music may be the new hotness these days , but people who bought music before the record industry began to see the light are still stuck with their DRMed music .
Of course , MSN Music customers do have one other option : burning all of their music to audio CD and then re-ripping them back to the computer as MP3s , sans DRM .
But that 's a lossy , lousy solution .

The Mugabe government has arrested the opposition presidential candidate repeatedly , has arrested the # 2 and charged him with treason , locked opposition voters in re-education camps , and more .
He is using food as a weapon together with violence , scaring away voters as well as some police for critical polling stations .
A defiant President Robert Mugabe yesterday vowed he would ‘ go to war ’ if he lost the presidential run - off due to take place in less than two weeks .
Describing the opposition as ‘ traitors ’ , he claimed Zimbabwe would never ‘ be lost ’ again .
Speaking at the burial of a veteran of the independence war , Mugabe said he would never accept the Movement for Democratic Change taking over .
‘ It shall never happen … as long as I am alive and those who fought for the country are alive , ’ he said .
‘ We are prepared to fight for our country and to go to war for it . ’
The threat was seen as an angry response to the pressure mounting on the government from other African leaders over the regime ’s harassment of the MDC leadership and supporters in the run up to the 27 June election .
With one in three women around the world affected by gender - based violence – a crime that skyrockets more than 200 per cent in conflict settings – Nobel laureate Nadia Murad brought governments and UN leaders to task on Monday , for failing to provide the resources needed to create meaningful change for traumatized communities .

According to a broad study released by the European Union today , Europeans are hanging up on landlines in favor of mobile phones and VoIP .
The EU spoke with over 26,000 people across 27 countries in the EU during November and December last year to find that 24 percent of European households have canceled their landline phone service in favor of mobile phones .
According to the study , 22 percent of European households are using PC software like Skype for making calls over the Internet , with citizens in Latvia ( 58 percent ) , Lithuania ( 51 ) , the Czech Republic ( 50 ) , Poland ( 49 ) , and Bulgaria ( 46 ) leading the pack .
This VoIP trend notably coincides with an increase in Internet access across the EU , with 49 percent of households now having access .
36 percent of those are on some kind of broadband ( up from 28 percent the year before ) .
Unfortunately , with the rise of faster access , Symantec says Europe has recently claimed the " king of spam " crown as well .
The most frequently - cited reason for not having Internet service ( 50 percent of these respondents ) , however , is n't lack of access but a sheer lack of interest in the service .
The EU 's increase in mobile phone and VoIP dependency parallels trends we 've seen recently in the US , where 15.8 percent of Americans are rolling only with mobile phones , and 13.8 percent are using VoIP .
Europeans also share similar gripes with Americans over the quality of their mobile phone and Internet services .
One in four mobile phone users are not always able to connect to make a call , while 28 percent say they are " sometimes " cut off .
22 percent say they have difficulty contacting their Internet service provider about connection problems , and a similar number said the cost of support they get is not affordable .

Four years after Kansas Senator Pat Roberts triumphantly cleared the Bush administration of misusing pre-war Iraq intelligence , the Phase 2 report of the Senate Intelligence Committee he once chaired today reached a much different conclusion .
After Roberts successfully stonewalled past the 2004 and 2006 elections the studies examining White House statements on the Iraqi threat and the role of the Pentagon 's Office of Special Plans , his successor Jay Rockefeller today concluded : " The president and his advisers undertook a relentless public campaign in the aftermath of the attacks to use the war against Al Qaeda as a justification for overthrowing Saddam Hussein . "
While Democratic and Republican committee members battle it out over the implications of the Phase 2 report , Pat Roberts ' role in obstructing the investigation of the Bush administration 's uses - and misuses - of intelligence in the run-up to the invasion of Iraq is beyond dispute .
Read on ...
The world knew the Bush administration was lying all along , but it 's good to finally have a definitive record .
Senator Pat " Memory Pills " Roberts did his level best to run interference for George Bush and unfortunately for him , he hitched his wagon to a falling star .
Roberts was considered vulnerable in his home state of Kansas before the release of this report , and in a year of change and the demise of the GOP , this is n't going to help .
This does n't bode well for Senator John McCain either .
He 's staked his whole candidacy on the failed Iraq debacle and he , along with the rest of the Republican candidates , will find it difficult to separate themselves from the disaster they helped to create .
This list has grown to an unmanageable size .
There are many entries that claim to be high profile but I personally have never heard of .
Many applications listed here no longer exist or are no longer written in Delphi and many links go to nowhere .
This list should either be verified and updated or completely removed .
Since I do n't see any activity on the first the latter is probably the preferred option .

Semanta Modeler Migrated and written in Delphi A Business Data Modeling solution
The basic concept is to only support a strict object hierarchical notation .
This means that objects that refer to other objects are in a higher hierarchy than objects that are being referred .
Because of this hierarchical notation there are very little symbols needed to depict the objects in a data model with their respective relations , which makes the model intuitive and understandable , also for non IT specialists .

Monopoly
Clue
The Game of Life
Scrabble
I love me a good game night .
Monopoly gets pretty cut - throat when we 're at my in - laws – cheating bankers , people hiding money , my brother - in - law yelling at people about the free market .
It 's a blast , actually .
But I love the word games too – Scattergories is probably my favorite , but Catch Phrase is a good time .
Especially if there 's alcohol involved .
I 've been itching for a good game night lately , so to satiate my urge until I can convince some friends to come over and be mercilessly beaten at Clue , here are a few facts about some of your favorite ( at least , my favorite ) games .
It 's thought that Monopoly originated in the early 1900s by Elizabeth Magie , except then it was called " The Landlord 's Game " ( that 's her original patent in the picture ) .
A professor at the Wharton School of Finance at the University of Pennsylvania even started using Magie 's version as a learning tool in his classes .
Evidence shows it was also used at the University of Toledo , Smith College , Princeton , MIT and Columbia .
She took different versions of The Landlord 's Game to Parker Brother on several different occasions but was turned down by George Parker every time .
Eventually , a later version of the game was played by Esther Darrow , the wife of Charles Darrow .
It was Charles who changed the layout and some rules of the game and began calling it Monopoly .
Darrow tried to sell Monopoly to Milton Bradley but was rejected in 1934 .
Bad move , Milton Bradley .
But Parker Brothers again passed on the game too , saying it was too complicated , too technical and too long .
However , the company heard about how well the game was selling locally and reconsidered their rejection just a year later .
They bought all of Darrow 's remaining inventory and helped him patent the board .
They also bought Elizabeth Magie 's patent to The Landlord Game to make sure that they had undisputed rights .
Uh , pretty smart , considering that Monopoly has sold more than 250 million copies worldwide since then . •
For some reason , I always thought the Monopoly guy was Uncle Moneybags .
Nope .
But " proper " names for him include Rich Uncle Pennybags , Milburn Pennybags and Mr. Monopoly ( his most recent name ) .
Some sources say he 's loosely based on J.P. Morgan . •
Marvin Gardens is actually a misspelling of Marven Gardens , a housing area in Margate City , N.J.
In fact , all of the properties on the " classic " Monopoly board are named after places or streets near or in Atlantic City , N.J. •
In the London version of the game , Trafalgar Square is a red property , Piccadilly is yellow , Regent , Oxford and Bond Streets are green and the blue properties are Mayfair and Park Lane .
The railroads are replaced by Underground stops ( King 's Cross , Marylebone , Fenchurch Street Station and Liverpool Street Station ) . •
Neiman Marcus once sold an all - chocolate edition .
The whole set , including dice , money , hotels and board , was edible . •
F.A.O. Schwarz in NYC sold a $ 100,000 version , which included 18 - carat game pieces , a rosewood board , real money , street names written in gold leaf and various gems scattered across the board . •
The most expensive board even made is a set worth $ 2 million
It 's made of 23 - carat gold and has rubies and sapphires embedded in the top of each house and hotel . •
Various versions of Monopoly include Batman , ESPN , Family Guy , American Idol , Nintendo , Sephora , and , honestly , just about any other version you can possibly think of .
What we in North America know as Clue , the rest of the world knows as Cluedo .
Would you believe that it was invented by a part - time clown ?
Totally true .
Anthony E. Pratt invented the game in England and it was published for the first time in 1949 by a British company .
Bought by Parker Brothers , the U.S. version came out the same year . •
The dead dude is known as Mr. Boddy in North America , but he 's Dr. Black everywhere else .
Also , Mr. Green is apparently alias Reverend Green in some parts of the world . •
Also , some of the Clue characters have little - known first names .
They are : Colonel Michael Mustard , Miss Josephine Scarlet , Professor Peter Plum , Reverend / Mr. John Green , Mrs. Blanche White and Mrs. Elizabeth Peacock .•
Characters used in other or deluxe versions of Clue include Miss Peach ( not to be confused with Princess Peach ) , Lady Lavender , Prince Azure , Rusty Naylor and Captain Brown . •
The original nine weapons were axe , shillelagh , bomb , rope , dagger , pistol , syringe , poison and poker .
Life has been around since 1861 ... not in the format we recognize today , of course .
Milton Bradley himself invented " The Checkered Game of Life " when his lithography business started to go down the tubes ( his major product was a portrait of clean - shaven Lincoln … when Lincoln grew the beard , Bradley went out of business ) .
He had actually been circulating the game on a smaller scale before his clean - shaven Lincoln lithograph took off , but he abandoned it once demand for his lithograph increased .
After that plummeted , he focused more attention on marketing and ended up selling more than 40,000 games in 1861 alone – no small feat for that time period ! •
Milton Bradley used a spinner to count the number of spaces people could move because dice were associated with gambing . •
In the original Checkered Game of Life , landing on the " Suicide " square put people out of the game completely .
Obviously .•
Other squares on the original game board included Prison , Infancy , Ruin , Gambling , Disgrace , Honesty , Truth , Cupid , Industry and " Happy Old Age " ( the goal of the game ) . •
One interesting variant ( among many ) is The Game of Redneck Life .
Careers include Mullet Salon Operator and Monster Truck Announcer .
The goal of the game is to get out with as many teeth as you can – through the various fights and brawls you get into over the course of the game , this can prove to be pretty challenging .
I 'm dead serious .
Scrabble came about in 1939 when architect Alfred Mosher Butts modified a game he had been working on earlier – Lexiko .
At first he called it Criss - Crosswords and based the values of the letters on based on letter usages from the New York Times ( and other reputable sources ) .
In 1948 , he allowed James Brunot to manufacture the game as long as he got a cut of each board sold … which was n't much , at first .
They actually lost money the first year they produced it .
Legend goes , though , that the President of Macy 's played the game while on vacation and , upon his return to work , was shocked that his store did n't carry it .
When they did start to carry it , sales skyrocketed . •
There are 96 two - letter words that are " legal " in Scrabble … including 10 that are spelled with vowels only .
I 'm so learning those . •
A typical Scrabble board has 225 squares . •
The highest known score for a single word in competition Scrabble is 392 .
In 1982 , Dr. Saladin Khoshnaw achieved this score for the word " caziques , " which means " Indian chief . " •
The highest possible score a player can get in Scrabble on a first turn is for the word MUZJIKS ( 128 points ) .
I realize there 's tons of beloved board games I 've missed , so maybe I 'll turn this into a series … a three - parter , or something .
Sorry ! , Candyland , Chutes and Ladders , Risk , Trivial Pursuit .
Lots of options .

Asked to sum up why the Irish should support Lisbon , Micheál Martin , director of the referendum campaign for one of the big three parties , Fianna Fáil , said : " First of all , the purpose of the treaty is to ensure that the EU is reformed so that it is more efficient and effective in meeting modern challenges … "
Folding bikes are particularly efficient when used in conjunction with public transit .
Unlike regular bikes , they can be taken easily on buses , trains or ferries .
In fact , some transit systems will only allow folding bikes to be taken on board .
For a little extra weight , you get the benefit of going up hills easily , and this is often very important to commuters who do not work up a sweat before getting into work .
Let ’s take a look at one of the better folding electric bikes out there : a Dahon Mu P3 custom - fitted with a BionX electric assist motor .
This bike is called Dahon Conversion and it ’s sold by NYCEWheels for $ 1899 ( see photos above and below ) .
The Dahon Conversion weighs just 42 pounds .
It can be folded in less than 20 seconds into a size roughly 13 ″ x 25 ″ x 30 ″ .
The folding of the bicycle requires the loosening of 4 clasps and the bicycle collapses to its folded size without removing any of the wheels or adjusting any of the gears .
The wires are out of the way and do not obstruct the folding and require no special attention in the folding process .
The bike has a range of 20 - 30 miles .
This version of the bike uses a 250 watt motor and NiMH batteries .
If you spend more , you can get a 350 watt motor ( add $ 230 ) or lithium - ion batteries ( add $ 300 ) .
The BionX standard system includes a control console , a battery and a motor .
The control console includes a multi-functional odometer , four assistance levels , four generative settings as well as a battery charge indicator .
Create Your Own
You can also create your own folding electric bike .
For example , to recreate the Dahon Conversion you could get the Dahon Mu P3 ( about $ 590 ) and install the BionX motor system yourself ( kits start at $ 1100 ) .
Of course you can also use other folding bikes and electric assist kits .
Some kits are available for less than $ 500 , however I ca n’t vouch for their quality .
There ’s also DVD that will tell you how to fit your bike with an electric motor — its a bit hokey but it shows the basic method of installation .
Another folding electric bike is the iZip EZgo .
This inexpensive bike by Currie Technologies , will help you pedal for 18 to 25 miles with speeds up to 18 mph .
The bike weighs 53 pounds , including the motor .
The EZgo has a simple twist throttle with a battery gauge .
The wheels are 16 ″ heavy duty alloy with stainless steel spokes .
The bike also features an integrated rear carrier to take some items on the go with you .
It ’s available from Amazon for $ 649 .
The bike ’s home page is here .
Biotague
Biontague is a folding electric mountain bike , created by Electric Cyclery .
It ’s a Montague Swiss Bike LX folding mountain bike fitted with a Bionx PL350 electric conversion kit .
The Biontague bike offers speeds in the 20 MPH range , great hill climbing assistance , and a range of up to 60 miles on a 3 - hour charge .
The Montague Swiss is a mountain bike that folds for easy transport and the whole thing weighs only 43.2 lbs .
A 36 - volt lithium - ion battery pack is mounted down low on the frame .
The price is $ 2425 from Electric Cyclery , plus $ 100 shipping in continental USA .

CHARLTON HESTON , who died Saturday at age 84 , was an avid newspaper reader , eager to share his opinions .
In addition to writing dozens of letters to the paper over four decades , the “ Ben - Hur ” star often would telephone Los Angeles Times editors with his comments .
While his political views were typically conservative , they were not always dogmatic .
Equally distinctive was the way the Oscar winner sometimes read the paper :
He would have an assistant spread sections around his pool , and Heston would peruse different stories between laps .
By the time he ’d completed his workout , he also had finished the day ’s news .
Here are excerpts from some of Heston ’s letters to the paper :
Spike Lee ’s threat

IN a fit of pique at the Cannes Film Festival , Spike Lee said I should be shot “ with a .44 Bulldog ” ( the handgun used by the serial killer Son of Sam ) .
In response , I feel some irony .
In ’63 , when I was marching for the freedom of black Americans , I was threatened by white men .
In ’99 , active now for the freedom of all Americans , I ’m threatened by a black man .

Elia Kazan ’s Oscar

SO the Oscars came off smoothly , with good work rewarded .
Early anxieties about the [ honorary Oscar presented to director Elia ] Kazan . . . went unrealized .
There was some scuffling by street protesters but inside the hall the presentation was vigorously applauded ; only a few sat silent .
It seems that the fierce and relentless attack on Kazan , lasting many weeks , was in fact the last hurrah of the Hollywood left .
( Mind you , the Hollywood liberal is still with us , but that ’s a different breed of cat entirely , alive and well , content to be the arbiter of taste , political correctness and the search for the next Great Restaurant . )

Well , whatever

THE cultural and social fabric of the country is fraying around the edges as we split up into separate little Gypsy camps , each with a different agenda , heading in different directions .
A while ago , I was at one of those silly “ A - list ” parties and fell into conversation on all this with a stunningly beautiful , famous star ( not a bad actress , either ) who said , “ Well , look what it says on the dollar bill : ‘e pluribus unum . ’
From one , many . ”
“ Actually , you ’ve got the Latin backward , ” I replied .
“ It translates , ‘ From many , one . ’
As in one nation . . . indivisible ? ” “ No kidding ? ” she said , amazed .
“ Well . . . whatever . ”
And there you have it .
We live , increasingly , in a “ well , whatever ” nation .
God help us all .

Lincoln no Clinton

I am offended by the preposterous characterization of Abraham Lincoln as a sex- crazed clone of Bill Clinton .
Lincoln is generally judged to be one of our finest presidents ( who also freed the slaves ) .
To imply that he in any way resembled our current president is an outrageous and shameful insult .

The bomb was best

I’VE read most of your reviews on the books reexamining the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki that ended World War II .
Each condemns the action without reservation as an insanely murderous choice .
Several respected intellectuals are quoted , some no doubt qualified on the subject .
It ’s too bad none of them was there .
. . .
The bomb ended the war , and its nuclear successors won the Cold War without firing a shot , on either side .
I call that a worthwhile achievement .

Titanic tanking ?

FOR the past 20 years , the most serious and apparently insoluble problem facing Hollywood is the runaway inflation of the cost of making and marketing movies .
. . .
The prime culprit this year is “ Titanic , ” replacing “ Waterworld ” and eclipsing “ Heaven ’s Gate ” in several unwelcome categories : over schedule by several weeks and over budget by many millions , with many weeks of added post - production yet to come .
Plus interest .
Still , all may yet be well .

Justice for Ice - T

Iwas bemused to read in Calendar that Dick Wolf , producer of the superb “ Law & Order , ” has hired the rap “ artist ” formerly known as Ice - T to star as the criminal hero of a series in which the baffled police employ bad guys to catch bad guys .
Wolf is one of the best producers in television ; if anyone can bring this concept off , he can .
Ice - T deserves the right to make a living .
I wish them both well , not least because I helped get Ice - T fired four years ago by Time Warner , the largest entertainment conglomerate in the world .
He was then under contract to Warners , which had just released a disc called “ Cop Killer , ” obscenely celebrating the murder of policemen .

In defense of Kato
THE hapless Kato Kaelin has my sympathy .
Still , if O.J. Simpson demeaned him during his tenure as housesitter , dog watcher and sometime companion , it was no worse , as your article points out , than the treatment routinely accorded the people who serve those affluent public faces who lack the character and decency to understand how to treat those who work for them .
I ’ve observed their disgusting antics throughout my career .
They no longer amaze but only appall me .
Your article , though , fails to separate clearly the Katos , gofers , dogsbodies and buddies from the men and women who function professionally as personal assistants .

Riot as revolution ?
YOUR examination of the rioters . . . whether they were random looters or principled protesters , the wild children of welfare or the impassioned architects of revolution . . . was reasoned and relatively unbiased .
Your finding seemed clear , though :
If these looters were in fact honest rebels , we should understand , maybe even applaud .
I think you ’ve stumbled badly in implying that revolution is automatically OK .
In the iron eye of history , revolution has a lousy track record .
It boasts one triumph , our American Revolution , the only rebellion in history to pass power peaceably to the next generation .

AIDS and a game show
CALENDAR ’S lead story on the new TV show “ Studs ” caught my eye .
Culturally and creatively , the project seems beyond comment .
It occurs to me , though , that in a time when Magic Johnson ’s sad situation and the way he ’s dealt with it has focused attention on the risk for heterosexual AIDS , “ Studs ” could make a significant contribution to this growing health problem .
Since the show is predicated on two young men taking three young women to bed and then discussing it , surely the producers should provide all participants with a free AIDS test as part of the casting process .

‘ Miss Saigon ’
ACTORS may be the oldest minority group in the world .
Thousands of years ago , when blacks still roved innocent in the African rain forests and Jews reigned remote in their desert redoubts , actors were wandering around Europe juggling apples , telling stories and doing the three walnut shells and a pea scam .
We slept in stables before Christ was born , often with local company that got us run out of town by dogs the next morning .
. . .
I ca n’t believe that the first union I joined , to which I ’m proud to belong , could endorse so blatantly racist a position as Actors ’ Equity has done in denying Jonathan Pryce the right to play the role he created in “ Miss Saigon . ”
As actor and director , I ’ve always assumed the idea was to get the best actor for the part , no matter what color he or she was .

Noriega must go
AN open letter to Jesse Jackson :
The world has changed since we both walked behind Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. a quarter - century ago .
Still , we share that shining memory and , I suppose , a common allegiance to our country and its people .
Beyond that , we differ on many issues .
Sadly , I have to say I find your column on Panama not only mean - spirited but riddled with error .
Let me point out the most egregious .
Do you really think that “ democracy is not created at the point of a bayonet ” ?
What did Washington ’s brave , beleaguered army carry on their bayonets in 1776 , then ?
What did the GIs splashing ashore in Normandy and across France into Germany bring , if not democracy ?
What brought democracy to Japan , if not bayonets ? . . .
You deplore bayonets in Panama ?
Perhaps you preferred Noriega ?
January 1990
( CNN ) -- Retired Adm. William Fallon resigned in March as leader of the U.S. military 's Central Command after reportedly clashing with President Bush .
Retired Adm. William Fallon told CNN he resigned to maintain confidence in the military chain of command .
During an interview Tuesday on CNN's American Morning , " Fallon denied a magazine article 's assertion that he had been forced to resign over his opposition to a possible war with Iran .
CNN 's Kyra Phillips asked Fallon about his resignation and about U.S. policy regarding Iraq and Iran .
Kyra Phillips :
How were you informed that this was it ?
Who called you ?
Fallon :
The story is -- the facts are that the situation was one that was very uncomfortable for me and , I 'm sure , for the president .
One of the most important things in the military is confidence in the chain of command .
And the situation that developed was one of uncertainty and a feeling that maybe that I was disloyal to the president and that I might be trying to countermand his orders , the policies of the country .
...
The fact that people might be concerned that I was not appropriately doing what I was supposed to do and following orders bothered me , and my sense was that the right thing to do was to offer my resignation .
Watch Fallon break his silence »
Phillips :
Do you feel you were pushed out ?
Fallon :
What was important was not me .
It was n't some discussion about where I was with issues .
It was the fact that we have a war in progress .
We had a couple of hundred thousand people whose lives were at stake out in Iraq and Afghanistan and we needed to be focused on that and not a discussion on me or what I might have said or thought or someone perceived I said .
That 's the motivation .
Phillips : [ Esquire magazine writer ]
Tom Barnett made it appear that you were the only man standing between the president and a war with Iran .
Is that true ?
Fallon : I do n't believe for a second President Bush wants a war with Iran .
The situation with Iran is very complex .
People sometimes portray it or try to portray it in very simplistic terms -- we 're against Iran , we want to go to war with Iran , we want to be close to them .
...
The reality is in international politics that [ there are ] many aspects to many of these situations , and I believe in our relationship with Iran we need to be strong and firm and convey the principles on which this country stands and upon which our policies are based .
At the same time demonstrate a willingness and openness to engage in dialogue because there are certainly things we can find in common .
Phillips : Would have you negotiated with Iran ?
Fallon :
It 's not my position to negotiate with Iran .
I was the military commander in the Middle East .
I had responsibility for our people and their safety and well - being .
It 's the role of the diplomats to do the negotiation .
Phillips :
So when talk of the third war came out , a war with Iran , the president did n't say to you , " This is what I want to do , " and did you stand up and say , " No , sir .
Bad move " ?
Fallon :
It 's probably not appropriate to try to characterize it in that way .
Again , do n't believe for a second that the president really wants to go to war with Iran .
We have a lot of things going on , and there are many other ways to solve problems .
I was very open and candid in my advice .
I 'm not shy .
I will tell people , the leaders , what I think and offer my opinions on Iran and other things , and continue to do that .
Phillips :
Do you think that cost you your job ?
Fallon :
No , I do n't believe so at all .
It 's a confidence issue of do people really believe the chain of command is working for them or do we have doubts , and if the doubts focus attention away from what the priority issues ought to be , then we 've got to make a change .
Phillips :
We talk about your no -nonsense talk and the fact that you had no problems standing up to the president .
Your critics say that Admiral Fallon is a difficult man to get along with .
Are you ?
Fallon :
You probably could ask my wife about that .
She would have a few things to say .
I think that what 's really important here is that when I was asked to take this job about a year and a half ago , I believe it was because we were facing some very difficult days in Iraq and Afghanistan and in the region .
I had some experience in dealing with international problems .
I certainly had a lot of combat experience , and I was brought in in an attempt to make things better .
That 's what I went about doing .
Again , there are things that are important and other things in life that are less so .
A lot of the issues that became points of discussion to me were not really important items .
The important items were the people , what they 're doing , how to get this job done , how to get the war ended and get our people home .
Phillips : Hillary Clinton [ and ]
Barack Obama talk about pulling troops out by next year .
John McCain says , no , we 've got to stay the course .
What is the best course for Iraq right now ?
Watch what the candidates say about war policy »
Fallon : I believe the best course is to retain the high confidence we have in General Dave Petraeus and his team out there .
Dave has done a magnificent job in leading our people in that country .
Again , this situation is quite complex -- many angles .
There 's a very , very important military role here in providing stability and security in this country , but that 's not going to be successful , as we know , without lots of other people playing a hand .
The political side of things in Iraq has got to move forward .
That appears to be improving .
People have to have confidence in their futures .
They want to have stability .
They would like to be able to raise their families in peace .
They would like to have a job .
They would like to look to tomorrow as better than today .
It takes more than the military , but the military is essential to provide stability and security .
The idea we would walk away from Iraq strikes me as not appropriate .
We all want to bring our troops home .
We want to have the majority of our people back and we want the war ended .
Given where we are today , the progress that they 've made particularly in the last couple months , I think it 's very , very heartening to see what 's really happened here .
The right course of action is to continue to work with the Iraqis and let them take over the majority of the tasks for ensuring security for the country and have our people come out on a timetable that 's appropriate to conditions on the ground .

Last week , new consumer price data released by the US Labor Department confirmed what most shoppers already suspected :
Food prices , which took their biggest one - month leap in nearly two decades in April , rose even further in May .
Energy costs , too , went up last month .
The big question , though , is why ?
Commodity analysts are quick to pinpoint reasons : Midwest flooding affecting food , livestock feed overdrive provoked by the Chinese , biofuel - related demand , and a weak dollar .
These reasons all have some merit , but I ’d argue it ’s speculation that ’s skyrocketed prices higher faster , not supply vs. demand .
At the financial leaders G8 summit that wrapped up over the weekend , food and oil speculation were front and center .
And G8 leaders are n’t the only ones expressing concern over traders profiting from the world ’s pain .
Major hedge - fund stars like George Soros and Michael Masters are also screaming moral foul on commodity speculation — a clear signal there ’s more fire than smoke on the horizon .
As Masters told a Senate committee last month , “ Institutional investors have purchased over 2 billion bushels of corn futures in the last five years .
[ They ] have stockpiled enough corn futures to potentially fuel the entire United States ethanol industry at full capacity for a year . ”
Indeed , the current agricultural price bubble has produced record highs in soybeans and wheat as well .
Against this backdrop , a clueless Congress passed US farmer and food - stamp aid within the recent farm bill , without addressing the possibility that speculation could be to blame , or that curtailing speculation could help alleviate the domestic and global food crisis .
They should have looked toWall Street ’s lead .
The latest grain and oilseed trading report from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange cited first quarter of 2008 trading volume up 32 percent over the last quarter of 2007 .
That ’s extra money coming in from speculators , not corn or wheat farmers hedging their crop prices in case of bad weather .
Additionally , the hot new favorite among traders is betting on packages of energy and agricultural futures .
Called CCO ’s ( collateralized commodity obligations ) , they are like their subprime cousins , CDO ’s ( collateralized debt obligations ) .
Their performance is linked to rising commodity prices ; the higher the prices , the more profit to the CCO .
There ’s another group , besides the standard speculator crew , literally reaping extreme profits from the price squeezes — the crop equivalents of Exxon , multinational agricultural biotechnology corporations .
Monsanto , which recently told the 12th Annual Goldman Sachs Agricultural Biotech Forum that its profits would double by 2012 , is buzzing ( PDF ) ; the firm ’s stock price doubled during the past year .
ADM , the nation ’s second - largest ethanol producer , saw its annual revenues increase by 64 percent .
Even agriculture conglomerate Cargill ’s third - quarter profits rose 86 percent .
Last week , a group of senators led by Carl Levin ( D - Mich . ) introduced the Close the London Loophole Act , which would curtail a situation that allows speculators to bypass all Commodity Futures Trading Commission regulations by trading on foreign exchanges .
But without strong regulation of electronic exchanges and the derivatives products that enable speculators to move huge proportions of the futures markets underlying commodities , putting a bit of regulation into the London - based exchanges will not alleviate anything .
Unless that ’s addressed , this bubble is going to take more than homes with it .
It ’s going to take lives .

For years , Helena Cobban has been standing on a street corner in Charlottesville , Virginia , with her local anti-war group , holding up “ Honk if You Want Peace ” signs .
In 2006 the Quaker and self - described “ convinced pacifist ” noticed for the first time since 9/11 that something was changing : Each week , more people were honking .
What followed in the midterm elections that November was a trouncing of what Cobban calls the “ the Republican vision of US domination over the whole world . ”
A longtime foreign affairs writer , Cobban sensed the country was at a turning point and set out to explore the foreign policy opportunities that will come with a new administration .
Re-engage !
America and the World After Bush , Cobban ’s seventh book , lays out her ideas with an eye toward how ordinary citizens can advocate for change .
Cobban brings to the book wide - ranging knowledge and experience gained from her nearly two decades as a columnist with the Christian Science Monitor and seven years spent living in Lebanon , much of it during the civil war .
Currently a contributing editor at Boston Review , she maintains a personal blog on international issues called Just World News .
Last month Cobban talked to Mother Jones about Barack Obama getting it right , the media ’s “ daddy - knows - bestism , ” and why five percent of the world should n’t run it .
Mother Jones :
When you look back at foreign policy during the Bush years , do you see any bright spots , things to emulate ?
Helena Cobban :
The negotiations with North Korea have been excellent .
In a sense it ’s sort of counter to the general narrative of Bushist unilateralism and militarism .
There they were , working as part of a six-nation coalition engaging diplomatically with Pyongyang — where , goodness only knows , the regime is just as dictatorial and far more mercurial and bizarro than the regime in Tehran .
It ’s kind of weird that at the same time they were doing that , they were continuing to pump up this idea that there ’s no possibility of dealing with the Tehran regime , and that we have to keep , as they ominously say , “ all options on the table ” — which in the context does mean the option of a nuclear first strike .
It ’s a scary thing that they ’re saying there .
MJ : What ’s your take on Barack Obama ’s foreign policy ?
HC : I think he is definitely the one who , in my view , gets it best , in terms of what is possible in this relationship between the US citizenry — 300 million people — and the other six billion people out there .
The operative number we Americans need to remember these days is six billion .
There are six billion men , women , and children on God ’s earth who happen not to be US citizens , and they never elected the US to rule the world .
So how do we , being just 5 percent of global humanity , want to build a relationship with the other 95 percent in which the rights and interests of everybody gets equally respected ?
That ’s a challenge , because a lot of us , not me personally — okay , well I did have an SUV — a lot of us have been living in a very profligate and sort of domineering way .
Grabbing the world ’s resources and puffing out our horrible carbon dioxide emissions , with never a thought to the effect on the other 95 percent of humanity .
MJ : So you would be hopeful about an Obama presidency ?
HC : Certainly in terms of what I ’m hearing him say , what I ’ve heard him say throughout , about the fact that war is completely dysfunctional as a way to get strategic gains of any lasting significance .
He was against the Iraq War before there was an Iraq War , and to me that ’s really important .
When he says , “ I ’m not just for ending the war , I ’m for ending the state of mind that got us into the war ” — that ’s a very kind of Quakerly way to approach the world .
MJ : What do you think the next president can and should do immediately that can improve America ’s standing in the world ?
HC : With respect to the first 100 days , we need to have a president who will commit to the post - Kyoto climate change process — that is , the negotiations that were started in Bali .
[ The president should ] close Guantanomo and close the whole archipelago of secret prisons the US has around the world , and state unequivocally that the US has no lasting desire to stay in Iraq and will have withdrawn all its troops by January of 2011 — that would give them two years .
MJ : Your book talks a lot about how ordinary citizens can get engaged .
Can you talk about what steps people can take to advocate for these more progressive policies ?
HC : There are some pretty good pro-peace and anti-war organizations around the country .
Though nothing as large as what I saw when I came to the United States in the 1980s when you had the nuclear freeze movement and those massive demonstrations in New York City .
There were large demonstrations in February 2003 during the lead - up to the invasion of Iraq , but that really has not continued as a nationwide movement .
So we have to rebuild that , and that means working with your local anti-war movement , your local church , anyone that ’s doing good anti-war organizing .
That involves all the usual kinds of things , from sidewalk vigils and local demonstrations and passing resolutions and taking part in ever broader coalitions — keeping the pressure up on our elected representatives .
All those people we elected in November 2006 we elected on a fairly clear anti-war , let ’s - end - the - occupation - of - Iraq program .
They just really have n’t performed for us .
We have got to hold their feet to the fire .
After September 11th , one of the things that happened that really disturbed me as a female who has been a columnist — since 1990 I was writing my column in the Christian Science Monitor , one of the few female columnists in the mainstream media — was that all of those efforts that all of us made to get diverse voices in the national media were just swept away by a tsunami of daddy - knows - bestism .
You just had these ranting , very militaristic white guys taking over the airwaves and the op - ed pages of major newspapers .
I was really disappointed in the Washington Post , which in the days of the Vietnam War really played a heroic role .
I do n’t see that it ’s gotten much better since then .
MJ : Post - 9/11 , do you think there was a connection between the message and the messengers being , as you say , a bunch of old white men ?
HC : Oh , definitely .
After 9/11 people wanted a father figure , they wanted reassurance , they wanted to feel safe .
And your white male grandfather — your imagined white male father — was a person that you trusted .
I think that ’s a lot of the explanation for how George Bush got elected in 2004 , which was the first time he was elected , of course .
That surprised the heck out of me — already then , it was clear that the Iraq War was a damaging debacle that was actively counterproductive for our country ’s interests .
But people elected the guy .
I sat with a lot of my friends in DC and elsewhere , trying to think , what is happening here ?
And the best explanation we could come up with was , people are still traumatized .
MJ : What ’s your take on the current state of the Middle East ?
What do you think should happen with American policy ?
HC : The Middle East provides so many great examples of what I ’m arguing for in Re-Engage .
The big argument of the book is that the United States should have a policy of global inclusion .
That means both the United States itself getting reincluded into the international community on a healthier and more mutually respectful basis , but it also means bringing into decision - making forums the voices of those who currently are excluded or marginalized from them .
So in the Middle East , that is obviously the government of Iran , which the United States has systematically been seeking to exclude and overthrow for the last 15 years , and also these large social movements like Hamas and Hezbollah , which have proven their support at the popular level and have proven their willingness to engage in cease - fires , pending the completion of final peace agreements .
If you look back at how the conflicts in South Africa or Northern Ireland or so many other conflicts having to do with decolonization , how did they get ended ?
They ended when the national liberation movement sat down with the outgoing colonial or other power on the basis of , anybody can sit in those negotiations who is prepared to engage in a cease - fire and to test their mandate in popular elections .
Those were the only two conditions in the successful peace process in South Africa and the successful peace process in Northern Ireland .
There was no prior demand that anybody had to disarm or demobilize , either militarily or ideologically .
In South Africa , the Pan Africanist Congress was a full part of the negotiations even though they still had the slogan , “ For one settler , one bullet . ”
MJ : In the beginning of the book , you say you are a “ convinced pacifist . ”
How do you define pacifism and how does it inform your reporting and writing ?
HC : Well , I came by it over the years , partly from my experience of having worked and lived in Lebanon for seven years , six of them at the beginning of the civil war there .
I was married to a Lebanese person — my two children from that marriage are half - Lebanese .
So I was there almost as an integrated member of Lebanese society , as a wife and a mom and somebody who was trying to run a household under the circumstances of civil war .
Most journalists do n’t have that experience , living in a hotel , worrying about the survival of their children or hauling water up from the basement because there is no electricity to pump it up .
Reflecting on that through the 1980s and 1990s , and looking at Bosnia or Kosovo or the Middle East , I just saw that war was not getting anybody what they thought they wanted .
I was also inspired by the Dalai Lama , whom I had the honor of meeting and working with a little bit in the late 1990s .
It just became clearer and clearer to me that , first of all , war always disproportionately harms civilians .
Quite frequently nowadays in the war doctrines of nations there is an intention to harm civilian infrastructure , as the Israelis did in Lebanon in 2006 , as the US in essence did in Iraq by completely dismantling the entirety of Iraq ’s state apparatus in 2003 .
It just struck me that you ca n’t get lasting gains through waging wars .
