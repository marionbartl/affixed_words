DES MOINES 
One of the $ 64,000 - questions about Thursday ’s Iowa caucuses is how much students from out of state will influence the outcome .
A big argument has been raging here about rules that allow out - of - state students who attend schools in Iowa to vote as long as they are not registered elsewhere .
Although presidential campaigns here have been notorious over the years for using out - of - staters to pack rallies and organize , at issue here is their actual participation in the caucuses : some see it as a hijacking of their process , while others see it as a voting rights issue and say that as many people as possible should be encouraged to participate .
The role of students is mainly an issue among Democrats because they tend to draw more young people .
Senator Barack Obama of Illinois , whose “ change ” theme is particularly appealing to young people , has been openly encouraging out - of - state students in Iowa to come back from winter break and caucus .
No one knows how many students will show up or what percent of the final turnout they will make up .
But only 124,000 Democrats turned out in 2004 , and even if , as predicted , many more turn out Thursday , thousands of out - of - state students here could still have a disproportionate say in the results .
Mr. Shefter and his associates do not contend that films are actually on the verge of becoming quite that ephemeral .
But they do see difficulties and trends that could point many movies or the source material associated with them toward “ digital extinction ” over a relatively short span of years , unless something changes .
At present , a copy of virtually all studio movies  even those like “ Click ” or “ Miami Vice ” that are shot using digital processes  is being stored in film format , protecting the finished product for 100 years or more .
For film aficionados , the current practice is already less than perfect .
Regardless of how they are shot , most pictures are edited digitally , and then a digital master is transferred to film , which can result in an image of lower quality than a pure film process  and this is what becomes stored for the ages .
But over the next couple of decades , archivists reason , the conversion of theaters to digital projection will sharply reduce the overall demand for film , eventually making it a sunset market for the main manufacturers , Kodak , Fujifilm and Agfa .
At that point , pure digital storage will become the norm , bringing with it a whole set of problems that never troubled film .
To begin with , the hardware and storage media  magnetic tapes , disks , whatever  on which a film is encoded are much less enduring than good old film .
If not operated occasionally , a hard drive will freeze up in as little as two years .
Similarly , DVDs tend to degrade : according to the report , only half of a collection of disks can be expected to last for 15 years , not a reassuring prospect to those who think about centuries .
Digital audiotape , it was discovered , tends to hit a “ brick wall ” when it degrades .
While conventional tape becomes scratchy , the digital variety becomes unreadable .
DIFFICULTIES of that sort are compounded by constant change in technology .
As one generation of digital magic replaces the next , archived materials must be repeatedly “ migrated ” to the new format , or risk becoming unreadable .
Thus , NASA scientists found in 1999 that they were unable to read digital data saved from a Viking space probe in 1975 ; the format had long been obsolete .
All of that makes digital archiving a dynamic rather than static process , and one that costs far more than studios have been accustomed to paying in the past  no small matter , given that movie companies rely on their libraries for about one - third of their $ 36 billion in annual revenue , according to a recent assessment by the research service Global Media Intelligence .
“ It ’s been in the air since we started talking about doing things digitally , ” Chris Cookson , president of Warner ’s technical operations and chief technology officer , said of the archiving quandary .

Hands free : Albert Martin shows off his invention
Ever get tired of carrying the shopping home ?
Albert Martin did - so he 's come up with a solution which he hopes will make him bags of money .
The 87 - year - old is so confident about his labour - saving device that he believes he could be a millionaire by the time he is 90 .
Drawing inspiration from braces and using his wife 's skills on her sewing machine , the former Royal Marine has created Martin 's Hands - Free Harness .
It slips over the shoulders and lets you hang heavy shopping bags on two hooks near your waist .
Mr Martin , a retired postal worker from Benfleet , Essex , said : " When you carry plastic bags your fingers go numb , you keep moving the bags to different fingers but eventually you drop your bags and lose all your shopping .
" I decided I would make a harness with two hooks to hang your bags on instead .
I find it comfortable to carry two bags on each side .
" There 's a strap over your shoulders with a hook on either end to carry your shopping and a strap across the back to stop you losing your bags if you lean forward . "
The contraption , made from 2 in - wide nylon seatbelt strapping and two strong clasps from dog leads , came together with the help of his wife Rowina .
Mr Martin said : " We made it in the garage .
My wife got her sewing machine out and away we went .
" It 's so comfortable you would n't know you have got it on , you can wear it under your coat .
" I do get a few funny looks and a smile from people , but I think it 's the ideal solution to a problem .
" It 's perfect for people with arthritis in their hands or bad joints .
" You can carry your shopping and wipe your nose , eat fish and chips or talk on the phone at the same time .
" It 's great for mums holding their children 's hands - you could even hold a baby at the same time as carrying your shopping .
You could also use it for laptop cases and other bags . "
The great - grandfather has secured a patent for his invention and has written to the major supermarkets offering them the chance to buy the rights to make and sell it .
" There 's a big market for it , " he said .
" All around the world , people carry their shopping in bags . "
Mr Martin said each set would sell for around £ 6 .
But he does not intend keeping for himself the riches he hopes to make .
" It 's all come a bit late in life for me , but I have told my three grandsons they can have the money , " he said .
A Tesco spokesman said : " This sounds like a really interesting invention .
We 'd be happy to hear more about it and see its practical application . "

If anyone actually read this blog , they might notice a trend in the games I choose to play .
Not simply bargain basement last - generation leftovers that make me want to do violence to myself and those around me , but bargain basement last - generation leftover turn - based strategy games that make me want to do violence to myself and those around me .
I do n't do this because I particularly like the genre , but because I refuse to play a game that requires the use of both my hands when on the subway or toilet .
Hoshigami meets this criteria and my other strict standards in spades , but if DS cards were a little wider and any more absorbent I 'd sooner wipe my ass with it than grunt and heave over this crap another second .
Continue Reading >>
For starters , it takes the single - most valuable aspect of turn - based games - the fact that you do n't have to pay attention to them every single second like a toddler that enjoys eating paint chips - and replaces it with having to push a button at the right moment for any attack to do more than 1 hp of damage .
Sometimes I wish he'd never been born ...
And as long as your eyes are glued to this inanity why not make every single animation unskippable ?
And after every action you should have to sit through not just one display of experience points gained but two .
And enemies should earn experience points too .
Both kinds !
And when it 's finally your turn again there 's no need for a quick save .
This not - plot - related battle should only take another 45 minutes , and anyway that 's what DS sleep mode is for .
And when one of your mercenaries fall , you should be faced with the choice of waiting through 20 unskippable rounds to recharge your single magic resuscitation coin or hiring a new soldier and raising them up from level 1 in the Tower of Trials .
Everyone loves grinding , and leaving your friends for dead will make it high - stakes , just like Fire Emblem .
Except with unreasonably large levels .
And no quick saves .
And unskippable animations .
And paint chips ...

Kennedy did not say : Bush is a fascist .
Instead he said ( in sequence ) :
Fascists are corporate plunderers of the commons Mussolini and Hitler were from the fringe radical right , and were irrelevant until corporations bolstered them Bush is a corporate plunderer of the the commons
Read between the lines .
The implication can't be mistaken .
Kennedy called Bush a fascist , and the progressive Seattle audience clapped and roared approval .
There were Congressmembers in the audience - it was a mainstream crowd that had paid money to hear Kennedy speak .
Kennedy sounded like man speaking at a radical rally .
He talked of the extreme , radical , anti-democratic corporate powers that are destroying our nation - in economic , political and spiritual terms .
This is what we call a backlash .
Vice President Gore says " police state " in a speech .
Robert Kennedy Jr. implies
Bush is a fascist , and I and other radicals are calling ourselves Democrats .
Times have changed - and this was impossible to miss tonight .
I felt at home , listening to a fiery speech about the defense of the republic in a mainstream setting , with a mainstream speaker , amongst a mainstream audience .
Sure , we were progressives - but the words were radical .
And lately more and more of the " sold - out Liberals " that I have been at odds with as a radical have been making sense to me .
Here is something in Salon on Kennedy 's talk of fascism in America ( emphasis added ) :
This week Kennedy declares war on this new " enemy within " -- the term his father applied to the Mafia lords who were subverting American politics , business and labor -- with a passionate , sweeping indictment of the Bush - sanctioned rape of our environment in the latest issue of Rolling Stone .
Kennedy lays out in legal - brief detail how , under Bush , the federal agencies supposed to be guarding our air , water and natural resources have been systematically turned over to the industry foxes that are ravaging them .
But the tone of his lengthy essay is far from lawyerly .
Kennedy 's original subtitle was " Corporate Fascism and the End of Nature . "
Another source on Kennedy calling Bush fascist ( commondreams.org ) :
In the book , Kennedy implies that we live in a fascist country and that the Bush White House has learned key lessons from the Nazis .
" While communism is the control of business by government , fascism is the control of government by business , " he writes .
" My American Heritage Dictionary defines fascism as 'a system of government that exercises a dictatorship of the extreme right , typically through the merging of state and business leadership together with belligerent nationalism . '
Sound familiar ? "
He quotes Hitler 's propaganda chief Herman Goerring : " It is always simply a matter to drag the people along , whether it is a democracy , or a fascist dictatorship , or a parliament , or a communist dictatorship .
The people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders .
That is easy .
All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked , and denounce the peacemakers for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger .
It works the same in any country . "
Kennedy then adds : " The White House has clearly grasped the lesson . "
Kennedy also quotes Benito Mussolini's insight that " fascism should more appropriately be called corporatism because it is the merger of state and corporate power . "
" The biggest threat to American democracy is corporate power , " Kennedy told us .
" There is vogue in the White House to talk about the threat of big government .
But since the beginning of our national history , our most visionary political leaders have warned the American public against the domination of government by corporate power .
That warning is missing in the national debate right now .
Because so much corporate money is going into politics , the Democratic Party itself has dropped the ball .
They just quash discussion about the corrosive impact of excessive corporate power on American democracy . "
Democracy is worth fighting for .
It is a wonderful concept , and the American republic is worth keeping around for the next generations .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - As Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama battle to be the Democratic presidential nominee , the winner could be determined by primaries held weeks ago in Florida and Michigan , even though the party decided to ignore their results .
Both contests have been ruled unofficial because the states violated Democratic Party rules by moving their elections forward in a bid to have more influence in selecting the nominee .
Now Michigan and Florida ’s 366 suspended delegates could prove decisive if neither candidate lands a knockout blow in the states remaining before the party ’s August convention .
Party officials are trying to avoid an ugly standoff that could linger through the summer and anger the 2.4 million voters who participated in the two primaries , both swing states that may be crucial in the November election .
“ The party is certainly concerned that some voters feel their votes did n’t count , ” said Florida Democratic Party spokesman Mark Bubriski .
So far neither state has agreed to stage another contest .
Florida party officials say the state ’s large elderly and military populations would have trouble participating in a caucus , while a mail - based election would cost up to $ 10 million .
Michigan Democratic Sen. Carl Levin said last week it would not be “ practical or fair ” to hold a caucus after 600,000 people have already voted in that state ’s primary .
Others have said it should not decide delegates because many stayed away from the polls on the belief their vote would not count anyway .
The Democratic National Committee had to suspend each state ’s delegates to prevent 20 other states from moving up their contests to January , a spokeswoman said .

“ The rules were upheld to ensure a fair and predictable process and to stop other states from leapfrogging forward , ” said Democratic National Committee spokeswoman Stacie Paxton .
Clinton , a New York senator and former first lady , won both contests , though Obama ’s name was not on the ballot in Michigan .
Slideshow ( 10 images )
The candidates did not campaign in either state , but some Obama TV ads aired in Florida as part of a national package of advertisements , and Clinton flew in to celebrate her victory .
Both attended fundraisers in the state .
Both state parties have since allocated their delegates to the national convention that picks the candidate .
Clinton would get 178 from the two contests , while Obama would get 67 delegates from Florida .
Some 55 delegates in Michigan are “ uncommitted ” since Obama ’s name was not on the ballot .
As of Wednesday , Obama , an Illinois senator , had 1,078 delegates nationally to Clinton ’s 969 , according to MSNBC , not counting the party insiders and elected officials who as “ superdelegates ” can support either candidate .
The two candidates could agree on a solution with regard to Florida and Michigan , but that has not happened yet .
If no agreement is reached , the convention ’s credentials committee would have to decide in July who , if anyone , should be seated .
Clinton has said she will fight to seat both states ’ delegates at the party convention , while the Obama campaign has said it would support another round of contests in those states if given adequate time to compete .
The Michigan and Florida primaries violated Republican Party rules as well , and the Republican Party responded by cutting each state ’s delegate total in half -- a solution that drew relatively little protest from the states or candidates .

EAST RUTHERFORD , N.J. --
The chance to watch the Giants try to mar the Patriots perfect season is n't drawing many Big Blue fans to the stadium this Saturday .
Many New York Giants fans are selling their tickets to the game to New England Patriots fans who want to see quarterback Tom Brady and his teammates go for a 16 - 0 record in their final regular - season game .
Internet auction sites that allow customers to buy and sell sports tickets have seen a surge in ticket sales for the game by Giants fans , The Star - Ledger of Newark reported for Tuesday 's newspapers .
" It looks like it 's on pace to be one of our top 25 events for all time .
It 's definitely one of our hot sellers , " Joellen Ferrer , a spokesman for Internet auction site StubHub , which specializes in tickets for events , told the newspaper .
" Although it 's meaningless to the Giants , it 's still going to be a great game to watch . "
In the first 24 hours after the Giants beat the Bills , more than 200 Giants ticket holders put their seats up for bid on the auction site , eBay .
As of Monday , about 3,000 tickets were available for purchase on StubHub
Tickets on StubHub have gone for as much as $ 1,600 apiece , Ferrer said .
If the Patriots win , they would become the first NFL team to go undefeated during the regular season since the Miami Dolphins finished the 1972 season with a 14 - 0 record .

Facebook Most Americans believe the nation 's founders wrote Christianity into the Constitution , and people are less likely to say freedom to worship covers religious groups they consider extreme , a poll out today finds .
The survey measuring attitudes toward freedom of religion , speech and the press found that 55 % believe erroneously that the Constitution establishes a Christian nation .
In the survey , which is conducted annually by the First Amendment Center , a non-partisan educational group , three out of four people who identify themselves as evangelical or Republican believe that the Constitution establishes a Christian nation .
About half of Democrats and independents do .
ON THE WEB : Read the full poll results
Most respondents , 58 % , say teachers in public schools should be allowed to lead prayers .
That is an increase from 2005 , when 52 % supported teacher - led prayer in public schools .
More people , 43 % , say public schools should be allowed to put on Nativity re-enactments with Christian music than in 2005 , when 36 % did .
Half say teachers should be allowed to use the Bible as a factual text in history class .
That 's down from 56 % in 2000 .
Charles Haynes , a senior scholar at the First Amendment Center , says the findings are particularly troubling during a week when the top diplomat in Iraq gave a report to Congress on progress toward achieving democracy there .
" Americans are dying to create a secular democracy in Iraq , and simultaneously a growing number of people want to see a Christian state " here , he says .
Haynes says the Constitution " clearly established a secular nation where people of all faiths or no faith are protected to practice their religion or no religion without governmental interference . "
Rick Green of WallBuilders , an advocacy group that believes the nation was built on Christian principles , says the poll does n't mean a majority favors a " theocracy " but that the Constitution reflects Christian values , including religious freedom .
" I would call it a Christian document , just like the Declaration of Independence , " he says .
The " scariest " number , in Haynes ' opinion , is that only 56 % agree that freedom of religion applies to all groups " regardless of how extreme their beliefs are . "
That 's down from 72 % in 2000 .
More than one in four say constitutional protection of religion does not apply to " extreme " groups .
Haynes says many Americans consider Islam extreme , especially since the Sept. 11 attacks .
But he says Roman Catholics were viewed that way in the 19th century , and some people still consider Mormons " on the fringe . "
" We are seeing the product of years of not teaching the First Amendment at a young age , " says Gene Policinski , the center 's executive director .
" People are applying their own values … rather than educated knowledge " of the Constitution .
Still , he says , support for constitutional freedoms has rebounded from a low the year after 9/11 , when 49 % said the First Amendment " goes too far in the rights it guarantees . "
Now , 25 % agree .
Other findings : • Seventy - four percent say public school students should not be allowed to wear a T - shirt with a message or picture that others might find offensive , more than at any time since the survey began in 1997 .
• About a third , 34 % , believe the press " has too much freedom " — the lowest percentage in 10 years — but most distrust the news media .
Sixty percent disagree with the statement that the news media try " to report the news without bias . "
Not all questions in the poll were asked every year .
The survey of 1,003 adults Aug. 16 - 26 has a margin of error of +/— 3.2 percentage points .

Falling home values helped push a record number of Californians -- more than double the previous high -- into foreclosure and out of their homes in the last three months of 2007 , data released Tuesday show .
Leandro Hernandez of Chino Hills is among thousands more who could be next .
He tried to sell his house in 2006 to get out of a mortgage he could n’t afford but found no takers .
Faced with a house worth less than his loan balance , he ’s trying to cut a deal with his bank .
But if the lender wo n’t budge , Hernandez , 45 , says he knows what he will tell them .
“ Foreclose me , ” he said defiantly .

Hernandez knows that an eviction is a lengthy process .
“ I ’ll live in the house for free for 12 months , and I ’ll save my money and I ’ll move on . ”
Many have already been forced out or hit the road , helping to drive foreclosures up to 31,676 statewide in the final three months last year .
That ’s more than double the record set in 1996 near the end of the last real estate downturn .
The all - time low was 637 foreclosures statewide in the second quarter of 2005 , when home values were still booming .
The wave of foreclosures that began in late 2006 hit first and hardest in outlying suburbs such as the Antelope Valley and the Inland Empire .

In these areas , people who stretched to buy their first home often found themselves unable to make payments as their adjustable loans reset to higher rates , and falling home values made it impossible for them to refinance .
The latest figures , however , show foreclosures are spreading rapidly into areas that were virtually untouched a year ago .
The five ZIP Codes with the sharpest rise were in Altadena , Costa Mesa , Pico Rivera , Anaheim and Long Beach .
Woodland Hills broker Eli
Tene specializes in short sales , deals in which a lender agrees to allow the sale of a house for less than what is owed on its mortgage so the seller can unload an unaffordable home .
He said affluent homeowners were increasingly distressed .
“ Those people overextended to get in to those neighborhoods .
I have people in Calabasas , Encino , Woodland Hills , Agoura , ” he said .

Statewide , the median price for a home peaked last year in March at $ 484,000 , then fell to $ 402,000 by year ’s end , according to DataQuick Information Services .
Southern California median sales prices peaked in the spring and summer of last year at $ 505,000 and ended the year at $ 425,000 .
When prices drop , some homeowners who owe more on their property than it is worth will often walk away , noted Leo Nordine , a Hermosa Beach broker who sells repossessed homes for banks .
Nordine said his workload had doubled in the last year .
“ When people see appreciation , they fight to hang on to their house , ” he said .
“ When they see it going backward , they ’re more likely to give up . ”
Economist Christopher Thornberg of Los Angeles consulting firm Beacon Economics said the growing number of foreclosures , along with rising unemployment , showed “ it ’s clear California has entered a recession . ”

Rising foreclosures in such Orange County cities as Orange and Costa Mesa stem in part from the crash of sub - prime lenders specializing in loans to people with shaky credit , he said .
“ Costa Mesa was sub - prime alley , ” he said of the lenders based in or near that Orange County city -- including ones that are no longer operating , such as Ameriquest Mortgage Co. and New Century Financial Corp .
“ The industry was born there and died there , so of course the local economy took a hit . ”
The foreclosure peak of 1996 occurred at the end of an economic recession , Thornberg noted .
That makes the sharp rise in foreclosures more alarming , he says , because the recession is just beginning .
“ If you think the market ’s bad now , wait a year , ” he said .
In a recession , the risk of foreclosure rises because people face sudden hardships such as an unexpected job loss .
That ’s what happened to Jacqueline and Oscar Arellano of Riverside .

The couple bought their six - bedroom house six years ago , before the real estate run-up , for about $ 300,000 .
Last March , Oscar , a maintenance electrician , lost his job .
Within weeks , the couple began falling behind on their monthly payments .
Then in October , the payments on their adjustable - rate loan rose to $ 3,200 , from $ 2,200 .
Oscar is working again , but Jacqueline was laid off as a loan officer from Countrywide Financial Corp. last fall .
They recently received a notice of default -- the first step in the foreclosure process -- and are trying to sell their house .
“ My home ’s been on the market for four months and I have n’t had anybody interested in buying it .
The market has just died , ” said Jacqueline , who now works as a bill collector .
As with foreclosures , notices of default are breaking records .
Throughout California , default notices jumped to 81,550 in the fourth quarter , which DataQuick said was the highest since it began tracking default notices in 1992 .

That total was more than double the 37,994 notices sent in the fourth quarter of 2006 .
Many of the homeowners in default will be able to keep their homes , but the odds of them doing so are diminishing .
An estimated 41 % of those in default are able to avoid foreclosure by bringing their payments current , refinancing or selling their home to pay off their loan , DataQuick reported .
A year ago , 71 % of homeowners in default were able to recover .
In Southern California , Riverside County saw the biggest jump in default notices , up 119 % from a year ago .
Orange County was a close second , with a 116 % increase from the fourth quarter of 2006 .

San Bernardino saw a 106 % increase , San Diego was up 95 % , and Ventura 89 % .
Los Angeles County fared better than other Southern California counties , with an 83 % increase in defaults .

It is hard not to stare .
At the end of a dirt track , deep in the Thai jungle , a group of women sit in the shade , fingering the coils of brass which snake tightly around their unnaturally long , giraffe - like necks .
It 's absolutely a human zoo - one solution is for tourists to stop going
Kitty McKinsey
UNHCR
" It 's incredible , " says a Canadian tourist , snapping away with his camera , as the women pose - heads bobbing stiffly far above their shoulders - and try to sell him a few souvenirs from the doorsteps of their bamboo huts .
For years the prospect of visiting one of three " long - necked " Kayan villages in this remote corner of north - western Thailand , close to the Burmese border , has been a major lure for foreign tourists .
In return , the visitors have helped to provide a very modest income for the Kayan women and their families , who are all refugees from Burma .
Boycott ?
But in a dramatic intervention , the United Nations is now talking of the need for a tourism boycott , amid allegations that the Kayan are being trapped in a " human zoo " .
The United Nations refugee agency ( UNHCR ) says that for the past two years , the Thai authorities have refused to allow a group of 20 Kayan to leave the country , despite firm offers to resettle them in Finland and New Zealand .
The suspicion is that the women are being kept in Thailand because of the central role they play in the local tourism industry .
" We do n't understand why these 20 are not allowed to start new lives , " said the UNHCR 's regional spokeswoman , Kitty McKinsey .
" The Thai authorities are treating them in a special way , " she argued , pointing out that some 20,000 other Burmese refugees had recently been allowed to move to third countries .
Actually they are n't refugees
Thai official
They absolutely are refugees
UNHCR official
" It 's absolutely a human zoo , " she said .
" One solution is for tourists to stop going . "
At the centre of this increasingly heated dispute is a quietly determined 23 - year - old woman called Zember , who has proudly worn her tribe 's traditional neck rings since she was five .
Zember and her family fled their home in the hills of eastern Burma 18 years ago .
Her mother , Mu Pao , remembers government troops raiding their village and taking the men away by force to work as porters .
Like tens of thousands of people , the Kayan headed for the Thai border .
But instead of being kept with the other refugees , the " long - necked " families were put in a separate compound a few yards from the official camp .
Since then , the ethnic conflicts inside Burma have raged on , and the Kayan community in Thailand has swelled to about 500 .
" At least we 're safe here and we can earn some money , " said Mu Pao .
Each tourist pays a 250 baht ( US $ 8 ; £ 4 ) entrance fee .
Better deal
Other older women in the village agreed that , with little hope of ever returning to Burma , earning 1500 baht a month to be stared at by tourists was an acceptable deal .
But in 2005 , a far better deal emerged .
The UNHCR began offering permanent resettlement abroad to the many thousands of refugees still living in the area .
Zember is challenging both tribal tradition and the Thai government
Many of the Kayan applied , and Zember and her family were quickly told they 'd been accepted .
" I was so happy , " said Zember .
" They tell me a house is already waiting for us in New Zealand . "
For the past two years , however , the Thai authorities have refused to sign the paperwork needed for Zember and 19 others to leave the country .
" Actually they are n't refugees , " said Wachira Chotirosseranee , the deputy district officer and refugee camp commander , who insisted this was a purely bureaucratic matter with no connection to the local tourism industry .
" According to the regulations , you have to live inside the refugee camp .
They do n't meet the criteria . "
The Thai authorities argue that the Kayan are economic migrants who earn a good living from the tourist trade and have chosen to settle outside the refugee camps .
Zember herself - with rings - features in the area 's own publicity
" They absolutely are refugees , " said the UNHCR 's Kitty McKinsey .
" It comes as a great surprise that the Thai authorities are criticising them for living outside the camps , when it was the Thai authorities who wanted them to live ( outside ) . "
In frustration , and as an act of protest , Zember has now taken off her neck rings .
" It felt uncomfortable at first , " she said , rubbing her throat .
Over the years , the rings push the women 's shoulders and ribs down , making their necks appear stretched .
" Because of my rings I have suffered many problems , " she said .
" I wear them not for tourists .
I wear them for tradition ...
Now I feel like a prisoner . "
A panel of scientists convened by the country ’s leading scientific advisory group says the hunt for extraterrestrial life should be greatly expanded to include what they call “ weird life ” : organisms that lack DNA or other molecules found in life as we know it .
“ The committee ’s investigation makes clear that life is possible in forms different from those on Earth , ” the scientists conclude in their report , “ The Limits of Organic Life in Planetary Systems , ” published yesterday by the National Research Council .
Other experts hailed the report as an important rethinking of the search for life .
“ It ’s going to help us a lot to make sure we go exploring with our eyes wide open , ” said Michael A. Meyer , lead scientist for NASA ’s Mars exploration program .
Starfish , sequoias , salamanders and the rest of Earth ’s residents may seem very diverse , but they are surprisingly similar on the molecular scale .
All species that scientists have studied need liquid water to survive , for example .
Further , they all rely on DNA to carry genetic information , and they all use that information to build proteins from the same set of building blocks , known as amino acids .
In September 2006 , the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the Rockefeller Foundation teamed up to launch “ AGRA ” a $ 150 million Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa .
Echoing the claim that Africa ‘s last Green Revolution ( originally promoted by Rockefeller ) had “ bypassed ” the continent , Gates and Rockefeller promised that AGRA will improve the lives of the continent ’s impoverished farmers by investing in appropriate technology , efficient farm practices , and a network of small shopkeepers to sell mini-packets of improved seeds and fertilizers .
Elegantly simple in its proposal and presentation , AGRA is the global face of a renewed international effort to revive Africa ‘s sagging agricultural research institutions and introduce new Green Revolution products across the sub-Sahara .
The complex array of institutional and financial interests lining up behind Gates and Rockefeller include multilateral and bilateral aid organizations , national and international research institutes , and the handful of powerful multinational seed , chemical , and fertilizer monopolies upon which the entire financial future of the new Green Revolution ultimately rests .
Gates and Rockefeller foundations are betting that AGRA can entice industry , governments and other philanthropies to invest in African agriculture .
AGRA is the Green Revolution ’s new philanthropic flagship leading a global campaign to attract talent , investment and resources for another go at Africa ‘s beleaguered food systems .
The new Green Revolution differs fundamentally from the first one introduced in the 1970 - 90s in that this time the private sector , rather than government , is taking the lead .
This Green Revolution is concentrating on Africa ‘s food crops like tubers and plantains , rather than global commodities like corn , rice and wheat .
This time around , the conventional crop breeding programs being built in Africa will lay the genetic and industrial groundwork for the expansion of genetically modified crops .
And more importantly , the seed and chemical companies that stand to gain from the Green Revolution are fewer , and because of biotechnology , much bigger and vertically integrated , selling both seed and inputs .
In fact , only two companies - Monsanto and Syngenta - control 30 % of the global market in seeds .
These monopolies and others are entering Africa markets with the help of CGIAR - the Consultative Group for International Agricultural Research , USAID , and Britain ’s DFID , even Jeffery Sacks ’ Millennium Villages .
But these same institutions - along with a host of national - level agricultural institutes - failed for three decades to establish the first Green Revolution in Africa .
Indeed , with AGRA , Gates is picking up where lesser philanthropists ( Rockefeller , Sarakawa 2000 ) and politicians ( Jimmy Carter , Bill Clinton ) ran out of steam .
The explanations given by northern institutions for the failure of the first Green Revolution have been many : Africa ‘s soils are too poor , its terrain is too broken , the infrastructure is lacking , its research institutions are weak , its farmers are too traditional Nowhere , of course do any of the Green Revolution champions question the assumptions , premises or technologies of the Green Revolution itself .
Nor do they admit to any social , economic or environmental failures in Asia , Latin America , and - yes , parts of Africa - where the Green Revolution was “ successfully ” implemented .
There is extensive documentation demonstrating that the first Green Revolution deepened the divide between rich and poor farmers and degraded tropical agro-ecosystems , exposing already vulnerable farmers to increased environmental risk .
It led to loss of seed / plant varieties and agro- biodiversity , the basis for smallholder livelihood security and regional environmental sustainability .
But putting these considerations aside for the moment , how does AGRA propose succeeding where others have failed ?
NEW ALLIANCE FOR CREATIVE CAPITALISM
At his special appearance at this year ’s World Economic Forum in Davos , Switzerland , Bill Gates gave us his answer : creative capitalism .
This , he explained to the world ’s financial masters , was “ [ An ] approach where governments , businesses , and nonprofits work together to stretch the reach of market forces so that more people can make a profit , or gain recognition , doing work that eases the world ’s inequities . ”
Gates acknowledged that capitalism does not work well for the poor .
His explanation is that this is because there are no international market incentives to fight poverty or hunger .
( This reasoning , of course , ignores the ways that international markets have actually produced hunger and poverty , but we will set this consideration aside for the moment also )
Gates takes a fairly standard neoliberal approach to solving the market incentive problem by insisting that the market is still the primary engine for social transformation .
The difficulty is in persuading those who do have market power that eradicating hunger is in their own best interest .
To address this challenge , Gates invites his fellow capitalists to consider the benefits of social recognition - as well as eventual profits - as the missing market - based incentive in order to make capitalism work well for everybody .
“ Recognition , ” said Bill Gates , “ enhances a company ’s reputation and appeals to customers ; above all , it attracts good people to the organization .
As such , recognition triggers a market - based reward for good behavior .
In markets where profits are not possible , recognition is a proxy ; where profits are possible , recognition is an added incentive . ”
Recognition of the good deeds done by capitalists will build the markets necessary to bring the poor the benefits of capitalism , thus ushering in a new system Gates calls “ creative capitalism . ”
That same week in Davos , the soon - to - retire president of Microsoft put his money where his mouth was by giving another $ 306 million to AGRA .
That ’s a lot of recognition , by anyone ’s standards .
Clearly , the “ halo effect ” created by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundations ’ altruism will benefit everyone associated with AGRA - from the CGIAR to Monsanto , DuPont and Syngenta .
This “ added incentive ” is calculated to make the sub -Sahara an attractive market to high power global corporations accustomed to 25 % and 40 % profit increases per year .
The poor may not have much to spend ( according to Rockefeller Foundation , half the sub -Saharan population earns less than $ 0.65 a day ) , but the purchases of small amounts of seed and inputs by180 million poor farmers add up .
The new Green Revolution is banking on a small but steady increase in their enormous collective purchasing power .
To understand AGRA - and Gates ’ creative capitalism - it is helpful to distinguish AGRA ‘s mission from its job .
AGRA ‘s mission is “ To [ work in partnership ] across the African continent to help millions of small - scale farmers and their families lift themselves out of poverty and hunger . ”
AGRA ‘s job - as so eloquently stated by Bill Gates in Davos - is to bring Africa ‘s poor into the international market .
Here , they will consume both hybrid and genetically - modified seeds , fertilizers and agrochemicals .
They will also consume the products of these seeds , making their diet dependent on the companies driving the Green Revolution .
Whoever can establish these seed markets in Africa will control not only the markets , but the food , and ultimately the ground of the vast continent .
But while these corporations and institutions are the driving market forces behind AGRA , they are not in and of themselves the reason behind Bill Gates ’ call for creative capitalism , or his decision to address hunger and poverty in Africa .
Gates ’ remarkable bequest still begs the question of his own making : as a creative capitalist , what - or for whom - is AGRA ‘s market - based reward ?
Recognition for Microsoft ?
Undeniable , but not significant or necessary for a company who already has all the recognition it wants .
Gates ’ financial interests in genetic engineering ?
These investments pale behind AGRA itself .
The answer is ; there is no market - based reward .
Rather , the prize is political .
AGRA , backed by Gates ’ enormous philanthropic power , bolstered by the best world - renown diplomats and CEOs money can buy , and driven by the sheer financial and institutional momentum of the industrial players within the Green Revolution , is a political machine of immense proportions .
AGRA allows the Gates foundation unprecedented influence not only in setting the national food and agricultural policies of many African governments , but in the agenda - setting of continental agreements ( like NEPAD ) , multilateral development institutions ( e.g. FAO ) , the strategies of agricultural research centers ( e.g. WARDA ) , and the political economic re-structuring of Africa ’s food systems in general .
The Alliance for a Green Revolution for Africa is the Gates ’ Foundations bold foray into big philanthropy ’s latest incarnation : philanthro - capitalism .
Philanthro - capitalist Development
In Michael Edwards new book “ Just Another Emperor , ” philanthro - capitalism is the term given to the movement taking hold that “ promises to save the world by revolutionizing philanthropy , making non-profit organizations operate like business , and creating new markets for goods and services that benefit society . ”
This neo-liberal brand of philanthropy distinguishes itself from charity and progressive philanthropy by insisting not only on market - based results , but on business - based procedures for grant giving .
Philanthro - capitalists seek business efficiencies and a financial “ bottom line ” from their “ investments ” and concentrate on making global markets work better .
A logical extension of current of neo-liberal hegemony , philanthro - capitalism sees unregulated markets not only as engines for creating wealth , but as the ultimate drivers of social change .
In this view , governments are too bureaucratic and corrupt , and social movements too unruly and inefficient .
Only the market can save us from well , the market .
However , the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is taking philanthro - capitalism into the realm of superpowers .
Because the Foundation holds 10 % of all U.S. philanthropy funds , AGRA is not just a philanthropy acting like businesses , but an Über - philanthropy so large and powerful it can influence governments and supra-national institutions .
This is not to say that Gates or AGRA acts independently of Warren Buffet , Jeffrey Sachs , the FAO , USAID , CGIAR , Monsanto , Syngenta , DuPont or the fertilizer companies cheering it on .
On the contrary , there is a general consensus in enthusiastically in favor of the AGRA campaign .
The reasons are both global and regional .
First , despite the hype regarding financial globalization , industrial capitalism has been suffering from falling rates of return and stagnant economic growth ( 1 - 2 % ) for almost three decades .
This is due to cyclical crises of overproduction : i.e. to much money and goods with too few borrowers and buyers .
It is essential for the large monopolies to create new markets ( witness the global biofuels craze ) , or overrun existing markets in order to find buyers for their goods .
Seed and chemical giants like Monsanto and Syngenta look to AGRA and Africa ‘s food systems to solve their problems .
They must replace local seeds and agroecological practices with their own commercial seeds and agrochemicals .
Second , while western capital is falling over itself to sell products to China , they are extremely nervous about China ‘s entry into global markets as a competitive seller - particularly in Africa .
It is important for western seed and chemical corporations , and all of the research institutions that produce new materials for these companies , to “ sew up ” the African market .
Even though the marginal returns to their investments are small , the Green Revolution does not want to lose 180 million consumers to the Chinese .
BUT , CAN AGRA SUCCEED ?
Whether or not AGRA can successfully bring the new Green Revolution to Africa , and whether or not the Green Revolution will benefit the poor as much as it benefits the capitalists being courted by the Gates Foundation are two different questions that should be open to public debate .
Unfortunately , there was never a public debate on AGRA .
There are many productive agroecological farming systems in Africa that do not depend on GMOs or other Green Revolution technologies , but these alternatives were never considered .
Whether or not AGRA can re-start the Green Revolution in Africa is yet to be seen .
What is clear thus far is that it has been successful in eliminating competition for the control of African food systems .
AGRA ‘s philanthro - capitalism draws the world ’s attention away from local alternatives and towards global market - based “ solutions ” that ultimately favor those with more international market power , i.e. , the seed and chemical monopolies .
Though it strengthens corporate opportunities and power , it does nothing to address the weakened ministerial and regulatory capacity of the state , ignores the need to protect local markets or ensure a greater market share of the value chain for farmers .
It elides land issues and does not address the eroding economic and environmental resiliency of African food systems .
Worse , it diverts attention away from the role that the global markets play in creating hunger and poverty in Africa in the first place .
Can AGRA actually solve these problems ?
Not without addressing their causes .

President Dwight Eisenhower was the first president to coin the phrase " executive privilege , " but not the first to invoke its principle : namely , that a president has the right to withhold certain information from Congress , the courts or anyone else -- even when faced with a subpoena .
Executive privilege , though , is a murky and mysterious concept .
Here , an attempt to clarify the murk .
Does the Constitution allow for executive privilege ?
Nowhere does the Constitution mention the term or the concept of executive privilege .
The belief that it does , the late legal historian Raoul Berger once said , is one of the greatest " constitutional myths . "
So how can a president simply withhold information if the Constitution does n't give him the power to do so ?
Presidents have argued that executive privilege is a principle implied in the constitutionally mandated separation of powers .
In order to do their job , presidents contend , they need candid advice from their aides -- and aides simply wo n't be willing to give such advice if they know they might be called to testify , under oath , before a congressional committee or in some other forum .
How long have presidents been invoking executive privilege ?
For as long as there have been presidents .
In 1792 , George Washington rebuffed efforts by Congress and the courts to get information about a disastrous expedition against American Indian tribes along the Ohio River .
Washington lost that battle , and he handed over all of the papers that Congress had requested .
But that has n't stopped many presidents over the years from invoking executive privilege .
Who usually wins these battles : the president or Congress ?
It can go either way .
President Eisenhower successfully kept officials from his administration from testifying at the Army 's hearings on Sen. Joe McCarthy .
( The hearings concerned allegations that McCarthy had pressured the Army to give preferential treatment to a former aide , and McCarthy 's counter - charges . )
During the Watergate investigation , though , President Nixon failed in his attempts to withhold White House audio recordings from special prosecutor Leon Jaworski .
Nixon handed over the tapes and , four days later , resigned .
In his memoirs , Nixon wrote dejectedly , " I was the first president to test the principle of executive privilege in the Supreme Court , and by testing it on such a weak ground , I probably ensured the defeat of my cause . "
Did n't the Nixon case settle the issue of executive privilege once and for all ?
No .
In fact , in its ruling on the Nixon tapes , the Supreme Court noted " the valid need for protection of communications between high government officials and those who advise and assist them in the performance of their manifold duties . "
In other words , while rejecting Nixon 's particular claim of executive privilege , the court left the door open for future claims by future presidents .
And there 's a key distinction to keep in mind :
The Nixon case was part of a criminal investigation ; the current case involving the Bush administration is not .
Is executive privilege a partisan issue ?
No .
Presidents from both parties have invoked executive privilege .
And neither side has a clear winning record .
In 1998 , President Clinton became the fist president since Nixon to invoke executive privilege and lose in the courts , when a federal judge ruled Clinton aides could be called to testify in the Monica Lewinsky scandal .
Do presidents invoke executive privilege mainly in matters of national security ?
No , not at all .
Presidents have cited the privilege for all sorts of issues .
For instance , the Bush administration invoked the spirit , if the not letter , of executive privilege when it argued that Vice President Dick Cheney need not disclose what was discussed during his Taskforce on Energy meetings .
The Supreme Court upheld the administration 's claim in 2004 .
But Justice Anthony Kennedy , writing for the majority , issued this warning : " Once executive privilege is asserted , coequal branches of the government are set on a collision course . "
Could this current case -- involving requests for documents from Bush administration officials -- end up in the courts ?
It 's possible , but not likely , legal experts say .
Neither side wants to get mired in a protracted legal battle , so the prospect of a negotiated solution is more likely .
Since 1975 , 10 senior administration officials have been called to testify before Congress , but the disputes were all resolved before getting to court .
No president has mounted a court fight to keep his aides from testifying on Capitol Hill .
Why has executive privilege been such a contentious issue ?
Because it is at the fulcrum of a very delicate balancing act -- between a president 's right to candid advice and Congress ' right to information .
Also , executive privilege is a power that political parties tend to support when they control the White House , but abhor when they 're out of power .
For that reason , neither party is eager for a definitive ruling from the Supreme Court .
For its part , the high court seems to be in no hurry to wade into such contentious constitutional waters .

The ' pink ' gang has staged protests against corrupt officials
They wear pink saris and go after corrupt officials and boorish men with sticks and axes .
The several hundred vigilante women of India 's northern Uttar Pradesh state 's Banda area proudly call themselves the " gulabi gang " ( pink gang ) , striking fear in the hearts of wrongdoers and earning the grudging respect of officials .
The pink women of Banda shun political parties and NGOs because , in the words of their feisty leader , Sampat Pal Devi , " they are always looking for kickbacks when they offer to fund us " .
Two years after they gave themselves a name and an attire , the women in pink have thrashed men who have abandoned or beaten their wives and unearthed corruption in the distribution of grain to the poor .
They have also stormed a police station and attacked a policeman after they took in an untouchable man and refused to register a case .
Poorest
" Nobody comes to our help in these parts .
The officials and the police are corrupt and anti-poor .
So sometimes we have to take the law in our hands .
At other times , we prefer to shame the wrongdoers , " says Sampat Pal Devi , between teaching a " gang " member on how to use a lathi ( traditional Indian stick ) in self defence .
We are a gang for justice
Sampat Pal Devi
Banda is at the heart of the blighted region that is Bundelkhand , one of the poorest parts of one of India 's most populous states .
It is among the poorest 200 districts in India which were first targeted for the federal government 's massive jobs - for - work programme .
Over 20 % of its 1.6 million people living in 600 villages are lower castes or untouchables .
Drought has parched its already arid , single - crop lands .
Banda is one of the poorest districts in Uttar Pradesh
To make matters worse , women bear the brunt of poverty and discrimination in Banda 's highly caste - ridden , feudalistic and male dominated society .
Dowry demands and domestic and sexual violence are common .
Locals say it is not surprising that a women 's vigilante group has sprung up in this landscape of poverty , discrimination and chauvinism .
Sampat Pal Devi is a wiry woman , wife of an ice cream vendor , mother of five children , and a former government health worker who set up and leads the " pink gang " .
" Mind you , " she says , " we are not a gang in the usual sense of the term .
We are a gang for justice . "
' Uproot the corrupt '
Her seeds of rebellion were sown very early on when in face of her parents ' resistance to send her to school , she began writing and drawing on the walls , floors and dust - caked village streets .
She finally ended up going to school , but was married off when she was nine in a region where child marriages are common .
At 12 , she went to live with her husband and at 13 she had her first child .
Sampat Pal Devi says nobody helps the poor
To keep the home fires burning , Sampat Devi began to work as a government health worker , but she quit after a while because her job was not satisfying enough .
" I wanted to work for the people , not for myself alone .
I was already holding meetings with people , networking with women who were ready to fight for a cause , and was ready with a group of women two years ago , " she says .
Sitting outside a home in Attara , Sampat Devi waves her calloused hands , breaks into a rousing song to " uproot the corrupt and be self reliant " , and animatedly talks to women - and men - who flock to her with their problems .
A mother brings in her weeping daughter who has been thrown out by her husband demanding 20,000 rupees from her parents .
" He married me for the love of money , " sobs Malti .
Sampat Devi tells her " gang " that they will soon march to the girl 's house and demand an explanation from the husband .
" If they do n't take her back and keep her well , we will resort to other measures , " she says .
' No handouts '
The pink sorority is not exactly a group of male - bashing feminists - they claim they have returned 11 girls who were thrown out of their homes to their spouses because " women need men to live with " .
That is also why men like Jai Prakash Shivhari join the " gulabi " gang and talk with remarkable passion about child marriages , dowry deaths , depleting water resources , farm subsidies and how funds are being stolen in government projects .
" We do n't want donations or handouts .
We do n't want appeasement or affirmative action .
Give us work , pay us proper wages and restore our dignity , " he says .
The women in the " gulabi gang " echo the same sentiment - but Sampat Devi has a separate agenda for women .
The women thrashed a policeman in protest against the arrest of a poor man
" Village society in India is loaded against women .
It refuses to educate them , marries them off too early , barters them for money .
Village women need to study and become independent to sort it out themselves , " she says .
Where do the pink women go from here ?
They already claim to have done some work in combating crime and corruption in the area .
Last year , Sampat Devi contested the state polls as an independent candidate and mustered only 2,800 votes .
" Joining politics is not my chosen way to help people .
We will keep up our good work , so the state does not take us for granted , " she says .
In the badlands of Uttar Pradesh where nothing seems to work for the poor , this itself is a laudable aim .
My dad just called .
He said one of his fifteen - year - old students asked , “ Why do we need to know this ?
How will To Kill a Mockingbird help me in life ? ”
My dad loves questions like that because he has asked them himself .
My dad has always loved school .
He was the kid who did the extra credit even though he already had an A .
So he had a lot of options at the end of college .
He applied to two graduate schools : Yale for history and Harvard for law .
He got into them both .
Before I tell you what he chose , I have to tell you about my family .
Rich .
Mob money .
My great - grandfather , my dad ’s grandpa , was the lawyer for the Chicago mob : solid work during prohibition and a reliable profession during the depression .
Money flowed freely during my dad ’s college days , but his grandfather threatened the inheritance if my dad chose history over law .
The way my dad tells the story , he always knew he wanted to teach , but he was scared to risk his family “ ? s wrath , to say nothing of their wealth .
So , after Harvard , my dad went to the top law firm in Chicago ( without even having to interview . )
My dad hated it , but he was n’t a risk taker , so he hated it for a long time , thinking the money was worth it .
Like the BMW : he drove one of the first cars ( when the motorcycle company diversified in desperation ) and the cars were so rare that the BMWs would flash each other when they passed .
( I ’d yell from the back seat , “ Hey , there ’s one !
Flash , Dad , flash ! )
There came a point , though when my dad asked himself , “ Why do I need to know about all these cases ?
How is this helping me in life ? ”
His grandpa died , his law firm merged , and the bottom of the BMW fell out .
Finally , after years of thinking his career would get better , it did n’t , and he quit .
He went to graduate school to teach high school history .
He was older than all the professors .
His kids were older than all the students .
After thirty years of practicing law , he started over .
I asked him about classes and he ’s say , “ It ’s hard to go back to school .
It ’s hard to no know what I ’m dong after so many years of doing the same thing . ”
He said his favorite class was the history of civil rights , because when they got to the ’60s he could write papers about his college days .
Upon graduation , everyone in his class got interviews and he did n’t .
No one even talked about age discrimination because it was so obviously there and so obviously unavoidable .
Finally , though , he got a job .
Teaching English .
He wanted to teach history , but he ’s entry level now .
It ’s like doing HTML when you ’ve got a degree in computer science .
But my dad is thrilled .
He took a big career risk and he ’s happy .
He ’s happy to be interacting with the students , but also , I have a feeling that he ’s happy he took a risk .
Changing careers is so scary , but it ’s so empowering - it gives you assurance that you can al ways choose to do what you want most — the hard part is to know yourself well enough to know what that is .
So think like a fifteen - year - old and ask yourself , “ Why am I doing this ? ”
And then think like a risk taker and jump like my dad when you know your time is right .
Traveling to another Earth - like world just got a lot easier .
It turns out that there may be many other dirt - and - water planets lurking at the edges of our solar system in places like the Oort Cloud .
These planets , which could be roughly the size of our own , would contain all the elements we need for life .
They 're just sitting in a cold , dimly - lit part of the solar system , waiting to be defrosted and colonized .
Yesterday , NASA scientists announced that this changes the prognosis for nearby livable planets .

NASA 's Alan Stern said these planets are so far away from the sun that we have n't seen them yet :
Our old view , that the Solar System had nine planets will be supplanted by a view that there are hundreds if not thousands of planets in our Solar System .
It could be that there are objects of Earth - mass in the Oort cloud ( a band of debris surrounding our planetary system ) but they would be frozen at these distances .
They would look like a frozen Earth .

So all we need to do is haul one of those babies into our orbit , defrost it , and start populating .
Earth 2 , here I come !
Beyond our solar system , millions more Earth 2s await .
University of Arizona astronomer Michael Meyer , co-author of a study about extrasolar dirt - and - water worlds , told reporters :
Our observations suggest that between 20 % and 60 % of Sun - like stars have evidence for the formation of rocky planets not unlike the processes we think led to planet Earth .
That is very exciting .

Although I 've taken the rest of the year off , I wanted to share a few fun classics this week .
No Quack was originally published on 2006 - 12 - 01 , and has become one of my all time favorites ...
M.A. is one of the world 's foremost experts on neural networks .
His undergraduate specialty was artificial intelligence , his master 's thesis was about genetic algorithms , and his doctoral dissertation covered evolutionary programming .
Such an extensive computer science education opened up a wide range of career options , ranging from a professor at a university to ... a professor at another university .
When someone outside of academia sought out his expertise for a project , he jumped at the opportunity .
The company that wanted to hire M.A. was a small programming firm that developed and maintained software used by the Bureau of Water Management .
They were recently awarded a large contract to redo a rather inefficient part of the system and were convinced that implementing a neural network was the way to go .
After the initial interview , M.A. told them that a neural network was the wrong tool for the job and that they should use a traditional approach .
Management disagreed with his assessment and insisted that he come aboard to help rebuild the system .
Had they not offered such a generous salary , he might have recognized this as a first warning sign .
M.A's first few weeks were spent analyzing the existing system and its processes .
Water testing equipment throughout the region sent data in a variety of different formats to the central processing server .
The data was logged in a single database table with three columns : Station Number , Recording Date , and Raw Data .
Each week , a team of seven technicians would spend a day manually parsing the Raw Data -- be it in CSV , fixed - width , XML , etc. -- and inserting the formatted data into another database table .
A script would then parse the standardized data and create the weekly water reports .
Management wanted to create a Neural Network that would learn how to parse the raw data and free up the technicians so they could do their regular job .
Armed with all the details of the process , M.A. explained that this was a very bad idea .
He argued that :
Neural Networks are not designed to handle tasks like this
If developed , such a Neural Network would need a lot of training
An algorithmic version could be developed in a fraction of the time and do the job better
Management disagreed .
They insisted that Neural Networks were the wave of the future and wanted M.A. to go forward with developing it .
He grudgingly agreed and got to work designing the system .
There would have to be a different Neural Network for each type of equipment , a server to keep track of the networks ' activities , a learner application for all networks , and an encapsulation around each network to allow it to reset in order to adapt to changes once it was fully trained .
M.A. explained the mess that would be required in implementing a Neural Network approach and tried once again to convince them to go with at traditional approach .
They disagreed and actually complimented him on coming up with such a " clever " approach .
He started development .
Nearly a year later , the system was complete .
And it was a horrible mess .
It required a server cluster to run the analysis , produced and executed horribly ugly and slow code at runtime , consumed a ridiculous amount of RAM , and needed at least a full week of training for each node .
But it worked .
Before heading back to academia , M.A. tried one last time to convince them to drop the neural network .
They would n't budge .
Fast forward three years , and the programming firm was bought and given a completely new management team .
The new CTO got wind of the behemoth that M.A. created and called him up to find out the reason behind such an " eccentric " implementation .
M.A. explained everything and even forwarded the CTO a proposal that he created for a traditional solution long before starting the neural network .
The new CTO was more than pleased and wanted to bring M.A. in once again to develop the traditional solution .
A few weeks later -- and after receiving another generous paycheck -- the new solution runs on a single server and is able to calculate , alert , and report on any issues within two minutes of a station updating their log file .
Not wanting to throw away a several hundred thousand dollar investment , the CTO decided to put the monstrous neural network to use doing something else : prose .
The developers spent a few hours re-training it to work from a dataset of phrases and output actual sentences instead of tokenized log lines .
The reports it generates included in a section of the company 's newsletter .
Following is one of its more recent creations .

WASHINGTON , Oct. 16 — Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates is pressing for the nearly 10,000 armed security contractors now working for the United States government in Iraq to fall under a single authority , most likely the American military , in an effort to bring Blackwater USA under tighter control , senior administration officials and Pentagon advisers say .
That idea is facing resistance from the State Department , which relies heavily for protection in Iraq on some 2,500 private guards , including more than 800 Blackwater contractors , to provide security for American diplomats in Baghdad .
The State Department has said it should retain control over those guards , despite Blackwater ’s role in a September shooting in Baghdad that exposed problems in the current oversight arrangements .
In practical terms , placing the private security guards who now work for the military , the State Department and other government agencies under a single authority would mean that those armed civilians would no longer have different bosses and different rules .
Pentagon advisers say it would also allow better coordination between the security contractors and American military commanders , who have long complained that the contractors often operate independently .
Mr. Gates has not publicly stated his final position on any reorganization , but his thinking on how to manage security contractors was described by administration officials , military officers and outside advisers to the Defense Department , who spoke on condition of anonymity .
As al - Tallal , 50 , walked towards her house , one of three men in the Opel stepped out and raked her with bullets .
A women 's rights campaigner , Umm Salam - a nickname - knows about the three men in the Opel : they tried to kill her on 11 December last year .
It was a Sunday , she recalls , and 15 bullets were fired into her own car as she drove home from teaching at an internet cafe .
A man in civilian clothes got out of the car and opened fire .
Three bullets hit her , one lodging close to her spinal cord .
Her 20 - year - old son was hit in the chest .
Umm Salam saw the gun - a police - issue Glock .
She is convinced her would - be assassin works for the state .
The shootings of al - Tallal and Umm Salam are not isolated incidents , even in Najaf - a city almost exclusively Shia and largely insulated from the sectarian violence of the North .
Bodies of young women have appeared in its dusty lanes and avenues , places patrolled by packs of dogs where the boundaries bleed into the desert .
It is a favourite place for dumping murder victims .
Iraqis do not like to talk about it much , but there is an understanding of what is going on these days .
If a young woman is abducted and murdered without a ransom demand , she has been kidnapped to be raped .
Even those raped and released are not necessarily safe : the response of some families to finding that a woman has been raped has been to kill her .
Iraq 's women are living with a fear that is increasing in line with the numbers dying violently every month .
They die for being a member of the wrong sect and for helping their fellow women .
They die for doing jobs that the militants have decreed that they cannot do : for working in hospitals and ministries and universities .
They are murdered , too , because they are the softest targets for Iraq 's criminal gangs .
Iraq 's women live in terror of speaking their opinions ; of going out to work ; or defying the strict new prohibitions on dress and behaviour applied across Iraq by Islamist militants , both Sunni and Shia .
They live in fear of their husbands , too , as women 's rights have been undermined by the country 's postwar constitution that has taken power from the family courts and given it to clerics .
' Women are being targeted more and more , ' said Umm Salam last week .
Her husband was a university professor who was executed in 1991 under Saddam Hussein after the Shia uprising .
She survived by running her family farm .
When the Americans arrived she got involved in civic action , teaching illiterate women how to read and vote , independent from the influence of their husbands .
She helped them fill in forms for benefits and set up a sewing workshop .
In doing so she put herself at mortal risk .
And since the assassination attempt , like many women in Najaf , she has found it hard to work .
Which is what the men in the white Opel wanted .
To silence the women like Umm Salam , who is 42 .
' It is very difficult for women here .
There is a lot of pressure on our personal freedoms .
None of us feels that we can have an opinion on anything any more .
If she does , she risks being killed . '
It is a story familiar to women across Iraq , betrayed by the country 's new constitution that guaranteed them a 25 per cent share of membership of the Council of Representatives .
That guarantee has turned instead into a fig leaf hiding what women activists now call a ' human rights catastrophe for Iraqi women ' .
After a month - long investigation , The Observer has established that in almost every major area of human rights , women are being seriously discriminated against , in some cases seeing their conditions return to those of females in the Middle Ages .
In areas such as the Shia militia stronghold of Sadr City in east Baghdad , women have been beaten for not wearing socks .
Even the headscarf and juba - the ankle - length , flared coat that buttons to the collar - are not enough for the zealots .
Some women have been threatened with death unless they wear the full abbaya , the black , all - encompassing veil .
Similar reports are emerging from Mosul , where it is Sunni extremists who are laying down the law , and Kirkuk .
Women from Karbala , Hilla , Basra and Nassariyah have all told The Observer similar stories .
Of the insidious spread of militia and religious party control - and how members of those same groups are , paradoxically , increasingly responsible for the rape and murder of women outside their sects and communities .
' There is a member of my organisation , an activist who is a Christian , ' said Yanar Mohammed , head of the Organisation for Iraqi Women 's Freedom , who has had death threats for her work in protecting women threatened by domestic violence or ' honour ' killings .
' She would have to walk home each day to her neighbourhood through an area controlled by one of the Islamic Shia militias , the Jaish al - Mahdi .
She does not wear a veil so she gets abused by these men .
About three weeks ago , one of them starts following her home saying that he wants a sexual relationship with her .
He tells her what he wants to do , and if she does n't agree he says she will be kidnapped .
In the end he thinks that , because he is armed , because he threatens her existence , she will have to agree to a " pleasure marriage " [ a temporary sexual union arranged by a cleric ] . '
Strong anecdotal evidence gathered by organisations such as that of Yanar Mohammed and by the Iraqi Women 's Network , run by Hanna Edwar , suggests rape is also being used as a weapon in the sectarian war to humiliate families from rival communities .
' So far what we have been seeing is what you might call " collateral rape " , ' says Besmia Khatib of the Iraqi Women 's Network .
' Rape is being used in the settling of scores in the sectarian war . '
Yanar Mohammed describes how a Shia girl was kidnapped , raped and dumped in the Husseiniya area of Baghdad .
The retaliation , she says , was the kidnapping and rape of several Sunni girls in the Rashadiya area .
Tit for tat .
Similar stories are emerging across Iraq .
' Of course rape is going on , ' says Aida Ussayaran , former deputy Human Rights Minister and now one of the women on the Council of Representatives .
' We blame the militias .
But when we talk about the militias , many are members of the police .
Any family now that has a good - looking young woman in it does not want to send her out to school or university , and does not send her out without a veil .
This is the worst time ever in Iraqi women 's lives .
In the name of religion and sectarian conflict they are being kidnapped and killed and raped .
And no one is mentioning it .'
Women activists are convinced there is substantial under - reporting of crimes against women in some areas , particularly involving ' honour killing ' - there is a massive increase against a background of pervasive violence - and that families often seek death certificates that will hide the cause .
In regions such as the violent Anbar province , the country 's largest , which borders Jordan and Syria , there is little reporting of the causes of any death .
And activists complain , in any case , that they have been blocked from examining bodies at the Medical Forensic Institute in Baghdad , or collecting their own figures to build up an accurate picture of what is happening to women .
While attacks on women have long been the dirty secret of Iraq 's war , the sheer levels of the violence is now pushing it into the open .
Last week in Samawah , 246 kilometres ( 153 miles ) south of Baghdad , three women and a toddler were killed when gunmen stormed their home in an unexplained mass murder .
Like Dr al - Tallal in Najaf , they were Shia Muslims in a Shia city .
The three women were shot .
The 18 - month - old baby had her throat slit .
In the north , too , last week the killing of women became more visible , with the al - Jazeera network reporting that attacks on women in the city of Mosul had led to an unprecedented rise in the number of women 's bodies being found .
Among them was Zuheira , a young housewife , found shot dead in the suburb of Gogaly .
Salim Zaho , a neighbour , quoted by the television station , said : ' They could n't kill her husband , a police officer , so they came for his wife instead . '
It is one of the recurring narratives of murder told by Iraqi women .
It is a violence that would not be possible without a wider , permissive brutalising of women 's lives : one that permeates the ' new Iraq ' in its entirety .
For it is not only the religious militias that have turned women 's lives into a living hell - it is , in some measure , the government itself , which has allowed ministries run by religious parties to segregate staff by gender .
Some public offices , including ministries , insist on women staff wearing a headscarf at all times .
A women 's shelter , set up by Yanar Mohammed 's group , was closed down by the government .
Most serious of all are the death threats women receive for simply working , even in government offices .
Zainub - not her real name - works for a ministry in Baghdad .
One morning , she said , she arrived at work to find that a letter had been sent to all the women .
' When I opened up the note it said , " You will die .
You will die " .'
The situation has been exacerbated by the undermining of Iraq 's old Family Code , established in 1958 , which guaranteed women a large measure of equality in key areas such as divorce and inheritance .
The new constitution has allowed the Family Code to be superseded by the power of the clerics and new religious courts , with the result that it is largely discriminatory against women .
The clerics have permitted the creeping re-emergence of men contracting multiple marriages , formerly discouraged by the old code .
It is these clerics , too , who have permitted a sharp escalation in the ' pleasure marriages ' .
And it is the same clerics overseeing the rapid transformation of a once secular society - in which women held high office and worked as professors , doctors , engineers and economists - into one where women have been forced back under the veil and into the home .
The result is mapped out every day on Iraq 's streets and in its country lanes in individual acts of intimidation and physical brutality that build into an awful whole .
And so in Salman Pak , on the Tigris 15 miles south of Baghdad , The Observer is told , the Karaa Brigade of the Ministry of the Interior rounds up some Sunni men .
Later some of the police return to the men's houses and promise their worried women to help find the missing men in exchange for sex .
In the Shia neighbourhood of al - Shaab in Baghdad , militiamen with the Jaish al - Mahdi put out an order banning women from wearing sandals and certain shoes , skirts and trousers .
They beat up others for wearing the wrong clothes .
In Amaryah , a Sunni stronghold in Baghdad , Sunni militants shave three women 's heads for wearing the wrong clothes and lash young men for wearing shorts .
In Zafaraniyah , a largely Shia suburb south of Baghdad , the Jaish al - Mahdi militiamen wait outside a school and slap girls not wearing the hijab .
It is a situation bleakly recorded by the Human Rights Office of the UN Assistance Mission to Iraq .
' There are reports that , in some Baghdad neighbourhoods , women are now prevented from going to the markets alone , ' Unami reported .
' In other cases , women have been warned not to drive cars , or have faced harassment if they wear trousers .
Women have also reported that wearing a headscarf is becoming not a matter of religious choice but one of survival in many parts of Iraq , a fact particularly resented by non-Muslim women .
Female university students are also facing constant pressure in university campuses .'
' Since the beginning of August it has just been getting worse , ' says Nagham Kathim Hamoody , an activist with the Iraqi Women 's Network in Najaf .
' There are more women being killed and more bodies being found in the cemetery .
I do n't know why they are being killed , but I know the militias are behind the killing ...
We went to the mortuary here in Najaf , but the authorities would not co-operate in helping to identify the murdered women .
There was one doctor , though , who told us that some of the bodies showed signs that they had been beaten prior to their murder . '
And so the painful lives of Iraqi women go on .
Analysts say Bush will never end Iraq ' surge ' Agence France - Presse
Published : Thursday January 24 , 2008

Print This Email This President George W. Bush is unlikely to reduce US forces in Iraq to less than levels just before the surge this year for fear of putting at risk security gains , US analysts said Wednesday .
The top US commander in Iraq , General David Petraeus , will make recommendations in March or April on whether more troops can come home in the second half of the year , further shrinking the size of US force in Iraq .
The military already has committed to reducing the size of the force from 19 to 15 combat brigades by July , bringing troop levels down from about 160,000 to about 130,000 troops -- the level before the " surge " troop hike that was launched a year ago .
But tension is developing between commanders in Iraq , who are wary about reducing US forces too quickly , and the military leadership at the Pentagon , who want to ease the strain on US ground forces as quickly as possible .
" General Petraeus is under pressure from the army , from the Central Command and the Joint Chiefs to continue the withdrawals after the drawdown of five brigades , " said Peter Rodman , a former senior Pentagon official .
" People in the military have the responsibility to worry about the stress on the forces , about the contingencies in the Middle East and in the world at large , " he said at a conference on Iraq at the Brookings Institution .
But Rodman added , " The president 's priority is : what do we need to do to prevail in Iraq ?
He wants to succeed in Iraq , that 's his priority . "
Bush indicated earlier this month during a visit to Kuwait that he will defer to Petraeus ' judgement , telling reporters that if the general wants to slow the pace of troop withdrawals , " that 's fine with me . "
" I said to the general , ' If you want to slow her down , fine .
It 's up to you . ' "
Lieutenant General Raymond Odierno , the number two commander in Iraq , cautioned recently against a quick drawdown .
" What we do n't want to do is suddenly pull out a whole bunch of US forces and suddenly turn things over to the Iraqi security forces .
I would like to see it done very slowly over time , " he said .
Phillip Gordon , another Brookings analyst , said the gains made by the surge , including a cease - fire among Shiite militias in the south and the rallying of Sunni militias to the side of US forces in Al Anbar province , are fragile .
" I do n't think we will be facing a prospect of a level below pre-surge troop levels any time soon , " he said .
" The president has invested so much in some form of success in Iraq that if General Petraeus even hints to him there is any risk in going down below 130,000 , I just can't imagine that he is going to be doing this , " he said .
Even if the army insists on reducing the strains on its deployed forces , he said , " Bush is not going to risk his Iraq legacy for these reasons . "
Michael O'Hanlon said the military already is making a " fairly dramatic reduction " by bringing the size of the force down to 15 combat brigades from 20 at the peak of the surge .
" It makes sense to take it a little slowly from that point onwards , " he said .
" Going down to 10 combat brigades would be a fifty percent reduction in the space of just 12 months ( which ) is to me traumatic and not sufficiently careful and cautious . "
US forces have made progress in purging extremists from the government and improving the sectarian balance of the security forces , " O'Hanlon said .
But he said " it underscores the degree to which the American presence is important , " adding that " there needs to be somebody between the Sunnis and the Shiites . "
Gordon said the hard decisions about leaving Iraq will be left to the next president .
" It is not going to be the one who decided to go to war , it is going to be his successor who is going to take the blame for whatever happens after that . "

When a slim but busty woman was stopped as she tried to enter Britain , Customs officers discovered a new item of underwear - the Plunderbra .
With secret pouches placed in each cup , up to £ 50,000 worth of cocaine can be concealed as traffickers seek ever more inventive ways of smuggling drugs .
It is discovered only if the trafficker is strip - searched or asked to go through a scanner .
Scroll down for more ...
Pictures of the modified lingerie show the lengths to which traffickers will go to bring cocaine into Britain from West Africa , in particular Ghana .
Other examples revealed yesterday include hollowed - out coat hangers , which can each contain £ 5,000 worth of cocaine , converted buttons , curtain beads , shoes and suitcases .
Tins of fruit juice , rum bottles and toiletries are also used - as are clothes which have been soaked in the drug .
Without doubt the most dangerous technique involves the trafficker swallowing vast quantities of cocaine to avoid detection .
One recent case involved a drugs mule from Nigeria consuming 100 plastic bags shaped like cocktail sausages , each containing 12 grams of cocaine with a total street value of £ 60,000 .
Had even one burst open in the smuggler 's stomach , the consequences would have been dire .
They were analysed by experts at the Forensic Science Service , which plays a key role in gathering evidence on behalf of Customs officials , and the suspect is now awaiting trial .
Details of the methods used by drugs traffickers emerged as two British schoolgirls prepare to be sentenced in Ghana for trying to smuggle £ 300,000 of cocaine into London .
Yatunde Diya and Yasemin Vatansever , both 16 , are expected to be sentenced to up to three years in youth detention this month .
Narcotics officers say the girls were " mules " paid £ 3,000 each to carry laptop bags with the drugs on a flight to Britain last July .
The girls , pupils at City and Islington College in London , claimed they did not know the drugs were in their luggage .
Vatansever is the daughter of immigrants from Cyprus , while Diya is of Nigerian descent .
Both are UK citizens .
They were held trying to board a British Airways flight to Heathrow carrying two bags containing more than 13lb of cocaine .
The swoop followed an operation - codenamed Operation Westbridge - involving Customs officials based in Ghana .
Following a crackdown on drugs mules travelling to Britain from Jamaica , there has been a marked increase in smugglers travelling from West Africa .
A spokesman for Revenue and Customs said : " One of the most significant trends concerns the amount of drugs being imported from Ghana .
" We had a big problem in Jamaica several years ago when hundreds of swallowers were trying to enter Britain each year .
" As a result , Customs sent officials to Jamaica to work with their officials .
Within a couple of years , the number of people detained dropped from 1,000 to just five . "
The operation 's success prompted drugs barons to look for alternative routes - most notably West Africa .
" This is the new route for drugs traffickers , " added the spokesman .
" Large numbers of drug smugglers are now trying to enter Britain from Ghana , Gambia and Senegal .
" To be fair , the Ghanaian Governmentquickly recognised the potential - scale of the problem and decided they did n't want to end up with the reputation of Jamaica .
" They got in touch with us and Operation Westbridge was set up in 2006 .
Scanners were installed at airports and there is now much better intelligence and analysis to identify traffickers .
" In the first year of Westbridge , more than £ 60 million worth of cocaine was seized . "
Despite the success , Customs officials based in Ghana say the smuggling threat there remains " very serious " .
Context free grammars ( CFGs ) are a valuable theoretical tool on which the modern compilation theory relies for parsing the code of programming languages .
For example , the most popular tool used for parsing – YACC , generates parsers for CFGs .
What most people do n’t know1 is that the vast majority of programming languages have grammars that are not context free .
C is a very good example , because it is one of the most popular languages in use and because its grammar is so almost context free that it serves as a good model to demonstrate what I ’m talking about .
Now , a CFG has several definitions in relation to formal languages and programming languages .
I do n’t want to delve too deep into the nomenclature here , but here is a discussion by a bunch of clever guys picking nits off this matter .
When I say that the grammar of C is not a CFG , what I mean is that a grammar given to YACC [ 2 ] is not enough to parse C correctly , without referring to some context information that comes from elsewhere .
It ’s time for some examples .
{ T ( x ) ; ... }
Consider this code :
Believe it or not , but given that T is a type , this is actually a valid declaration of x of the type T in C .
However , if T is not a known type , this is a call to the function T with the argument x .
How can the C parser know which way to parse without knowing whether T was previously defined by a typedef ?
I can hear you say “ but this is contrived , who ever writes code like that ? ” .
OK , something more standard :
{ T * x ; ... }
What is this , a declaration of x as a pointer to T , or a void multiplication of the variables T and x ?
There is no way to know without having the table of types defined by typedef in the memory , and parsers are n’t built to do that – this is context sensitive information .
Here ’s another example :
func ( ( T ) * x ) ;
If T is a type , the result of dereferencing x is cast to T and passed to func .
If T is n’t a type , the multiplication of T and x is passed to func .
In all these examples , the parser would be lost without having some information gathered on the code before the problematic statement is reached .
Therefore , C cannot be parsed with a YACC grammar without mixing in some context sensitive information .
This actually has a name in the compilation / C community – the “ typedef - name : identifier ” problem .
Even K&R23 has something to say about it , when presenting the grammar for C in the appendix :
With one further change , namely deleting the production typedef - name : identifier and making typedef - name a terminal symbol , this grammar is acceptable to the YACC parser - generator .
So , as you see , C is very close to having a CFG , but is n’t quite there .
Fortunately , this problem is very simple to fix .
All that ’s needed is keeping a symbol table of types defined by typedef as the parsing goes .
Whenever a new identifier is recognized in the lexer , it checks if this identifier is a defined type , and returns the correct token to the parser .
As far as the parser is concerned , it has two distinct terminals – an identifier and a defined type .
All that ’s left is updating the symbol table whenever a successful parse of a typedef statement completes .
To show better how this works , I ’ll show the relevant portions of the C parser and lexer from c2 c ’s code .
Here is a portion of the Lex file :
identifier ( [ a - zA - Z_ ] [ 0- 9a-zA - Z_ ] * )
< INITIAL,C>{identifier} { GetCoord( &yylval.tok ) ; yylval .n = MakeIdCoord ( UniqueString ( yytext ) , yylval.tok ) ; if ( IsAType(yylval.n->u.id.text ) ) RETURN_TOKEN( TYPEDEFname ) ; else RETURN_TOKEN ( IDENTIFIER ) ; }
Without getting too much into the syntax of Lex here , what this basically says is that whenever an identifier is found , it is tested for being a type .
If it is , the TYPEDEFname token is returned .
Otherwise , IDENTIFIER is returned .
For the Yacc grammar , these two are separate terminals .
1 To be more precise , “ most people ” do n’t even care for things like this .
By people I here refer to those who are interested in programming and computer science .
2 YACC only accepts CFGs , since in every production rule V -> w , V is a single nonterminal symbol .

John Woodruff , the black American runner who won the 800 meters in the 1936 Berlin Olympics in the face of Adolf Hitler and his “ master race ” agenda , has died .
He was 92 .
Woodruff , the last surviving gold medalist from that U.S. team that included the legendary runner Jesse Owens , died Tuesday at an assisted living center near Phoenix , said Rose Woodruff , his wife of 37 years .
Nicknamed “ Long John ” for his nearly 10 - foot stride , Woodruff was a lanky 21 - year - old freshman at the University of Pittsburgh with just three years of competitive running under his belt when he sailed to the racially charged scene in Berlin .
On Aug. 4 , 1936 , he won the 800 meters using one of the most astonishing tactics in Olympic history .
Boxed in by the pack of runners , he literally stopped in his tracks , then moved to the third lane and passed everyone to win the race in 1:52.9 .

“ I did n’t panic , ” Woodruff told the New York Times in 2005 .
“ I just figured if I had only one opportunity to win , this was it .
I ’ve heard people say that I slowed down and almost stopped .
I did n’t almost stop .
I stopped , and everyone else went around me . ”
He was the first black athlete to win a gold medal at the Berlin Games .
His teammate Owens won four .
There were 10,000 people to greet him when he returned to his hometown of Connellsville , Pa. , according to an Associated Press account from the time .
“ He was happy to bring the honor to the country .
That was No. 1 , ” his wife said .
“ And then to his family and the community where he lived . ”

Woodruff continued to excel after his return from Europe .
He won three consecutive national 880 - yard titles and the national Amateur Athletic Union ( AAU ) 880 championship in 1939 .
That same year he broke the 400 - meter record at the Compton Relays in California .
An excellent relay runner , he was the first athlete in the history of the Penn Relays at the University of Pennsylvania to anchor three championship relays in one year , which he did first in 1938 and again the next year .
In 1940 , he set a world indoor record of 1:47.6 at a meet in Hanover , N.H .

His last race was in the 1940 Compton Invitational , where he set an 800 - meter record that lasted 12 years , winning in 1:48.6 .
“ After the Olympics , I won nearly every major track meet in the country , ” he told the Associated Press some years ago .
“ Cumulatively speaking , I felt those achievements meant more to me than the Berlin Games .
I got into the Olympics very fast .
I did n’t realize the importance of what I had accomplished .
I did n’t even think about it . ”
But even his Olympic accomplishments could not erase the prejudice he sometimes encountered at home .
At a meet in Dallas in July 1937 , Woodruff ran what was then believed to be the fastest 800 meters ever .
He did it in 1:47.8 , nearly two seconds faster than the previous record .
But two days later , local AAU officials suspiciously ruled that the track was six feet short of regulation and the mark was disallowed .

A grandson of slaves , John Youie Woodruff was born July 5 , 1915 , one of 12 children of Silas and Sarah Woodruff .
He started his running career in high school but did n’t have the luxury of training on a track because the school did n’t have one .
Instead , he trained on the school ’s football field .
He later earned a sociology degree from the University of Pittsburgh and a master ’s degree , also in sociology , from New York University .
Woodruff twice served in the Army , during World War II and then the Korean War .
He left active service in 1957 as a lieutenant colonel but remained in the Army Reserves .
According to the National African American Registry , he commanded two battalions , one of them integrated , and was executive officer for five artillery battalions .

Woodruff had many jobs over his long life .
He worked for the New York City Children ’s Aid Society , and was a teacher , parole officer , welfare investigator and recreation center director for the New York City Police Athletic League .
Along the way , he volunteered as an official at many track meets , including the Penn Relays .
He and his wife moved to Arizona in 2000 and lived in Fountain Hills .
Diabetes led to amputation of his once - powerful legs in 2003 .
In addition to his wife , he is survived by a son , John Jr. of Brooklyn , N.Y. ; a daughter , Randilyn Gilliam of Chicago ; five grandchildren ; and three great - grandchildren .
When someone are fresh to the leisurely interest of photography , someone might sense a very little panic .
There is a lot to learn , and camera equipments are a lot more highly developed than ever .
Here someone are going to locate some excellent guidelines for boosting your photography .
The “ S ” represents shutter pace .
Utilization small shutter pace to obtain sharp photographes when catching shifting objectives .
Establish the shutter pace to better speeds for producing an even more experimental pic .
This is a sensational feature to employ when getting images of fireworks or even rear light sources on a vehicle .
This is an easy method to have creative characteristics in your images .
Utilization the normal light source that beams by means of a window in order to lighten your images .
This light source is restful and diffused after it traverses the windowpane pane and are going to develop a fabulous light source on your subject .
Put your susceptible directly in the light source of the windowpane and someone are going to be actually fairly pleased with the end results .
Discover when to disregard the rules and spurn conventions .
The more someone evaluate additional people ’s photographes , the more someone are going to recognize common solution of widespread items .
Accomplish your ideal to follow an assorted design .
Technique conventions and fads because a little something someone are able to learn from , nevertheless do certainly not multiply them in your craft .
To acquire unique images , take photographes of the subject in their normal environment , certainly not a poised one .
Do this with kids , little ones and animals and ensure to snap rapidly .
These normal opportunities are going to help someone in order to catch unforeseen sentiments and facial looks .
Utilization a diffuser in order to minimize the negative consequences of flash photography .
The integral flash on most camera equipments produce images that get a higher light - dark contradistinction , which creates them look severe and unrealistic .
A diffuser diffuses the light source from the flash , circulating it a lot more consistently and making your flash images appear a lot more normal .
Take into account precisely how the customer ’s eye are going to adhere to the opportunity .
Really good opportunities get at least one point that will definitely center the customer ’s preliminary recognition .
Better opportunities get several reasons of claim that law because a virtual trip of the image .
Example include a specified outline , queues on a path , or even items in the foreground that spread out in to the background .
Notice the limit lines in your images .
Someone have to guarantee that they are entirely straight in order for your opportunity to appear straight .
If they are jagged or even slanted , it will definitely appear to be the content jagged .
That makes someone appear incapable of an aboveboard opportunity , therefore put in the time to make sure your limits are straight .
The trick to taking excellent pictures is in order to often bear in mind that illumination is the most crucial things .
Take into account lighting all the time .
This accomplishes certainly not matter precisely what the provider of the illumination is , nevertheless it is the elemental part of any type of portrait .
Utilization the sun , a streetlight , a public attention or perhaps even the pc monitor to grab any type of light source and produce an exceptional portrait .
Do certainly not allow your understanding shape your photographes .
Someone must base your pic around your idea and very creative sense and usage understanding and your equipment guidance someone produce this idea reawakened .
Someone are able to try with methods when someone initially understand them , nevertheless someone are going to get your ideal photographes when someone allow your notions get cost .
Do certainly not worry an excessive amount of about making use of filters in your photography .
Filters are certainly not essential when someone are trying for typical , beautiful , and normal opportunities .
Utilization them if someone are seeking to accomplish some exclusive consequences , nevertheless be actually advised , it is certainly not heading to be actually as effortless because it searches .
Regularly examine the job of excellent professional photographers .
Someone have to be actually crucial of their job and discover precisely what it is in their opportunities that makes them excellent .
Someone also should retain an eyeball out for their defects also .
Someone are able to then use this understanding in order to your very own opportunities .
See your light source .
The illumination in a portrait are able to bring a topic in to much better focal point or even adjust the state of mind of the representation .
Varied illumination setups are going to produce incredibly different pictures .
Avoid severe straight illumination on your subject ’s appearance , because this are going to usually cause them in order to scrunch up your eyes .
The best illumination is incredibly essential when building a specified tone or even state of mind .
Be actually crystal clear about the variety of illumination someone prefer in your pictures and do not just decide for whatever illumination is obtainable .
Relaxation with lens distortion .
A lot of pictures employ likeness contact lens or even zoom contact lens to center on an objective , and employ a wide - angle lens for landscapes and such .
By making use of a lens for an assorted usage than its proposed one , someone are going to acquire a very original portrait .
Do certainly not allow this become your design : learn when someone are able to employ an original lens .
When mastering photography , at some point someone are going to have to get some kind of qualified guidance .
Self - teaching could merely get someone up until now .
If someone are certainly not requiring a training on photography , try obtaining parted of the photography community .
Talk to and inquire pros for assistance ; after all there are no greater teachers in the area than true professional photographers .
Utilization a really good lens to obtain a much better image top quality .
Someone are able to develop creative photographes with any type of kind of equipment if someone strive and adapt your design to your equipment .
But obtaining a really good lens most definitely uncovers a lot more choices .
For example , someone are able to grab more details and receive a much better focal point .
A typical beginner ’s error is in order to place one ’s thumb on the lens while requiring a portrait .
This induces a blurry spot in order to appear in the corner of a portrait .
Someone must make sure your lens is clean and that someone are certainly not obscuring it with your thumb before taking a picture .
Regularly get more electric batteries and get a much larger thought playing card than someone assume someone ’ll desire when someone are taking your camera equipment on a tour .
Thought cards are enormously a lot more low - cost than merely a handful of many years ago , so it ’s effortless in order to acquire a much larger thought playing card than someone ’ll assume someone desire .
Someone certainly never realize when someone ’ll come across a scene that someone ’ll desire to catalogued adequately .
Throw some more electric batteries in your bag very , because someone do not desire to miss that after in a lifetime shot because your camera equipment lacked power .
In conclusion , one of the ultimate designs must be actually the capacity to needs pictures .
People are able to employ camera equipments in order to grab any type of time that will definitely last for countless years .
Utilization the photography guidelines in this article to help someone grab instants that are going to last for countless foreseeable future generations .

That is certainly the conventional wisdom .
But consider , for example , the case of Billy Gene Davis , who , after twice failing a polygraph test , confessed to killing his girlfriend in Austin , Tex. , in 1990 .
She later turned up alive in Tucson .
According to the Innocence Project , 49 people whose convictions relied on false confessions have been proved innocent and released from prison based on DNA evidence .
Last September , Jeffrey Deskovic — who , now 32 , spent half his life in a New York prison for raping and killing a classmate in 1989 — was freed after DNA found on the victim was matched to an incarcerated murderer .
Deskovic , like many false confessors , said he believed his life was in danger and that his interrogation would n’t stop unless he told the police what they wanted to hear .
In Virginia , Earl Washington Jr. , a mentally retarded man , spent 17 years in prison after falsely confessing to the rape and murder of a 19 - year - old mother of three .
He was pardoned after DNA established his innocence .
New York Times Magazine
Thehas an incredible story and a frightening one .
Many people , perhaps most , have no idea how easy it is to convict an innocent man of murder .
Not just to convict but to get him to confess to it , especially in death penalty states .
Anyone who has investigated how police botch up murder investigations and coerce suspects will know this is possible .
Not only is it possible but I would say it is inevitable .
Certainly not in every case but in many of them .
Let us start with the basics in this case .
In 1997 Michelle Moore - Bosko was raped and murdered .
Her husband , a Navy enlistee , returned to their apartment to find her body .
He ran across the hall to a neighbor pleading with him to call the police .
The neighbor , Daniel Williams , did as requested .
Williams , also a Navy recruit , and his wife , shared an apartment with another sailor , Joseph Dick , Jr. Police detective Robert Ford suspected that Williams was the perpetrator because a female friend of the victim said that Williams had been looking at her .
Ford grilled and threatened Williams .
And he used the tactics of brainwashing and coercion .
He also made it clear to him that he would be convicted and that he would be executed unless he confessed .
If he confessed the death penalty was off the table .
Confess or die .
Williams was told he was seen going into the apartment , that was a lie .
Williams had willingly taken a polygraph test and the results said he was telling the truth .
But Ford lied to Williams and told him he had failed the test .
Williams said he started to believe the accusations himself .
It is also known that some individuals can be easily convinced to confess to anything .
Dr. Richard
Ofshe is one of the world ’s leading experts on false confessions and the ease with which they can be obtained .
He has a full report on this incident here
The police did not look for DNA evidence on Williams , or in his apartment , or at least there is no record of them doing so .
Detective Ford was convinced he had the right man .
Then DNA recovered on the dead woman ’s body threw a monkey wrench into the neat little scenario that Ford had invented for himself .
It did n’t match Williams .
A rational man would conclude that contradictory evidence to his thesis has to be explored .
Ford , instead , concluded it proved that Williams was not alone .
Now his attention turned to Joe Dick , who shared the Williams ’ apartment .
He must be the " second " suspect .
Dick told Ford he was on duty aboard the U.S.S. Saipan when the crime had been committed .
He could n’t have been involved .
Dick ’s supervisor , Michael Ziegler , confirms that .
Ziegler also double checked ship records which showed that Dick was aboard .
And he said that the ship had very rigorous security measures and that Dick could n’t leave without it being noted and Ziegler being informed .
The alibi was never checked out .
Dicks ’ lawyer , who seems to have done a piss - poor job , claims the Navy had records that Dick was not on board and that the prosecutor confirmed this .
But the prosecutor , Damian Hansen , says he never checked out the alibi and that he assumed the lawyer had done so .
He had n’t .
Detective Ford did not investigate the alibi either .
But he did lied to Dick and claimed that he had checked into it and that the alibi did n’t hold up .
Ford continued working on Dick , who Ziegler says , is mentally slow .
When Dick started confessing Ford was pleased .
Except for one problem : the two confessions were very different .
Williams had confessed , after his interrogation , that he , and he alone , killed the woman .
He said he did it between 9 pm and 11 pm .
But the victim was not home during those hours .
She was out with a friend from around noon to 11:30 pm .
Williams remembered beating the woman in the face .
But there was no sign of a beating .
He was asked if he choked her and he said no .
But the autopsy showed she had been chocked and stabbed .
He thought the murder took place in the living room , it took place in the bedroom .
Williams did n’t have any memory that corresponded with the facts .
When these contradictions were presented to Williams his memories changed again to correspond with what he was told .
However , Dick was confessing to a different crime .
He says he and Williams were arguing and that Moore - Bosko grabbed a kitchen knife and attacked him .
He then stabbed her in response .
But he had no recollection of what the knife looked like .
He claimed he had ejaculated in the woman ’s mouth but no semen was found there .
He said that he threw a blanket over the woman after she died .
And a blanket was found over her body but the husband says he did that when he came home and found her .
Dick only “ remembered ” the blanket after he saw police photos of the crime scene .
He did n’t know the blanket was added by the husband .
So , now Ford had two suspects , both of whom had confessed .
And he had DNA evidence from the victim .
Except the DNA did n’t belong to either of the suspects .
Instead of questioning his theory Ford concluded that this meant there was a third suspect .
So he goes after the mentally - slow Dick again .
Now Dick remembers that there was third man there ; his confession changes again .
The third man , Eric Wilson , he said washed the blood from the knife .
And they had moved the body from the bedroom , where it was found , to the living room , but then they were startled by a noise and moved it back .
There was no indication the body had ever left the bedroom -- no blood residues or traces outside the bedroom .
Dick said the murder took place between 7:00 and 8:00 but the victim did n’t return home that evening until 11:30 .
And that is before Williams said it took place .
And the knife was supposedly washed in the Williams apartment by a new suspect .
Yet it was found in the victim ’s apartment .
Nothing fit but Ford ignored it all .
He knew what he knew and was n’t going to let something like evidence convince him otherwise .
Wilson was arrested and went through hours of similar police interrogation tactics .
He started confessing but says this was because he was beaten and threatened by Ford .
Yet again the DNA did n’t match .
So , once again Ford concludes that this means there was a fourth suspect .
And he returns to Dick who complies with a new confession .
Dick said the man who helped in the murder was named George but he could n’t remember more .
He was shown photos of local sailors and picked out “ George ” from the photos .
The fourth suspect was not named George but was Dereck Tice .
Ford arrested him and spent 14 hours interrogating him .
Again Ford told
Tice that he would get the death penalty unless he confessed .
Tice requested an attorney and Ford refused !
Tice said that some information he used in his “ confession ” had to be supplied to him by Ford and what was n’t supplied did n’t fit the crime .
Tice said the men used a claw hammer to pry open the apartment door of the victim .
The door showed no signs of it .
And he remember there being seven attackers not the four who were now the target of Ford ’s “ investigation ” .
Ford conveniently did n’t record any of the interrogations .
So , now three more men were arrested .
And still none of the seven “ suspects ” matched the DNA evidence that was found !
Astoundingly Ford continues with his case against these men .
Williams and Dick had confessed to the crime and never stood trial .
But their testimony was sufficient to convict Tice and Wilson who were arguing they were intimidated and coerced into false confessions .
But it was too late for them to retract .
Then the Innocence Project got involved in the case ( they are good people ! ) .
And they brought in a DNA expert .
Under the police theory there were now seven men supposedly involved in the attack .
All seven men took turns raping the victim .
And supposedly they each took turns stabbing her .
There were three knife wounds and one attempted wound on the victim .
If all seven men stabbed her why were there only four wounds ?
And one forensics expert noted the stab wounds were all close together .
He says that indicated a single attacker stabbing the victim in rapid succession .
Seven different men taking turns would n't stab so closely together .
In addition no DNA from any of the men was found on the victim or in the room .
Supposedly this gang of men attacked the victim in her apartment yet the apartment was immaculate .
There was no sign of a gang rape or of seven men having burst in to violently attack the woman .
And the new three suspects were not cooperating and not confessing .
Two had evidence supporting alibis for the night of the crime .
Charges were dropped against these three men but the Detective Ford insists they were guilty in spite of air tight alibis to the contrary .
And thenotes that innocent people confess to crimes all the time , something the prosecutor told the jury does n’t happen .
Remember that in this case there is still no DNA match .
None of the four imprisoned men , or the three other alleged suspects , matched the actual DNA evidence that was found .
And that fact did n’t seem to impact on Ford ’s mind .
He had coerced confessions out of four innocent men .
( This ought to tell you something about the usefulness of “ enhanced interrogation ” tactics to get accurate information from “ enemy combatants ” .
That 's Bushspeak for torture . )
Now things come full circle .
Police were approached by a woman , Karen Stover , who gave them a threatening letter she received from one Omar Abdul Ballard , who was then in prison .
In that letter he also says he was the one who killed Moore - Bosko .
Also , the woman who was with Moore - Bosko the day of the murder was Tamika Taylor .
She was allegedly the one who suggested police investigate Williams .
It turns out she was friends with Ballard .
And she had introduced him to the victim .
In addition Ballard has a history of violence against women including rape and attempted murder .
One of those attacks took place just down the street from where this murder had taken place .
Ballard had been identified in that attack .
In fact , he had fled to the Bosko apartment for refuge when some men intervened and went after him for attacking the woman .
Two weeks after that incident he was arrested for raping another woman .
Police already knew he was wanted for violent attacks on women in that very neighborhood and never put two and two together .
Instead they followed they fanciful theory of the expanding gang of men .
Finally the police compared Ballard to the DNA evidence .
It was a match .
He also freely confessed to the crime and accurately described the knife that he used .
He told police when the crime had happened and it matched the events , unlike the other “ confessions ” .
And he told police he committed the crime by himself .
So the innocent men walked ?
Not on your life .
Police now concocted a new theory .
They pretended that Ballard was protecting the other seven men who were also allegedly involved .
They reasoned that Ballard was protecting them because he did n’t want to be labeled a snitch in prison .
They also figured that since Ballard was black , and the others were white , that Ballard did n't want his friends knowing he was hanging around with whites .
And supposedly the other men , four of whom were happy to point fingers at others , did n’t mention Ballard because they were afraid of him .
It gets worse .
Detective Ford then threatened Ballard telling him he would face the death penalty unless he signed a new confession which implicated the men that Ford had already arrested .
Ballard , who had never met any of the seven other alleged killers , said he did just that .
After he signed the confession the police needed , the death penalty was taken off the table in his case .
Four innocent men were threatened with death unless they confessed .
And the one guilty man is offered his life if he lies for the police .
For Ballard the choice was to sign a false confession or face the death penalty .
( This is one major reason the death penalty is a pernicious force in the justice system .
It can be used to intimidate and force false confessions and accusations . )
Over and over Detective Ford used the death penalty as a means of forcing people to sign false statements .
When Joe Dick was willing to admit that he falsely accused Tice and Wilson , it was Ford who stopped him .
Ford told Dick that any change in his testimony would result in the death penalty and Dick says he was trying to save his own life .
He had no choice .

It is a fascinating account of a blatant miscarriage of justice .

The star called himself an " imagineer "
He was a staple of Saturday night television for more than 15 years - in many ways ITV 's foil to Noel Edmonds during the 1980s and 1990s .
In his most famous hidden camera stunt , he managed to convince Dorset homeowner Janet Elford that an alien spaceship had landed in her back garden .
She was so sucked in to the scenario that she sang a hymn to the visitor from outer space before asking it into her house for tea .
" The scale was huge , " Beadle told Channel 4 in 2005 .
" We literally cut off half of Dorset . "
You 'd quite enjoy being Jeremy Beadle , I promise you

Beadle dies at 59
But despite his meticulous planning , Beadle always attributed the success of his pranks to the hapless victims .
The alien sketch was only funny , he admitted in 2003 , " because the person we played it on was so wonderful " .
Game For A Laugh
Beadle was born in Hackney , east London , in 1948 .
His father , a Fleet Street journalist , left before he was born - and the star never made an attempt to contact him out of respect for his mother .
After school , Beadle tried his hand at rock music promotion , masterminding the 1972 Bickershaw rock festival .
He also became northern editor of listings magazine Time Out , but finally came into the public eye in 1981 as one of the original presenters of Game For a Laugh with Matthew Kelly , Sarah Kennedy and Henry Kelly .
The star worked on local radio before launching his TV career
His hidden camera programme , Beadle 's About , later became one of ITV 's top-rated shows , as was You 've Been Framed , which featured viewers ' video howlers .
But they were easy targets for critics , and Beadle became a byword for cheap laughs and tacky television .
In the mid-1990s he was replaced as You 've Been Framed host by Emmerdale actress Lisa Riley , and Beadle 's About was axed because of falling ratings .
' Cruelty '
He was philosophical about his public vilification , telling The Sunday Times : " I think people are guilty about enjoying the cruelty of comedy which is always at someone else 's expense . "
But , he insisted , people were always affectionate when they met him in person .
" You 'd quite enjoy being Jeremy Beadle , I promise you , " he told London 's Metro newspaper .
" People are very welcoming .
They want to chat .
Considering the tone in the press , it seems like a contradiction , but it 's not . "
In recent years , the star concentrated on corporate and fundraising events , while writing a weekly trivia quiz for the Independent newspaper .
He also worked with US author Irving Wallace on a series of million - selling reference books , including The People 's Almanac and the Book of Lists .
In 1998 , he caused a storm of controversy when he revealed he had helped a friend dying of motor neurone disease to commit suicide .
" Trying to talk him out of it would n't have been helpful , " he told the Mirror newspaper .
" If he was going to go through with it , he needed to do it properly . "
" I feel privileged to have been his friend and proud that I was able to assist his dignified exit .
I was his sole confidant and I admired his courage . "
Charity award
Beadle was made an MBE in 2001 for his charity work
In 2002 , six members of the public were locked away with the star for a week at a time as part of an endurance test for Ant and Dec 's Saturday Night Takeaway .
He also appeared on Celebrity Mastermind , where his specialist subject was London Murders 1900 - 1940 and , in 2005 , he partnered Sir Alan Sugar on a charity edition of Who Wants To Be A Millionaire .
But perhaps his proudest moment came in February 2001 , when he was made an MBE for his services to charity .
" I was quite moved to be honest .
My eyes welled up , " he admitted .
Beadle 's charitable efforts included helping children with Poland 's Syndrome , which stunted the growth of his right hand during childhood , and raising more than £ 13 m for the Foundation for Children with Leukaemia , in Barnet , north London .
The star downplayed his contributions , saying he gave over his time for " selfish reasons " .
" It 's very easy just to sit back and feel sorry .
Well , I hate that , I hate pity .
" So I turn it into something very positive .
It 's very selfish .
It 's actually stopping me from feeling pity . "
In recent years , Beadle was plagued by ill health .
In 2004 , he lost a kidney to cancer and , a year later , he was diagnosed with a mild form of leukaemia .
His death comes after a battle with pneumonia .
He leaves behind his wife , Sue , daughters Cassie and Bonnie and his stepchildren , Leo and Claire .
Mobile phone data can be used to pinpoint a person 's location
Data about calls made and received will also be available to 652 public bodies , including the police and councils .
The Home Office said the content of calls and texts would not be read and insisted the move was vital to tackle serious crime and terrorism .
But critics said it was another example of Britain 's " surveillance society " .
The new law , under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 , was signed off by Home Secretary Jacqui Smith in July .
It requires phone companies to log data on every call or text made to and from every phone in Britain .
' Different uses '
Since 2004 , companies have voluntarily provided data , where available , if it was requested , but now they will required by law to retain it for a year .
Minister for Security and Counter - terrorism Tony McNulty told BBC Radio 4 that the data could provide three levels of information , the simplest being about the phone 's owner .
" Say some old lady has got difficulties with someone who 's repaired the gas in her house and has a mobile phone for somebody who 's clearly dodgy , " Mr McNulty said .
" The local authorities can just get the subscriber information next to that number .
" The second level of data is not simply the subscriber , but also the calls made by that phone .
" And the third level which is purely for the security forces , police , etc , is not just the subscriber information and the calls made , but also the calls coming in and location data - where the calls are made from . "
Personal ' profile '
A person 's location can be pinpointed to within a few feet by identifying the mobile phone mast used to transmit their call .
Shami Chakrabarti , director of civil rights group Liberty , said people were more concerned than ever about their personal privacy , especially how many bodies had access to their phone records .
" There are actually a very broad range of purposes for which this information about who we 've been phoning and when can be revealed , " Ms Chakrabarti said .
" It includes , for example , the Gaming Board , the Food Standards Authority and every district and county council in the country . "
She said requests for information would not be limited to those concerning serious crime and national security .
" We 're talking about a profile that can be built of your personal relationships on the basis of who you 've been speaking to and when . "
Public consulted
Mr McNulty said local councils would only have access to data on " a legitimate and proportional basis " .
" ( To say ) that all of a sudden anyone and everyone 's information is available , that all these authorities somehow have the right to go fishing and snooping , simply is n't the case , " he added .
Nick Clegg , Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman , said : " Once again this government has been caught red - handed creating new surveillance state powers with no meaningful public or parliamentary debate .
The Home Office said the plans had been through a public consultation and said a senior police officer would have to approve any request for phone data .
Councils would only be able to use the powers to " prevent and detect crime - not for the collection of taxes " , the spokesman added .
The new law brings Britain in line with an EU directive on the retention of phone data .
Predators need prey .
So , theoretically , brown trout ( Salmo tutta ) should thrive in lakes teeming with arctic char ( Salvelinus alpinus ) , a potential meal .
Yet , brown trout , depleted by overfishing , remained scarce in northern Norway 's Lake Takvatn even though fishing was halted and there were plenty of char for them to eat .
Only when scientists removed 660,000 of the char ( between 1984 and 1989 ) did brown trout once again rule the waters .
Ecologist Lennart Persson of Umeå University in Sweden and colleagues tracked the two fish populations through 2005 to determine how culling prey affects predators .
At first glance , it would seem odd that the trout population would recover so quickly when its main food source was reduced by 80 percent .
But Persson says that the dwindling number of predators allowed the char to grow too big for the remaining brown trout to swallow — and , in fact , enabled the former prey to become competitors for other food sources such as insects .
The brown trout needed small , quickly reproducing char to feed on in order to rebound , so killing off the bigger , more sluggish prey actually benefited the predator .
" Before the thinning , the density of char was very high but the population consisted of slowly growing individuals with low fecundity , " Persson says .
" The predator , brown trout , increased 30 times in numbers following the char thinning . "
Further , the brown trout were capable of sustaining this ideal condition for themselves ; numbers of smaller char increased along with the numbers of their predator in subsequent years .
" The predator causes an increase in its own resource — small prey — availability by eating on it , " Persson says .
Brown trout and char numbers have reached a new equilibrium that has been maintained for the past 15 years , the researchers report in Science .
Neither temperature nor nutrients in the lake changed during the study period and a nearby lake showed no similar recovery without the culling .
Given the collapse of a wide variety of predatory fish worldwide due to similar overfishing , this new strategy might help promote recovery .
" It may be more feasible to thin out the prey fish population than to stock with predatory fish , " Persson says .
For example , collapsed cod stocks in the Baltic Sea might be saved if its prey , herring and sprat , were more widely fished , he says .
And assigning individual quotas on the amount of fish anglers are allowed to catch , credited with fish recovery from New Zealand to Iceland , might prevent depleting populations in the first place , according to another report in Science .
By combining such tradable quotas and selective fishing of prey species , there may be hope yet for restoring the bounty of both the ocean and freshwaters .

I do n’t have much time for hobbies these days , but occasionally I get to indulge a bit .
A few days ago I did a videoconference talking about one of my favorite hobbies : hunting for the fundamental laws of physics .
Physics was my first field ( in fact , I became a card - carrying physicist when I was a teenager ) .
And as it happens , the talk I just gave ( for the European Network on Random Geometry ) was organized by one of my old physics collaborators .
Physicists often like to think that they ’re dealing with the most fundamental kinds of questions in science .
But actually , what I realized back in 1981 or so is that there ’s a whole layer underneath .
There ’s not just our own physical universe to think about , but the whole universe of possible universes .
If one ’s going to do theoretical science , one had better be dealing with some kind of definite rules .
But the question is : what rules ?
Nowadays we have a great way to parametrize possible rules : as possible computer programs .
And I ’ve built a whole science out of studying the universe of possible programs — and have discovered that even very simple ones can generate all sorts of rich and complex behavior .
Well , that ’s turned out to be relevant in modeling all sorts of systems in the physical and biological and social sciences , and in discovering interesting technology , and so on .
But here ’s my big hobby question : what about our physical universe ?
Could it be operating according to one of these simple rules ?
If the rules are simple enough , one might be able to do something that seems quite outrageous : just search the universe of all possible rules , and find our own physical universe .
It ’s certainly not obvious that our universe has simple rules at all .
In fact , looking at all the complex stuff that goes on in the universe , one might think that the rules could n’t be terribly simple .
Of course , as early theologians pointed out , the universe clearly has some order , some “ design ” .
It could be that every particle in the universe has its own separate rule , but in reality things are much simpler than that .
But just how simple ?
A thousand lines of Mathematica code ?
A million lines ?
Or , say , three lines ?
If it ’s small enough , we really should be able to find it just by searching .
And I think it ’d be embarrassing if our universe is out there , findable by today ’s technology , and we did n’t even try .
Of course , that ’s not at all how most of today ’s physicists like to think .
They like to imagine that by pure thought they can somehow construct the laws for the universe — like universe engineers .
The physicists at my recent videoconference are a little closer to my point of view , though the methodology and technicalities of what I ’m doing are still pretty alien to them .
But OK , so if there ’s a simple rule for the universe , what might it actually be like ?
I ’ve done a lot of work on this , and written quite a lot about it .
One important thing to realize is that if the rule is simple , it almost inevitably wo n’t explicitly show anything familiar from ordinary everyday physics .
Because in a really small rule , there just is n’t room to fit an explicit “ 3 ” for the effective dimension of space , or the explicit masses of one ’s favorite particles .
In fact , there almost certainly is n’t even room to fit an explicit notion of space , or of time .
So in a sense we have to go below space and time — to more fundamental primitives .
So what might these be ?
There are undoubtedly many ways to formulate them .
But I think most of the promising possibilities are ultimately equivalent to networks like this :
There ’s no “ space ” here — just a bunch of points , connected in a certain way .
But I think it ’s a little like , say , a liquid : even though at the lowest level there are just a bunch of molecules bouncing around , on a large enough scale a continuum structure emerges .
Normally in physics one thinks of space as some kind of background , in which matter and particles and so on separately exist .
But I suspect it ’s really more integrated : that everything is “ just space ” , with the particles being something like special little lumps of connectivity in the network corresponding to space .
In his later years , Albert Einstein actually tried hard to construct models for physics a bit like this , in which everything emerged from space .
But he had to use continuum equations as his “ primitives , ” and he could never make it work .
Many years later , there are a certain number of physicists ( many of whom were at my videoconference ) who think about networks that might represent space .
They have n’t quite reached the level of abstractness that I ’m at .
They still tend to imagine that the points in the network have actual defined positions in some background space — or at least that there ’s some topology of faces defined .
I ’m operating at a more abstract level : all that ’s defined is the combinatorics of connections .
Of course , one can always make a picture using GraphPlot or GraphPlot3D .
But the details of that picture are quite arbitrary .
What ’s interesting , though , is that when a network gets big enough , its combinatorics alone can in effect define a correspondence with ordinary space .
It does n’t always work .
In fact , most networks ( like the last two below ) do n’t correspond to manifolds like 3D space .
But some do .
And I suspect our universe is one of them .
But , OK , having space is n’t really enough .
There ’s also time .
Current physics tends to say that time is just like space — just another dimension .
That ’s of course very different from the way it works in programs .
In programs , moving in space might correspond to looking at another part of the data , but moving in time requires executing the program .
For networks , pretty much the most general kind of program is one that takes a piece of network with one structure , and replaces it with another .
Often there ’ll be many different ways to apply rules like that to a particular network .
And in general each possible sequence of rule applications might correspond to a “ different branch of time ” .
But it turns out that if one thinks about an entity inside the network ( like us in the universe ) , then the only aspect of applying the rules that we can ever perceive is their “ causal network ” : the network that says what “ updating event ” influences what other one .
Well , here ’s an important thing : there exist rules which have the property that whatever order they ’re applied in , they always give the same causal network .
And now there ’s a big fact : these causal invariant rules not only imply that there ’s just a single perceived thread of time in the universe ; they also imply the particular relation of space and time that is special relativity .
Actually , there ’s even more than that .
If the microscopic updatings of the underlying network end up being random enough , then it turns out that if the network succeeds in corresponding in the limit to a finite dimensional space , then this space must satisfy Einstein ’s equations of general relativity .
It ’s again a little like what happens with fluids .
If the microscopic interactions between molecules are random enough , but satisfy number and momentum conservation , then it follows that the overall continuum fluid must satisfy the standard Navier–Stokes equations .
But now we ’re deriving something like that for the universe : we ’re saying that these networks with almost nothing “ built in ” somehow generate behavior that corresponds to gravitation in physics .
This is all spelled out in the NKS book .
And many physicists have certainly read that part of the book .
But somehow every time I actually describe this ( as I did a few days ago ) , there ’s a certain amazement .
Special and general relativity are things that physicists normally assume are built into theories right from the beginning , almost as axioms ( or at least , in the case of string theory , as consistency conditions ) .
The idea that they could emerge from something more fundamental is pretty alien .
The alien feeling does n’t stop there .
Another thing that seems alien is the idea that our whole universe and its complete history could be generated just by starting with some particular small network , then applying definite rules .
For the past 75 + years , quantum mechanics has been the pride of physics , and it seems to suggest that this kind of deterministic thinking just ca n’t be correct .
It ’s a slightly long story ( often still misunderstood by physicists ) , but between the arbitrariness of updating orders that produce a given causal network , and the fact that in a network one does n’t just have something like local 3D space , it looks as if one automatically starts to get a lot of the core phenomena of quantum mechanics — even from what ’s in effect a deterministic underlying model .
OK , but what is the rule for our universe ?
I do n’t know yet .
Searching for it is n’t easy .
One tries a sequence of different possibilities .
Then one runs each one .
Then the question is : has one found our universe ?
Well , sometimes it ’s easy to tell .
Sometimes one ’s candidate universe disappears after a tiny amount of time .
Or has some bizarre exponential version of space in which nothing can ever interact with anything else .
Or some other pathology .
But the difficult cases are when what happens is more complicated .
One starts one ’s candidate universe off .
And it grows to millions or billions of nodes .
And one ca n’t see what it ’s doing .
One uses GraphPlot .
And lots of fancy analysis techniques .
But all one can tell is that it ’s bubbling around , doing something complicated .
Has one caught our universe , or not ?
Well , here ’s the problem : one of the discoveries of NKS is a phenomenon I call computational irreducibility — which says that many systems that appear complex will have behavior that can never be “ reduced ” in general to a simpler computation .
It ’s inevitable that at some level our universe will have this property .
But what we have to hope is that a candidate universe that we “ catch in our net ” will have enough reducibility that we can tell that it really is our universe .
What we ’ve been doing for the past few years is to try to build technology for “ universe identification . ”
It ’s not at all trivial .
In effect what we ’re trying to do is to build a system that can automatically recapitulate the whole history of physics — in a millisecond or something .
We need to be able to take what we observe in our candidate universe , and somehow establish what its effective physical laws are , and see whether they correspond to our universe .
Of course , it ’s somehow more like mathematics than traditional physics .
Because in a sense we have the underlying “ axioms ” , and we ’re trying to see what laws they imply , rather than having to base everything on pure experiment .
There ’s an analogy that I find useful .
When I was working on the NKS book , I wanted to understand some things about the foundations of mathematics .
In particular , I wanted to know just where the mathematics that we do lies within the universe of all possible mathematics .
So I started enumerating axiom systems , and trying to discover where in the space of possible axiom systems our familiar areas of mathematics show up .
One might think this was crazy — like searching for our universe in the space of possible universes .
But NKS suggests it ’s not .
Because it suggests that systems with simple rules can have the richness of anything .
And indeed , when I searched , for example , for Boolean algebra ( logic ) , I did indeed find a tiny axiom system for it : it turned out to be about the 50,000th axiom system in the enumeration I used .
Proving that it was correct took all sorts of fancy automated - theorem - proving technology — though I ’m happy to say that as of Mathematica 6 , FullSimplify can just do it !
I think it ’s going to work a bit like this for the universe .
It ’s going to take a lot of effort — and a little luck — to avoid the long arm of computational irreducibility .
But the hope is that we ’ll be able to do it .
Physicists at the videoconference were very curious about whether I had candidate universes yet .
The answer is yes .
But I have no idea yet just how difficult they ’ll be to analyze .
A good friend of mine has kept on encouraging me not to throw away any even vaguely plausible universes — even if we can show that they ’re not our universe .
He thinks that alternate universes have to be good for something .
I certainly think it ’ll be an interesting — almost metaphysical — moment if we finally have a simple rule which we can tell is our universe .
And we ’ll be able to know that our particular universe is number such - and - such in the enumeration of all possible universes .
It ’s a sort of Copernican moment : we ’ll get to know just how special or not our universe is .
Something I wonder is just how to think about whatever the answer turns out to be .
It somehow reminds me of situations from earlier in the history of science .
Newton figured out about motion of the planets , but could n’t imagine anything but a supernatural being first setting them in motion .
Darwin figured out about biological evolution , but could n’t imagine how the first living cell came to be .
We may have the rule for the universe , but it ’s something quite different to understand why it ’s that rule and not another .
Universe hunting is a very technology - intensive business .
Over the years , I ’ve gradually been building up the technology I think is needed — and quite a bit of it is showing up in strange corners of Mathematica .
But I think it ’s going to be a while longer before there are more results .
And before we can put “ Our Universe ” as a Demonstration in The Wolfram Demonstrations Project .
And before we can take our new ParticleData computable data collection and derive every number in it .
But universe hunting is a good hobby .
And it was nice to have a chance to talk about it a few days ago .
A Whitehouse exchange with Mukasey today :
" Is waterboarding constitutional ? " he was asked by Senator Sheldon Whitehouse , a Rhode Island Democrat , in one of today ’s sharpest exchanges .
" I do n’t know what is involved in the technique , " Mr. Mukasey replied .
" If waterboarding is torture , torture is not constitutional . "
Mr. Whitehouse described Mr. Mukasey ’s response as a " massive hedge " since Mr. Mukasey refused to be drawn into a conversation over whether waterboarding , which has been used by the Central Intelligence Agency to question terrorist suspects , amounted to torture .
" It either is or it is n’t , " the senator continued .
" Waterboarding is the practice of putting somebody in a reclining position , tying them down , putting cloth over their faces , and then pouring water over them to simulate drowning .
Is that constitutional ? " Mr. Mukasey repeated his answer : " If it amounts to torture , it is not constitutional . "
Mr. Whitehouse said he was " very disappointed in that answer — I think it is purely semantic . "
" I ’m sorry , " Mr. Mukasey replied .
Well , if waterboarding is n't torture , than what is ?
Would Mukasey reject extreme sleep deprivation , cold temperatures and other non-physical methods as rising to the level of torture ?
Even though those methods were precisely the ones used by the Gestapo and the KGB / Cheka ?
I swear , all this tells me is that there is not a good Republican left in this country , if a supposedly decent man like Mukasey cannot accept that waterboarding IS TORTURE .
If he does n't think it is , why does n't he do some first - hand research ?
Hey Judge , how about looking into some of the horrible renditions we 've been committing on American soil ?
When otherwise decent men use such language to justify state terror against innocent people , many of us know that our country has crossed an important line separating good from evil .
Only time will tell whether we as a people can bring ourselves back from the brink .
NOTE : dhonig has a great cartoon downthread in his comment .
Hesiod notes downthread :
Even persons who were only suspected of opposing any of the policies of the German occupation authorities were arrested , and on arrest were interrogated by the Gestapo and the SD in the most shameful manner .
On 12th June , 1942 the Chief of the SIPO and SD published , through Mueller , the Gestapo Chief , an order authorising the use of " third degree " methods of interrogation , where preliminary investigation had indicated that the person could give information on important matters , such as subversive activities , though not for the purpose of extorting confessions of the prisoner 's own crimes .
This order provided :
Third degree may , under this supposition , only be employed against Communists , Marxists , Jehovah 's Witnesses , saboteurs , terrorists , members of resistance movements , parachute agents , anti-social elements , Polish or Soviet Russian loafers or tramps ; in all other cases my permission must first be obtained ....
Third degree can , according to circumstances , consist amongst other methods of very simple diet ( bread and water ) , hard bunk , dark cell , deprivation of sleep , exhaustive drilling , also in flogging ( for more than twenty strokes a doctor must be consulted ) .
So when otherwise supposedly decent people like Mukasey cannot categorically say that such practices are torture , can we say that justice is even possible in this country right now ?
*** UPDATE *** From CA Libertarian :
From Amnesty International : " The Bush administration continues to astonish .
Its own State Department has labeled waterboarding torture when it applies to other countries .
Yet in President Bush 's legal wonderland , waterboarding is renamed an enhanced interrogation technique .
President Bush continues to assert that his administration is complying with U.S. and international law , yet every available fact has proven the contrary .
Torture by any other name is still torture - a new name does not make the practice acceptable or even palatable . "
And from Weelzup , who researched in Wikipaedia .
I think the case is clear to anyone who is n't hiding under a rock .
*** 2nd Update *** Chacounne movingly writes below , just in case someone out there does n't get it - what this kind of treatment does to people , Mukasey 's vagueness be damned :
[ My husband , a Vietnam vet ] was tortured by his North Vietnamese captors .
He suffered from his injuries for over thirties years until his fatal heart attack two years ago .
All of his toenails were removed three times , to try to get rid of the bamboo infection from their attemps to extract information .
Removing the toenails did n't work and he still had the infection the day he died .
He had scars all over his body from wounds inflicted during questioning .
There was never enough food in the house to fill the whole left by the food deprivation he suffered during his captivity .
He never got a full night 's sleep in over thirty .
His nightmare screams still haunt my sleep .
Let me be clear :
Food deprivation is torture .
Sleep deprivation is torture .
Sensory deprivation is torture .
Clothing deprivation is torture .
Stress positions are torture .
Intentionally cold environments are torture .
Intentionally hot enviroments are torture .
Beatings are torture .
Sexual humiliation and rape is torture .
EVERY American needs to stand up and say :
NOT IN MY NAME !
NEVER IN MY NAME !
and they need to KEEP saying it until the torture stops .
I will testify anytime and anywhere about what my husband experienced and why it is torture and what effect it had on him .
Torture is ALWAYS wrong , no matter who is doing it to whom .
For Dan ,
Heather
Frankly , I 'm humbled .
I can say no more .
CANBERRA ( Reuters ) - Australia apologized on Wednesday for the historic mistreatment of Aborigines in a move indigenous leaders said would help end generations of pain .
Prime Minister Kevin Rudd told parliament that past policies of assimilation , under which aboriginal children were taken from their families to be brought up in white households , were a stain on the nation ’s soul .
“ Today , the parliament has come together to right a great wrong , ” Rudd said .
“ We apologize for the laws and policies of successive parliaments and governments that have inflicted profound grief , suffering and loss on these our fellow Australians . ”
The parliamentary apology comes 11 years after a major report into past assimilation policies found between one in three and one in 10 aboriginal children had been taken from their families between 1910 and 1970 .
The report urged a national apology to those affected , known as the Stolen Generations , but the then conservative government under prime minister John Howard rejected the finding and offered only a statement of regret .
But Rudd made the apology the first item of parliamentary business for his centre - left Labor government , which won power in November last year , ending almost 12 years of conservative rule .
About 100 members of the Stolen Generations were in parliament to hear the government apologize , some wiping away tears as Rudd spoke , while thousands of people gathered on the lawns outside to watch the parliamentary debate on giant television screens .
Others assembled at squares and schools around the country to watch the speech , which Australians expect to open a new era of reconciliation between indigenous and other Australians .

DIVISIVE ISSUE
The crowds outside , and about 1,000 people in the public galleries in parliament , gave Rudd a standing ovation for his speech , which was broadcast live around Australia .
Rudd hugged members of the Stolen Generations watching from the floor .
Howard , who lost his seat at the last election , was not in parliament for the apology , but all of Australia ’s other living former prime ministers , conservative Malcolm Fraser and Labor ’s Paul Keating , Bob Hawke and Gough Whitlam , were in the galleries .
The issue has divided the conservative Liberal Party , but the apology had bipartisan support with new opposition leader Brendan Nelson offering his backing .
Rudd told lawmakers the apology was part of Australia ’s unfinished business .
“ As of today the time for denial , the time for delay , has at last come to an end , ” he said .
He called for reconciliation “ across the entire history of the often bloody encounter between those emerged from the dreamtime 1,000 generations ago and those who , like me , came across the seas only yesterday . ”
Australia has about 460,000 indigenous Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders , who make up about 2 percent of the 21 million population .
There are no aboriginal members in the national parliament .
Aborigines are the most disadvantaged group in Australia , with a life expectancy 17 years less than other Australians , and far higher rates of infant mortality , unemployment , imprisonment , alcohol and drug abuse and domestic violence .
Rudd has promised to end the gap in life expectancy within a generation , and to end aboriginal inequality .

UPDATE : Apparently , the list that I cut and paste from the senate.
gov site just after the vote was completed was inaccurate as it now shows that Obama also did not vote .
I was watching CNN and MSNBC throughout the morning and both networks reported that Obama was on the Senate floor , while Clinton was not there at all .
If that 's true and he did n't vote , it seems strange to me .
At any rate , the point of this post is not so much the fact that Clinton and Obama did n't vote ( as I 'm sure both of them would have voted with the Kennedy / Schumer Progressive block ) .
It 's the idea that 68 people voted " yea " to a free pass on domestic spying .
That needs a response from the American people .
UPDATE UPDATE :
claims Obama voted " nay " , although I tend to believe the senate.gov list at this point .
Notice that McCain voted " Yea " , Obama voted " Nay " , and Clinton did n't show up .
For what it 's worth .
Send an e-mail to your senator to complain if they supported this ....

Top U.S. Navy officials sharply criticized China on Tuesday for refusing to allow U.S. warships to stop in Hong Kong last week , signaling a potential fracture in American - Chinese relations just a short time after a visit to Beijing by Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates .
On Nov. 20 , the Chinese refused to allow two minesweepers , the Patriot and Guardian , to enter Hong Kong to refuel and take refuge from a storm .
The next day , the Chinese refused to permit the aircraft carrier Kitty Hawk and its strike group to make a scheduled four - day port call to Hong Kong for the Thanksgiving holiday .
Chinese officials have not yet provided an explanation for denying access to Hong Kong , and top U.S. military leaders have not spoken directly with the Chinese military .
Advertisement
The denial of access for the Kitty Hawk was later reversed .
But by that time , the carrier group was already en route to Japan after long - planned holiday reunions between American service members and their families had been ruined .
Adm. Timothy J. Keating , the head of U.S. Pacific Command , and Adm. Gary Roughead , the chief of naval operations , both took sharp exception to the Chinese government ’s refusal to allow the minesweepers to come into port when threatened by rough seas .
“ As someone who has been going to sea all my life , if there is one tenet that we observe it ’s when somebody is in need you provide [ assistance ] and you sort it out later , ” Roughead said .
Roughead noted that neither of the vessels was damaged by the storm and both were refueled at sea by a tanker .
Advertisement
China ’s denial of refuge for the minesweepers was perplexing and at odds with international mariner traditions , Keating said .
“ This is , kind of , an unwritten law amongst seamen , that if someone is in need , regardless of genus , phylum or species , you let them come in ; you give them safe harbor , ” Keating said .
“ Jimmy Buffett has songs about it , for crying out loud . ”
The Chinese have recently played host to a series of high - level visits by U.S. military officials .
Gates ’ visit on Nov. 5 followed an earlier visit by Adm. Michael G. Mullen , just before he became chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff .
U.S. officials have been working to improve military - to - military relations with China in hopes of coaxing the People ’s Liberation Army to be more forthcoming about its budget and military doctrine .
Advertisement
But China frequently maintains silence about the reasoning behind its military moves , as it has done in the case of the American warships .
Hong Kong is a popular harbor for U.S. warships .
Both Keating and Roughead said that the Navy continued to plan on using Hong Kong as a port of call .
About 50 U.S. Navy ships visit Hong Kong each year , Navy officials said .
The last naval ship to be denied access was the destroyer Curtis Wilbur in 2002 .
The Chinese never provided a reason for that denial .

The U.S. wants to establish a permanent hotline between the Pentagon and China ’s defense establishment .
Although the Chinese have agreed in principle to the phone line , they have delayed its implementation and the technical details have yet to be finalized .
Keating said he hoped to go to China in January , but the Chinese had not yet approved the visit .
If the trip happens , he said , the denial of refuge would be the top issue on his agenda .

Teff ( Eragrostis tef ) is a reliable , low risk ancient grain .
It is grown mainly as a cereal crop and can adapt to both drought and water logged conditions .
Teff grass is grown as forage for cattle and as a component in adobe construction in Ethiopia .
Teff grain is ground into flour , eaten as porridge or used to brew alcoholic beverages .
Teff is the smallest grain in the world , it takes 150 teff grains to weigh as much as one wheat grain .
Teff may be substituted for seeds , nuts or other small grains when baking , as a thickener for soups , stews , gravies and puddings , to make grain burgers , and in stir- fries and casseroles .
Nutritionally teff consists mainly of bran and germ , and contains no gluten - a source of many food allergies .
Teff is rich in calcium , phosphorous , iron , copper , aluminum , barium and thiamin , and is a good source of protein , amino acids ( especially lysine ) , carbohydrates and fibre .
Teff is virtually unknown in North America and the cultivation that does exist is done by private entrepreneurs in the U.S .

Several patent reform advocacy organizations have banded together to form a new coalition that will lead a collaborative effort to abolish software patents .
Supported by the Free Software Foundation , the Public Patent Foundation , and the Software Freedom Law Center , the End Software Patents ( ESP ) project aims to challenge the legal validity of patents that do not specify a physically innovative step .
In addition to helping companies challenge software patents in the courts and in the patent office , the ESP project will also work to educate the public and encourage grass - roots patent reform activism in order to promote effective legislative solutions to the software patent problem .
A growing number of software patents cover abstract principles that are essential to software development .
Consider , for instance , patent 5,175,857 , which covers a " System for sorting records having sorted strings each having a plurality of linked elements each element storing next record address . "
What the ' 857 patent describes is a quicksort implemented with a linked list .
Such patents are extremely detrimental to innovation because they apply serious encumbrances to the foundational building blocks of computer programming .
The rapid proliferation of software patents in recent years has transformed the technology industry into an intellectual property minefield .
Software companies have been forced to accumulate massive patent portfolios to use as leverage in elaborate cross-licensing agreements .
The resulting situation , which is akin to an arms race , seriously disadvantages independent software developers and has made it increasingly difficult to write conventional software without committing any infringement .
The courts will revisit software patentability
The patent system has traditionally excluded coverage of innate scientific truths and mathematical expressions .
There is no basis in law for assuming that software methods are patentable , but some dubious legal rulings issued by the Federal Circuit after its inception in the 1980s have created legal precedents for software patentability .
The federal circuit recently revealed that it intends to use the Bilski case ( PDF ) as an opportunity to reevaluate the scope of what can be patented — a move that could have extremely broad implications for patents on software and business methods .
ESP 's executive director , tech policy expert Ben Klemens , believes that the current climate in the courts and broad recognition of patent issues in the software industry make this the perfect time to mount a serious challenge against software patents .
" Software patents endanger both software developers and businesses , ironically stifling the very innovation that the U.S. patent system was intended to foster , " Klemens said in a statement .
" With statements from the Supreme Court and the USPTO supporting our position , we can use our court system to restore our patent system to its original state without delay . "
In a detailed report ( PDF ) published at the organization 's web site , ESP estimates that companies waste $ 11.4 billion every year in litigation over software patents .
The report also notes that companies not directly involved in the software industry are increasingly being targeted with software patent litigation .
Some examples of companies that have recently faced software patent infringement suits include Burlington Coat Factory , the Green Bay Packers , and Kraft Foods .
As our society becomes more and more dependent on software , the impact of these lawsuits will escalate sharply .
ESP 's report also points out that technological innovation in the software industry flourished profoundly prior to the court rulings that made software patentable .
This provides compelling evidence that software innovation will not be stifled in the absence of patent protection as some speculate .
It is also worth noting that specific implementations of software methods — in the form of source code — are fully protected by copyright law , which is arguably more than sufficient to safeguard the intellectual property rights of software creators .
Patent reform proposals are gaining momentum in congress , but largely fail to address the software patent issue .
The ESP project 's efforts to eliminate software patents by working through the court system could have very positive results for the entire software industry by helping to put an end to the destructive gridlock and patent trolling that has increasingly stifled technological innovation in software development .

Long before the passionate debates over cigarettes , DDT , asbestos or the ozone hole , most Americans had heard of only one environmental health controversy : fluoridation .
Starting in the 1950s , hundreds of communities across the U.S. became embroiled in heated battles over whether fluorides — ionic compounds containing the element fluorine — should be added to their water systems .
On one side was a broad coalition of scientists from government and industry who argued that adding fluoride to drinking water would protect teeth against decay ; on the other side were activists who contended that the risks of fluoridation were inadequately studied and that the practice amounted to compulsory medication and thus was a violation of civil liberties .
Berkeley and the Marines - semper screwy

Despite all the excitement focused on Super Tuesday , one of the most read and most commented stories throughout the week was not Hillary vs. Obama , or McCain vs. Romney and Huckabee .
It was , instead , Berkeley vs. the Marines .
More precisely , Berkeley 's City Council and the anti-war group Code Pink , seeming to gang up on a Marine recruitment office on Berkeley 's Shattuck Square .
The Marines were " unwelcome intruders , " the City Council declared in a letter .
Code Pink members - given a special parking spot outside by the council - chained themselves to the recruitment center 's doors , blocking the entrance .
The reaction has been incendiary , and not just from what Chronicle stories and columns have variously labeled " the right wing blogosphere " and " right wing zanies " - so much so that two council members want to rescind the declaration and another council meeting on the subject is scheduled for Tuesday .
Among the more than 1,300 comments posted ( so far ) on SFGate , few have been in defense of the City Council or Code Pink .
The vast majority , from far and wide - as well as from liberal Berkeley itself and people who otherwise consider themselves anti-war - have been along a continuum of outrage .
Below is a sample , edited for space , of those comments .
- Andrew S. Ross , Chronicle interactive editor
65 years ago I was a paper boy for the Chronicle .
In 1950 I was with PHIBPAC [ Amphibious Fleet , Pacific ] and helped carry in I Co. , 3rd Battalion , 5th Marines for the assault at Inchon ( Korea ) .
Seventy - eight days later , only 20 of those 200 Marines were still standing .
I am a 1964 MSEE grad from UC .
My wife also graduated from UC with a music major .
I never thought Berkeley would insult us , our sons , brothers and fellow Americans who put our lives on the line for the freedoms the city council so blatantly misuses .
- Birchard ( Bert ) Kortegaard , 78 , Berkeley
I forwarded this article to my son , a lieutenant in the USMC , but I am still going to discourage him from working at the recruiting office on Shattuck this summer .
The notion that some Berkeley resident would call my son a " murderer " or " baby killer " would really tick me off !
Then I would have to come down to Shattuck Avenue ....
- Vickie Darnell , 54 , Corning , Tehama County
( " mother of Midshipman Lt. Jess Darnell USMMA / USMC " )
As a graduate of UC Berkeley and a Marine veteran I am appalled .
The Marine Corps is not responsible for the decision to go to war .
If the council seeks to place blame for the war they should look to the president who made the decision to go to war , to the Congress who appropriated the funds to carry out the war , and to the American people who freely and legally elected them .
To compound the council 's hypocrisy and illogic the city freely accepts federal funds from the very system they denounce .
- Booth Myers , 65 , Brentwood
As a current Army officer , former Marine , and former San Franciscan , I am glad so many of you are sounding off on this Berkeley madness .
- Steve Lai , 45 , Mililani , Hawaii
Berkeley 's position did not " ignite the anger of the right wing " ( as one Chronicle story wrote ) .
It ignited the anger of every decent , thinking American .
From what I can see , even the majority of the lefties in the Bay Area really know what free speech means .
- Carl Baker , 62 , Mission Viejo , Orange County
I am requesting , with a mother 's heart , that you put federal marshals out in front of that recruiting station so that these fine Marines are protected and they can do our government 's business .
Immediately , please .
- Beverly Perlson , 51 , Oak Lawn , Ill .
( " Very proud mother of soldier , 82nd Airborne , 4th Deployment , Bronze Star Recipient . " )
I 'm a veteran .
Code Pink and the majority of the City Council do not speak for most of the Berkeley residents I know .
I 'm against the war , but this is the wrong way to protest against it .
If someone wants to join the Marines , that 's their right .
I 'll be at the next council meeting .
- Michael Roberts , 47 , Berkeley
I am starting a group to support the USMC office in Berkeley .
- Heather Jacobsen , 50 , Berkeley
Recruiters for cannon fodder are the shameful ones here , not the citizens who want them out or the members of the [ City Council ] who have the courage and morals to kick the warmongers out of town .
Keep recruiters out of our schools while we 're at it .
" No child left unrecruited " is the Marine , Army , Navy and Air Force way .
I refused to serve in '70 when I lived in Berkeley and it's the smartest and most honorable thing I ever did .
I was convicted and served probation at Sonoma State Hospital teaching deaf - blind kids how to communicate and tie their shoes , which was a helluva lot better than goin ' to ' Nam and killing people I never saw .
OUT with the recruiters - all of them !
- Alan Moore , 59 , Fairbanks , Alaska ( " native San Franciscan " )
Why did someone put a Marine recruiting center here ?
They must have known something like this would happen .
Perhaps they wanted to see the City Council humiliated in a fight they had chosen to start ?
I disapprove of the original ordinance , and I do n't think Code Pink needed its own parking space , or a special blow - horn permit , but if you are going to go that route , stick with it .
- Steve White , 50 , Oakland
The recruiting station has every right to set up shop there .
If the lefties do n't want to enlist , do n't enlist .
- Peter Udell , 54 , San Francisco
I can understand opposition to the war , but the arrogance and hatred that emits from this proposal is just unfathomable to me .
Peace loving ?
They show their peace loving by giving a permanent parking space in front of the recruiting office to a group that abhors the Marines ?
- Kim Parigoris , 52 , Lodi
The [ City Council ] should be commended for admitting they erred in judgment and leave it at that .
- Sharon Jones , 58 , San Francisco
The real issue here is not the war in Iraq or the Marines .
The real issue here is the blatant hypocrisy of a city where the Free Speech Movement began .
Imagine if a pro-life group wanted to get a permit similar to the one given to Code Pink to protest an abortion clinic in Berkeley .
Do you think the City Council would grant them a permit ?
Of course not .
- Frank Sullivan , 48 , San Francisco
Code Pink is the Operation Rescue of the left .
- Sherman Lewis Jr. , 38 , Alameda
Safe to say that these individuals who wish to disrupt Marine recruiting would be the first to hide behind one if their life was threatened .
And the Marine would not think twice about his duty to protect that individual regardless of his or her disdain for the man in uniform .
I think that 's what we need to remember here and ask yourself who you 'd trust and rather be in a foxhole with .
I 'll take the Marine every time .
- Mark Dale , 44 , Damascus , Ore .
The most disturbing part of this whole thing though is that the council voted to give a parking space to a group of people whose sole purpose was to harass and badger another human being .
Freedom of speech and assembly is fine , but the government should not be openly endorsing one organization in such a way .
- Thomas Kotris , 32 , High Point , N.C .
Watch them back down when they have to make a sacrifice for their beliefs - in this case the possible loss of federal tax dollars .
- Robert Reinbold , 48 , Swarthmore , Pa .
We can choose to stay out of Berkeley with our wallets , refusing to spend one dime within the city limits of Berkeley until the City Council backs off on this insulting position .
- William Thompson , 64 , Walnut Creek
As an " out - of stater " I 'm very happy to see these comments from the " locals . "
All of your comments give me faith .
- Ray Schroeder , 45 , Pukalani , Hawaii
Well , in the three - way race between San Francisco , Berkeley and Santa Monica for spewing out insipid , drooling , leftist drivel , Berkeley has pretty much taken the trophy for 2008 , and so remarkably early in the year !
- Jeffrey Griffith , 57 , Newport Beach
Long live Berkeley 's values !
- Sandy Bauman , 42 , Wyomissing , Pa .

To prevent a life of crime , buy your kid a gun
To prevent a life of crime , buy your kid a gun
by Vin Suprynowicz
It 's called propaganda : Simplify your lie down to an easily - recalled slogan , repeat it often enough , and people will eventually get it down by heart and accept it as fact .
Take : " The cause of all these school shootings is the too - easy availability of guns . "
Prior to the National Firearms
Act of 1933 , there was no law to discourage a veteran of the Great War from keeping a fully - operational souvenir machine gun in the bedroom closet .
There were few towns in America where the local lads did n't know the location of at least one such weapon .
Yet none was ever used in a " school shooting . "
As late as the 1960s , it was not unusual in rural America for young boys to carry their .22 rifles to school with them , parking them in the principal 's office until needed for the target matches after school .
At age 49 I am no doddering old - timer , but I can remember young lads walking the country roads of Ohio and Connecticut after school with their rifles ( or bicycling home with the weapons across their handlebars ) , hoping to pick off some predatory bird with the full encouragement of area farmers .
A neighbor might chide you about watching where your bullets went if you missed , but no one ever called the police to report " The Jones boy is heading down the road with his gun ; come arrest him ! "
When I went away to Eaglebrook School in Massachusetts ( yes , " Own a gun , go to jail " Massachusetts ) in 1962 at the age of 12 , I took my rifle .
We fired for accuracy at the range on Saturdays .
I daresay we could have snuck them out of the lockers down at the gym for some mayhem if it ever crossed our minds ... but it never did .
The violent media ?
Today 's TV offers nothing like " The Rifleman " or " Wanted Dead or Alive , " programs of the early 1960s in which Chuck Connors and Steve McQueen ended every episode by mowing down some reprobate who had kicked the town dog or insulted Millie down at the general store , in McQueen 's case using a sawed - off Winchester which it 's now a federal felony even to recreate for a museum .
This focus on " the availability of guns " -- ignoring the fact they were far more accessible only 40 years ago , when you could order a 20 - mm Lahti anti-tank gun through the mail from an ad in the back of a comic book -- is intended not only to advance the prior agenda of those who want a disarmed and enslaved citizenry , but also to distract us from asking what it is about the mandatory behavior modification labs ( public schools ) which creates such rage and frustration in our incarcerated adolescent males .
We do n't see these shoot - em- ups in the private schools , or among home - schoolers .
It also diverts attention from the perfectly relevant question of how many of these shooters had been on drugs known to affect the judgment , like Ritalin and Luvox , prescribed and administered by their government wardens .
In the face of all this misdirection , is n't it too bad the government has never conducted an actual scientific study on how it affects a child 's likelihood of committing crimes if his parents buy him a gun ?
Um , actually ... they have .
The study was conducted from 1993 - 1995 by the U.S. Department of Justice 's Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention .
Child psychologists tracked 4,000 boys and girls aged 6 to 15 in Denver , Pittsburgh , and Rochester , N.Y .
Their findings ? --
Children who get guns from their parents do n't commit gun crimes ( 0 percent ) while children who get guns illegally are quite likely to do so ( 21 percent ) .
--
Children who get guns from parents are less likely to commit any kind of street crime ( 14 percent ) than children who have no gun in the house ( 24 percent ) -- and are dramatically less likely to do so than children who acquire an illegal gun ( 74 percent . ) --
Children who get guns from parents are less likely to use banned drugs ( 13 percent ) than children who get illegal guns ( 41 percent . ) --
Most strikingly , the study found : " Boys who own legal firearms have much lower rates of delinquency and drug use ( than boys who own illegal guns ) and are even slightly less delinquent than non-owners of guns . "
This would n't have surprised anyone before the rise of the modern welfare state .
It used to be common knowledge that the best way to get kids to act " responsibly " was precisely to give them some " responsibility . "
Why would we assume a child taught by his parents to use a gun responsibly would n't also be more responsible in his other behaviors ?
" Want to dramatically reduce the chance that your child will commit a gun-related crime or -- heaven forbid -- go on a shooting spree ? " asked the national Libertarian Party in a May 21 news release detailing these study results .
" Buy your youngster a gun . "
" Politicians are apparently more interested in demonizing guns than they are in facts , " commented LP national director Steve Dasbach , himself an Indiana government schoolteacher .
But " The evidence is in : The simplest way to reduce firearm - related violence among children is to buy them a gun and teach them how to use it responsibly . "

“ THE Iranian regime is basically a messianic apocalyptic cult . ”
So says Israel 's once and perhaps future prime minister , Binyamin Netanyahu .
If he is right the world is teetering on the edge of a terrifying crisis .
While the world has been distracted by Iraq , Afghanistan and much else , Iran has been moving relentlessly closer to the point where it could build an atomic bomb .
It has converted yellowcake into uranium hexafluoride gas .
Now it is spinning the gas through thousands of centrifuges it has installed at the underground enrichment plant it built secretly in Natanz , south of Tehran .
A common guess is that if it can run 3,000 centrifuges at high speed for a year , it will end up with enough fuel for its first bomb .
According to the International Atomic Energy Agency , the UN 's nuclear watchdog , Iran could have 3,000 centrifuges hooked up by the end of this month .
The Iranians say their next aim is to scale up to 54,000 centrifuges .
Figuring out how to put the fuel into a usable weapon will also take time — perhaps a year or more .
But for would - be bomb - builders , making the fuel is by far the hardest part .
The upshot , say Israel and some American experts , is that Iran may have a bomb by the end of 2009 .
Mohammed ElBaradei , the IAEA 's director - general , is more cautious .
But even he says that if Iran really wants a bomb it could now build one within three to eight years .
Choose your unhappy ending
What Iran is doing at Natanz is entirely illegal .
It has signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and says its nuclear aims are peaceful .
But having spent decades deceiving nuclear inspectors , it is disbelieved even by its friends .
A year ago this month Russia and China therefore joined the rest of the UN Security Council in ordering Iran to stop .
It carried on regardless .
The Security Council followed up with two resolutions , in December 2006 and March this year , repeating its demands and applying sanctions .
The centrifuges spin defiantly on .
So what next ?
This story could have at least three unhappy endings .
In one , Iran ends up with nuclear weapons , bringing new instability and a hair - trigger face - off with nuclear Israel into one of the world 's least - safe neighbourhoods .
In another , America or Israel take pre-emptive military action and manage to stop it , even though such an attack would almost certainly have very dangerous consequences of its own .
In the third ending , Iran is attacked , and enraged , and retaliates — and still ends up with a bomb anyway .
It is vital to understand that this third finale is not a nightmare dreamt up by editorial writers .
After the false intelligence that led America into Iraq , and the mayhem that followed , it may seem hard to believe that America or Israel are pondering an attack on a much bigger Muslim country .
But they are — and they are not mad .
This time , after all , there is no question of false intelligence : the world 's fears are based on capabilities that Iran itself boasts about openly .
Nor would there be another invasion : this would be an attack from the air , aimed at disabling or destroying Iran 's nuclear sites .
From a technical point of view , launching such an attack is well within America 's capabilities ( America has lately reinforced its carrier fleet in the Persian Gulf ) and perhaps within Israel 's , too .
Yet such an attack would nonetheless be a huge gamble .
Even if it delayed or stopped Iran 's nuclear programme , it would knock new holes in America 's relations with the Muslim world .
And if only for the sake of their domestic political survival , Iran 's leaders would almost certainly hit back .
Iran could fire hundreds of missiles at Israel , attack American forces in Iraq and Afghanistan , organise terrorist attacks in the West or choke off tanker traffic through the Strait of Hormuz , the world 's oil windpipe .
How could any Western leader in his right mind risk initiating such a sequence of events ?
The succinct answer of Senator John McCain is that although attacking Iran would be bad , an Iran with nuclear weapons would be worse .
He is not alone : most of America 's presidential candidates would consider military force .
Cult or calculator ?
If Iran really is no more than the “ messianic cult ” of Mr Netanyahu 's imagination , it would be worth running almost any risk to stop it acquiring nuclear weapons .
But as our special report argues , Iran is not that easy to read .
Iran is a self - proclaimed theocracy .
Yet it has conducted foreign relations since the revolution of 1979 in a way that seems perfectly rational even if it is not pleasant .
Its president , the Holocaust - questioning Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , is widely reported to have threatened to “ wipe Israel off the map ” .
But in fact he may never have uttered those precise words , and there is both ambiguity and calculation behind the bluster .
Look closer and Mr Ahmadinejad is vague about whether he means that Iran should destroy Israel or just that he hopes for Israel 's disappearance .
Knowing that a nuclear attack on Israel or America would result in its own prompt annihilation , Iran could probably be deterred , just as other nuclear powers have been .
Did n't Nikita Khrushchev promise to “ bury ” the West ?
Since Israel has memories of a real Holocaust , it may not set much store by that “ probably ” .
This newspaper continues to believe that even for Israel containment of a nuclear Iran would be less awful than a risky pre-emptive attack that would probably cause mayhem , strengthen the regime and merely delay the day Iran gets a bomb .
Yet the whole world still has a huge interest in preventing that day from coming .
Even if Iran never used its bomb , mere possession of it might encourage it to adopt a more aggressive foreign policy than the one it is already pursuing in Iraq , Lebanon and the Palestinian territories .
And once Iran went nuclear other countries in the region — such as Saudi Arabia , Egypt and perhaps Turkey — would probably feel compelled to follow suit , thereby entangling the Middle East in a cat 's cradle of nuclear tripwires .
Is there a way to avoid all of the unhappy endings by finding a peaceful way to stop Iran going nuclear ?
The Europeans hoped they had stumbled on such a solution last year , when they at last talked Russia and China into imposing sanctions and George Bush into dangling the prospect of normal relations with Iran once enrichment stopped .
But the mild sanctions imposed so far are not working , and now the technological clock in Natanz is outrunning the diplomatic clock at the United Nations .
Iran may soon work out how to spin its centrifuges at full speed for long periods ; and once it learns how to do that the odds of stopping it from building a bomb will rapidly lengthen .
This suggests that a third sanctions resolution , with sharper teeth , needs to be enacted without delay .
Iran is obstinate , paranoid and ambitious .
But it is also vulnerable .
A young population with no memory of the revolution is desperate for jobs its leaders have failed to provide .
Sanctions that cut off equipment for its decrepit oilfields or struck hard at the financial interests of the regime and its protectors in the Revolutionary Guards would have an immediate impact on its own assessment of the cost of its nuclear programme .
That on its own is unlikely to change the regime 's mind .
If at the same time Iran was offered a dignified ladder to climb down — above all a credible promise of an historic reconciliation with the United States — the troubled leadership of a tired revolution might just grab it .
But time is short .

When Industry Minister Jim Prentice tries to justify a Canadian DMCA , he frequently claims that the business community is demanding these reforms .
Those claims have now been completely undermined .
Sources report that this afternoon , a powerhouse group of companies and business associations in Canada spoke up for fair and balanced copyright .
The Business Coalition for Balanced Copyright includes a who's who of the telecom , Internet , retail , and broadcast communities .
Signatories include the Canadian Association of Broadcasters ( CAB ) , Canadian Association of Internet Providers , a division of CATAlliance ( CAIP ) , Canadian Cable Systems Alliance ( CCSA ) , Canadian Wireless and Telecommunications Association ( CWTA ) , Computer and Communications Industry Association ( CCIA ) , Retail Council of Canada ( RCC ) , Google , Third Brigade , Tucows , Yahoo !
Canada , Cogeco Cable , EastLink , MTS Allstream , Rogers Communications Inc. , SaskTel , and Telus .
Yes – you just read right – Google , Yahoo ! , Rogers , Telus , Cogeco , and dozens of other companies are speaking out as the largest cable companies , largest retailers , largest broadcasters , largest Internet companies , and most of the major telcos have all joined forces to oppose a Canadian DMCA .
What does this new coalition stand for ?
An excerpt from the proposed package includes [ UPDATE :
The position paper is available here ] :
1. Expanded Fair Dealing – " if Canada is to truly modernize its copyright legislation , then the time has come for Canada to broaden the existing fair dealing rights in the Act by adopting a more flexible approach that is illustrative rather than exhaustive . "
2. TPMs – " rules against the circumvention of effective technological measures that are used by rights owners in connection with the exercise of their rights must not prohibit Canadians from engaging in non-infringing activities . "
3. Making Available – " to the extent necessary to meet its WIPO obligations , Canada should introduce only a very narrow exclusive right of making available for those rights owners who need it to protect the legitimate online distribution of their works . "
4. Private Copying – " the government should seriously question the continued existence of the private copying regime . "
5. Avoid Copyright Liability for Technical Processes – " the Act should be amended to grant broadcasters a full and meaningful exception from the reproduction right , similar to that which exists in most other developed countries . "
6. ISP Liability – " as all of Canada 's major trading partners have long recognized , Internet service providers should face no copyright liability when acting as intermediaries . "
7. Rational and Effective Enforcement – " while those who infringe copyright on a commercial scale or to the material prejudice of rights holders should be subject to appropriate penalties , courts should have more flexibility to limit damages in circumstances where there is only minimal harm to rights holders resulting from the conduct . "
It is difficult to overstate the importance of this new coalition and its support for fair copyright principles .
With such an impressive list of backers , the Industry Minister must now surely recognize that his proposed bill is opposed by the very industries that he has promised to support .
In the past , I 've described a Canadian DMCA as anti-education and anti-consumer – it is now unquestionably anti-business as well .
Update : Google has posted on the coalition on the Google Policy Blog .
The CBC has detailed coverage here .
SAN FRANCISCO -- Barry Bonds , baseball 's home run king , was
indicted for perjury and obstruction of justice Thursday and could
go to prison instead of the Hall of Fame for telling a federal
grand jury he did not knowingly use performance - enhancing drugs .
The indictment , culminating a four - year investigation into
steroid use by elite athletes , charged Bonds with four counts of
perjury and one of obstruction of justice .
If convicted , he could
be sentenced to a maximum of 30 years in prison .
Shortly after the indictment was handed up , Bonds ' personal
trainer , Greg Anderson , was ordered released after spending most of
the past year in prison for refusing to testify against his
longtime friend .
The 10 - page indictment mainly consists of excerpts from Bonds '
December 2003 testimony before a federal grand jury investigating
the Bay Area supplements lab at the center of a steroid
distribution ring .
It cites 19 occasions in which Bonds allegedly
lied under oath .
An attorney familiar with the investigation told ESPN's T.J. Quinn that the government obtained the results of positive steroids tests for Bonds during a search of BALCO facilities .
The source said the positive results did not come from confidential testing conducted by Major League Baseball and the players ' association .
In approximately 2001 , MLB conducted tests to gauge the level of substance problems among players .
The government subpoenaed those records .
In August , when the 43 - year - old Bonds passed Hank Aaron to
become the career home run leader , he flatly rejected any
suggestion that the milestone was stained by steroids .
" This record is not tainted at all .
At all .
Period , " Bonds
said .
Under " Federal Rules of Criminal Procedures , " Bonds does not have to surrender for fingerprinting , mug shots and a bond hearing until his initial arraignment in U.S. District Court in San
Francisco .
His arraignment is scheduled for the morning of Dec. 7 .
At that point , Bonds will appear before a magistrate judge and then likely be handed over to U.S. Marshals , who will conduct the booking procedures .
But while San Franciscans cheered his every swing and fans
elsewhere scorned every homer , a grand jury quietly worked behind
closed doors to put the finishing touches on the long - rumored
indictment .
Bonds still will be eligible for the Hall of Fame even if he 's convicted and goes to prison , said Jack O'Connell , secretary - treasurer of the Baseball Writers Association of America .
Hall of Fame voters , however , punished Mark McGwire last year when he appeared on the ballot for the first time ; McGwire received 128 votes , far short of the necessary 409 needed for induction .
Bonds is by far the highest - profile figure caught up in the
steroids probe , which also ensnared track star Marion Jones .
She
pleaded guilty in October to lying to federal investigators about
using steroids and faces up to six months in prison .
Bonds finished the year with 762 homers , seven more than Aaron ,
and is currently a free agent .
In 2001 , he set the season record
with 73 home runs .
Late in the season , the San Francisco Giants told the seven - time
National League MVP they did n't want him back next year .
One of his
attorneys , John Burris , did n't know of the indictment before being
alerted by The Associated Press and said he would call Bonds to
notify him .
" I 'm surprised , " Burris said , " but there 's been an effort to
get Barry for a long time .
I 'm curious what evidence they have now
they did n't have before . "
Defense attorney Mike Rains said he spoke briefly with Bonds but
did not describe his reaction .
At an evening news conference , he
read a statement accusing federal prosecutors of " unethical
misconduct " and declined to take questions .
" Every American should worry about a Justice Department that
does n't know if waterboarding is torture and can't tell the
difference between prosecution on the one hand and persecution on
the other , " Rains said .
He has never been identified by Major League Baseball as testing
positive for steroids .
The Giants , the players ' union and even the White House called
it a sad day for baseball .
" This is a very sad day .
For many years , Barry Bonds was an
important member of our team and is one of the most talented
baseball players of his era .
These are serious charges .
Now that
the judicial process has begun , we look forward to this matter
being resolved in a court of law , " the Giants said .
Union head Donald Fehr said he was " saddened " to learn of the
indictment , but cautioned that " every defendant , including Barry
Bonds , is entitled to the presumption of innocence unless and until
such time as he is proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt . "
Reporters Without Borders
April 25 , 2008
Reporters Without Borders condemns the holding of the 17th International World Wide Web Conference ( WWW2008 ) in Beijing .
With “ One World , One Web ” as its main theme , this five - day conference , which ends today , has been looking at the changing behaviour of Internet users and their participation in public affairs by means of social networks .
“ Staging such a conference just a few kilometres from where Hu Jia , Shi Tao and 46 other cyber - dissidents are imprisoned is a provocation , ” the press freedom organisation said .
Leading Internet figures ( researchers , engineers and businessmen ) meet at the annual WWW2008 conferences to discuss new Internet trends and technologies .
“ Among other things , the conference is about the importance of Internet users in society , how they are becoming more and more active in creating online virtual communities , ” Reporters Without Borders said .
“ But in China , voicing one ’s views online is a crime if they do not accord with what the party thinks .
Nothing in the programme suggests that online freedom of expression has been tackled .
But a minimum of decency and respect for China ’s imprisoned cyber - dissidents would have demanded this . ”
The conference is being staged jointly by Beihang university and the World Wide Web Consortium ( W3C ) , an alliance of 421 bodies and universities launched in 1994 that plays a leading role in Internet innovation and the adoption of new surfing techniques .
One of WWW2008 ’s most important sponsors is the US Internet company Yahoo ! , which provided the Chinese authorities with online account information that led to the imprisonment of four Chinese cyber - dissidents .
China has more Internet users than any other country , but it holds a leading position in the Reporters Without Borders list of countries that are “ Internet enemies . ”
More than 2,500 online discussion forums were closed down in 2007 .
Currently , 48 cyber - dissidents are in prison for criticising government policy or calling for democracy .

Jennifer Maestre : I 'm a late bloomer as an artist .
I went to Mass College of Art in my 30's , and majored in Glass .
Before that , I 'd always done some type of creative project , but never full time .
I 'm basically self taught as far as what I do now , they do n't teach my type of pencil art in school .
I was recently fortunate to be in touch with artist Jennifer Maester , who for a number of years has mesmerized us with her sculptures .
I asked her if I could interview her for the blog .
Not only was she happy the communicate , but we also got to see some very new work of hers .
RM : What mediums do you use for creating your art and objects ?
JM : For now , I am using mostly pencils .
The sculptures are made by drilling holes in one inch long sections of pencils , and sewing them together using a sculptural beading technique called ' peyote ' stitch .
RM : Who do you think most influenced your work ?
JM : I love Ernst Haeckle 's work , but I 'd say it inspires rather than influences me .
RM : When did you fascination for pencils begin ?
How did it become one of
your best - known art mediums ?
JM : I 've always been the type to use pencils down to the tiniest nub , and save the nubs .
However , when I started using pencils in my sculptures , it was more about the textures they could allow me to achieve .
I was experimenting with lots of pointy things , and pencils happened to be easy to get , and fun to work with .
As for it becoming my best - known art mediums - I 'm not really sure !
RM : How do you think up the subjects for your sculptures ?
JM : Sometimes I have a rough idea in my head for a form , sometimes things go awry , and I end up somewhere I never envisioned .
Sometimes I make a ' pattern ' for myself , and follow it to see what happens .
Many times , one sculpture will inspire the next .
Originally , I was inspired by the form and texture of the sea urchin , I still make them out of pencils .
RM : Do you buy pencils in bulk quantities ?
How many do you estimate
you 've used in the last year ?
JM : Yes , I do buy in bulk , if I can .
I 'm very sad that one of my sources has been bought up by a Mega Corporation with a very un-user friendly website - no way to figure out how to get a case of pencils !
On the other hand , a very nice German pencil company sent me 2 cases of gorgeous pencils for free .
They are seconds , but I for one can't find any fault with them .
It is tough for me to estimate , but I reckon I 've used at least 5,000 pencils , just for sculptures , not including the jewelry .
RM : Where is your work exhibited ?
For sale ?
JM : I am represented by Mobilia Gallery in Cambridge MA. , at least as far as the sculptures .
I sell my jewelry in a few shops , galleries , and Museum stores , and on etsy.com .
RM : Tell us about your pencil jewelry .
What kind of feedback do you get
from people who have worn it or given as gifts ?
JM : I started making the jewelry in 2005 .
I had made a teapot commission , and the handle was done with a laminated block of pencils , carved .
The shapes and colors were so interesting , I decided to try making the jewelry .
I enjoy doing it , as I get results a lot sooner than I do when I 'm sewing my sculptures together !
It is interesting watching people looking at the jewelry .
Sometimes , they get it right away , but other times , even if I tell them what the material is , they still can't puzzle it out .
Sometimes people ask me if I melt the pencils - which is a funny question - pencils are made of wood !
RM : What 's next on the horizon ?
JM : I 've been making some artist trading cards , and am thinking I 'd like to expand on that .
I also want to make a chess set out of pencils , but first I need to get more pencils .
Of course , those are both for fun , for days when I 'm not working on my sculptures .

Virginia ’s Presidential Primary is coming up on February 12th and , for some time now , I ’ve been trying to figure out who I was going to vote for , or even if I was going to vote at all .
On the Republican side , before the election ended yesterday , my choices were bleak indeed .
I ’ve already reiterated before the reasons I ca n’t support John McCain , Mitt Romney , and Mike Huckabee and there ’s no need to repeat them here .
Up until December or January , I probably would have cast my vote for Ron Paul even though I did n’t agree with him on two important issues — immigration and foreign policy — but , with the newsletter story being the straw that broke the camel ’s back , I quickly became disillusioned with both the campaign and the candidate and now I do n’t think that his campaign will have any lasting impact on the Republican Party .
If there were still a race , I probably still would have voted for Paul just to cast a protest vote , but that seems utterly pointless now .
But , you see , I live in Virginia and we have completely open primaries .
When Virginians go to the polls on Tuesday , they simply need to ask for the Democratic or Republican ballot , and they can vote for whom they please .
While I personally think that party primaries should be closed affairs , the open primary presents me with a very interesting opportunity this year .
The Republican race is over , but the Democratic primary is n’t and it ’s possibly the most important race that this nation has seen .
Issues aside , I have come to the conclusion that the worst thing that has happened to this country has been the fact that we ’ve been living in a Bush - Clinton - Bush dynasty for the past 20 years .
The first Bush Administration was n’t all that bad , and George H.W. Bush was , faults aside , a relatively decent person .
But you would n’t have known that from the rhetoric thrown at him from both the left and the right .
Then , when Bill & Hillary Clinton came to power in 1993 — and , make no mistake , these two have always been a team — the political atmosphere in this country changed , and it changed for the worse .
It was n’t all the Clintons either , almost from the day the Clinton Administration came into office there was this element of the right whose opposition to the President was nothing short of venomous .
There were allegations that Bill Clinton was involved in drug- running ( remember Mena anyone ? ) , that Vince Foster had been murdered , that Bill had an illegitimate black child , even that the Clinton Administration administered the Oklahoma City bombing .
It was the era of the militas , and black helicopter conspiracy theories , and the Y2 K nonsense .
And it was the era when the Contract for America died on the altar of the Lewinsky scandal and ill - considered impeachment hearings .
Then , George W. Bush came into office .
I just knew things were n’t going to calm down when he won in a closely - fought disputed election that was , ultimately , decided by the Supreme Court ( correctly I would submit ) , and they did n’t .
The Loony Left picked up right where the Loony Right had left off .
And then 9/11 happened .
For awhile , it seemed like something had happened that would , much like World War II , unite the country .
For a time , it did , but only for a time .
The conspiracy theories started almost as soon as the smoke stopped floating into the sky and the 9/11 Truthers are still with us .
The political venom in the air since 2001 is , if anything , worse than what we saw during the Clinton Administration and , once again , both sides are to blame .
Michael Moore is an idiot , and so is Ann Coulter .
We ’re yelling at each other and accomplishing nothing .
What ’s needed , I am convinced , is a break with the past and a new direction .
In some sense , although I hate to admit it , John McCain represents that for the GOP but Barack Obama represents it even more and , more importantly , is running against the one person who , if she wins , would guarantee a return to same crap we ’ve been dealing with since 1993 on both sides of the political aisle .
A few weeks ago Mark at Publius endures explained why he could support Barack Obama , and I agree with him :
I could not disagree more with Obama on many of his policies .
Yet I find myself drawn to supporting him – passionately , even – because his goals are liberal in the classical sense .
I repeat – I do not think his means are libertarian in any way , and are arguably not even classically liberal means .
But the goals , so far as I can see , ARE classically liberal .
His are not goals centered entirely around maximizing his own political power , and thus he is a candidate worthy of my deep respect .
These ultimate ends are the same ends as exist for us perjoratively - named cosmo-libertarians ( as well as for other derivations of classical liberalism ) .
For all these reasons , on February 12th , I will be voting for a Democratic Presidential candidate for the first time in my life , and I will be voting for Barack Obama .
Does this mean I would vote for Obama in November if he ’s the nominee ?
No , and , frankly I probably would n’t .
I also wo n’t vote for John McCain .
But the Democrats deserve to have their best candidate as their nominee , and they deserve to have the Clinton machine destroyed , and if I can help in that process I am happy to .
j-j-j- jQuery .
It ’s on everyone ’s lips , right ?
You love it or you hate it , or you ’ve never tried it but you love it , or you ’ve never tried it but you super - hate it .
Yeah , we know .
Well , PJ and I launched FamSpam a bit ago and made the bold move of powering all the jabbascript with jQuery .
We even wrote our own Facbeook - style lightbox library in jQuery ( Facebox ) .
So while this is a Ruby blog , indulge me for a moment as we dance with Ruby ’s ugly - cool half - sister : Javascript .
what Query ?
There are a bajillion posts about jQuery , all of which introduce you gently , so I will be brief : jQuery is all about a single namespace and kickass querying .
( Get it ? )
Our buddy Hpricot , you may remember , was heavily influenced by jQuery ’s selector syntax .
Which was , in turn , heavily influenced by CSS selectors .
As such , some of this may look familiar :
$ ( ' #id ' ) .hide ( ) $ ( '.class ' ) .css ( ' height ' , 20 ) $ ( ' # posts li > a' ) .addClass ( ' dark ')
And so forth .
One of the fun things is that any of those $ ( ) queries may return 0 , 1 , or more elements — yet the code stays the same .
That ’s right : our css ( ) call would affect the height of all matched elements .
Same with the addClass .
But , if nothing is found , it ’ll all silently fail .
jAwesome !
niceQuery ( )
While some of the recent “ jQuery vs < insert_framework_here > ” blog posts might not be so nice , jQuery itself certainly is : it ( mostly ) easily works alongside other libraries .
That means you can start dipping your toe into the jSauce while your Prototype or MooTools code does n’t suspect a thing .
It ’s easy :
jQuery.noConflict ( )
j Query ( ' #id ' ) .hide ( ) j Query ( '.class ').css ( ' height ' , 20 ) jQuery ( '# posts li > a' ) .addClass ( ' dark ')
My above examples would now be written like this :
The noConflict ( ) call causes jQuery to defer ownership of $ ( ) to Moo or Proto , leaving your current js intact .
How thoughtful .
Check more at the comprehensive doc site .
chainQuery ( )
j Query is all about chaining , in a big way .
Here ’s an example from FamSpam :
var person_email = $ ( this ) .parent ( ) .find ('#person_email ').val ( )
Pretty self explanatory .
The find is scoped to the receiver , in this case the parent of the current element .
Another cool chain :
$ ( '# invite_error ' ) .
show ( ) .
text ( ' Please enter an email and a name . ')
Hrm , we should probably put text ( ) before show ( ) , yeah ?
I love these kind of questions !
Finally , a slightly more advanced chain :
$ ('# facebox .body ' ) .children ( ) .hide ( ) .end ( ) .
append ( '< div class = " loading " >< img src= " '+$s.loading_image +'" /></div>')
Get it ?
The end ( ) reverts the most recent ‘ destructive ’ ( read : find ) operation .
So we start with the .body , then find its children , then hide its children , then go back to .body and append some html .
Slick , I think .
Real slick .
Like I said , the doc site is super great .
ujsQuery ( )
Okay , here ’s the segue : jQuery has unobtrusiveness built in .
And it feels smooth .
Real smooth .
Here , a snippet straight from FamSpam ’s javascript :
$ ('.reset_invite_form').click ( function ( ) { $ ( ' #new_person').resetForm ( ) $ ( ' #invite_another ' ) .hide ( ) $ ('#invite_another > span ' ) .remove ( ) $ ( ' # new_person ' ) .
show ( ) return false })
Pretty simple , right ?
And clear , to boot .
What we do is slip this code inside of a function passed to $ ( document ) .ready ( ) , which will be run when the , erm , document is , uh , ready .
$ ( document ) .
ready ( function { $ ( '.reset_invite_form ').click ( function ( ) { ... stuff ... } ) } )
Like this :
So on and so forth .
We attach Facebox to links the same way :
if ( $.facebox ) $ ( 'a[ rel*=facebox ] ' ) .facebox ( )
If the Facebox plugin is loaded , we find any links with a rel of “ facebox ” and convert them from normal links into jsery ’d Facebox links .
Easy as pie .
Which brings us , of course , to the segue .
spamQuery ( )
How are we using jQuery on FamSpam ?
jRails ?
Something custom ?
By hand ?!
Yeah , well , by hand .
We add all our behavior unobtrusively using the method detailed above .
As far as I know , there ’s no javascript in our html .
If there is it ’s on the run .
For its life .
If you want to peep around , the js is ( predictably ) right here : http://famspam.com/javascripts/application.js.
Something to note : as of writing ( 1.2.2 ) , jQuery does n’t play nicely with Rails ’ respond_to .
But , hold the phone , it ’s okay : a simple fix .
Right here :
jQuery.ajaxSetup({ ' beforeSend ' : function ( xhr ) { xhr.setRequestHeader( " Accept " , " text / javascript " ) } })
You ’re now ready to rock .
Oh , one more thing before we move on : if you want some ajax - flavored will_paginate , check out this short guide .
It was mentioned in another post , and now it ’s mentioned here .
plugQuery ( )
j Query , you see , has a wonderfully simple plugin system .
We take full advantage of it by using a few choice plugins .
Here ’s a taste to wet your pallet .
The most essential plugin is the jQuery Form Plugin .
With it , you can unobtrusively convert normal forms into ajax forms .
The ( obvious ) advantage of this is graceful degradation , which is very kind but also very courageous .
$ ('# new_person ' ) .ajaxForm( function ( ) { alert ( ' Atta boy ! ' ) })
Seriously .
Simple .
And just so perfect for Rails — all the form ’s attributes stay the same , including its action and method , just now it ’s submitted through ajax .
respond_to and jQuery are so in love it ’s making me sick .
Another plugin we use is the Tablesorter .
While we do n’t have much tabular data on the promo or family sides of FamSpam , our admin interface is full of it .
Want to sort your families by number of members ?
Conversations ?
Photos ?
It ’s one line of code with this plugin .
Sure , we ’ll have to do some more complicated server - side sorting as our database grows , but this does the trick so quick right now .
$ ('#sorted_table ' ) .tablesorter ( )
See ?
Another plugin we really love is the anti-aliased rounded corner plugin .
Unfortunately this is not the most popular rounded corner plugin for jQuery , and that ’s a shame .
A damn shame .
Because it ’s definitely the best .
We use it on the home page and other places we thought could use some class .
As usual , it ’s dead simple once installed :
$ ( '.corner ' ) . corner ( )
You do n’t have to be so generic with it , but we like to be .
Finally , the brand new autocomplete plugin by ReinH and wycats is simple , small , and slick .
See a pattern here ?
We ’re using this on our admin site and could n’t be happier .
It speaks JSON , baby .
Sign me up .
thatsitQuery ( )
Thanks for letting us stray for a moment from our normally dreary discourse .
Got any other cool jQuery tips or treats ?
Leave ‘em in the comments .
Oh , a parting gift .
More code to chew on : our tour.js .
We use it to power the FamSpam tour .
Enjoy .
Bush approval among military families down 50 % since 2004 Jason Rhyne
Published : Friday December 7 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This Support for President Bush and his Iraq war policy is nearly as anemic among US military families as it is in the general population , according to a new Los Angeles Times / Bloomberg poll .
The survey finds that almost 60 percent of the military community -- which was defined as active and former service personnel as well as their families -- disapprove of the president 's handling of the war .
The same percentage of the group disapprove of Bush 's overall performance as president .
Meanwhile , only 37 percent of the family members approve of Bush .
Among civilians polled , the war garnered support from 32 percent of respondents .
Families that include veterans of wars presided over by the president were found to be just as critical of the war in Iraq as other Americans , with a full 60 percent saying the war was not worth the cost .
" Patience with the war , which has now lasted longer than the U.S. involvement in World War II , is wearing thin -- particularly among families who have sent a service member to the conflict , " reports the Los Angeles Times ' Faye Fiore .
" One-quarter say American troops should stay 'as long as it takes to win . '
Nearly seven in 10 favor a withdrawal within the coming year or ' right away . ' "
The new numbers stand in stark contrast to a poll of military families conducted by the University of Pennsylvania three years ago , in which twice as many individuals approved of the president 's performance .
The poll also finds more support for Democrats than Republicans when it comes to " treatment " of active - duty military personnel , indicating that a " plurality of military - family members , 39 percent , say they believe Democrats are likely to do a better job handling those issues , compared with 35 percent for Republicans , " according to Bloomberg news .
A military sociologist told the Los Angeles Times that flagging support for a president from servicemembers ' families in a time of war was n't typical .
" You generally expect to see support for the president as commander in chief and for the war , but this is a different kind of war than those we 've fought in the past , particularly for families , " he said .
One Army mother responding to the poll , whose son was wounded in Iraq , told the Times that she feared casualties in the conflict were for naught .
" I do n't see gains for the people of Iraq ... and , oh , my God , so many wonderful young people , and these are the ones who felt they were really doing something , that 's why they signed up , " she said .
" I pray to God that they did not die in vain , but I do n't think our president is even sensitive at all to what it 's like to have a child serving over there . "
Complete polling results are available here .
Several readers sent us to the New York Times for disturbing news on Russia 's vanishing press freedoms .
The story tells of how one of the few remaining relatively independent radio outlets in Russia recently acquired new managers , reportedly loyal to Vladimir Putin .
Quoting : " At their first meeting with journalists since taking over Russia 's largest independent radio news network , the managers had startling news of their own : from now on , they said , at least 50 percent of the reports about Russia must be ' positive . '
In addition , opposition leaders could not be mentioned on the air and the United States was to be portrayed as an enemy , journalists employed by the network , Russian News Service , say they were told by the new managers , who are allies of the Kremlin . "

DRM on music may be dying , but network filtering of copyrighted material is alive and well .
In fact , over the next few months , two different filtering initiatives from Big Content could both come to fruition , bringing the magic of Big Brother to colleges and ISPs near you .
It 's still a contested issue , but the situation has developed to the point where it is at least plausible to imagine ubiquitous network filtering in the US .
College filtering
We 've reported before on a Congressional bill that would force US colleges and universities to plan for network filtering and for alternative music and movie download services or face the loss of federal funds .
The College Opportunity and Affordability Act of 2007 passed a House committee back in November and could be coming to a vote in the next couple of months .
According to the EFF , it could even come to a vote in February .
Under the bill , schools would need to " develop a plan for offering alternatives to illegal downloading or peer - to - peer distribution of intellectual property as well as a plan to explore technology - based deterrents to prevent such illegal activity . "
There 's no requirement that schools implement such a plan , but it 's not hard to see how the requirement could become law in a future education bill ( after all , content owners want more than a " plan , " they want action ) .
For schools that do n't want to spend their budget dollars coming up with expensive plans to monitor student traffic , the MPAA stepped in last December like a Christmas angel with an offer of free monitoring software .
Called ( ambiguously ) the " University Toolkit , " the software showed that even Big Content has a special place in its Grinchy heart for open - source software ... but not so special a place that it knows how to comply with the terms of open - source license agreements .
The software was pulled after an Ubuntu technical board member pointed out that the MPAA was violating the GPL by not making code available .
Seth Oster , executive VP and chief communications officer of the MPAA , told Ars at the time that the MPAA was quick to respond because " we take copyright very seriously at the MPAA . "
The software remains unavailable today .
While the situation was humorous , all it mean is that if the bill passes , universities will need to spend more time and effort evaluating other ( paid ) solutions in order to comply with the law .
Coming to an ISP near you
Making inroads at colleges and universities would be a big step for groups like the MPAA , but filtering on a truly national level would be far preferable .
The MPAA has made no secret of its desire that ISPs take part , and rather amazingly , one of the nation 's largest ISPs is interested .
In fact , AT&T seems downright enthusiastic about the prospect of sniffing for copyright violations .
While AT&T has yet to reveal how such a filtering regime would function , it has repeatedly confirmed that it is going forward with the technology .
Confirmation of those plans at CES made news , and it thrilled people like NBC's Rick Cotton , a lawyer who has led NBC 's push for such filtering .
As a sign of just how mainstream the entire debate has become , Cotton and Columbia law professor Tim Wu are squaring off this week in a New York Times blog .
In his first post , Cotton argued that technology can actually do a superb job of filtering .
Those problems you 've heard so much about ?
Solved .
" Digital technology is also capable of great exactitude and flexibility in identifying copyrighted content and targeting infringements with no more intrusiveness than when it screens out viruses and hacker attacks , " he wrote .
We may find out if he 's right later this year .
AT&T has been talking up its plans for some time and sounds ready to pull the trigger soon , though the FCC 's new interest in traffic - shaping and monitoring at Comcast might make AT&T proceed with caution .
Filters , filters everywhere
Colleges and consumers are both likely to kick back hard against these sorts of measures , and that could be enough to knock both of them off track .
But it wo n't necessarily do so ; both filtering proposals have years of effort behind them , some Congressional support , and the buy - in of major corporations like AT&T .
2008 could be the year that both kinds of filtering become regular features of the Internet landscape in the US .
If a couple of national ISPs and even a minority of universities start filtering this year or the next , the filters could probably examine much of the peer - to - peer traffic passing through the country .
If effective , such filters could do much to slow the spread of copyrighted material ( for a time ) , but based on the filtering technology we 've seen in the past , we remain skeptical .
Mistakes are bound to occur ; as more companies use the Internet and P2P to distribute legitimate content , even a few of these mistakes could lead to charges of anticompetitive behavior and requests for FCC investigations .
The blocking of even a few homemade videos sent to friends could run afoul of FCC guidance that suggests all consumers have a right to use their Internet connections for lawful purposes and to run their choice of applications over the network .
The pro-filtering lobby is playing a dangerous game by pushing its way into the ISP space .
While sites like YouTube have launched filtering technology of their own , privately - owned sites are generally allowed to run their own operations .
Network operators face far more government scrutiny .
2008 might well be the Year of the Filter , but who knows ?
It might also be the Year of Filtergate .
A single major fiasco could even revive the simmering debate over network neutrality regulation and legislation .
Stay tuned ; it should be quite a spectacle .
Update : A House staffer from the Committee on Education and Labor contacted us to point out that the bill will not jeopardize federal funds for those schools that do n't plan for using filtering and for P2P alternatives .
The bill says that " each eligible institution participating in any program under this title shall to the extent practicable " do the planning .
We 're told that despite this requirement , the bill does n't back it up with any penalties .
" Neither of these two provisions is tied to a school 's participation in the federal student aid programs in any way , " we 're told .
" In other words , no school and no student will ever lose funding if a school does n't make plans to address IP theft , or purchase any programs to do it .
And no school will ever lose any federal aid because its students engage in illegal downloading or file - sharing , period . "
But schools will face problems with the Department of Education unless they " inform their students about their campus policies on copyright infringement and illegal downloading " and " report their campus policies and procedures for addressing these violations once a year . "
So , bottom line : the bill still directs colleges and universities to make plans for playing the filter game , but does n't penalize them if they do n't .
There is a rule for judging solutions to the twin problems of energy dependence and global warming : A policy designed to solve one problem should not make the other worse .
But that is a likely outcome of the many “ energy independence ” bills circulating in Congress that aim to build a whole new generation of coal - to - liquid plants to convert coal into automotive fuel .
These bills have already acquired an enthusiastic constituency and will be offered as amendments to what is now a relatively simple and sound energy bill designed to increase the fuel efficiency of cars and light trucks , encourage the production of biofuels and provide research and development money for the capture and storage of carbon dioxide emissions from power plants .
There are , of course , ways to make this bill better .
Senator Jeff Bingaman will offer a useful amendment to require utilities to generate a percentage of their electricity from renewable sources like wind .
But there are also ways to make the bill a lot worse .
One of them is to require the expenditure of billions of dollars in loans , tax incentives and price guarantees to lock in a technology that could end up doing more harm than good .
Coal is far and away America ’s most abundant fuel .
It provides more than half the country ’s electricity .
And there is no doubt that it could substitute for foreign oil , although how much and at what price is not clear .
In addition , the technology to convert coal into liquid fuels is well established .
But it is also true that between the production process and burning it in cars , coal - to - liquid fuel produces more than twice the greenhouse gas emissions as gasoline and nearly twice the emissions of ordinary diesel .
These are terrible ratios .

The Flight
It seems that Richard Branson and Virgin Galactic are going to have some serious direct competition in the near future .
The European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company , or EADS for short , has recently announced its plans to enter the suborbital space tourism race [ see announcement ] .
The project leader , Marc Newsome , has said that they would like to begin the project in 2008 and if they are able to do so then a first commercial flight would possibly be available by 2012 .
Marc
Newsome will be in charge of designing the interior cabin which is said to have " . "
The Australian born designer has been named by Time Magazine as one of the 100 most influential people in the world .
As Creative Director of Qantas Airways , he has also been responsible for the design of their entire fleet including the Airbus A380 and I can say from personal experience that Qantas has , by far , been the best airline with which I have traveled .
The flight will consist of two stages on a space jet comparable to a business jet sized vehicle and will carry four passengers .
The space jet will take off from a conventional airport and normal jet engines will carry the craft to an altitude of 12 km when the rocket engines will be ignited .
In a mere 80 seconds the rockets will have propelled the space jet all the way up to an altitude of 60 km .
The ship will receive enough boost from the rockets to lift it to its peak altitude of 100 km where it will hover weightlessly for 3 minutes and give tourists an incredible view of the Earth .
Passengers will get plenty of opportunity to catch a view with the 15 windows , each 30 % bigger than a standard jet window .
The jet will then make its descent slowly until the jet engines can safely be initiated .
The jet will then land at a standard airfield .
In total , the entire trip will last between an hour and an hour and a half .
Below is the promotional video of a flight from EADS Astrium :
So the industry is accepting that circulation will fall and hoping to find a level that can be sustained with little effort .
As a result , the subscription churn rate — the number of people who drop their newspaper each year divided by the total number of subscribers — fell to 36 percent last year from 54 percent in 2000 , the newspaper association says .
There are exceptions to the trend ; New York City ’s tabloids , The Daily News and The New York Post , continue to scrap for as many readers as they can , even if many of them drift away .
And some executives and analysts think newspapers have gone too far in cutting investments meant to cultivate new readers , like advertising on radio or distributing papers in schools .
“ Newspapers have not spent a lot of money on that kind of self - promotion , and I think that has hindered our long - term growth , ” said John Kimball , chief marketing officer at the Newspaper Association of America .
A prime example of the new approach is at The Los Angeles Times , which has lost more circulation in this decade than any other paper , falling to about 800,000 on weekdays in its most recent reports to the Audit Bureau of Circulations , from almost 1.1 million in 2000 .
“ There is a school of thought these days that you stop actively selling altogether and let the readership seek its natural level , ” said Jack Klunder , senior vice president for circulation at The Los Angeles Times .
“ We ’re not at that point , but we ’re running far fewer promotions , accepting that some number of people are never going to buy the paper , long run , at full price . ”
Like many other papers , The Times has also cut back sharply on advertising itself .
“ When the profitability stream of the paper is interrupted , you start to look at places to save on the expense side , ” including advertising , Mr. Klunder said .
“ You need to advertise in the long run , but we make a lot of short - term decisions in this business . ”
The New York Times ’s circulation has held relatively steady in this decade , but that masks two opposing trends .
In its home market , circulation is down , as The Times , like others , has cut back on promotions and discounting .
But sales are up in other markets where The Times continues to pursue new , mostly affluent readers .
“ There are so many important areas where this country could lead , ” Mr. Weis said .
“ If we learned one thing with the NSFnet experience , I think it was that the government has the ability to help advance science and technology in this country by holding out a carrot , and using the stick as a pointer . ”
The lesson learned , he said , is that it is crucial for government and industry to share financial risks .
That would make it possible to move forward in areas as diverse as materials technology , biology and energy efficiency .
The specific form would be to create new “ grand challenges ” in technology , Mr. Weis said .
Though it ’s almost impossible now to imagine living in a world without the Web , the transition from the academic and scientific NSFnet to the commercial Internet did not come without conflict .
There were bitter arguments among the participants over whether commercialization should take place at all .
And when the National Science Foundation contracted with a partnership of I.B.M. , the MCI Corporation and the Merit Network  a group of Michigan universities and a state agency  to manage the network ’s backbone , the resulting Non-Profit Advanced Network Services created bitter resentment among early commercial Internet service providers .
“ The idea of network as a service was a new thing , and it was difficult to convince everybody a ) that it was a good idea and b ) that it was legal , ” said Steve Wolff , director of network research at the National Science Foundation from 1986 to 1995 .
According to a wide range of conference participants , NSFnet ultimately succeeded because of both the hacker culture of engineers that built the system and the very nature of the network they were creating ; it fostered intellectual collaboration in a way not previously possible .
“ The model of a network where no one is in charge is a model that can scale , ” said Douglas E. Van Houweling , the chairman of the Merit Network when the NSFnet backbone was constructed .
Giving the network time to develop was vital , he added , because the Internet “ was an alien concept to the communication industry when it began growing . ”

Dr Williams says Muslims should have a choice in legal disputes
Dr Williams interview
Dr Rowan Williams told Radio 4's World at One that the UK has to " face up to the fact " that some of its citizens do not relate to the British legal system .
Dr Williams argues that adopting parts of Islamic Sharia law would help maintain social cohesion .
For example , Muslims could choose to have marital disputes or financial matters dealt with in a Sharia court .
He says Muslims should not have to choose between " the stark alternatives of cultural loyalty or state loyalty " .
' Sensational reporting '
In an exclusive interview with BBC correspondent Christopher Landau , ahead of a lecture to lawyers in London on Monday , Dr Williams argues this relies on Sharia law being better understood .
At the moment , he says " sensational reporting of opinion polls " clouds the issue .
An approach to law which simply said - there 's one law for everybody - I think that 's a bit of a danger
Dr Rowan Williams
Archbishop of Canterbury
Religious courts in the UK
He stresses that " nobody in their right mind would want to see in this country the kind of inhumanity that 's sometimes been associated with the practice of the law in some Islamic states ; the extreme punishments , the attitudes to women as well " .
But Dr Williams said an approach to law which simply said " there 's one law for everybody and that 's all there is to be said , and anything else that commands your loyalty or allegiance is completely irrelevant in the processes of the courts - I think that 's a bit of a danger " .
" There 's a place for finding what would be a constructive accommodation with some aspects of Muslim law , as we already do with some other aspects of religious law . "
' Other loyalties '
Dr Williams added : " What we do n't want either , is I think , a stand - off , where the law squares up to people 's religious consciences . "
HAVE YOUR SAY
There is , and should only be , one law which covers all people and to suggest it can be otherwise is to seriously damage our rights Patricia London , UK
" We do n't either want a situation where , because there 's no way of legally monitoring what communities do ... people do what they like in private in such a way that that becomes another way of intensifying oppression inside a community . "
The issue of whether Catholic adoption agencies would be forced to accept gay parents under equality laws showed the potential for legal confusion , he said .
" That principle that there is only one law for everybody is an important pillar of our social identity as a western democracy , " he said .
" But I think it is a misunderstanding to suppose that means people do n't have other affiliations , other loyalties which shape and dictate how they behave in society and that the law needs to take some account of that . "
' Custom and community '
Dr Williams noted that Orthodox Jewish courts already operated , and that the law accommodated the anti-abortion views of some Christians .
" The whole idea that there are perfectly proper ways the law of the land pays respect to custom and community , that 's already there , " he said .
People may legally devise their own way to settle a dispute in front of an agreed third party as long as both sides agree to the process .
Muslim Sharia courts and the Jewish Beth Din which already exist in the UK come into this category .
The country 's main Beth Din at Finchley in north London oversees a wide range of cases including divorce settlements , contractual rows between traders and tenancy disputes .
Dr Williams 's comments are likely to fuel the debate over multiculturalism in the UK .
Last month , the Bishop of Rochester , the Right Reverend Dr Michael Nazir - Ali , said some places in the UK were no - go areas for non-Muslims .
Dr Williams said it was " not at all the case that we have absolute social exclusion " .
LONDON , Nov 28 ( Reuters ) - British music industry major EMI wants to cut its funding to the industry ’s trade bodies , a source familiar with the situation told Reuters on Wednesday , which could deal a blow to the fight against music piracy .
The source said EMI , which was recently taken over by private equity group Terra Firma , was looking at ways to “ substantially ” reduce the amount it pays trade groups .
The groups , the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry ( IFPI ) , the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) and other national associations , represent music companies and the fight against illegal piracy .
They receive funding from the four major music groups -- EMI , Warner WMG.N , Sony BMG and Universal -- and hundreds of small independent labels .
The IFPI said it believed the four majors give approximately 64 million pounds ( $ 132.1 million ) each year to itself , the RIAA and many other national associations .
The other majors were not available for comment , but a separate industry source said at least one of the major music companies is known to strongly support the associations and their work .
EMI is undergoing a strategic review after being bought by Terra Firma for 2.4 billion pounds ( $ 4.95 billion ) .
Like all music groups , it has been hit hard by online piracy and falling CD sales , despite the efforts of the trade groups to combat the problem .
The IFPI said on Wednesday it was engaged in annual budget decisions and “ as one would expect in this market , there is a focus on efficiencies and savings ” .
It declined to give any further details but added that it was also engaged in a very full agenda to promote the rights of its member record companies .
EMI , Terra Firma , the BPI and RIAA were all unavailable to comment .
Illegal file - sharing is estimated to cost the music industry billions of dollars a year in revenues .
In response , the trade bodies have launched legal action and called upon Internet service providers to block the activity .
Analysts at UBS said any move to reduce the funding to trade bodies could hamper the industry ’s efforts to fight piracy and protect music copyright .

The woes in the U.S. financial sector are “ poetic justice ” for bankers who designed and sold complex investments that have since gone sour , billionaire investor Warren Buffett said on Wednesday .

The head of the Berkshire Hathaway Inc BRKa.

N group of companies also played down worries about a credit crunch by saying that recent interest rate cuts mean low - cost funds are readily available .
But he warned that the U.S. dollar will continue to slide unless the country can rein in its yawning trade deficit -- the “ biggest factor ” behind the decline .
Still , he said , the U.S. economy will “ do very well over time . ”
Buffett , one of the world ’s wealthiest people , appeared to see irony in the fact that many of the banks who marketed complex investments which have now crashed are bearing much of the fallout .
“ It ’s sort of a little poetic justice , in that the people that brewed this toxic Kool - Aid found themselves drinking a lot of it in the end , ” he said .
Buffett , a legendary investor who has amassed a huge fortune through plays in a wide range of industries , has bet against the U.S. dollar in the past .
In 2005 , Berkshire had made a $ 21.8 billion bet that the U.S. dollar would fall .
It later unwound that successful position as it found other non-U.S. investments .
Buffett said on Wednesday in Toronto that the turmoil that has rocked the U.S. economy in recent months has imbued the markets with a healthy degree of caution , while the rate - cutting response from central bankers has ensured that cheap money remains available for borrowing .
“ I would n’t quite call it a credit crunch .
Funds are available , ” Buffett said during a question and answer session at a business event .
“ Money is available , and it ’s really quite cheap because of the lowering of rates that has taken place . ”
He added : “ What has happened is a repricing of risk and an unavailability of what I might call ‘ dumb money , ’ of which there was plenty around a year ago . ”
Buffet was in Toronto for the Canadian launch of corporate - news firm Business Wire , which Berkshire bought in 2006 .
Buffett tends to favor companies with relatively simple businesses , strong management , consistent earnings , good returns on equity , and little debt .
As of late last year , Berkshire ’s businesses employed about 220,000 people and the number is growing as the group continues to expand its portfolio of companies .
The units generated a $ 10.27 billion profit on revenue of $ 90.2 billion from January to September .

But the use of Kurdish is not simply a matter of linguistic comprehension .
Sometimes it is a form of diplomacy .
One of the most aggressive legal investigations against Baydemir concerned a series of public statements he made in Kurdish in March 2006 .
In a battle that month between P.K.K. militants and Turkish soldiers , 14 Kurds had been killed .
Diyarbakir exploded in mass demonstrations that ultimately became violent .
Baydemir begged the crowd  in Turkish  to settle down , to refuse further violence , to go home and rest .
The crowd chanted P.K.K. slogans , like “ Teeth to teeth , blood to blood , we are with you Ocalan , ” referring to Abdullah Ocalan , the head of the P.K.K. whom Baydemir , as a lawyer , had defended after his capture in 1999 .
Desperate to subdue the crowd , Baydemir switched to Kurdish .
“ You claimed your identity , ” he told them .
“ With burnt hearts , you claimed your people and your pain .
We are also with you .
Be sure of this .
But for the sake of peace , for the sake of your success , we have to listen to each other under the leadership of the party ”  the Democratic Society Party , or D.T.P. , Turkey ’s only legal “ pro-Kurdish ” party .
“ We fear , ” he went on , “ that this mobilization from now on will harm our nation and our people .
From now on , we all will go back to our homes quietly . ”
Sixteen people were killed in the rioting that subsequently spread across the southeast and into Istanbul .
The mandate  the ordeal  of a mayor in a Kurdish town was clear : a kind of internal mediation of the highest order , the challenge of connecting to the hearts of the Kurdish population while governing according to the laws of the state .
Nearly all of the prominent Kurdish politicians accused of language violations are members of the D.T.P .
But the latest front in the party ’s legal battles is not crimes against the alphabet but the status of the D.T.P. itself .
On Nov. 16 , Abdurrahman Yalcinkaya , chief prosecutor of the Supreme Court of Appeals , applied to the Constitutional Court to ban the D.T.P. , arguing that it is merely a suit - and - tie - clad front for the P.K.K .
“ The party in question has become a base for activities which aim at the independence of the state and its indivisible unity , ” the prosecutor wrote in his statement .
This move to ban the pro-Kurdish party , likely to last several months in court , is in some ways less surprising than the fact that the D.T.P. made it to Parliament at all .
In the past several years , at least four Kurdish parties have been banned or forced to dissolve in Turkey , always under the accusation of supporting the P.K.K. and threatening Turkey ’s unity .
But the D.T.P. has been different .
In last July ’s elections , it became the first Kurdish party to have a strong presence in Parliament in more than a decade .
It did so by running its candidates as independents in order to get around a 10 - percent minimum ( of the total vote ) that a party would need to achieve in order to actually win seats .
Supporters saw its victory as a chance to address Kurdish issues in Turkey through democratic means .
D.T.P. members took great pains to assert their desire to work within the law , to give voice to the economic , social and cultural concerns of their constituents and to bridge the deep chasms between their group and Turkey ’s old guard , which is represented by the Republican People ’s Party and the Nationalist Action Party .
But from the new Parliament ’s opening session in August , the D.T.P. ’s presence set in motion a circus of hostile and even juvenile behavior .
At the helm of Parliament , the neo-Islamist Justice and Development Party has been the most neutral .
But throughout the late summer and fall , Turkish society was captivated by play - by - play scrutiny of who would shake whose hand and who would be invited to whose parties .
Some representatives of nationalist and secularist camps took to calling their D.T.P. colleagues “ separatists . ”
Since D.T.P. members first entered Parliament , they have been urged by everybody from the prime minister to the European Union to the United States to condemn the P.K.K.
Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and the leaders of other parties have stated repeatedly that until the D.T.P. does so , it will not be trusted .
D.T.P. leaders have attempted to distance themselves from the P.K.K. without directly condemning the group : in public statements , they constantly reiterate that they are against separatism , do not want to divide the Turkish state and oppose all violence .
In the autumn , D.T.P. leaders began calling fallen Turkish soldiers “ martyrs , ” as the military and the rest of Turkey ’s establishment have always done .
But that was n’t nearly enough after an early - October attack killed 13  the worst strike by the P.K.K. in years .
Turkish television channels broadcast continuous gut - wrenching footage of soldiers ’ mothers collapsing over coffins and uniformed officers comforting them .
An intense climate of national mourning set in , along with a focus on national security that Kurdish activists feared would obliterate any hope for cultural reforms .
Aysel Tugluk , a young female leader of the D.T.P. and a one - time member of Ocalan ’s defense team , sounded exhausted when she spoke at a conference in Istanbul later that month .
She started her talk with a long string of condolences for all those who died , then went on to say : “ If you force the D.T.P. to condemn the P.K.K. , you deny us the possibility to take initiative in a way that could turn out to be effective . ”
But she added that if Kurdish cultural demands were met , the D.T.P. would be able to condemn “ any force that deploys violence ” and that the most important step right now would be for Kurds to be allowed to express themselves in their native language .
“ After 30 years , we still have violence , ” Tugluk said , “ so I think we should stop and ask , What was our mistake ?
The P.K.K. has to be taken into account from a sociological point of view ; it is the result of the nonsolution to the Kurdish issue : we have to focus on the origins of that issue . ”
Ayhan Aktar , a sociologist at Istanbul ’s Bilgi University , described the situation to me more bluntly : “ If the D.T.P. condemns the P.K.K. , they wo n’t ever be able to go to Diyarbakir again ; they will get beaten up on the street by some hotheads when they set foot in town . ”
If you thought that nothing could burn while sandwiched between two bricks of dry ice — think again .
Magnesium can combust in an atmosphere of pure carbon dioxide .
As this spectacular video points out , people who work with the fascinating metal must choose their fire extinguishers carefully .
Moyers : Political pork and the military - industrial complex Nick Langewis and Mike Aivaz

Print This Email This PBS ' Bill Moyers Journal profiles Seattle Times investigative reporters David Heath and Hal Bernton in their investigation of congressional earmarks , and their recipients , in the Pacific Northwest .
So far this year , members of Congress have appropriated 12,881 earmarks for " pet projects , " some to be conducted by campaign contributors , which would cost taxpayers over $ 18 billion .
David Heath , for the Seattle Times ' ' Favor Factory ' feature , had to build his own database , now available online , in order to research the recipients of earmarks in the 2007 defense budget .
The appropriations bill itself did not list the earmarks , requiring Heath to enlist the help of veteran Washington staffer Winslow Wheeler .
" If you look at a Department of Defense appropriations bill , " says Wheeler , " you 'll not find very much pork in it .
What you need to do is look at the committee report ; 99 % of the pork is in the committee report , not in the statute . "
The committee report for the 2007 appropriations bill contained the data Heath was looking for , but in a barely decipherable code , and in small print .
Heath identified 2,700 earmarks , worth around $ 12 billion , by hunting down the representatives ' press releases and matching them with the data on the report .
Heath and military affairs specialist Hal Bernton found a disturbing trend in awards that representatives in the Pacific Northwest were handing out :
Money was going towards manufacturing products that would never be used , or that nobody asked for to begin with .
One such product was Microvision Corporation 's " Nomad , " a helmet with a mounted computer display , meant to flash maps and relevant data to a soldier in combat .
In 2001 , Senator Slade Gorton ( R - WA ) , who would later join Microvision 's board , earmarked $ 8 million for the development of the " Nomad . "
Democratic Senator Patty Murray , his successor , would appropriate a total of $ 11.5 million more to buy the helmets .
" Junk , " one Army commander called the helmets , which have never seen combat ; a contractor called Rockwell Collins was awarded the contract instead , but Senator Murray awarded Microvision $ 6 million for the purchase of their product anyway .
" People tend to talk about earmarks as something that is a bad thing , " Sen . Murray told Heath .
" I see it as a way to make sure that the tax dollars that are spent are spent in a very wise way and help our state economically . "
When confronted with the events surrounding Microvision , the Senator added , " None of us bat a thousand , and obviously this one did n't , or potentially has n't , and -- you know -- we'll just keep trying to get as close to a thousand as we can .
That 's what my job is . "
" This is not about an aberration , " says Heath .
" This is about a culture .
This is about a system that 's doing this -- it 's not just a bad congressman . "
The entire feature , " Mr. Heath Goes to Washington , " is available to view below .
It was broadcast on PBS ' Bill Moyers Journal on February 22 , 2008 .
More information on the work of David Heath and Hal Bernton is available at the Seattle Times .
It was a big underground submarine base and docks once in USSR .
After the Soviet Union collapsed and Russian army left Ukraine it was partly abandoned and some of its parts was converted into a museum later .

Why is it so hard to say ' well done ' ?
Matthew Kirdahy , Forbes.com | September 18 , 2007
B usinesses small and large have always had difficulty retaining talent .
Employees enter and exit companies on the same basic premise , maximizing the latest opportunity with the best pay .
Supervisors , managers and anyone else in charge of hiring , in their complacency , accept this turnover as the norm even when it could be a clear indicator that maybe people are n't satisfied and would have stayed with the company for something as simple as the occasional pat on the back .
According to some studies and one author , that 's worth its weight in gold .
In his new book , Focus on the Good Stuff : The Power of Appreciation ( Jossey - Bass , $ 19.95 ) , author and leadership motivational speaker Mike Robbins talks about the value and importance of acknowledging a job well done .
He cites key research from the U.S. Department of Labor and The Gallup Organization , the global research firm , to support a very simple yet important claim .
According to the DOL , 64 % of working Americans leave their jobs because they do n't feel appreciated , while Gallup research shows that 70 % of working Americans say they receive no praise or recognition on the job .
" We understand this and we should know how to do it , like you said , as grown adults , " Robbins said .
" But we never had any training .
I never took a class in school on how to appreciate people or how to be grateful , how to look at the ' good stuff . '
But to me it 's one of the most fundamental things we could do to be successful . "
Google knows what 's up .
Yahoo !
already has the gist of the message too .
Those are a couple of Robbins ' favorites when it comes to employee appreciation .
However , they could still benefit from some motivational words too .
Forbes.com :
What led you from professional baseball to a dot - com to motivational speaking ?
Mike Robbins : I blew out my pitching arm when I was 23 playing in the minor leagues for Kansas City ( Robbins was drafted by the Royals in 1995 ) .
I get hurt .
Career 's over .
The dot - com thing was just sort of happenstance .
I moved back to the San Francisco area where I grew up and it was the late '90s and the dot - com boom was going on .
I did that for a couple years .
Laid off in 2000 .
I 'm glad I had those couple years of business experience because it helps me do what I do now .
I had a little money saved and with all of my experience in sports and a couple years in business , this whole notion of teamwork of appreciation of really creating positive environments seemed to be what success was really about .
And I thought I had a few things I could share even though I was pretty young at the time .
How do you go from talking to Chevron to executives at AT&T to a group that you 're talking to right now to students ?
How do you meet all of them on common ground ?
If I 'm talking to an AT&T or a Chevron or a Wells Fargo , it 's going to vary even within that organization depending on the group I 'm talking to .
But what I find is that people are people and appreciation is one of those things that fundamentally connects people to one another .
So when people appreciate one another , they create better relationships in whatever kind of business they 're doing .
In most businesses , people are in the people business and then on a personal level so many of us are so hard on ourselves and critical of ourselves .
I think that when we can appreciate ourselves we ultimately produce better results .
At the same time I know that a lot of the stuff is common , human stuff .
What company already has a handle on the things you preach ?
Wells Fargo [ employers ] do an incredible job .
They bring me in a lot .
Over the last four - five years I 've probably done over 100 programs there .
They 've had me speak at big events .
They 've had me come in and do small seminars .
They 've had me train people .
They do a fantastic job .
Their people feel really appreciated .
Another one that 's easy to use as an example , although its not my client , although I did have a meeting down there , is Google .
I had a meeting at Google and the moment I walked on the campus I immediately thought there was a party going on or something .
I called the guy who I was meeting with and asked him whether there was some event .
He said this is how it is here .
It felt like a cross between Stanford and Disneyland .
Google requires its employees to take 20 % of their work day to do something else other than their job .
The place is open 24 - 7 .
The company feeds its people incredible food .
The campus is beautiful .
There 's all these things that make people feel appreciated .
Now you could say it 's making all this money and it's at the top of the heap , so to speak , but I do n't think it 's an accident .
One of the pieces of feedback I got was Google is doing so well and its people are so happy that it might not necessarily need my services .
But what I said in response was , look , a lot of companies I go to , I talk to them about the cynicism and the negativity and how to overcome that .
In your case , people seem pretty happy and you 're successful , so we would discuss how to take that to the next level .
Whose job is it exactly to express this appreciation ?
Does it always have to be the boss ?
Are n't the executives too high up to have anyone remark on their performance ?
One of the challenges for the C - level execs is they do n't get a lot of appreciation themselves .
So very few people walk into their offices in any genuine way and let them know what they 're doing well .
The perception is that whenever that happens , people are kissing up or it 's some kind of phony thing .
They 're under so much pressure to produce the results for the organization .
I think the higher up you go , the harder it becomes for people to stop and genuinely appreciate what 's happening because there is so much pressure .
That being said , I think there are some organizations that do a lot better than others , but by and large , it 's lacking in most organizations .
And the companies that I work with that have the best results and the best ultimate morale or environment are always the ones where not only the C - level executives , but all the way down people feel a genuine sense of appreciation .
The other thing that I really teach is that recognition has to come from above .
But appreciation can come from anyone to anyone .
So I really try to empower people whether I 'm talking to the senior level executives all the way down the organization .
Appreciation I talk about as almost a culture thing , whereas recognition is almost a top - down kind to reward results and I think both are important .
What 's a greater form of appreciation in the business world ?
Would you say verbal or monetary or through promotion ?
I think it 's both , to be honest with you .
The reality with a check or a promotion is that could only happen once or twice a year if you 're doing phenomenally well .
I tell people in the audience , think about a time you felt appreciated , recognized or acknowledged in your career .
Then I have them turn to the person next to them and have them share that experience and then I have a few volunteers raise their hands and ( share ) .
And every now and then it's a big promotion or some big thing , but even when it's that it 's usually something really simple .
It 's something very personal .
Very specific .
Very mundane in some ways .
Going back to that point about why people leave their jobs because they do n't feel appreciated .
Remember , it 's not money .
It 's about they do n't feel valued .
At the end of the day , of course who would n't want more money or a nicer title but I think that there 's been a lot of cases where people stayed places where this person -- specifically their boss -- really valued them and felt like what they could say and what they did had an impact on the organization .
You might expect that adults would already know how to treat each other .
Why are n't we getting it already and what business does Mike Robbins have going around telling us how to appreciate our colleagues ?
Well , I actually think we 're getting it more .
I started speaking about this full time seven years ago .
And when I did I had people say , What is that -- who cares .
And now , I do n't get that anymore .
People go , Yeah this is really important .
I wrote this book specifically to be very practical and tangible so people could take this stuff and use it in their lives , use it in their businesses because even though we know it ... like the final chapter in my book is ,
It 's not what we know it 's what we do that matters .
We 've got to start putting little things , simple things , into practice every day so they become habits .
A Wake Up Call for the Logic Programming Community

In the 6 six years that I have been doing research in the Logic Programming community , I have met a lot of nice people and heard about a lot of interesting research ideas .
However , the community itself is n't exactly thriving and LP has a serious PR problem .
It 's my fear that if we happily continue along our current path , then there will be little left of LP and its flagship Prolog in a couple of years .
There are plenty of stories about the fabled heydays of Logic Programming with 300 + ICLP attendants , well before my time .
However , nowadays , what are LP 's claims to fame ?
How can we motivate people to join the field , while there are so many more exciting ( better marketed ) research fields ?
What career opportunities can we promise people who learn Prolog ?
What industrial applications can we mention ?
There must be some out there , but for some reason it is oh so difficult to list more than the one or two you always hear about .
The purpose of this article is to tell you about how the Functional Programming community , and in particular the Haskell community , has dealt quite successfully with very much the same issue .
My recent attendance of ICFP , the FP counterpart of ICLP , has been a real eye - opener in this respect .
There are plenty of tell - tale signs of a successful PR machinery running at full throttle :
There is an incredible boost in the number of ICFP participants : 240 participants this year , which is about twice the number at ICLP .
There are about a 100 more than last year .
The co-located Haskell workshop ( one day , 10 papers ) had about 120 participants .
That 's about the same number as the ICLP main conference !
I 'm sure it 's 3 x or 4 x more popular than any ICLP single day workshop .
The second most popular co-located workshop is the Commercial Users of Functional Programming ( CUFP ) workshop with 109 participants !
Most of the speakers are indeed commercial users and not affiliated to a university .
More than a few non-academics participate attend ICFP and its workshops .
Commercial users and hobbyists feel that ICFP has something in store for them .
What 's the secret of their success ?
These aspects must be having some effect :
Functional Programmers are confronted head - on with the commercial applications of their work , and they cannot avoid being motivated .
I already mentioned the CUFP workshop .
ICFP too puts a big effort in a special track of 6 experience reports .
These are meant to build up a written body of evidence at the disposal of the champions of FP .
Do not except any new research ideas or new insights in the use of FP .
That 's not what they are meant for .
The purpose is really to reinforce the community !
Functional Programmers know where to find a job when they finish their Ph.D. Companies are actively recruiting at ICFP .
Get a free dinner when you sign up for an interview !
A considerable part of the program consists of new ideas to make programming easier , libraries , tools and programming idioms .
These are exactly what real programmers and companies need , in order to be convinced to adopt FP .
If the research community values talks about these topics too , then you get more research effort spent on them .
More real world programming tools , means more real world programmers .
More real world programmers means more researchers !
Of course , there is more to a community than just conferences and workshops , certainly if there is more to that community than just academics .
Haskell is the undisputed flagship of the FP community .
This language was designed by a committee and is especially welcoming to outsiders :
There is a tremendous amount of activity on the Haskell mailing lists ( Haskell and Haskell - Cafe ) : on October 10 I counted 83 messages versus the 7 messages on Prolog 's main discussion forum comp.lang.prolog .
The haskell.org portal website bundles almost everything there is to know about the language : papers , systems , tools , companies , tutorials and wikis with explanations about language features and idioms , ...
There is a central repository ( hackage ) for all kinds of libraries and projects .
Missed a symposium or FP user group meetings to know what 's going on ?
Simply catch up on Google Video !
For example , all the Haskell 2007 workshop talks are on - line .
In comparison , if found only two videos on Prolog which were n't even by LP people .
Everyone can step right in to contribute ; in fact , the community insists that you join the fray .
There is no central authority , no equivalent of the ALP , to tell people what to do or what not .
You do n't need permission to update the website or to add another project to hackage .
It works : the open source community around Haskell is growing and making Haskell into a viable alternative for mainstream languages .
These days libraries are a major factor for adopting a language , and Haskell is getting them through its growing open source community , its Google Summer of Code projects and its hacking marathon co-located with ICFP , not to mention the researchers who can actually publish their work on libraries for real - world problems .
The snowball was tiny when it was first thrown , but it 's become a real avalanche now !
And the Haskell community sure is fanning the flames .
Clearly this community is doing some things right by investing considerable efforts in community building .
I think the LP community should start learning from this if it does n't want to get extinct .
There is little point in putting your hopes on parallel programming for making LP popular again , if the community does not start to value and advertise itself first .
All the things I mentioned above , LP can do too :
real - world application papers at ICLP and all these other signs that LP matters out there , talks on Google Video , more papers on programming tools and libraries at conferences , a centralized wiki website and project repository with all kinds of resources where we can find out about LP people , projects , software , companies , ... , a mailing list that pushes messages rather than a newsgroup from which you actively have to pull messages , the ALP and other sponsors should financially back community efforts .
All this should happen with the communities encouragement .
Do n't put up high barriers and high standards for people to contribute .
Let them contribute first , and , if you do n't like what 's there , then improve it !
It takes only a little effort from everyone to make a big difference .
There is one big hurdle that the LP community has .
The Prolog implementations are hopelessly fragmented , and we cannot expect any hope from the ISO Prolog committee .
We are in great need of an up - to - date language standard .
It 's been proven to be impossible to get everyone to agree .
So let 's not do that ; let's
lower our standards .
Would n't it already be great if we could have JUST TWO systems that we could rely on to behave in the same way .
Here 's my challenge for you Prolog systems out there :
find a partner system ,
agree on a common module system ,
agree on a common set of built-ins , and
agree on a common set of base libraries ,
present us your system at ICLP 2008 .
Here 's my challenge to the community to back the first two systems that manage
to seriously cooperate :
we conduct any generic Prolog research on these systems and say so in our papers ,
we contribute all the library code we happen to write ,
we teach our students to use these systems ,
we get our master students to write libraries and tools for these systems , and
the ALP endorses these systems as the new Prolog standard .
Please let me and everybody else know what you think : tell us on comp.lang .

FASTER chips are the fuel of the computer industry .
So the announcement on November 16th that Mubadala Development , an investment arm of oil - rich Abu Dhabi , would pay about $ 622 m for 8.1 % of Advanced Micro Devices ( AMD ) , a leading maker of microprocessors , seems somehow fitting .
The deal is an unexpected twist in the race between AMD and Intel , the world 's largest chipmaker , in which Intel is again making the running .
For a while it seemed that AMD had pulled ahead of Intel in chip design .
It devised a clever way to enable chips to handle data in both 32 - bit and 64 - bit chunks , which Intel reluctantly adopted in 2004 .
And in 2005 AMD launched a new processor that split the number - crunching between two “ cores ” , the brains of a chip , thus boosting performance and reducing energy - consumption .
But Intel came back strongly with its own dual - core designs .
This month Intel began shipping its new family of “ Penryn ” processors , some of which have four cores .
AMD offers similar chips under the “ Barcelona ” brand , and revealed its latest versions on November 19th .
But Intel now has the technological edge .
Next year it will launch new chips with eight cores on a single slice of silicon , at least a year ahead of AMD .
As the smaller of the two firms , AMD faces three handicaps .
First , it has only two chip fabrication plants , or “ fabs ” , compared with Intel 's 15 , which still supply three - quarters of all processors for PCs ( see chart ) .
This makes AMD more vulnerable to manufacturing problems : its newest chips are not as fast as promised and have been hit by production delays .
It also means that Intel can usually introduce new manufacturing processes faster .
With Penryn , Intel has started using hafnium , an obscure metal , to insulate the transistors in its chips .
This has made it possible to shrink the tiny switches even further without leaking too much current .
AMD will not reach the same level of miniaturisation until mid-2008 .
Second ,
Intel has more power over its customers , the PC - makers .
AMD had hoped to catch up after convincing Dell , the world 's second - largest PC - maker and a close ally of Intel 's , to use its chips too .
But the new relationship has been a disappointment so far .
AMD claims that Intel is abusing its dominant position , and has complained to regulators in Asia , Europe and America .
It alleges that PC - makers receive substantial rebates in return for buying most of their chips from Intel .
America 's Federal Trade Commission decided in October against opening a formal antitrust investigation , but in July the European Commission issued a “ statement of objections ” critical of Intel 's business practices .
In South Korea regulators are already considering penalties .
Third , there is money .
Intel was able to recover quickly from its missteps because it has deep pockets .
After slashing nearly 11,000 jobs in the past 12 months , its profit in the third quarter soared by 43 % , to $ 1.86 billion .
AMD , by contrast , has posted losses for four quarters in a row ( although its latest loss of $ 396 m was not as bad as expected ) following its acquisition of ATI , a maker of specialised graphics chips , for $ 5.4 billion in 2006 .
Although the takeover made strategic sense , since AMD is now able to build high - end graphics features into its chips , it forced the firm to borrow heavily , just as it was fighting a bruising price war with Intel .
Hence the need for a cash infusion .
The petrodollars from Abu Dhabi , if followed by the sale of some assets , could give AMD a fighting chance to survive this round with Intel and perhaps recover some of its former strength .
This would be good news for customers , who benefit from the warring duopoly through lower prices and more innovation .
Mubadala Development will not get a seat on AMD 's board .
But the deal will prompt worries that if technology spending slows , as many industry - watchers expect it to , America 's high - tech industry will suffer , and more resource - rich countries will take the chance to buy their way into it .
NEW YORK ( CNN ) --
Authorities arrested three people Friday after detectives saw a replica of a Revolutionary War submarine floating near the dock of the Queen Mary II .
Authorities arrested a man found floating in an odd - looking submersible vessel Friday .
An Intelligence Division detective spotted two men in an inflatable boat and a third in a partially submerged vessel in a channel off the East River near Brooklyn , according to a New York Police Department statement .
The NYPD Harbor Unit was called to the scene .
The vessel is an 8 - foot replica of the 1776 submersible known as the Turtle , said Petty Officer Seth Johnson of the U.S. Coast Guard .
It was unclear what the people were doing , but there was no indication of any connection to terrorism , he said .
The vessel " is the creative craft of three adventuresome individuals , " Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said in a statement , according to WABC - TV .
" We can best summarize today 's incident as marine mischief . "
Initially the men were going to be charged on a number of violations , but as of Friday afternoon , it was unclear if any charges would be brought forward .
The odd - looking submarine appears to be a hobby of one of those arrested -- Philip Riley , 35 , of Brooklyn , Johnson said .
Police said one of the men claimed to be a descendant of David Bushnell , the inventor of the original Turtle , WABC reported .
Do n't Miss
The Connecticut River Museum claims to own the only working , full - scale model of the submarine .
The one - man , hand - propelled vessel was used in September 1776 in a failed attempt to attach a bomb to the hull of a British warship .
Because of weather problems and other difficulties , it was never used in action again , the museum says .

AS SMOKING bans bite in the developed world the number of puffers in China , India and other developing countries continues to grow .
The tobacco industry is regrouping in order to focus on poor countries and escape the pesky lawsuits it is likely to face in rich , litigious ones .
But the war on smoking is spreading too .
Over 150 countries have already ratified the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control , which requires signatories to take a range of anti-smoking measures in the hope of avoiding appalling consequences for public health .

ISTANBUL  Parliament took a major step on Saturday toward lifting a ban against women ’s head scarves at universities , setting the stage for a final showdown with Turkey ’s secular elite over where Islam fits in the building of an open society .
Lawmakers voted overwhelmingly in favor of a measure supported by Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan to change the Constitution in a way they say will guarantee all citizens the right to go to college regardless of how they dress .
The authorities imposed the ban in the late 1990s , arguing that the growing number of covered women in colleges threatened secularism , one of the founding principles of modern Turkey .
Secular opposition lawmakers voted against the change , with about a fifth of all ballots cast .
Crowds of secular Turks backed them on the streets of the capital , Ankara , chanting that secularism  and women ’s right to resist being forced to wear head scarves by an increasingly conservative society  was under threat .

V. The Effect of Coca on the Healthy Human Body
I have carried out experiments and studied , in myself and others , the effect of coca on the healthy human body ; my findings agree fundamentally with Mantegazza ’s description of the effect of coca leaves .
The first time I took 0.05 cg. of cocaïnum muriaticum in a 1 % water solution was when I was feeling slightly out of sorts from fatigue .
This solution is rather viscous , somewhat opalescent , and has a strange aromatic smell .
At first it has a bitter taste , which yields afterwards to a series of very pleasant aromatic flavors .
Dry cocaine salt has the same smell and taste , but to a more concentrated degree .
A few minutes after taking cocaine , one experiences a sudden exhilaration and feeling of lightness .
One feels a certain furriness on the lips and palate , followed by a feeling of warmth in the same areas ; if one now drinks cold water , it feels warm on the lips and cold in the throat .
On other occasions the predominant feeling is a rather pleasant coolness in the mouth and throat .
During this first trial I experienced a short period of toxic effects , which did not recur in subsequent experiments .
Breathing became slower and deeper and I felt tired and sleepy ; I yawned frequently and felt somewhat dull .
After a few minutes the actual cocaine euphoria began , introduced by repeated cooling eructation .
Immediately after taking the cocaine I noticed a slight slackening of the pulse and later a moderate increase .
I have observed the same physical signs of the effect of cocaine in others , mostly people of my own age .
The most constant symptom proved to be the repeated cooling eructation .
This is often accompanied by a rumbling which must originate from high up in the intestine ; two of the people I observed , who said they were able to recognize movements of their stomachs , declared emphatically that they had repeatedly detected such movements .
Often , at the outset of the cocaine effect , the subjects alleged that they experienced an intense feeling of heat in the head .
I noticed this in myself as well in the course of some later experiments , but on other occasions it was absent .
In only two cases did coca give rise to dizziness .
On the whole the toxic effects of coca are of short duration , and much less intense than those produced by effective doses of quinine or salicylate of soda ; they seem to become even weaker after repeated use of cocaine .
...
There are said to be people who cannot tolerate coca at all ; on the other hand , I have found not a few who remained unaffected by 5 cg , which for me and others is an effective dose .
The psychic effect of cocaïnum muriaticum in doses of 0.05 –0.10g consists of exhilaration and lasting euphoria , which does not differ in any way from the normal euphoria of a healthy person .
The feeling of excitement which accompanies stimulus by alcohol is completely lacking ; the characteristic urge for immediate activity which alcohol produces is also absent .
One senses an increase of self - control and feels more vigorous and more capable of work ; on the other hand , if one works , one misses that heightening of the mental powers which alcohol , tea , or coffee induce .
One is simply normal , and soon finds it difficult to believe that one is under the influence of any drug at all .
...
I have tested this effect of coca , which wards off hunger , sleep , and fatigue and steels one to intellectual effort , some dozen times on myself ; I had no opportunity to engage in physical work .
...
The effect of a moderate dose of coca fades away so gradually that , in normal circumstances , it is difficult to define its duration .
If one works intensively while under the influence of coca , after from three to five hours there is a decline in the feeling of well - being , and a further dose of coca is necessary in order to ward off fatigue .
The effect of coca seems to last longer if no heavy muscular work is undertaken .
Opinion is unanimous that the euphoria induced by coca is not followed by any feeling of lassitude or other state of depression .
I should be inclined to think that after moderate doses ( 0.05 –0.10g ) a part at least of the coca effect lasts for over twenty - four hours .
In my own case , at any rate , I have noticed that even on the day after taking coca my condition compares favorably with the norm .
I should be inclined to explain the possibility of a lasting gain in strength , such as has often been claimed for coca by the totality of such effects .
It seems probable , in the light of reports which I shall refer to later , that coca , if used protractedly but in moderation , is not detrimental to the body .
Von Anrep treated animals for thirty days with moderate doses of cocaine and detected no detrimental effects on their bodily functions .
It seems to me noteworthy – and I discovered this in myself and in other observers who were capable of judging such things – that a first dose or even repeated doses of coca produce no compulsive desire to use the stimulant further ; on the contrary , one feels a certain unmotivated aversion to the substance .
...
Coca is a far more potent and far less harmful stimulant than alcohol , and its widespread utilization is hindered at present only by its high cost .
...
Like Mantegazza and Frankl , I have experienced personally how the painful symptoms attendant upon large meals – viz , a feeling of pressure and fullness in the stomach , discomfort and a disinclination to work – disappear with eructation following small doses of cocaine ( 0.025–0.05 ) .
Time and again I have brought such relief to my colleagues ; and twice I observed how the nausea resulting from gastronomic excesses responded in a short time to the effects of cocaine , and gave way to a normal desire to eat and a feeling of bodily well - being .
I have also learned to spare myself stomach troubles by adding a small amount of cocaine to salicylate of soda .
...
Accordingly , I should say that the use of coca is definitely indicated in cases of atomic digestive weakness and the so - called nervous stomach disorders ; in such cases it is possible to achieve not merely a relief of the symptoms but a lasting improvement .
c ) Coca in cachexia .
Long - term use of coca is further strongly recommended and allegedly has been tried with success – in all diseases which involve degeneration of the tissues , such as severe anemia , phthisis , long - lasting febrile diseases , etc. ; and also during recovery from such diseases .
...
I once had occasion to observe the case of a man who was subjected to the type of cure involving the sudden withdrawal of morphine , assisted by the use of coca ; the same patient had suffered severe symptoms as a result of abstinence in the course of a previous cure .
This time his condition was tolerable ; in particular , there was no sign of depression or nausea as long as the effects of coca lasted ; chills and diarrhea were now the only permanent symptoms of his abstinence .
The patient was not bedridden , and could function normally .
During the first days of the cure he consumed 3dg of cocaïnum muriaticum daily , and after ten days he was able to dispense with the coca treatment altogether .
The treatment of morphine addiction with coca does not , therefore , result merely in the exchange of one kind of addiction for another – it does not turn the morphine addict into a coquero ; the use of coca is only temporary .
Moreover , I do not think that it is the general toughening effect of coca which enables the system weakened by morphine to withstand , at the cost of only insignificant symptoms , the withdrawal of morphine .
I am rather inclined to assume that coca has a directly antagonistic effect on morphine ...
...
f ) Coca as an aphrodisiac .
The natives of South America , who represented their goddess of love with coca leaves in her hand , did not doubt the stimulative effect of coca on the genitalia .
Mantegazza confirms that the coqueros sustain a high degree of potency right into old age ; he even reports cases of the restoration of potency and the disappearance of functional weaknesses following the use of coca , although he does not believe that coca would produce such an effect in all individuals .
Marvaud emphatically supports the view that coca has a stimulative effect ; other writers strongly recommend coca as a remedy for occasional functional weaknesses and temporary exhaustion ; and Bentley reports on a case of this type in which coca was responsible for the cure .
Among the persons to whom I have given coca , three reported violent sexual excitement which they unhesitatingly attributed to the coca .
A young writer , who was enabled by treatment with coca to resume his work after a longish illness , gave up using the drug because of the undesirable secondary effects which it had on him .

All attacks are now about stealing money , say experts
So say security experts looking back on 12 months in which hi-tech gangs took control of the net 's underground .
The economy supporting these groups has matured so much that now everything from virus - writing kits to spam - spewing zombies are available for rent or hire .
This has helped to fuel , say security professionals , rapid growth in the methods criminals use to catch out PC users and steal saleable data .
Money game
" 2007 was a fairly interesting year , " said Joe Telafici , vice president of operations for McAfee 's Avert Labs , " cyber crime continued to fuel most of the security attacks we saw . "
It was a year , he said , which saw the effective extinction of young hackers who wrote viruses and other malicious programs for fun .
Now , he said , Windows malware was all about money .
Some attacks , such as phishing runs , were clearly about stealing cash from victims either from a credit card or bank account .
But , he said , many others that looked more innocuous were done with money in mind .
For instance , he said , trojans placed in banner ads that try to hijack a home PC were all about getting hold of resources that can be rented out for a fee to spammers or other net - based criminals .
" There 's a real eco-system built around this , " he said .
Paul Henry , vice president of technology evangelism at Secure Computing said the tool of choice for many hi-tech criminals was the botnet - a collection of hijacked home PCs .
" Botnets are now a well - organised tool , " he said .
" They are at a point now where they are creating smaller botnets from larger ones . "
This was being done , he said , because like all businessmen criminals were keen to make the most of their assets .
Many malicious hackers have moved away from e-mail attacks
Successive spam campaigns added to the numbers of machines in the Storm botnet and , though estimates vary , many believe it was made up of more than 1 million machines .
A ready market for the buying and selling of time on a botnet and the tools needed to put it to good use had sprung up , said Mr Henry .
" Commercial exploitation has brought the real value of these tools to the vast majority , " he said .
One of the most widely known tools was the MPack kit which was created by a Russian hacker gang .
Anyone buying it got included in the price a year of technical support that updated them with the latest vulnerabilities so it could be used time and again for attacks .
But , said Mr Telafici , this had created problems for some makers of malicious software .
" One kit developer recently threw in the towel because they could no longer get the margins they used to , " he said .
" Instead they opened up the source and gave it away .
There were just too many players in that space , it 's too crowded . "
Novel threats
This busy market was driving innovation , said Simon Heron , managing director of Network Box .
Windows remains the biggest target for hi-tech criminals
Some of those that used to send huge numbers of phishing e-mails were now indulging in " spear phishing " which brought together lots of bits of data to make the messages they send look much more convincing .
Mr Heron said he had seen campaigns targeted at a few hundred people such as the senior managers in a large firm .
" It 's just fascinating seeing that this is happening , " he said .
The move away from the old attack vector of e-mail meant troubled times for users , he said .
" The bad guys are becoming more sophisticated and that means its becoming more difficult to stay safe , " he said .
Summing up Paul Henry from Secure Computing said 2007 was the year that hi-tech crime became firmly established and entrenched .
" I see no end to this , " he said , " until we effectively reduce the value of personal information to the point where for the hackers it is useless . "
As the presidential campaign narrows and its costs skyrocket , detailed disclosure of financial resources becomes ever more important .
Of the leading contenders , so far , only Senator Barack Obama has released his full income - tax returns  a level of disclosure once routine for candidates after the political corruption of Watergate .
Release of the tax returns should not be made conditional on winning the nomination , as Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton has made it .
Both Senator John McCain , the Republican front - runner , and she owe it to their parties and to voters to promptly make available their Internal Revenue Service filings , and to respond to any questions about them .
It is true that as senators , Mrs. Clinton and Mr. McCain are required to file financial disclosure forms .
But those forms present only general parameters of family financial resources , not the detail available on tax returns .
The need for greater transparency regarding the income and overall financial dealings of candidates and their spouses was underscored by Mrs. Clinton ’s recent decision to make a $ 5 million loan to her campaign .
Such borrowing is a permitted practice under the campaign laws .
But the campaign said the money came from her share of the Clintons ’ joint resources , and that calls attention to the lack of information about their family finances .
As a former president , Bill Clinton has been making millions annually giving speeches and traveling the globe .
What is publicly known about his business dealings is sketchy , and clearer disclosure of them is required to reassure voters that Mrs. Clinton ’s candidacy is unencumbered by hidden entanglements .
In the same spirit , the Clintons are obliged to make prompt disclosure of the major donors who have been backing the former president ’s library and foundation .
It is not even clear whether Mr. Clinton would disclose his library ’s donors if his wife won the White House .
In support of the International Polar Year ( IPY 2007 - 2008 ) , LIMA brings the coldest continent on Earth alive in greater detail than ever before through this virtually cloudless , seamless , and high resolution satellite view of Antarctica .
The U.S. Geological Survey ( USGS ) , the British Antarctic Survey ( BAS ) , and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration ( NASA ) , with funding from the National Science Foundation ( NSF ) , created LIMA from more than 1,000 Landsat ETM + scenes .
As the first major scientific outcome of the IPY , LIMA truly fulfills the IPY goals .
LIMA is an international effort , supports current scientific polar research , encourages new projects , and helps the general public visualize Antarctica and changes happening to this southernmost environment .
Researchers and the general public can download LIMA and all of the component Landsat scenes at no charge .
Pan to view the continent and zoom in to see the stunning detail of this Natural - Color , Pan -Sharpened LIMA ( bands 3 , 2 , 1 ) .
LIMA covers the entire continent except from the South Pole at 90 degrees south to 82.5 degrees south latitude , where Landsat has no coverage because of its near - polar orbit .
To provide a continental view , the image above has LIMA 3 , 2 , 1 overlaying the MODIS Mosaic of Antarctica ( MOA ) .
The opening view includes McMurdo Station , the largest research base in Antarctica .
Located at the tip of Hut Point Peninsula on Ross Island , McMurdo has been continually operated by the United States of America since 1956 .
Ross Island is roughly 72 km ( 45 mi ) across .
The flat , white areas are the Ross Ice Shelf and other sea ice off the coast of Antarctica .
Also visible are the Erebus Glacier Tongue , Koettlitz and Ferrar Glaciers , and the Royal Society Range .

“ The pride of the Chilean Navy , the Esmeralda , might be a magnificent example of marine architecture , but it has skeletons in its closet .
To thousands of Chileans , the ship is a symbol of the country 's brutal past .
In the weeks after General Augusto Pinochet 's bloody coup in 1973 , the Esmeralda was used as a floating prison and torture chamber . ”
“ Reports from Amnesty International , the US Senate and Chilean Truth and Reconciliation Commission describe the ship as a kind of a floating jail - torture chamber for political prisoners of the Augusto Pinochet 's military regime from 1973 to 1980 .
It is claimed that probably over a hundred persons were kept there at times and subjected to hideous treatment . [ 1 ] ” - Wikipedia

“ Worlds and empires shelter and fatten offshore , dropping into protected enclaves , free economic zones , and paper sovereignties long enough to avoid taxes , engage inexpensive labor , or launder an identity .
Streamlined logistics and loosened legalities are among the bullet - pointed features of every logistics park and free economic zone in the world .
Their segregation from other worlds and other nations helps them to garner power , and shapes them into distended and dominating territories that are constantly expanding and excluding .
They are the world with their own seas . ”
“ In Jacques Ranciere ’s speculations , the sea is a medium of insurgency and democracy .
Ranciere ’s sea is not a frictionless sea but , rather , a rough space of contention : “ It smells of sailors . ”
The sea is capable of enriching and disrupting the landed politics of consensus .
Once on a shore , political organs dilute the sea ’s raw democracy , as if secretly wishing for the end of politics or a delivery from the sea ’s unknowns .
Land and sea again appear to be a pair , or two halves of a single world .
Yet the site of this contemplation is the shore , the interface between raw democracy and political organization .
Wherever that interface exists , there is a platform for which to counter what Carl Schmitt called the “ shoreless sea ” of legal exception .
In Ranciere ’s characterization , this slipstream is not a space of least resistance but , rather , a space of traction and contention . ”
“ like shores , these areas of intolerance between worlds sustain and are sustained by error piracy , or the contentions of democracy .
As interfaces between worlds , they form a perpetual wilderness with limitless surface area – always newly minted , and often underexplored .
However rough they may be , these seas are also spacious , mixing different waters and different political constitutions . ”

Fifteen months ago , the armed wing of Lebanon 's Hezbollah party , listed as a terrorist organization by the United States and most other western countries , attacked Israel 's northern border , capturing two Israeli soldiers and killing eight more .
Israel replied with a month of massive air attacks all across Lebanon that destroyed much of the country 's infrastructure , levelled a good deal of south Beirut , and killed about a thousand Lebanese civilians .
Washington , London , Ottawa , and some other western capitals insisted that this was a reasonable and proportionate response and shielded Israel from intense diplomatic pressure to stop the attacks , even when Israel launched a land invasion of southern Lebanon in early August 2006 .
The operation only ended when Israeli casualties on the ground mounted rapidly and the Israeli government pulled its troops back .
So what would be a reasonable and proportionate Turkish response to the recent attacks by the Kurdistan Workers Party ( PKK ) –listed as a terrorist organization by the United States and most other western countries –from northern Iraq into southeastern Turkey ?
More than 40 Turkish civilians and soldiers have been killed in these attacks over the past two weeks , and a further eight Turkish soldiers were captured .
Well , it would be unreasonable for Turkey to bomb Iraq , where the PKK 's bases are , for any more than one month .
It would be quite disproportionate for the Turkish air force to level more than a small part of Baghdad–say , 15,000 homes .
Ideally , it should leave Baghdad alone and restrict itself to destroying some Kurdish - populated city in northern Iraq near Turkey 's own border .
Moreover , when the Turks do invade Iraq on the ground , they should restrict themselves to the northern border strip where the PKK 's bases are .
What 's that ?
Washington is asking Turkey to show restraint and not attack Iraq at all ?
Even after the Kurdish terrorists killed or kidnapped all those Turkish people ?
Could it be that Turkish lives are worth less than Israeli lives ?
Never mind .
At least the United States officially classes the PKK as a terrorist organization and refuses to let its officials have any contact with it .
But what 's this ?
There is a parallel terrorist organization called the Party for Free Life in Kurdistan ( PJAK ) , essentially a branch office of the PKK , also based in northern Iraq , which carries out attacks into the adjacent Kurdish - populated region of Iran , and the United States does not condemn the PJAK ?
It even sends its officials to have friendly chats with the PJAK terrorists ?
How odd .
The PJAK 's leader , Rahman Haj - Ahmadi , paid an unofficial visit to Washington last summer .
One of his close associates , Biryar Gabar , claims to have " normal dialogue " with U.S. officials , according to a report last Tuesday in the New York Times –and the American military spokesman in Baghdad , Cmdr.
Scott Rye , issued a carefully structured nondenial : " The consensus is that U.S. forces are not working with or advising the PJAK . "
Gabar also said that PJAK fighters have killed at least 150 Iranian soldiers and officials in the past three months .
That 's a lot more people than the PKK have killed in Turkey in the same time , and yet neither Washington nor any other western country has expressed sympathy for Iran .
Could it be that Iranian lives are worth even less than Turkish lives ?
And here 's something even more peculiar .
Iran , like Turkey , is already shelling Kurdish villages on the Iraqi side of the frontier that it suspects of sheltering or supplying the PKK / PJAK .
How come President George W. Bush and Vice President Richard Cheney simply ignore these actions when they have been working hard for the past year to build a case for attacking Iran ?
We are told that Iran is supporting the anti-American insurgency in Iraq .
Bush even warned us last week that a nuclear - armed Iran ( which he insists is coming ) would lead to " World War Three " .
So if they 're that keen to attack Iran , why do n't Bush and Cheney use the fact that Iranian artillery shells are falling on Kurdish villages in northern Iraq almost every day as a pretext for the attack ?
Are they are getting cold feet ?
I sincerely hope so .
On the other hand , I doubt it .
As Pat Buchanan noted on MSNBC 's Hardball last week : " I do n't see how ” ¦Bush and Cheney can avoid attacking Iran and [ still retain ] their credibility going out of office . "
The U.S. military " assets " for an attack on Iran are all in place , so it can't be that .
Maybe the delay means that Bush and Cheney are having difficulty in persuading the military professionals to go along with this harebrained scheme .
Most senior American military officers see an attack on Iran as leading to inevitable failure and humiliation for the United States , and the last thing the White House wants is a rash of U.S. generals resigning in protest when it orders the attack .
On the other hand , Bush is still the commander - in - chief , and how many U.S. generals resigned when he committed the somewhat lesser folly of invading Iraq ?
Only one , and he did it very quietly .
" It is dangerous enough that a single entity such as Google is dominant as a search engine , " Maurer and his co-writers say , but the fact that Google is operating many other services and is probably colluding with other players was " unacceptable . "
" Google is massively invading privacy , " the study said , with the company able to access knowledge about individuals and companies , but not bound by national data protection laws .
Google was amassing data by using data mining tools in its applications like Google Earth or Gmail in connection with its search engine function .
A Google spokesman said in a statement : " These allegations are premised on numerous inaccuracies , conspiracy theories and fundamental misunderstandings about Google 's products and services .
They 're completely without foundation and , frankly , a little strange . ''
The Austrian researcher warned that by using data collected from users via its applications , Google could potentially turn into the world 's largest detective agency .
Even if Google did not use that potential now , it might have to do so in the future in the interest of its shareholders .
The study further argues that Google is influencing economies in the way advertisements and documents are ranked .
" The more a company pays , the more often will the ad be visible . "
The study believes rankings can also be influenced from queries , and that in the future Google could rank paying customers higher .
Moreover , Maurer was worried that Google could use its knowledge of what was happening in the world to play global stockmarkets to its advantage .
" Google has become the main interface of our reality , " and distorts reality the study authors said .
Most material written today was in some way based on Google and Wikipedia - and if those did not reflect reality , a distortion was possible , the researchers said , recalling biased contributions frequently placed on Wikipedia .
Furthermore there is some indication of cooperation between Google and Wikipedia .
Sample statistics showed that randomly selected Wiki entries consistently ranked higher on Google than on other search engines , the Graz team said .
Maurer also criticised journalists who increasingly researched their stories by googling them , as well as students copying work from the internet .
" Google 's open aim is to know everything there is to know on Earth , " the researchers concluded .
" It can not be tolerated that a private company has that much power : it can extort , control , and dominate the world at will . "
Stopping the insidious aspects of Google was however not possible by a head - on strategy , as the company was too powerful , the Austrian researchers warn .
Rather , they say , the " Google effect " can be minimised by the introduction of special - purpose search engines that are better in their areas of application that the larger company is .

On Saturday afternoon , John Edwards met with Martin Luther King III , son of Rev. Martin Luther King , Jr. , at the King Center in Atlanta .
He received this note ( .pdf ) from him the following day :
... I appreciate that on the major issues of health care , the environment , and the economy , you have framed the issues for what they are - a struggle for justice .
And , you have almost single - handedly made poverty an issue in this election .
You know as well as anyone that the 37 million people living in poverty have no voice in our system .
They do n't have lobbyists in Washington and they do n't get to go to lunch with members of Congress .
Speaking up for them is not politically convenient .
But , it is the right thing to do .
I am disturbed by how little attention the topic of economic justice has received during this campaign .
I want to challenge all candidates to follow your lead , and speak up loudly and forcefully on the issue of economic justice in America .[.. ]
I believe that now , more than ever , we need a leader who wakes up every morning with the knowledge of that injustice in the forefront of their minds , and who knows that when we commit ourselves to a cause as a nation , we can make major strides in our own lifetimes .
My father was not driven by an illusory vision of a perfect society .
He was driven by the certain knowledge that when people of good faith and strong principles commit to making things better , we can change hearts , we can change minds , and we can change lives .
So , I urge you : keep going .
Ignore the pundits , who think this is a horserace , not a fight for justice .
My dad was a fighter .
As a friend and a believer in my father 's words that injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere , I say to you : keep going .
Keep fighting .
My father would be proud .

Submitting links to web directories can be a great way to increase highly relevant traffic to your site .
Inbound links are one of the most important factors in how search engines ranks websites , and so this can be a major plus .
Also , submitting links to specific directories and categories will create more relevant traffic for your site .
This is the best kind of traffic you can receive , because it will drive conversions and help you rank better for keywords related to the subject your site addresses .
However , choosing the right directories to submit to is very important to your search engine optimization strategies .
What follows are tips for choosing and using directories that will be the most effective so you do n’t waste your efforts .
1. Choosing Directories with Page Ranks
Check the page rank of the directory you ’re considering using .
You can do this easily through Google .
Generally , you want to choose a directory whose main page has a rank of at least 5 .
Be sure to also check the rank of interior pages , if they have them .
The categories or internal pages you ’re considering linking your site under should have ranks of at least 2 , because these will have the most viewers , and therefore drive the most traffic to your site .
2. Does the Directory Use Dynamic Pages that Search Engines have a Hard Time Indexing ?
You can check this quite easily through Google or Yahoo by entering the search term “ site:www.domainname.com”.
If the results show lots of pages with unique titles and description tags , then you can assume that the directory in question is search engine friendly , and therefore worth using .
3 . Will the directory provide you direct links to your site , or will it instead use a tracking code ?
Less helpful directories will not provide your link with a value or page rank .
You can easily check this by locating an existing site in the directory and holding your mouse over it until you can see the URL appear in the bottom left side of your browser .
If you see that this is a direct link to a domain , this generally means the directory will be effective .
If this appears as a tracking URL , then this will not provide you with the direct links you want , and the directory is not worth using .
However , some sites will appear as direct links but not actually be direct links , and instead are hidden by a Java script to conceal the fact that these links receive no Page Rank and therefore no attention from search engines .
Use this tool to check the source code .
If you see the term “ NOFOLLOW ” in the source code , then no page rank will be assigned to your link , and the directory is not worth using .
4 . Does the directory pass on link credit to sites that it lists ?
This is very important .
You can test this by choosing a few sites listed in the directory and checking their backlinks by entering the search term “ link:www.domainname.com” into Google , Yahoo or any other search engine .
Scan the results to see if there are any links listed from the directory you are investigating .
If you find them , the directory is effective and worth using .
However , if you do not find them , do n’t cast the directory off just yet .
Sometimes sites with lower page ranks do not appear in these link results , especially when using Google .
Try to check sites with higher page ranks .
If you find one or a few that have backlinks listed by Google , then the directory can be said to have value .
Strangely , Yahoo and MSN often display more backlinks than Google .
This may indicate that using links in directories is more effective for boosting ranking in these search engines .
So use discretion , but generally assume that a backlink that appears in Google indicates a very good directory .
5 . Are there too many sites already listed in your relevant category on the directory ?
Generally , you want to choose directories that have less than 25 sites listed to improve focus on your own .
Some directories may warrant adding your link to categories with more , but never list on categories that have more than 50 sites .
Too many links means diluted value for each one , so the less , the better .
6 . Choosing between free directories and directories with fees .
The advantage of directories that carry fees is that they often guarantee to review and consider your link within a short amount of time .
This does not however guarantee inclusion in the directory .
Be sure to read the fine print concerning submission standards , and to ensure that your site and link comply with all of them , because you do n’t want to waste money applying to sites that are going to reject your link .
However , directories with fees are well - respected and popular , and so they definitely provide somewhat of an advantage over less quality free directories .
For free directories , be careful to choose ones that are updated often with new links .
Sometimes , the sheer volume of link applications they receive means that yours wo n’t be reviewed for quite some time , if at all .
However , if you can find good ones , never pass up on the opportunity to gain valuable backlinks for free .
7. General directories vs. industry specific directories .
When it comes down to it , both types of directories can be useful in boosting your traffic .
Industry specific directories have obvious additional value however , since they will bring you targeted , relevant traffic , which essentially means higher quality traffic .
The people you want viewing your site are the people interested in what your site offers .
A Selection of Quality Directories with Proven Results
Below are listed some directories that we have found to be effective .
These can be excellent places to start .
Open Directory ( Free ) – One of the most popular directories out there , Open Directory is owned by AOL , and Google uses it to power their directory feature .
However , due to their popularity they receive lots of submissions , and therefore can be very slow in reviewing and adding your link .
Pay careful attention to the submission requirements , as they are very strict .
About .Com ( Free ) – Another very popular site , About hires writers and editors to create and monitor specific categories of content and articles .
Each page has a list of suggested links on the subjects they address .
If you feel your site can be very useful to readers of these articles and pages , write their editors and request to be listed .
Wikipedia ( Free ) – Wikipedia offers user - generated content on an endless variety of subjects .
While not truly a directory site , each subject page lists relevant links , which you can add yourself .
This is best for sites that really focus on a niche market or subject , as those pages will have less people submitting links to their sites .
More popular subjects can have listings of links that change every hour , while less popular , more niche subjects may have links that remain for many months .
Yahoo Directory ( Annual Fee ) – Yahoo directories have very high page ranks , and being listed in them can be very effective for boosting search engine traffic , especially because they do very well in Google .

The Clintons for all of their duplicity , their trickery , their bullying , their triangulation and their chicanery will have destroyed the Democratic party or more appropriately the shell of what remains of it , for the sake of their own insatiable arrogance , rank sense of entitlement and relentless drive to regain control of the money spigots on the spoils trough .
Minus the antiwar base that propelled the feckless Pelosi - Hoyer - Reid triad to victory in 2006 with an end the f*cking war now mandate and an energized Republican base including Raptureheads lining up behind their new best chance to trigger Armageddon and send them flying dirty , nasty naked up to fondle themselves at the foot of God 's throne while we sinners , heathens and libruls rip each other 's f*cking throats out and are eaten by plagues of insects and wage total jihad against the hated she devil the Dems are toast .
The Clintons will go down faster than a Republican in a pay toilet stall and America 's ticket to a vile and sorrowful destiny along with historical infamy will be punched .
Time to put a f*cking end this ridiculous farce of a marriage , the Democrats in my opinion are actually worse than the Republicans because at least the GOP is honest about what they are which is the earthly personification of Satan himself .
The Democrats on the other hand are more like Judas Iscariot and we have been sold out for chump change .
I will always remember what a diehard Marxist who was once an acquaintance of mine told me , " there is really no difference between the two capitalist parties in this country , both are killers only one is better at pretending not to be " .
So to those who are antiwar and for the restoration of the Constitution dare I say that maybe our time is better served ( other than those who still have a childlike faith in the two - party system ) by slowly beginning to extricate ourselves from this abortion of a marriage in which we are taken for granted as nothing more than the easy piece of ass of a philandering drunken cad of a spouse who prefers dipping his wick elsewhere unless he finds himself suddenly and unexpectedly desperate on any particular night .
I say that it is well past the time to start looking into alliances with the libertarians who are antiwar since the Democratic party in it 's current incarnation has pretty much sh*t on us all and takes our support for granted .
Matt Taibbi coincidentally is out with a new piece in Rolling Stone on exactly how the Democrats have betrayed those against the war and it is well worth reading and appropriately entitled The Chicken Doves which shows just how far that the current Democrats have gone to manipulate the antiwar base for cynical political reasons .
The never ending re-importation of what used to be our finest young soldiers as so much hamburger meat wrapped in body bags as the finished product of the warfare state be damned just so long as they can have their precious f*cking gigs as the preening servants of the oligarchy , the looters and the blood barters .
Taibbi in his typical caustic and irreverent style berates the footstool bearing Democrats for their part in " one of the most awesome political collapses since Neville Chamberlain " and rightfully singles out Senate Majority Leader Casper Milquetoast Harry Reid as " one of the biggest pussies in U.S. political history " - this was before today 's latest feat of imperial bootlicking by the chief palooka in Hillary 's Temple of Eunuchs .
This particular bit is classic :
There was much public shedding of tears among the Democratic leadership , as Reid , Pelosi and other congressional heavyweights expressed deep sadness that their valiant charge up the hill of change had been thwarted by circumstances beyond their control - that , as much as they would love to continue trying to end the catastrophic Iraq deal , they would now have to wait until , oh , 2009 to try again .
" We 'll have a new president , " said Pelosi .
" And I do think at that time we 'll take a fresh look at it . "
Pelosi seemed especially broken up about having to surrender on Iraq , sounding like an NFL coach in a postgame presser , trying with a straight face to explain why he punted on first - and - goal .
" We just did n't have any plays we liked down there , " said the coach of the 0 - 15 Dems .
" Sometimes you just have to play the field - position game .... "
In reality , though , Pelosi and the Democrats were actually engaged in some serious point - shaving .
Working behind the scenes , the Democrats have systematically taken over the anti-war movement , packing the nation 's leading group with party consultants more interested in attacking the GOP than ending the war .
" Our focus is on the Republicans , " one Democratic apparatchik in charge of the anti-war coalition declared .
" How can we juice up attacks on them ? "
Taibbi then goes on to show just how morally depraved that the Democrats truly are in resorting to a tactic right out of Karl Rove 's playbook of recruiting public relations hacks to set up a bogus antiwar front group called Americans Against Escalation in Iraq to infiltrate and channel the energies of the antiwar movement towards electoral politics - all while Americans are still being fed into the Mesopotamian meat grinder as a live action practice run for the soon to be widening war of civilizations .
Here is some more of Taibbi 's piece :
Rather than use the vast power they had to end the war , Democrats devoted their energy to making sure that " anti-war activism " became synonymous with " electing Democrats . "
Capitalizing on America 's desire to end the war , they hijacked the anti-war movement itself , filling the ranks of peace groups with loyal party hacks .
Anti-war organizations essentially became a political tool for the Democrats - one operated from inside the Beltway and devoted primarily to targeting Republicans .
This supposedly grass - roots " anti-war coalition " met regularly on K Street , the very capital of top - down Beltway politics .
At the forefront of the groups are Thomas Matzzie and Brad Woodhouse of Americans Against the Escalation in Iraq , the leader of the anti-war lobby .
Along with other K Street crusaders , the two have received iconic treatment from The Washington Post and The New York Times , both of which depicted the anti-war warriors as young idealist - progressives in shirtsleeves , riding a mirthful spirit into political combat - changing the world is fun !
But what exactly are these young idealists campaigning for ?
At its most recent meeting , the group eerily echoed the Reid - Pelosi " squeezed for time " mantra : Retreat from any attempt to end the war and focus on electing Democrats .
" There was a lot of agreement that we can draw distinctions between anti-war Democrats and pro-war Republicans , " a spokeswoman for Americans Against the Escalation in Iraq announced .
What the Post and the Times failed to note is that much of the anti-war group 's leadership hails from a consulting firm called Hildebrand Tewes - whose partners , Steve Hildebrand and Paul Tewes , served as staffers for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee ( DSCC ) .
In addition , these anti-war leaders continue to consult for many of the same U.S. senators whom they need to pressure in order to end the war .
This is the kind of conflict of interest that would normally be an embarrassment in the activist community .
Worst of all is the case of Woodhouse , who came to Hildebrand Tewes after years of working as the chief mouthpiece for the DSCC , where he campaigned actively to re-elect Democratic senators who supported the Iraq War in the first place .
Anyone bothering to look - and clearly the Post and the Times did not before penning their ardent bios of Woodhouse - would have found the youthful idealist bragging to newspapers before the Iraq invasion about the pro-war credentials of North Carolina candidate Erskine Bowles .
" No one has been stronger in this race in supporting President Bush in the War on Terror and his efforts to effect a regime change in Iraq , " boasted the future " anti-war " activist Woodhouse .
Most notably the Taibbi piece quotes Justin Raimondo of the libertarian website Antiwar.com that shows that I am not the only one thinking of the potential of crossover appeal to jump start the antiwar movement .
I have written at length here and in other places on the next step now that it has become obvious that the Republican party is not our sole enemy but rather the entire rotting system itself .
There really needs to be a realization that swallowing our pride because as Bob Dylan once sang " it ai n't poison " and starting to do some work to build a bridge to others that we may not agree with on a full time basis is in the best interests of not only America but in a building a political force that can't be taken for granted .
We do have a common interest in purging fascism from this country and truthfully until that is done nothing else really matters .
Now I have also noted that I have been impressed by the now headless Ron Paul movement for a sheer example of how quickly that one can rally support by going against the blood soaked oligarchy despite a flawed messenger .
The Ron Paul phenomenon always impressed me solely as a sum of its parts rather than a whole and as I listen to these people in most cases they are practically begging for an alliance with progressives and liberals so why the f*ck not ?
It is time to renounce the abusers but the first step of recovery is the acknowledgement of the problem , the way that I see it is that the Democrats are the ones that need the antiwar movement now more than ever so what is wrong with holding their feet over the fire ?
Either stop the f*cking wars or we will stay home come November , it is probably already too late to change the trajectory but why not start looking to the future .
We need to begin talking with antiwar libertarians and principled conservatives , start the process of cross pollination and as the Marge Piercy poem Each Day One More so eloquently puts it :
It goes on one at a time ,
it starts when you care
to act , it starts when you do
it again after they said no ,
it starts when you say We
and know who you mean , and each
day you mean one more .
It is imperative to start expanding our horizons because we are the only hope that the existing system will one day crumble under the weight of it's own bullshit .
I end with this from the great Hunter S. Thompson on the ultimate outsiders , The Hell 's Angels :
The Angels do n't like being called losers but they have learned to live with it .
" Yeah , I guess I am " said one " But you 're looking at one loser who 's going to make a hell of a scene on the way out "
Let 's just hope that there are still some outlaws left out there amongst the sheeple , they are all that we have when it comes down to whatever hope there may be left in an increasingly hopeless and hostile world .
IT may be true , as scientists tell us , that you can discover whole worlds in a drop of water , but Rickmond Wong would prefer to explore a bowl of soup .
Not just any soup -- noodle soup .
And not just any noodle soup , but ramen .
On the Internet , at least , Wong just about owns the subject .
He is the Rameniac .
Wong ’s website , www.rameniac.com, is a lively compendium of all things ramen , one of the best of the food sites by single - topic fanatics .
There is an in - depth discussion of Japan ’s regional styles of ramen ( 22 , according to Wong ) .
There are reviews of ramen restaurants .
There are reviews of packaged ramen .
There are even videos of ramen being made and slurped .
There is a forum for discussing ramen and ramen - related issues .
Wong says that he eats ramen several times a week when he’s at home in Los Angeles and that he ’ll slurp almost nonstop when he visits Japan .
“ Last year I ate 18 bowls of ramen in 14 days , ” he says .
“ I came back and ate only salads for a month .
But while I was there I had to get my ramen . ”
Next year ’s vacation is already planned .
“ I ’m going to bicycle across Japan eating ramen , ” he says .
Visually lively , informed and well - written , Rameniac is one of three websites written by Wong -- he also has a site called Rameniac ’s B - Sides that is devoted to food other than ramen , and a MySpace page .
But Rameniac is all about the noodles .
It ’s wised - up without being snarky , and though it is plainly a love song to ramen , it never veers into cheap romanticism .
Right now , the Rameniac is very happy .
He is sitting in the bustling food court of the Torrance branch of Mitsuwa Marketplace .
On the little table in front of him is ramen from his favorite restaurant , Santouka .
A mop - topped 33 - year - old who was born and raised in the San Gabriel Valley , Wong is the child of Cantonese immigrants .
He works as a Web designer for Universal Studios and , with a partner has just started Qio , a clothing store on Pico Boulevard in West Los Angeles dedicated to Japanese street fashion .
Wong takes a slurp of soup and deftly plucks a nest of noodles with his chopsticks .
“ This is the best ramen in town because of the depth of flavor in the soup , ” he says .
He explains that Santouka ’s home base of Hokkaido is in the extreme north of Japan and that its ramen is made from a rich pork stock that is also flavored with seafood .
The broth is , indeed , extraordinary .
In fact , so is the whole dish .
Santouka ’s signature shio ramen is one of Southern California ’s perfect noodle dishes .
The soup is deeply flavored and complex .
The noodles are perfectly al dente .
The slices of pork alternate between buttery smooth and chewy and muscular .
It ’s hard to believe you can get food this perfect for only $ 6.50 a bowl .
At its most basic level , ramen is very simple .
There is a soup , which consists of a stock and a seasoning .
There are the noodles .
And there are the garnishes .
But each of these elements offers so many variables that trying to generalize about ramen in Japan is like trying to generalize about pasta in Italy .
There are two main families of stock -- a clear one made with pork and chicken cooked relatively briefly , and a milky one called tonkotsu made from split pork bones that have been boiled for hours .
Traditionally , there are three seasoning choices -- salt ( or shio ) , soy sauce ( or shoyu ) and miso paste .
The stock is determined mostly by regional preference and to a certain extent by the style of the individual ramen maker .
The choice of seasonings is left to the eater , though most ramen shops will emphasize one , even if very subtly ( at Santouka , the flagship bowl of shio ramen is signified by the presence of a pickled red ume plum the size of a large pea ) .
The overall effect of the soup can range from almost unctuously fatty ( kotteri , in Japanese ) , to very light and brothy ( assari ) .
It ’s this initial base that determines the quality of a bowl of ramen , Wong says .
“ The quality of a ramen is dictated by the broth and the depth of flavor in it is what determines a great ramen , ” he says .
“ By that I do n’t mean that it should be super - salty or something like that .
The soup has to have lots of things going on in it .
It ’s complexity and umami that makes the difference . ”
Regional differences
THOUGH ramen is made almost exclusively with wheat noodles , every region has a slightly different style that the locals believe ideally suits the particular soup of the area .
Hakata ramen from northern Kyushu has noodles that are very thin and very firm .
Kumamoto ramen from central Kyushu has thicker noodles , nearly spaghetti- like .
Generally , ramen shops buy their noodles from specialized manufacturers .
In fact , Wong says , most Southern California ramen shops buy their noodles from the same importers .
And with garnishes , the range of possibilities goes through the roof .
Pork is one of the most common , called chashu ( though the name is derived from the Chinese char - siu barbecued pork , in Japan it ’s usually simply boiled ) .
There may well also be such things as cooked eggs , wood ear mushrooms , green onions and mustard greens .
Even more exotic choices might include pickled ginger , sesame seeds , pickled vegetables , seafood , and even fried cubes of pork fat .
Even with all of that , ramen is essentially street food -- cheap and filling and meant to be slurped enthusiastically but not requiring a lot of ceremony .
“ Ramen is perfectly suited for geeks , ” Wong says , “ Otaku is what they call them in Japan , ” usually indicating someone with an obsessive interest in an arcane topic such as animé ( Japanese cartoons ) or fashion .
“ It ’s cheap and it ’s hedonistic .
“ There is also so much regional variation and that goes with the geek mentality of endlessly categorizing and analyzing things , ” he says .
“ There ’s this show on Japanese TV where they take ramen geeks and blindfold them and see if they can identify their favorite ramen shops just by the smell of the soup . ”
Though today
Wong is all about the ramen , when he was growing up it was as foreign to him as foie gras .
His mom was the kind who would try to make sure he ate healthy meals , which irritated him no end .
“ When everyone else was bringing bologna sandwiches to school , she ’d send me with egg salad or something , ” he says .
“ I hated it .
And I think inadvertently she ’s the one who turned me into a food freak . ”
When the family went out to eat , it was to one of the San Gabriel Valley ’s many Cantonese restaurants .
That cuisine left Wong similarly uninspired .
“ I ’m sorry , but Cantonese food is really bland , ” he says .
“ It ’s like , ‘ Oh , we just steamed this fish . ’
I never got into that . ”
Discovering ramen
WHEN he found ramen , as a student at UCLA , it was a revelation .
“ I found I really loved it , even the bad ones , ” he says .
“ They were salty and they were cheap .
I had a hot plate and a pot in my dorm room and I ’d cook those ramen packages and eat them with Spam and Vienna sausages . ”
Wong ’s introduction to real ramen came in 1999 , after he graduated from college and moved to Japan to teach English .
Living in the countryside in Kyushu in southern Japan , he began to explore the almost infinite permutations of this most versatile of soups .
Wong says his approach as the Rameniac is informed by his college experiences .
An ethnomusicology major specializing in Asian music ( he plays traditional Japanese , Chinese and Korean instruments ) , he came to reappraise how he approached other cultures .
“ It got to seem very colonial , to be honest -- Western culture scrutinizing this so - called exotic music , ” Wong says .
“ If I had a mission statement for my website , it would be to help do away with the way people look at ‘ ethnic ’ culture .
“ To me it ’s just something that ’s really cool that happens to come from a certain place .
I want people to try going to this one place to eat because the food is great and the vibe is really cool .
It ’s a way of presenting this aspect of popular culture without coming off sounding like I ’m talking about the ‘ exotic Orient . ’ ”
On his website are reviews of ramen restaurants all over Japan and the U.S. and even Canada and Britain .
And though he loves ramen of all kinds , he has enough academic distance on the subject to put it in realistic context .
For example , though Santouka is a well - respected chain in Japan , he says , “ it certainly would n’t be regarded as anything really special .
It ’s like In - N - Out is here .
It ’s probably not the best hamburger you ’ll ever eat , but everybody goes there because it ’s always good . ”
The obsessive appeal of ramen makes it perfect for the Internet , which sometimes seems like nothing so much as a global geek meet - and - greet .
In this group , Wong feels right at home .
“ I ’ve met a lot of food bloggers recently and I have to say that a surprising number of them share the same demographic as me -- Asian Americans , late 20s to early 30s , just out of college and working in a cubicle job , ” he says .
“ It ’s like we ’ve done the things we were supposed to do and now this is how we have fun . ”
He cites local food blogs Eat , Drink & Be Merry ( eatdrinknbmerry.blogspot.com ) by Dylan H. , Oishii Eats ( oishiieats.blogspot.com ) by Jeni Afuso and Eddie Lin ’s contributions to “ Deep End Dining ” ( www.deependdining.com).
In fact , at a recent dinner in honor of visiting Internet celebrity Eric M. ( he ’s the one whose translation on a Chicago foodie website unlocked the southern Thai specialty menu at L.A. 's Jitlada ) , Wong says the translator was just about the only non-Asian in the crowd .
“ For an Asian American , being a foodie on the Internet is kind of like being a rock star without having to be unemployed or doing a lot of drugs or disappointing your parents . ”

Randy Salerno News Anchor Dies in Snowmobile Crash
Chicago CBS affiliate television station KBBM - Channel 2 announced that their morning news anchorwas killed on Thursday night when a snowmobile he was riding on crashed .
The accident occurred at 11:30 p.m. in Eagle River , Wisconsin , a popular snowmobiling area .
The driver was flown to Marshfield for medical treatment .
Vilas County Sheriff 's Department reported that a 45 year old man was killed when a snowmobile that he was a passenger on , lost control and hit several trees .
In the department 's release , it was indicated that alcohol and high speed were factors in the crash .
His death was reported on Channel 2 this morning .
His colleagues described their working partner as calm , witty and always willing to help others during his time at the station .
The recipient of a local Emmy Award for reporting , Salerno leaves behind a wife and three children .
New research shows that the second most diverse group of hard corals first evolved in the deep sea , and not in shallow waters .
Stylasterids , or lace corals , diversified in deep waters before launching at least three successful invasions of shallow water habitats in the past 30 million years .
This finding contradicts a long - established theory that suggests corals and other marine animals all evolved in shallow water before migrating into deeper habitats .
" When we look at the DNA and fossils of these animals , we can trace how these transitions from deep water to shallow habitats have popped up in different parts of the family at different points in time , " says Alberto Lindner , a coral researcher at the University of São Paulo , Brazil .
" We also see this story unfold in which the corals are building skeletal defenses in what looks like a long - running arms race with their predators .
Together , it shows us how wrong it is to think of deep - sea ecosystems as being isolated and static . "
Regardless of where they evolved , the corals living in these habitats continue to surprise researchers .
" Deep - sea corals can be spectacularly long - lived , which makes them critical contributors to our efforts to understand the past , " says Brendan Roark , a paleoceanographer at Stanford University .
" Our radiocarbon dating shows that some species have life spans of over 4000 years .
That means some coral colonies have been alive since Stonehenge was erected .
These animals are living antiquities . "
Many corals grow their skeletons in a manner similar to tree trunks , laying down growth rings that become historical archives of the water conditions over time .
Analyzing the chemical composition of these layers allows researchers to trace changes in ocean circulation and temperature over hundreds to thousands of years .
Such historical reconstructions are critical for understanding how climate change occurred in the past , and for making predictions about the future .
The coral might further our understanding , for example , of how the oceans absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere .
" These organisms are the equivalent of the bristlecone pine in the deep ocean , " he said .
They are placed in jeopardy not only by coral harvesters but also by deep - sea trawling and long - line fishing .
" Clearly a different frame of mind is needed , " he said .
" It 's not a renewable resource . "
Roark and his associates found that Gerardia , commonly known as gold coral , can live for at least 2,700 years .
It grows in tree - like fashion to several meters in height .
Even older is the deep - water black coral Leiopathes glaberrima .
Another tree - like skeleton , it has life spans in excess of 4,000 years -- some of these corals began growing just a few hundred years after the great pyramids were built in Giza and are still alive today .
Roark 's finding on growth rates and longevity also challenge the adequacy of old models upon which the management of deep - sea coral species are based .
" Growth rates have been overestimated by an order of magnitude in some fisheries management plans .
Our new understanding of the great longevity of some of these species strongly suggests the need for more rigorous measures to ensure their populations are adequately protected . "
Research in these habitats is expensive and difficult , often leading to studies that are geographically constrained and impossible to compare .
In an attempt to overcome these challenges , J. Murray Roberts of the Scottish Association for Marine Science will unveil plans for a novel international scientific program called the Trans - Atlantic Coral Ecosystem Study ( TRACES ) .
The project will be the first to trace the flow of genes and animals across the seafloor communities of an entire ocean basin .
TRACES researchers from Canada , the U.S. , and the European Union will conduct exploratory cruises across the North Atlantic to study the environmental and ecological history of deep - sea communities beginning in late 2008 .
Whereas Lindner 's work is concerned with how species evolved in the distant past , the TRACES geneticists are focused on tracking relatively recent changes in populations .
Other TRACES researchers will expand upon Roark 's work ; by collecting a large library of the isotope records stored in coral skeletons , they will be able to study historical climate change and create new models with better resolution than ever before .
" We must cross national boundaries to understand deep - sea coral ecosystems .
The only way we can work out how to protect deep - sea corals is to understand how they are distributed and connected , " Roberts says .
" Since we started work on TRACES we 've been amazed at the response of the scientific community .
Over 100 scientists are already involved and our first meetings are over - subscribed .
Everyone agrees we owe it to future generations to make sure these unique ecosystems are protected by conservation plans based on sound science . "
Researchers will discuss these and other new discoveries about deep - sea corals at the American Association for the Advancement of Science ( AAAS ) Annual Meeting in Boston , MA , February 14 and 15 .

Quick thought .
I think Obama should combat the increasing use of his middle name by right - wingers and some portions of the official Republican Party by making a joke out of it .
Whenever referring to John McCain from now on , Obama should use McCain ’s middle name , Sidney .
And he should really hit the emphasis on Sidney — the stupid among us will hear vaguely feminine undertones ; the intelligent among us will see the absurdist joke .
Most of all , it will likely disarm Obama ’s critics and make them look silly .
Think you know a better way Obama can handle the issue ?
Let me hear it in the comments .
The magnetic field produced by the rails can be estimated by the Biot - Savart Law , which calculates the field of a current carrying long straight wire ; B = u 0 I /2 pir .
The plot on the right shows how the magnetic field around a wire rises linearly with current .
The wire in this case has a radius of 0.00635 m and its length is dimensionless .
Notice how one Tesla is not achieved until 35000 amperes flow through the wire : Producing a strong field in a straight wire requires vast amounts of current , and there are several more efficient ways to achieve these high field strength values without resorting to several tens of thousands of amperes .
Some of these methods are to be explored in another , future Railgun design .
The plot on the left illustrates how the magnetic field strength drops with distance between the rails and increases with decreasing rail width .
Both relationships are exponential .
Seeing as the acceleration is a product of the force created by the magnetic field strength acting on the mass of the armature , it can be seen that ideally , for the highest possible field strength a rail gun would have very thin rails , very close together ( not surprisingly , this translates into a large L ' value ) , running a very high current .
Unfortunately these two parameters limit the mass that can be launched , and also exacerbate the rail erosion problem , as thinner rails have less surface to dissipate the heat produced during firing .
Ultimately , as is the case with virtually every other engineering design , a practical Rail Gun design represents a compromise of several factors where rail life , muzzle velocity and payload mass are carefully balanced to meet the requirements of what is expected from the gun .
In my previous Railgun design I utilized two flat parallel rails facing with their broad sides ; this provided the greatest amount of surface area for the rail / projectile contact interface so as to minimize arcing and arc damage while at the same time maintaining the rails very close to one another , thus maximizing the magnetic field strength .
Other research rail designs include flat rails with narrow sides facing , square rails , round bores , multiple symmetrical rails , and others .
According to [ 5 ] the ideal rail geometry is plate like , with a Width / Height ratio of > 2 .
This provides a high L ' value , although as indicated by the Lorenz force calculation , a high inductance gradient is not required nor does it guarantee a successful design .
For this design I will attempt a square bore .
There is good evidence to its superiority to a round bore design [ ] , and , contrasting with the previous rectangular bore design I employed , the larger rail spacing will allow for a greater variety of projectiles to be tried ( at the cost of less magnetic force , however ) .
The repulsive force between the two rails of an electromagnetic accelerator can be approximated by [ 7 ]
K= -�( I2/16 π ) *( L/D )
�= Magnetic Permeability in Vs / Am ( 4 π * 10 - 7 ) H m - 1[ 8 ]
I= Current through rails in Amperes
L= Length of rails in meters
D= Distance between rails in meters Taking into account a rail length of 60 cm , rail separation of 1 cm and a peak current of 100 kA the maximum repulsive force between the rails becomes 15 KN .
This amounts to 3372 lbs .
The mean pressure on the rails is thus 238PSI .
Rail repulsive force becomes 10500lbs with the addition of a 500PSI injector .
This load is assumed to be shared equally by the 28 bolts holding the structure together , thus requiring the bolts to clamp a 374 pound force each .
By pre-tensioning the bolts to a pre determined torque it is possible to preload the entire structure to a force greater than the total repulsive force of the rails during firing , and in this way ensure that no rail deflection occurs , maintaining barrel integrity , seals , and ensuring continuous contact between the armature and the rails .
This does not , however , apply to plasma armatures ; as experience from the original RailGun demonstrated , the actual pressure inside the bore during a plasma armature firing will be vastly more than this ( enough some times to shatter the enclosure ) .
Peak pressures of over 55000PSI can be obtained with plasma armatures
The final design addressed the weak spot where the injector met the gun itself by eliminating it , making the entire gun a single 24 inch long barrel divided equally between the 12 " rails and a 12 " channel through which pneumatic acceleration takes place .
The rails themselves were milled from a large piece of copper , thus eliminating the need for any welding or brazing .
On these pictures the " ears " created by milling the rails in an " L " shape can be seen .
Also seen below , behind the bottom rail , is the garolite G - 11 " fake rail " where the projectile rides during the initial pneumatic acceleration stage .
Below the spot where power is fed into the gun can be seen more clearly .
This had to be milled very accurately since that is the point of highest plasma pressure in this particular design .
Material choices on this gun were as follows :
The enclosure is constructed of 1/2 " thick Garolite G9 , one of the strongest composites currently available .
G9 is both extremely strong , very stiff , non conductive and non magnetic .
The rail spacers are a 1/8 " thick strip of Garolite G11 laid over the G9 enclosure .
G11 has similar properties to G9 , however during tests [ ] it showed the lowest electrical ablation rate of any non ceramic tested .
The low ablation rate means the gun should be able to fire several shots before these need to be replaced .
Rails are oxygen free copper , 3/4 " wide , 1/8 " thick , 1ft long .
Bolts , nuts and washers are 18 - 8 Stainless Steel , the highest grade SS available .
Stainless was chosen because it is non magnetic ; a magnetizeable material around the rail will carry with it magnetization losses .
Ideally a small performance gain could be obtained by having non conductive bolts , but there are no such bolts available today which would be strong enough for this application .
A new crisis has exploded in Iraq after Turkish troops , supported by attack planes and Cobra helicopters , yesterday launched a major ground offensive into Iraqi Kurdistan .
The invading Turkish soldiers are in pursuit of Kurdish guerrillas hiding in the mountains .
They are seeking to destroy the camps of the PKK ( Kurdistan Workers ' Party ) along the border between Turkey and Iraqi Kurdistan .
" Thousands of troops have crossed the border and thousands more are waiting at the border to join them if necessary , " said a Turkish military source .
" There are severe clashes , " said Ahmed Danees , the head of foreign relations for the PKK .
" Two Turkish soldiers have been killed and eight wounded .
There are no PKK casualties . "
Turkish television said that the number of Turkish troops involved was between 3,000 and 10,000 , and they had moved 16 miles inside Iraq .

But the escalating Turkish attacks are destabilising the Kurdish region of Iraq which is the one peaceful part of the country and has visibly benefited from the US invasion .
The Iraqi Kurds are America 's closest allies in Iraq and the only Iraqi community to support fully the US occupation .
The president of the autonomous Kurdistan Regional Government , Massoud Barzani , said recently he felt let down by the failure of the Iraqi government in Baghdad to stop Turkish bombing raids on Iraqi territory .
The incursion is embarrassing for the US , which tried to avert it , because the American military provides intelligence to the Turkish armed forces about the location of the camps of Turkish Kurd fighters .
Immediately before the operation began , the Turkish Prime Minister , Tayyip Erdogan , called President George Bush to warn him .
The US and the Iraqi government are eager to play down the extent of the invasion .
Rear Admiral Gregory Smith , a US spokesman for Iraq , said : " We understand [ it ] is an operation of limited duration to specifically target PKK terrorists in that region . "
The Iraqi Foreign minister , Hoshyar Zebari , claimed that only a few hundred Turkish troops were in Iraq .
But since last year Turkey has succeeded , by making limited incursions into Kurdistan , in establishing a de facto right to intervene militarily in Kurdistan whenever it feels like it .
Many Iraqi Kurdish leaders are convinced that a hidden aim of the Turkish attack is to undermine the Kurdish region , which enjoys autonomous rights close to statehood .
Ankara has always seen the semi-independence of Iraqi Kurdistan , and the Kurds ' claim to the oil city of Kirkuk , as providing a dangerous example for Kurds in Turkey who are also demanding autonomy .
Many Turkish companies carrying out construction contracts in the region have already left .
And businesses that remain are frightened that Ankara will close Iraqi Kurdistan 's lifeline over the Harbour Bridge into Turkey .

During the 1990s the Turkish army carried out repeated attacks in Iraqi Kurdistan with the tacit permission of Saddam Hussein , but this is the first significant offensive since the US invasion of 2003 .
" A land operation is a whole new level , " said the US Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Matthew Bryza , adding that the incursion was " not the greatest news " .
The Turkish army is unlikely to do much damage to the PKK , which has some 2,500 fighters hidden in a mountainous area that has few roads , with snow drifts making tracks impassable .
The Turkish ground offensive was preceded by bombing .
" We were certain yesterday after this bombing that a military operation would take place and we got ready for it , " said Mr Danees , adding that bombing and artillery had destroyed three bridges on the Iraq - Turkish border as well as a PKK cemetery .
Another reason why Turkey has launched its offensive now has as much to do with Turkish internal politics as it does with any threat posed by the PKK .
The PKK launched a military struggle on behalf of the Kurdish minority in eastern Turkey in 1984 which lasted until the PKK's leader Abdullah Ocalan was seized in Kenya in 1999 and later put on trial in Turkey .
The PKK has been losing support ever since among the Turkish Kurds , but at the end of last year it escalated guerrilla attacks , killing some 40 Turkish soldiers .
Limited though the PKK 's military activity has been , the Turkish army has used it to bolster its waning political strength .
For its part , the mildly Islamic government of Mr Erdogan is frightened of being outflanked by jingoistic nationalists supporting the military .
Mr Erdogan has pointed out that previous Turkish army incursions into Kurdistan in the 1990s all failed to dislodge the PKK .
The area which the Turkish army has entered in Iraqi Kurdistan is mostly desolate , with broken terrain in which bands of guerrillas can take refuge .
The PKK says it has left its former bases and broken up into small units .
The main bases of the PKK are along Iraq 's border with Iran , notably in the Kandil mountains , to the south of where the Turkish troops entered .
At this time of year the villagers , many of them herders and shepherds , leave their houses and live in the towns in the plain below the mountains until the snow melts .

FRANK GIBNEY was old and sick and a little more than a month away from dying .
But he was filled with righteous anger , and he had some things to say .
He told his son , the documentary filmmaker Alex Gibney , to unplug a noisy oxygen machine and to grab a video camera .
The older Mr. Gibney , a journalist and scholar who died in April , had served as a naval interrogator in World War II .
In a moving statement that serves as a sort of coda to “ Taxi to the Dark Side , ” a new documentary about the Bush administration ’s interrogation policies in the post - 9/11 world , he said it had never occurred to him to use brutal techniques on the Japanese prisoners in his custody .
“ We had the sense that we were on the side of the good guys , ” Frank Gibney said , seething .
“ People would get decent treatment .
And there was the rule of law . ”
There would seem to be an enormous distance between the Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan , where the central events in “ Taxi to the Dark Side ” take place , and Enron ’s headquarters in Houston , where the machinations of white - collar criminals brought down the giant energy company and became the backdrop for Mr. Gibney ’s entertaining 2005 documentary , “ Enron : The Smartest Guys in the Room . ” But Mr. Gibney said the two projects have common themes .
Howard Wolfson , Hillary Clinton 's communications director , confirms :

We have had one of our best fundraising efforts ever on the web today and our Super Tuesday victories will only help in bringing more support for her candidacy . "
Also : Clinton is challenging her supporters to raise her 3 million in 3 days .

How Quickly We Forget : The Transience of Memory
This is the first in a new series on the 7 deadly sins of memory .
First up , how the passage of time affects our memories .
My memory continues to surprise me , and not usually in a good way .
I recently reread a book which I first read , and greatly enjoyed , about 13 years ago .
It is fiction by one of my favourite authors – the writing is vivid , the story exciting and the set - piece action breathtaking .
Despite all this I had almost no memory of reading the book the first time .
Almost everything about the book seems to have seeped away in the intervening years .
I could n’t remember the plot , most of the characters or any of the scenes .
The only thing I vaguely remembered was the main character ’s name , but I could n’t be sure I had n’t invented that memory , after all I could n’t recall anything else about the book .
This is an example of what Harvard psychologist Daniel L. Schacter calls the first deadly sin of memory : transience ( Schacter , 1999 ) .
Transience can be seen in both short - and long - term memory .
Short - term memory , for psychologists , means the things that are in your mind right now , and only those things .
On the other hand long - term memory is anything you store to be retrieved at a later time .
Studies have shown that both types of memory can be extremely fragile over their respective timescales .
Short - term memory : fast forgetting
A classic experiment on fast forgetting was carried out by Peterson and Peterson ( 1959 ) .
They asked participants to memorise a three - letter sequence , then count backwards in sets of threes .
Participants were then asked to try and recall the three - letter sequence after different lengths of time counting backwards .
Participants did surprisingly poorly on this test .
After only six seconds of counting backwards in threes , on average half of the original three letters had disappeared from memory .
By the time participants had been counting backwards for 12 seconds , less than 15 % of the original memory remained .
Finally after 18 seconds it was all but gone .
This experiment clearly shows how quickly information leaks out of short - term memory .
So perhaps the book I was reading just went straight in and straight out again ?
No doubt a lot of it did , but surely some of it must have stuck .
Otherwise I would n’t have been able to follow the story and would have ended up reading the first page again and again .
Long - term memory : slow forgetting
No , some aspects of the book must have become lodged in my long - term memory , so what types of processes affect how much we retain from long - term memory ?
In fact relatively little is known about how we forget over substantial periods of time .
Thirteen years is a long time for an experimenter to wait just to find out if I can remember the details of that book .
Nevertheless , studies do suggest that forgetting probably follows a power function .
That means we lose a lot of information soon after it goes in , then , over time , the rate of forgetting slows down .
Storage , retrieval and rehearsal
Of course not all memories are created equal , and so the reasons why we fail to recall information are many and varied .
Indeed , some psychologists have argued that we never really forget anything .
Perhaps , they say , the memory is still in our minds but we can no longer access it .
Cues are clearly important to retrieving memories .
The smell of varnish might remind us of the day we spent canoeing in the rain , lost in solitary thought .
Conversely some experiences can hinder the retrieval of certain memories .
The memory of a parent ’s anger at our childish misdemeanour might completely block out the memory of what we actually did .
Memory is certainly more likely to fade if we do n’t use it .
The retrieval and rehearsal of memories has been shown to enhance their storage .
Interestingly there ’s no actual evidence in humans that memories which remain unrehearsed or unretrieved actually do dissipate over time .
Perhaps all our memories really are still in there .
Gone , and forgotten
But even if my memory of reading that book the first time is still in there , it ’s doing a very good job of hiding .
Especially since rereading the book should be a massive cue to its recall .
Maybe we do completely forget or maybe I have just forgotten that I did n’t actually read the book in the first place .
Either way , perhaps I ’ll be able to enjoy the same book all over again in another 13 years !

Anorexia can be debilitating
Doctors at one of the country 's largest eating disorders treatment centres said they needed to act more responsibly .
The eating disorders charity , B - eat , said little progress had been made on combating " pro-ana " sites .
The networking sites said it was hard to distinguish between support groups and " pro-anorexia " groups .
But a spokesperson for MySpace said they were working with organisations such as B-eat .
Over 1.1 million Britons are known to suffer from an eating disorder .
The vast majority are women , although experts believe the numbers could actually be much higher as many cases go undiagnosed .
Social networking sites can censor their material and we expect them to act responsibly
Dr Ty Glover , consultant psychiatrist
Specialists and charities say the rise of the internet and new media has played a significant part in providing easier access to information on how to get thin .
Research has shown that young women exposed to pro-ana websites felt more negative , had lower self - esteem , perceived themselves as heavier and were more likely to compare their bodies with other women .
' Common theme '
Dr Ty Glover , consultant psychiatrist on the Eating Disorders Unit at Cheadle Royal Hospital , said it had proven difficult to shut down pro-ana websites , but the situation was slightly different for sites such as Facebook .
" Social networking sites can censor their material and we expect them to act responsibly , " he said .
Rather than censor these groups , we are working to create partnership
MySpace spokesperson
" We are horrified at the content of these sites and the tips they give on how to be thin .
" People with eating disorders are extremely vulnerable and often have very low self esteem , so pro-ana and pro-mia sites can be very damaging as they are sending out the wrong advice . "
It is thought there are more than 500 pro-ana and pro-mia internet sites .
Cheadle MP Mark Hunter has asked the government to promote awareness of the dangers of such websites .
" These websites are truly despicable and only help to reinforce the myth that having an eating disorder is n't a problem , " he said .
Susan Ringwood from B -eat , who are due to launch a report this week calling for better support for families of people with eating disorders , said the websites encouraged people to avoid treatment .
" We believe that the sites should act responsibly .
" They have acted to remove other content that is seen as ' dangerous ' , or could encourage young people to do dangerous things . "
She said they were not calling for such sites to be banned completely , but for greater awareness of the dangers and for more support online so the sites are not the " only refuge " .
But Shannon Bonnette , who is recovering from anorexia , told the BBC that looking at anorexia web pages actually helped her overcome the illness .
" What I found through visiting those site was that there was a common theme - everybody stays miserable , " she said .
A spokesperson for MySpace said : " It 's often very tricky to distinguish between support groups for users who are suffering from eating disorders and groups that might be termed as " pro " anorexia or bulimia .
" Rather than censor these groups , we are working to create partnerships with organisations like B-eat .
" We have also placed ads on pro-anorexia profiles for up to a year from the National Eating Disorder Association to target these groups with positive messaging about how and where they can get help . "
A spokesperson for Facebook said the site supported the free flow of information .
" Many Facebook groups relate to controversial topics ; this alone is not a reason to disable a group .
" In cases where content is reported and found to violate the site 's terms of use , Facebook will remove it . "
Read a selection of your comments on this story :
I recently realized that I suffer from anorexia , and have begun treatment .
My case is probably on the mild side , but even so I am astonished that anyone could want to be anorexic .
The dreadful constipation , the depression , the feeling of isolation - it 's miserable being anorexic , and dangerous to your health .
Most people do not realize how damaging anorexia is to the body .
If the social networking sites do not crack down on these pro-ana and pro-mia sites , they will be placing many girls and boys with poor self - esteem in harm 's way .
It could even lead to a lawsuit , and I 'm certain MySpace etc. would find that vastly inconvenient .

Pro-anorexia sites , like anything which advocates harmful lifestyles , should ideally be banned .
Unfortunately , this just drives them underground .
This makes it even more difficult for those caring for sufferers of eating disorders to understand what messages and signals are being sent .
What is important is that everyone should be aware of how sudden , death from starvation can occur , especially when it is combined with excessive exercise !!
Gyms should be aware that people with eating disorders will over - exercise in order to burn off more calories .
These people are then putting themselves in greater danger .
I speak from the experience of seeing my daughter do this .
No gym ever suggested to her that she was no longer fit enough to maintain her exercise regime , suggested a shorter time , or stopped her from using their facilities .
She did reduce her exercise when she began to recover , and , with more food put on some weight .
Unfortunately , after a few months she relapsed , and she died last year .
It is this fact that people should be made aware of .
Anorexia is not a fad to lose weight ; she wanted to eat , but could not bear to do so .

I found much on anorexia on MySpace when I did a search , those pages I looked at seemed to be well intentioned with good advice .
I can believe there are sites catering to the idea that anorexia is good though , just could not find them quickly .
What bothers me is not that these sites exist but that the people who should see them as an opportunity to learn how these people think and engage them at their own level in a non confrontational way ( anonymously even ) are so blinkered .
They may be otherwise intelligent people but they lack any kind of vision and apparent understanding how the Internet community works .
All they do is some quasi- scientific study and come to the conclusion such sites may reinforce anorexic behaviour .
Anyway , censor them and alienate them .
Genius idea .
Come one people .
Do some of that thinking out side the box .
David Reynolds , Plymouth UK
I am the senior administrator of an eating disorder message board , and whereas our forum is definitely on the pro-recovery side of the " debate " , it has to be said that websites do n't cause eating disorders .
Skinny celebs do n't cause eating disorders .
Eating disorders are almost always caused by severe childhood trauma either from abuse or severe emotional distress .
I for one would like to see the BBC actually produce a documentary that tackles the real issues , with real science instead of just blaming anorexia on " Posh Spice "
Tom , Hackettstown , NJ
I have never been diagnosed with an eating disorder , although like most teenagers I had a phase where I starved myself and purged when I did eat .
We live in a country of free speech and I do not think that pro-ed websites should be banned .
They cannot give people eating disorders , the person must already be well on their way .
Whilst agreeing that pro-ana / mia websites are not the best means of support , they can be useful in stopping the feelings of isolation that sufferers are likely to have .
Also it makes it easier to target those with eating disorders as a lot of them will be on pro-ed sites !
Rachel , London
To say one supports " the free flow of information " without first deciding whether the information is ethical or not , is not acceptable .
I have worked with anorexia patients who used the web to support their illness .
They " knew " that participating in these sites was self destructive , but like other addicts , they found it very difficult to resist the allure , and seeming support of these sites .
We need National and International bodies to search out and ban these sites .
Also I would suggest hefty fines for sites like Facebook who do n't do enough to keep there pages safe .
Their owners can well afford to insure ethical behaviour on their sites .
To see the suffering of anorexia close up is heart breaking , especially for the extended families .
We must do all we can to limit this deadly illness .

When I was in High School , my girlfriend had a serious eating disorder .
When I confronted her about it she would n't admit to it right away .
Eventually , we got through it together .
However , it was made a lot harder because her friends were doing it .
I think that girls are especially social creatures and will use sites that are pro-ana or pro-mia to justify / increase their disorders .
I know there is a lot of concern about censoring web material , but if facebook was around 6 - 7 years ago when I was dealing with it , I think it would have been even harder for her to overcome .
Christian , Wheaton , USA
Having just read this story , I decided to have a look at one of these sites .
I was shocked and sickened by it .
The people who run sites like this are going to be responsible for the needless deaths of many young people .
SW , York , UK
Although not a direct experience - I find it disheartening that an MP would say that " these websites are truly despicable " - Come on .
Generally the contributors to these websites are anorexics with low self image - the last thing they need is for some mis-informed MP to spout off about them being despicable !
Maybe the MP should control his messages - please !
Barry Hearne , Johannesburg South Africa
If we are considering anorexia ( and to some extent emotional overeating or obesity ) as a form of self - harm , then pro anorexia or pro obesity sites should equally be areas of concern and debate .
Each disorder has the potential to end life prematurely .
These web sites should come with some form of responsibility , and resources of contact for consumers to activate support .
Anorexia and obesity are both life threatening in their extreme and acute presentation .
Both have been related to a form of neurological or brain dysfunction .
Personal choice appears to play a smaller part to play in managing either anorexia or obesity according to research , although engagement and current easily accessible information is important .
These key websites can become more empowering and informative to send people inspiring anecdotes of recovery .
Pro anorexia is a very risky stance to promote is has very real consequences of mortality .
Parents would and should be very concerned .
Allied health has a responsibility to respond and join in the debate to activate change .

Imagine a world where , instead of leaping on the internet as a convenient scapegoat , we tackled the all - pervasive lies about what women should look like that are the real cause of anorexia .
No , I did n't think you would .

Hopefully , everyone can now see the McCain strategy for running against Barack Obama .
Yes , we have some general points on taxes , culture wars and McCain as war hero who can protect us in ways that flash - in - the - pan pretty boy Barack Obama can’t .
But that ’s not the core .
The core is to drill a handful of key adjectives into the public mind about Barack Obama : Muslim , anti-American , BLACK , terrorist , Arab .
Maybe a little hustler and shifty thrown in , but we ’ll have to see .
The details and specific arguments are sort of beside the point .
They ’re like the libretto in a Wagner opera , nice for some narrative structure .
But it ’s the score that ’s the real essence of it , the point of the whole exercise .
Now , a good deal has been made out of John McCain ’s repudiation of talk radio yakmeister Bill Cunningham , who led off for McCain at one of his rallies with the full run of Obama sludge .
But do n’t be distracted or fooled .
This is more like an example of what the digital commerce folks refer to as ‘ channel conflict ’ .
You ’ve got your multiple distribution channels .
You ’ve got the way McCain ’s selling the product .
Broadcast .
Broad and thematic about McCain .
But you ’ve got a number of other product channels to sell through , most of them a lot grittier , but no less essential for ultimate success .
Both can work simultaneously .
In fact , in the kind of campaign McCain ’s running , they ’re both essential for success ( see the 2000 Republican presidential primary in South Carolina ) .
The key is just that the channels do n’t cross .
Because that ’s when the trouble starts and they can begin to undermine or even short - circuit each other .
And that ’s what threatened to happened here .
Do n’t insult your intelligence or mine by pretending that John McCain ’s plan for this race does n’t rely on hundreds of Cunninghams — large and small — across the country , and the RNC and all the GOP third party groups , to be peddling this stuff nonstop for the next eight months because it ’s the only way John McCain have a real shot at contesting this race .
If McCain really wants to repudiate this stuff , he can start with the Tennessee Republican party which dished all the slurs and smears about Obama being a Nation of Islam - loving anti-Semite , just today .
And once he ’s done talking to the people who will be running his Tennessee campaign , we ’ll have a number of others he can talk to , like the head of his Ohio campaign , former Sen .
Mike DeWine , who gave that Cunningham guy his marching orders .
Let ’s just not fool ourselves , not lie to ourselves about what ’s happening here and who ’s in charge .
Late Update : A few insightful readers have noted that Wagner is perhaps not the best illustration of my libretto to score metaphor since Wagner is one of the few major composers —
I ’m actually not sure there are any others — to write his own libretti .
Perhaps my blind spot is a product of my listening to Wagner without knowing German .
In any case , I think my general point remains valid .
Perhaps I should have picked on Verdi .
But for me nothing — nothing in opera at least — compares to Wagner .
Amazon Web Services was struck by a temporary outage today , dragging the thousands of web sites which rely on its hosted storage down with it .
Reports of content stored on Amazon 's Simple Storage Service ( S3 ) being unavailable or performing poorly began appearing around 5 AM PST .
Hardest hit by the outage was the crowd of " web 2.0 " startups that lean on hosted storage to keep costs down , such as the messaging service Twitter .
But even the New York Times , which uses S3 to store articles from its historical archives , was spitting out internal server error messages .
Amazon has a pretty good track record in keeping its hosting services running .
It 's had some growing pains in the past , but this is the service 's first major outage .
Service was restored a few hours later at 7:17 AM PST according to an Amazon technician .
" My business is effectively closed right now because Amazon did something wrong .
I 'll have to reconsider using the service now , " wrote one customer on Amazon 's web developer forum .
" This is the first outage I have experienced since I joined the service nearly a year ago .
Yes it sucks , yes I hope they get it fixed very soon ... but , the sky is not in fact falling at the moment , " wrote another .
One likely outcome from Amazon 's slip - up is some additional transparency in reporting future errors .
S3 technicians were slow to confirm the problem and did n't provide any status updates to its customers .
It took one hour to verify the outage from the first complaint on their developer board , and the S3 rep did n't post again until they resolved the issue .
" What really annoys me is the lack of an official explanation from Amazon ( as usual ) , " posted one user .
" A health monitor would be useful - something to show what Amazon thinks the status of the services are and to post official information , " wrote another .
Amazon said later that one of its three data centers for S3 was unreachable , beginning at 4:31 AM PST .
It was back to " near normal " performance at 6:48 AM PST .
" Though we 're proud of our uptime track record over the past two years with this service , any amount of downtime is unacceptable and we wo n't be satisfied until it 's perfect , " an Amazon rep posted .
An ultimately undeliverable " perfect " record may be the wrong message to be sending out .
Maybe Amazon should start with convincing its users it 'll do a better job than if they set up storage themselves . ®
The regulations that govern the Army ’s relations with the Arroyo Center , the division of RAND that does research for the Army , stipulate that Army officials are to review reports in a timely fashion to ensure that classified information is not released .
But the rules also note that the officials are not to “ censor ” analysis or prevent the dissemination of material critical of the Army .
The report on rebuilding Iraq was part of a seven - volume series by RAND on the lessons learned from the war .
Asked why the report has not been published , Timothy Muchmore , a civilian Army official , said it had ventured too far from issues that directly involve the Army .
“ After carefully reviewing the findings and recommendations of the thorough RAND assessment , the Army determined that the analysts had in some cases taken a broader perspective on the early planning and operational phases of Operation Iraqi Freedom than desired or chartered by the Army , ” Mr. Muchmore said in a statement .
“ Some of the RAND findings and recommendations were determined to be outside the purview of the Army and therefore of limited value in informing Army policies , programs and priorities . ”
Warren Robak , a RAND spokesman , declined to talk about the contents of the study but said the organization favored publication as a matter of general policy .
“ RAND always endeavors to publish as much of our research as possible , in either unclassified form or in classified form for those with the proper security clearances , ” Mr. Robak said in a statement .
" The multivolume series on lessons learned from Operation Iraqi Freedom is no exception .
We also , however , have a longstanding practice of not discussing work that has not yet been published . "
When RAND researchers began their work , nobody expected it to become a bone of contention with the Army .
The idea was to review the lessons learned from the war , as RAND had done with previous conflicts .
The research was formally sponsored by Lt. Gen. James Lovelace , who was then the chief operations officer for the Army and now oversees Army forces in the Middle East , and Lt. Gen.
David Melcher , who had responsibility for the Army ’s development and works now on budget issues .

Today , in the world of financial celebrity , anyone who is anyone is a billionaire .
By the same token , millions upon millions of people are or soon will be mere , everyday millionaires in the United States .
Millionaires are on the way to becoming a dime a dozen .
Similarly , new cars cost what new homes did only a few decades ago .
Men 's neckties often sell nowadays for as much as men's suits did not so very long ago .
To have a pair of soles and heels put on a pair of shoes today costs as much as a new pair of shoes did not too many years ago .
All of this is the result of continuous inflation of the money supply by the Federal Reserve System .
As a result of the " Fed 's " actions , tens and hundreds of billions of new and additional dollars have poured into the economic system , correspondingly increasing spending and driving up prices .
There are more and more billionaires and millionaires and shockingly high - priced goods simply because of the flood of new and additional money coming from the Fed .
It 's not such things as " oil shocks " or diverting food crops to fuel production that 's responsible .
Without the flood of new and additional money , increases in the price of oil and farm products would be accompanied by decreases in the price of practically everything else .
This is because practically all of whatever additional money was spent in buying oil et al .
would have to be taken away from spending elsewhere , since the overall total ability to spend in the economic system would be limited by a limited quantity of money .
And the rise in the price of oil and farm products would also not be nearly as great as it has been .
To confirm the fact that the source of today 's high and rising prices lies in the rapid increase in the supply of paper currency and checkbook money , it 's helpful to calculate prices in terms of the currency sanctified by the US Constitution , namely , the gold dollar .
A gold dollar contains approximately one - twentieth of an ounce of gold .
Today an ounce of gold sells for more than $ 800 ( it 's actually $ 907 at present ) .
That means that one gold dollar has the value of more than $ 40 paper dollars , because one - twentieth of $ 800 is $ 40 .
The result is that the price of everything stated in gold dollars is currently one - fortieth , or less , of its price in paper dollars .
Thus , a $ 1 million home is $ 25,000 in gold dollars .
A $ 50,000 automobile is $ 1,250 in gold dollars , and so on .
The rise in prices is the result of the fact that we express prices in paper money , whose supply can be increased virtually without limit and without cost .
Prices can never rise to anywhere near the same extent when stated in gold .
That 's because gold is rare in nature and costly to extract .
Today , we have a credit crisis emanating from the collapse of the real estate bubble that the Fed launched in order to cope with the effects of the collapse of the stock market bubble that it had launched only a few years earlier .
Now , in order to cope with the effects of the collapse of the real estate bubble , the government and the Fed are looking for yet another program of monetary " stimulus . "
This time it's to be in the form of cutting taxes while financing an undiminished , indeed , an increased amount of government spending by means of the creation of still more new and additional money .
The Fed and the rest of the government seem to think that their job is always to be sure that the stock market averages and the price of homes is never to be allowed to fall too far below their most recent peaks , and to flood the economy with as much new and additional money as may be required to accomplish this .
Keeping up housing prices is an especially remarkable goal , inasmuch as only a year or two ago , all of the complaining was about how far housing prices had climbed relative to the ability of people to afford them .
One would think that a sharp reduction in home prices is the very thing needed to solve that problem and that the process needs to go a good deal further than it has , in order to do so .
For the present and the foreseeable future , there is probably nothing that will stop the Fed from continuing with its inflation .
Leading pressure groups are ardently in favor of it : tens of millions of share owners want it ; the great majority of businessmen large and small want it ; bankers and brokers want it ; homeowners want it ; labor unions want it ; the political establishment wants it .
If there is another terrorist attack , let alone another war , inflation will be used to pay much of the cost .
To the extent that the environmentalist agenda of declining energy production is imposed , inflation will be used to finance subsidies to the growing numbers of Americans who will be impoverished by it .
Their expenditure of those subsidies will drive up prices for everyone else and cause further impoverishment and the need for more subsidization and for still more inflation to pay for it .
In the face of such prospects , people around the world who have been willing to hold dollars because dollars were superior to their own , more rapidly inflating currencies , will lose their desire to hold dollars .
They 're already losing that desire .
The world 's supply of dollars will sooner or later reside exclusively in the United States .
Indeed , the reflux of dollars appears to have already begun .
The dollar has begun the kind of slide taken in the past by such currencies as the Italian lira .
In the 1930s , one lira was worth 20 cents .
Twenty cents in that era had a buying power equal to several of today 's dollars .
Before the lira was replaced by the euro , its value was less one - twentieth of one US cent .
A few days ' food and lodging at an undistinguished hotel cost more than a million liras .
The fall of the lira took place in essentially the same way that the dollar is falling today — through the reckless increase in its quantity in response to widely held beliefs in the necessity of such increase .
Is there anything that can be done to stop the potential destruction of the real value of all dollar - denominated savings and long - term contracts by a flood of inflation ?
Is there anything that can protect people from a possible tsunami of inflation in the United States ?
There is something that could be done .
There is a financial life raft , as it were , that could be made available to everyone , that would enable people to salvage at least some significant portion of the real value of their savings and contracts denominated in fixed sums of dollars .
It is something much more urgently needed , aimed at a much more realistic danger , and much more feasible than efforts to control global warming , say .
What is it ?
It is the enactment of a creditors ' protection bill , whose essential provisions would be the insertion into all outstanding contracts of a limited , contingent gold clause , and the removal of all legal obstacles to the inclusion of such clauses in all future contracts .
Here 's an example of how it would work .
Imagine someone who owns $ 1 million of corporate bonds that he bought several years earlier and that are scheduled to be redeemed in another 25 years .
Perhaps 25 percent of this sum , i.e. , $ 250,000 , would be designated as representing the quantity of gold that the owner of the bonds could choose to receive when the bonds came due , instead of the $ 1 million he is presently entitled to receive at that time .
The actual quantity of gold he would be entitled to receive would be the amount that $ 250,000 could buy at the price of gold prevailing on some specified date within 12 months prior to the enactment of the law .
If that price of gold were $ 1,000 per ounce , say , then the $ 1 million dollar contract would contain a contingent liability calling for the payment of 250 ounces of gold .
This payment would be at the creditor 's option .
The creditor would have the right to choose to be paid 250 ounces of gold rather than $ 1 million dollars .
Obviously , no creditor would exercise this option if the price of gold remained at $ 1,000 per ounce , let alone if it fell below $ 1,000 per ounce .
He would not exercise it if the price of gold rose to $ 2,000 per ounce .
Nor would he do so if it rose to $ 3,000 per ounce .
But when and if the price of gold exceeded $ 4,000 per ounce , then it would be to the advantage of the creditor to choose to be paid 250 ounces of gold , or the sum of dollars then necessary to buy 250 ounces of gold , for at that point 250 ounces of gold would represent more than $ 1 million .
If gold reached , say , $ 5,000 per ounce , the 250 ounces of gold that the creditor was entitled to would be worth $ 1,250,000 , i.e. , $ 250,000 more than the million he had lent .
This would not represent any real gain to the creditor , however , if over the same period of time , prices in general had also increased by a factor of 5 .
In that case , the actual buying power of the 250 ounces of gold would be no greater than it had been when the price of gold was $ 1,000 per ounce and prices in general were where they were at that time .
But even in this case , the creditor would not be quite as badly off as he would have been without the protection afforded by the 25 percent gold clause .
For in its absence , he would have been repaid merely his original $ 1 million , that now had a buying power only one - fifth as great as it was originally .
With this gold clause and his consequent receipt of $ 1,250,000 , the buying power he receives is one - fourth as great as the sum he lent .
The difference between a fourth and a fifth is , of course , not very great .
It would amount to our creditor incurring a loss in buying power of 75 percent rather than 80 percent , which is not an outcome to be particularly happy about .
But the odds are great that the protection afforded by such a gold clause would be equal to more than 25 percent of the real value of the sum originally due the creditor .
This is because if prices were to start rising rapidly , the price of gold would almost certainly rise even more rapidly .
Thus , for example , if prices in general were to rise on the order of 5 times over the course of a decade or two , say , the price of gold might very well rise by 10 or even 20 times .
In that case , the 250 ounces of gold that the creditor would have the option of choosing , would be worth $ 2.5 million or even $ 5 million .
In the face of a fivefold rise in prices , these sums would have the buying power of 50 percent or even 100 percent of the real value of the sum originally due the creditor .
What would serve to make the price of gold rise faster than prices in general is that in periods of rapid inflation , and in the absence of any reliable alternative paper currency , such as the dollar once appeared to be , gold is the ideal inflation hedge for most people .
Even though its ownership entails some costs of storage and safekeeping , those costs are very modest .
At the same time , incurring them represents a far lesser loss than does practically all the usual forms of investment in a period of rapid inflation , including ownership of common stocks and family businesses .
In these cases , capital gains taxes and income taxes consume funds needed for replacement at higher prices .
As a result , a growing demand for gold as an inflation hedge appears , which operates on the price of gold alongside of and in addition to the forces operating to raise prices in general .
In addition , the price of gold could be increased by the desire for accumulations of gold on the part of those who had agreed to accept contingent liabilities in gold .
A potential consequence of a system of such partial gold clauses could well be the development of substantial opposition to rapid inflation on the part of debtors , however paradoxical that may sound .
This is because once the number of dollars payable under gold clauses started to exceed the number of dollars originally owed , debtors would be in a position in which further inflation served to increase their burden of debt rather than decrease it .
Gold prices rising more rapidly than prices in general would mean that debtors would be in a position in which the additional inflated money they took in could not keep pace with the additional money they owed .
They would do better to take in less additional inflated money and not be confronted with debt obligations rising even more rapidly .
( This seemingly paradoxical effect of inflation under a system of gold clauses is a matter I discuss more fully in Capitalism . )
Enactment of a creditors ' protection bill along the lines I have described should be an essential part of the near - term political agenda of all defenders of economic freedom .
It would offer a potentially valuable two - fold protection against the ravages of inflation .
First , it could provide substantial protection to the real value of the assets of individuals .
Second , it also might also ultimately turn debtors , who typically have a vested interest in inflation , into opponents of inflation , once they came to be faced with debts payable in gold , which would become harder to repay as inflation reduced the ability of paper money to serve as the means of repayment .
The insertion of a gold clause into existing contracts should by no means be regarded as any kind of new and additional government interference with the freedom of contract .
To the contrary , it would be a major step in undoing such interference .
Prior to their abrogation by the New Deal in 1933 , full , 100 - percent gold clauses were the norm in the United States in long - term debt contracts , and had been since the Civil War .
They are something that comes about on the foundation of the rational self - interest of individuals when it is allowed to operate free of government interference .
Obviously , the degree of gold - clause protection would not by any means necessarily have to be the 25 percentage points that I have chosen for purposes of illustration .
If a mere 5 or 10 percent protection could be enacted into law , it would be a major first step , simply by introducing the concept of gold clauses to the present generation .
And , of course , it would still afford some actual measure of protection against the possible ravages of inflation .
The parties entering into new contracts should be free to include whatever degree of gold - clause protection is mutually agreeable .
What presently stops such contracts from being made are considerations both of their enforceability in the courts and their likely treatment for purposes of taxation .
As just mentioned , such contracts were abrogated on a mass scale in 1933 and the Supreme Court did nothing to uphold them .
To be accepted with any degree of confidence , the enforceability of new , partial gold - clause contracts would have to have the benefit at the very least of a joint resolution of Congress directing the courts to uphold them .
The gold - clause contracts would have to be exempt from any possible application of usury statutes .
Such statutes might come into play when creditors ended up being repaid sums of depreciated paper dollars that were greatly in excess of the sums originally lent — e.g. , being repaid $ 2.5 million paper dollars when one had originally lent $ 1 million paper dollars .
The contracts would have to be interpreted in terms simply of being repaid a fixed amount of gold principal — e.g. , the 250 ounces of gold in the example above — irrespective of any increase in the price of gold .
Treatment of the gold - clause contracts in this way would preclude the payment of taxes on any paper money gains reflecting merely the repayment of larger sums of paper to maintain parity with the same physical amount of gold .
Thus , for example , the $ 1.5 million paper gain in the repayment of $ 2.5 million on a $ 1 million loan would not be subject to any kind of income or capital - gains taxation .
The applicable principle would be that the lender has merely received the same physical quantity of gold that he was always entitled to .
He has no gain whatever in terms of gold .
In effect , he has lent a sum of gold and has been repaid that sum , nothing more .
Thus , he has no gold income or gold capital gain .
Gold - clause contracts would almost certainly become very widespread if the market could take for granted their enforceability and exemption from taxation based merely on the rise in the price of gold .
As a matter of principle , the parties entering into new contracts should be legally free to agree to whatever degree of gold - clause protection they wished , all the way to 100 percent .
Nevertheless , little actual harm would likely be done , if for a short time legal limits were imposed on the percentage of the value of new contracts that could enjoy gold - clause protection .
Such a limitation would probably make the enactment of gold - clause protection politically more acceptable in the beginning , since it would be an incremental change and thus not appear too radical .
Even with such a restriction , the gain simply from enacting the principle of gold - clause protection would be profound , not to mention the substantive protection likely afforded to creditors .
However , even in the absence of any legal limitation , for some period of time it would almost certainly be highly advisable in most cases for the contracting parties to agree to fairly modest partial gold clauses rather than full , 100 percent gold clauses .
This is because partial gold - clause protection is what will be necessary in order not only to give creditors an important measure of the protection they need , but also to avoid the development of widespread bankruptcies on the part of debtors .
The threat of debtors going bankrupt arises because continuing inflation is likely to drive the real value of gold far higher than it is today and at the same time greatly reduce the ability of earnings in paper money to pay debts stated in gold .
As a result , entering into 100 - or even 50 - percent gold - clause contracts today , at today 's price and real buying power of gold , would be an extremely risky proposition for debtors , one likely to result in their owing amounts of gold they simply could not pay .
Avoiding near - term widespread bankruptcies in gold is essential to gaining public support for gold 's once again serving to protect the real value of contracts on a large scale .
Hopefully , education about the risks of owing too much gold would serve to prevent bankruptcies in gold from being too frequent .
Partial gold - clause protection is what would follow from such education and accomplish its objective .
The implication here is that the degree of gold - clause protection in contracts should increase only as the risk of further increases in the real value of gold in the economic system relative to that of paper - money declines .
Gold clauses , of course , would protect not only lenders , but also people dependent on pensions or annuities or who would be the beneficiaries of such retirement vehicles in the future .
They would also protect the grantors of long - term leases of all kinds .
The widespread establishment of partial gold clauses is an essential step in the protection of the buying power of creditors .
It would also be a major step on the path toward the establishment of sound money .
Of course , it is possible that the Fed will pull back from its increasingly inflationary course and reverse field as it did in the early 1980s .
In that case , gold - clause contracts will simply have a status comparable to fire insurance for people whose homes do not suffer fire damage greater than their deductible .
They will serve simply as a form of insurance policy .
One that , unfortunately , looks like it is increasingly needed .

Sam Penrod reportingSome college students in Utah County are calling some music videos pornographic , and they are trying to get a health club to take them off its screen .
The controversy involves two Gold 's Gym locations in Utah County frequented by BYU and UVSC students .
Five organizations are banding together to keep the videos from being shown at the gyms .
The organizations that fight pornography in the community are upset with the videos at the gym and say they have collected nearly 1,000 signatures on a petition calling on Gold 's Gym to quit showing the videos .
Gold 's Gym officials here in Utah agreed to hear their concerns this afternoon , as the students prepared to protest .
The Gold 's Gym near the BYU campus is one of 19 Gold 's Gyms in Utah .
A majority of this gym 's customers are BYU students .
Dallen Johnson says , " I 've had to leave , honestly !
There have been four times I 've run out of the cardio cinema because of racy and inappropriate things being shown , things I personally view as pornography . "
The students have documented five music videos played on the Gold 's Gym music video network which they call objectionable .
Jesse Yaffe says , " Once you are a member here , you basically do n't have the choice anymore .
You 're forced to watch indecent material because it seems everywhere you go there 's a TV .
They 've got the Gold 's Gym membership network , and certain videos they play are extremely indecent , and some are outright pornography . "
The protesters say Gold 's Gym is not the only business they are concerned about .
" The things I see the most is people have no idea how it affects people and how widespread it is and how serious of an issue it is , " says Nicole Braden .
Managers at Gold 's Gym told Eyewitness
News today they use Gold 's TV network instead of cable channels like MTV to offer more conservative videos but can't control individual videos that are shown .
They say cardio machines have individual monitors which allow gym members to watch any channel they want .
Gold 's says music helps to energize people who are there to exercise and say they do n't want anyone to be offended at the gym during their workout experience .
The students gave Gold 's 10 days to remedy their concerns before they start picketing the health club .
They outlined four specific issues they 'd like resolved :
No rated R movies or sexually explicit or racy PG - 13 movies .
Change the content of Gold 's Broadcasting Network or do n't show the Network .
Keep external TV's on decent and clean stations , or let members choose the channels themselves .
Install blinds on the aerobics room to block the dancing , which is very provocative .

Advocates of network neutrality frequently express concerns that Internet Service Providers ( ISPs ) will use sophisticated network filtering technologies that facilitate Deep Packet Inspection to track and modify the content of web pages as they are being served to end users .
The ability to modify Internet content at the network level could potentially be abused by ISPs to insert additional advertising into web pages or perform selective , automated censorship .
Although no mainstream ISP in North America engages in such practices , proponents of network neutrality have discovered that Rogers — a Canadian cable Internet provider — is trialing similar technology to inject notices to subscribers in regular web content , leading some to fear that more abusive content manipulation may occur in the future .
Lauren Weinstein , the co-founder of a net neutrality advocacy group called People for Internet Responsibility ( PFIR ) , has published an example of one of the notices that Rogers has begun embedding in web pages .
The notice informs users when they are close to reaching their monthly bandwidth cap .
According to Weinstein , Rogers is using software created by in - browser marketing firm PerfTech , which can easily be used for more odious endeavors .
Rogers uses the software to modify web pages as they are being transmitted , adding JavaScript code that causes the notice to display .
" While Rogers ' current planned use for this Deep Packet Inspection ( DPI ) and modification system ( reportedly manufactured by ' In - Browser Marketing ' firm ' PerfTech ' ) is for account status messages , it 's obvious that commercial ISP content and ads ( beyond the ISP logos already displayed ) would be trivial to introduce through this mechanism , " wrote Weinstein .
The screenshot that Weinstein uses to demonstrate the feature is a Google web page , but the notices will appear on any page that the user visits until they either click a link in the message acknowledging that they have seen it or click a link opting out of seeing future subscriber notices embedded in content .
We asked Rogers for additional information about the subscriber notification system and other potential instances of content manipulation .
Rogers confirmed that the notices are being added to pages , but denies plans to engage in more extensive content manipulation .
" Rogers has had bandwidth limits on its various tiers of service for several years we are looking at ways to notify customers when he / she hits the 75 % mark of that limit , " Rogers communications VP Taanta Gupta told Ars .
" We do not interfere with the content of the search ( it could easily have been a Rogers yahoo search or any web site visit so is certainly not specific to any search engine or web site ) .
This is a trial to make it easier for our customers to keep track of usage .
There is no deep package inspection and there is no privacy issue . "
Despite the fact that the message is exclusively a notice to subscribers about the service rather than commercial content , some proponents of network neutrality believe that third - party modification of web content — particularly at the ISP - level — fundamentally changes the nature of the Internet in detrimental ways .
" Will Web service providers such as Google and many others , who have spent vast resources in both talent and treasure creating and maintaining their services ' appearances and quality , be willing to stand still while any ISP intercepts and modifies their traffic in such a manner ? "
Weinstein asks , referring to a screenshot of a Rogers subscription information notice plastered onto the top of a Google page .
" Google did n't give this ISP any such permission .
The ISP simply decided to modify Google on their own . "
Although embedding subscription notices in web pages is n't exactly malicious behavior , the use of this practice by Rogers adds credibility to some of the concerns voiced by network neutrality advocates .
Rogers already engages in several questionable practices , like impeding the usage of peer - to - peer traffic on its network .
At this stage in the network neutrality debate , when lawmakers and consumers are becoming more aware of the issues at stake , it seems particularly foolish for an ISP to do something that contributes to the credibility of those arguing for stricter regulation .
Cable providers appear to be a particularly audacious bunch .
Comcast 's questionable activities , for instance , are also inviting a regulatory smackdown .
The 2008 elections may not have been as animated as the 2016 ones , but they did have their fair share of scandals , one example being the Granny Warriors ’ campaign .
The fact that the small town of Sutton , New Hampshire did not grant the other candidate , Ron Paul , any votes due to human error , led to a ChipIn campaign backed by Republican candidate Albert Howard and the “ Granny Warriors ” Ron Paul support group .
The voter fraud in Sutton came to light after entire families claimed to have voted for Ron Paul in that city , despite the candidate being given 0 votes .
This led to the most vocal and dedicated group of Ron Paul supporters , the “ Granny Warriors ” , creating a ChipIn crowdfunding campaign , with the money intended to go towards a primary vote recount .
According to certain Ron Paul forums , the Granny Warriors were so dedicated to meet their goal that they were travelling throughout the country in an RV in order to ask people for donations .
The defunct Granny Warriors Recount site had the following message displayed :
“ With all the strange events going on in the primary and with solid statements of actual fraud in NH everyone is calling for a recount which should be take care of by the Campaign staff but that is n’t going to happen it seems .
Therefore … we the Grassroots will fund our own recount for Dr. Paul .
Every cent will be put toward the recounting and we will just see if we can stir up enough attention to really get a good count now .
Perhaps it will also give notice to other states not to mess with the counts .
Lets get this done before it is too late and facts and figures can be altered . ”
This crowdfunding campaign came after Ron Paul had already raised 6 million dollars in 24 hours for his campaign , using online donations , marking the most successful online crowdfunding campaign at the time .
The monetary goal of the Granny Warriors Recount campaign was to get 65000 dollars , promising that every single cent would go into making sure that a primary vote recount would take place .
However , as ambitious as the campaign was , it did not have a happy ending .
Ron Paul supporters managed to pool up over 55000 dollars , being only 10000 dollars short of their goal with one day remaining .
To everyone ’s surprise , that ’s where the donations stopped abruptly , not one additional dollar coming .
The reason for the sudden freeze ?
PayPal had mysteriously frozen the account , possibly because of the sudden influx of money coming into it .
Unfortunately for the Granny Warriors , the issue was not resolved on time , and the crowdfunding campaign ended unsuccessfully , therefore meaning that no primary recount took place .

Olbermann not amused by Rove 's quip about 9/11 David Edwards and Nick Juliano
Published : Friday February 22 , 2008
|
Print This Email This Former White House adviser Karl Rove received an ignominious superlative Thursday night after a speech this week in which he mused that the 9/11 terrorist attacks were delivered by history .
He was given the familiar distinction as " Worst Person in the World " on Keith Olbermann 's MSNBC show .
" Defending the Iraq war as an opportunity to prove the U.S. would not hesitate to defend itself against Islamic extremist , even the wrong ones , [ Rove said ] quote , ' History has a funny way of deciding things .
...
Sometimes history sends you things and 9/11 came our way , ' " Olbermann said on Thursday night 's episode of Countdown .
" History has a funny way of deciding things -- 9/11 .
Real funny , Karl .
Karl Rove , todays ' Worst Person in the World . ' "
Rove spoke to a crowd of 1,200 at the University of Pennsylvania Wednesday evening .
University officials would not reveal how much he was paid for the speech .
The former adviser to President Bush defended the Iraq war and proffered quotes from Democrats who believed Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction before the invasion .
The country goes to war " not for the purpose of conquest but for the purpose of freedom , " he said , according to the student newspaper , which did not report his 9/11 comment .
Those comments were noted by The Bulletin , another Philadelphia paper .
It reported the exchange as follows . [... ] .
On Iraq especially , the political strategist found it behooved him to underscore the unique circumstances under which the decision to go to war was made .
" History has a funny way of deciding things , " he said .
" Sometimes history sends you things , and 9/11 came our way . "
Americans should not forget , he counseled , that every act of war sends a poignant political message and that any statement the U.S. could send by reluctance to fight Islamic extremists abroad will be taken as a sign of diminished will .[...]

It ’s been a busy week for me here in Tokyo …
After all too many years of living in foreigner guest houses , I decided that it was finally time to get a real Japanese apartment .
Now , I know you ’re probably thinking that this is a completely normal and respectable proposition .
However , I can assure you that moving shop in Tokyo is anything but easy .
What exactly is involved in renting a real apartment in Tokyo ?
Good question !
For starters , Japanese use the phrase hikoshi - bimbo to describe someone who recently moved into a new apartment .
Literally translating as ‘ moving poor , ’ hikoshi - bimbo describes the state of having to fork over six months ’ salary for the privelege of renting a new apartment .
That ’s right folks – it costs an average of six months ’ salary to rent an apartment , not including purchases of furniture , bedding , appliances and other “ luxury items . ”
Believe it or not , Japan still has a number of feudal laws on the books aimed at maintaining the gap between rich and poor .
Essentially , this means that you need a serious amount of cash on hand before you can even step foot into the realtor ’s office .
Confused ?
So was I , though hopefully this post will help clear things up a bit .
My new apa rtment is a 2LDK , which means that it has two bedrooms , one bathroom and an all - purpose living room / dining room / kitchen .
It is located in a high class part of Tokyo , though the rent is affordable since the building is fairly old .
Rent for one month is 170,000 yen ( US $ 1500 ) , which is n’t that terrible considering that I ’m sharing the place with a good friend .
However , before being handed the keys , we had to pay considerably more than this amount – in cash .
As a rule , all new renters also have to pay two month ’s rent in advance , which is somewhat reasonable considering the percentage of defaulters in Japan .
On top of that , all new renters have to give another two month ’s rent as a security deposit , which is refundable assuming there is no damage to the apartment .
Here is where things start to get a bit shocking …
On top of that , all new renters also have to give another two month ’s rent as a gift to the landlord , which is not refundable under any circumstances .
This money , which is known as reikin ( 礼金 ; key money ) in Japanese , is a huge blow to the wallet .
On top of that , all new renters also have to give another month ’s rent as a finder ’s fee to the realtor , which is also not refundable under any circumstances .
This money is considered to be a small price to pay given the competiveness of the Japanese real estate market .
To summarize , this means that my somewhat affordable apartment required an initial down payment of a whopping 1,190,000 yen or approximately US $ 10,000 in cash .
With that said , my apartment is amazing , especially if you ’re a fan of traditional Japanese architecture .
Although I ’m certainly going to be hikoshi - bimbo for a little while , at least I ’m doing it in style .
( If you do n’t believe me , check out the pictures of my swinging pad ! )
Two polar bears , Vera and Vilma , gave birth a few weeks ago .
The zookeepers had decided not to disturb the cubs , even if the mothers rejected them .
Vilma scratched her feed box on Monday , " appearing nervous , well - fed , obviously not hungry , " a zookeeper was quoted as saying .
No cubs could be seen or heard .
So as not to disturb the cubs , the zoo did not check how many were born .
Zoo director Dag Encke said that Vilma 's cubs - believed to be a pair - may have been ill and that in such cases polar bears often eat their young .
Vera was spotted briefly with one of her cubs
Vera , meanwhile , has appeared briefly with one of her cubs .
Mr Encke 's deputy Helmut Maegdefrau said the cub appeared " in perfect shape " .
The zoo has said it wants to avoid any repetition of " Knut mania " , a popular craze triggered by a hand - reared bear cub at Berlin Zoo last year .
Knut was rejected by its mother , but Berlin Zoo decided to hand - rear it - a move which proved enormously popular .
But Mr Maegdefrau , quoted by the German news website Focus , said " we should have faith in nature and accept that sometimes with new mothers things just do n't work out .
" If we were to go in , we would disturb them and make it more likely that something goes wrong , " he added .
Berlin Zoo said it disagreed with the Nuremberg zoo staff 's decision .
Since they started hand - rearing Knut , he has become a celebrity - both in Germany and worldwide .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Democrat Hillary Clinton , under fire from rivals for a muscular attitude toward Iran , said on Monday “ all options must remain on the table ” if Tehran does not comply with nuclear nonproliferation requirements .
Democratic Presidential candidate and U.S. Senator Hillary Clinton , ( D - NY ) speaks outside Paschal 's restaurant in Atlanta , Georgia , October 12 , 2007 .

In an article for Foreign Affairs magazine , the Democratic presidential candidate said the United States should be prepared to offer incentives if Tehran ends its nuclear weapons ambitions , renounces sponsorship of terrorism , supports Middle East peace and plays a constructive role in stabilizing Iraq .
Oil -rich
Iran denies trying to develop a nuclear weapon , saying its atomic program is for peaceful energy purposes .
But the United States and its European allies believe Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad wants a nuclear bomb .
In the article , Clinton made a case for diplomatic talks with Tehran , saying “ true statesmanship requires that we engage with our adversaries , not for the sake of talking but because robust diplomacy is prerequisite to achieving our aims . ”
The New York senator said Iran poses a long - term strategic challenge to the United States , its NATO allies and Israel and accused the Bush administration of negligence in dealing with Iran .
However , she made clear that Iran “ must not be permitted to build or acquire nuclear weapons . ”
“ If Iran does not comply with its own commitments and the will of the international community , all options must remain on the table , ” Clinton wrote .
Her national security director , Lee Feinstein , told reporters in a conference call that Clinton was focusing on diplomacy in dealing with Iran , not military action , if she is elected president in November 2008 .
The commander - in - chief , he said , “ does not take options off the table , ” but Clinton feels “ the preferred approach right now is to pursue intensive diplomacy and economic pressure as the best way to avert a nuclear program in Iran and as the best way to avert a war . ”
Clinton has been under fire from Democratic presidential opponents Barack Obama and John Edwards for voting for a Senate resolution recommending the State Department designate Iran ’s Revolutionary Guards as a terrorist organization .
They argued it could be used by the Bush administration to launch military attacks against Iran .
In the Foreign Affairs article , Clinton also said if elected she would direct U.S. military leaders to come up with a plan within 60 days of her inauguration to “ bring our troops home ” from Iraq in a way that begins to restore stability in the region and replaces military force with a new regional diplomatic initiative .
She said she would convene a regional stability group composed of key allies , other world powers and all states bordering Iraq to develop a strategy for achieving a stable Iraq that provides incentives for Iran , Saudi Arabia , Syria and Turkey to stay out of Iraq .
Clinton also said if elected she would seek to negotiate an agreement with Russia to substantially reduce U.S. and Russian nuclear arsenals to send a “ strong message of nuclear restraint to the world . ”
She described a pragmatic relationship with Russia .
She said Russian President Vladimir Putin had suppressed many of the freedoms won after the fall of communism , but added it would be a mistake to see Russia only as a threat .
Clinton said the United States should work with Russia on selective issues such as thwarting Iran ’s nuclear ambitions , securing loose nuclear weapons in Russia and former Soviet republics and reaching a diplomatic solution in Kosovo .
" Hopes for a peaceful conclusion to the declaration of Kosovo 's independence were fading as the European Union announced it had withdrawn its staff from the north of the fledgling country in the face of increasingly angry Serb protests . "
So begins the utterly predictable reaction of the EU to Serb anger as their " army in suits " pre-emptively withdraws .
At the same time , KFOR , the Nato - led peacekeeping force , sealed the border to Serbia , after angry mobs torched border crossings .
... Yesterday Peter Feith , the EU's Kosovo envoy , said security concerns were behind the withdrawal of his staff from northern Kosovo .
They had been preparing the ground for a 2,000 - strong EU rule of law mission .
" I would like to appeal to the Serb community to be generous and to turn the page and look forward to working together with us , " he said .
" We hope that conditions will soon allow us to resume our activities . "
Translation .
We 'll return when NATO makes it safe enough for us to return .
The wider impact of the Kosovo crisis is the precedent that it sets for many of the " frozen conflicts " of the world , ranging from Azerbaijan to the Basque region .
Remarkably , many Muslim countries have refused to recognize Kosovo .
And their reluctance is fueled in part by the desire to avoid stirring up separatism .
Therefore Kosovo has been sold by the EU and the US as an " exception " to the general rule .
The problem is that the Serbs are taking the cue from the Kosovars .
If Kosovo can split from Serbia why can't Serbian regions split from Kosovo ?
The EU believed that by throwing a protective blanket of " suits " around the Serbs in the north that Kosovo might be held together .
But as the experience of Iraq shows , stabilization can only occur where security is guaranteed .
The crisis that will face Western policy in Kosovo is whether they are up to providing " security " which is another word for military force , to back up their " army of suits " .
The suits can't deploy without the uniforms .

... But the chivalrous acts are n't really what gets me .
The things I truly love about men are all the things you might not recognize as being " lovable " or appealing to women .
Such as : 1 . The hilarious , obnoxious and totally adorable banter that goes on between two guys when they 're playing a video game .
If you know that scene from " The 40 - Year - Old Virgin " ( " I 'm ripping your head off now ... aaannd now I 'm throwing it at your body ... F %$ K YOU ! " ) , that 's it in a nutshell .
I know it is n't meant to be , but it 's just so frigging cute .
2 .
The sound a man sometimes makes when I walk past him in a low - cut top .
Hard to describe , but it 's sort of a sing - songy little chirp of appreciation that he literally can not seem to hold in .
Somewhat akin to the sound a very small animal might make if you squeezed its abdomen too tightly .
( PETA folks please note : I have never actually squeezed a small animal 's abdomen .
I am merely speculating as to what it * might * sound like ) .
3 .
The stance you adopt when taking a good , long , desperately needed piss : leaning forward at a roughly 60 - degree angle , one hand braced against the wall in front of you , the other hand gripping your kickstand ... I do n't know how , but it manages to make you look both strong and vulnerable .
I love it .4 . The way a guy will use the pronoun " we " when discussing his favorite team .
For example : " I ca n't believe we traded Player X " or " Dude , we are so gonna annihilate Team X in the playoffs . "
I always found that kind of sweet and oddly endearing .
5 . I 'm also rather fond of your forgetfulness .
To go back to sports , I think it 's amazing that you can forget key dates like birthdays and anniversaries and all that crap ... but can immediately recall the stats of Player X , not to mention his hometown , height and weight , and what college he played for .
Incredible !
I 'm much more amused than bothered by it .6 .
The way all men look when they first wake up in the morning : boyish , crazy messed - up bed head , puffy eyes and lips , morning wood at half - mast .
Awww , ya just look so sweet and defenseless !
7 .
The act of showing possession by smacking their girl 's butt in public .
Of course , not all men do this ... but the kind I like do .
My only criticism is , if you 're not going to do it loud and hard enough for everyone in the immediate vicinity to take notice , do n't bother .
8 .
The manner in which most guys ( who do n't have kids or maybe nieces / nephews ) hold little babies : ehhhver - so - gently and barely moving , as if they 're cradling delicate explosives and are afraid that the slightest movement might cause the thing to explode .
9 .
When I see that some of you suit wearers have pulled / slackened your ties on the Metro ride home from work , as though you simply could n't wait until you got home and needed immediate relief , making the adjustment the moment you stepped out of your office building .
Ahhh , freedom .10 .
The fact that maybe 95 % of you have NO IDEA how amazing and perfect you are in all your idiosyncratic maleness .
* Sigh * I wish I could date every last one of you ...
The New York Times called Mitt Romney a liar today , but not CIA Director Michael Hayden .
What was Romney ’s big one ?
He ran an ad in New Hampshire this week saying Sen .
John McCain had called for allowing illegal workers in the US to collect Social Security , and the the paper of record said he was lying .
That ’s not what McCain had said .
But When Gen .
Hayden told a much bigger whopper , saying that the CIA had destroyed videotapes of the “ interrogations ” of two suspected Al Qaeda leaders because of concerns that the tapes might disclose the identities of CIA agents , thus exposing them and their families to danger , the Times , in the same issue of the paper , let it pass .
Near the end of the lengthy half - page , one - jump article , the paper did quote Tom Malinowski , director of the Washington office of Human Righst Watch , as saying that Hayden ’s explanation “ was n’t credible , ” which indeed it was n’t .
But you ’d have to read a lot of verbiage to get to that gentle challenge .
The truth is that the CIA is full of documents that if leaked would disclose agents ’ identities , and the CIA does n’t destroy those records .
The truth is also that if the CIA wanted to keep the tapes , and even make them available if asked to , it has the means to easily wipe away the identities of any agency assets or agents who appear in the film , and even to mask their voices .
News programs do that all the time .
So the excuse does n’t wash .
The reason the Agency destroyed those tapes is not because of concerns about agent safety , but because those tapes are the CIA ’s Abu Ghraib moment .
They are incontrovertible documentary evidence of the CIA ’s blatant use of torture , which it was authorized and instructed to use against terror suspects by President Bush after 9 - 11 , in what is clearly an impeachable act .
And in Hayden ’s view , and the view of the agency heads before him , it was better to break the law and destroy the evidence than to turn it over to Congressional investigators , defense attorneys for terrorism suspects on trial , and the 9 - 11 Commission , all of which groups had asked about the existence of such tapes , and about those tapes in particular .
And all of which were lied to by the Agency .
So let ’s at least call a lie a lie .
Chisled into the marble entranceway to the headquarters of the Central Intelligence Agency is the phrase : “ And you shall know the truth , and the truth shall set you free . ”
Right .
Obviously that line is meant ironically .
The CIA is not about truth .
It is about shadows , secrecy and deceit .
The question is why someone like Hayden is accorded any credibility at all by the news media .
I ’m past expecting Congress to do anything about this torture scandal , or about Hayden ’s lies , since it has n’t done anything about any of the other scandals of this administration .
But it would be nice if the media , including the New York Times , would at least call a lie a lie .
We can only hope that some person of character at the CIA , or someone with a grudge or a problem who needs some insurance or payback potential , has kept a copy of those tapes , and that at some point they will see the light of day .
( If you ’re out there , please mail it to me at PO Box 846 , Ambler , PA 19002 .
Confidentiality guaranteed . )
Maybe many Americans think torturing our enemies is a good thing .
But they ’re wrong .
Torture not only is a poor and perhaps even a useless tool for learning anything of value ( since the victim clearly will say anything , true or false , to get the torture to stop , and thus can send people on endless wild goose chases , wasting resources and time ) , but it is inevitable that some of the people who get tortured wil be innocent .
Besides , once it is known that torture is the fate of those who are captured by American forces , people will go to much greater lengths to avoid capture , which means more fights to the death , and inevitably more casualties on our side .
Better to let our enemies know that if they give up , they ’ll be treated fairly , with respect and in accordance with the law .
Besides , if we torture , how are we any better than the terrorists and the rogue nations ?
For that matter , if we have an agency that is founded and built on lies , what does that have to do with a democracy ?
Obama , Gravel tangle on campaign donations in 2008 ' YouTube ' debate Michael Roston
Published : Monday July 23 , 2007 Print This Email This Enjoy this story ?
Get politics headlines as they break in your browser .
The Monday night Democratic presidential primary debate started out with a testy exchange between Alaska 's Mike Gravel and Senator Barack Obama of Illinois that exemplified an early focus on the identities and broad visions of their candidacies .
" You 're not going to see any change when any of these people get elected , " Gravel said , before pointing to Senator Obama 's promise that he was n't taking money from political action committees and lobbyists .
" He has 134 bundlers , now what does he think that is ? "
Gravel added , before pointing to one particular donor .
Obama responded that Gravel was wrong on his facts .
" I do n't take money from banks , from lobbyists , " he said .
" The reason you know about the bundlers is because I passed a law in this session . "
The early exchange came in a debate hosted at The Citadel , a military college in South Carolina .
The state is home to an early southern primary election during next year 's presidential campaign .
The debate was moderated by CNN's Anderson Cooper .
All questions were submitted via YouTube by users of the website , and selected by CNN .
The participants , in addition to Gravel and Obama , were Senator Joseph Biden of Delaware , Senator Hillary Clinton of New York , Senator Chris Dodd of Connecticut , former Senator John Edwards of North Carolina , Rep. Dennis Kucinich of Ohio , and Governor Bill Richardson of New Mexico .
Other points in the debate also turned on questions of the candidate 's identity and vision .
Senator Clinton was asked if she considered herself to be a liberal .
She said the word had been abused by liberalism 's critics .
" I prefer the word progressive , " she answered .
" I consider myself a modern progressive ... who believes strongly in individual rights and freedoms . "
Clinton was also asked about whether the fact that she was a woman was important to her candidacy .
" I 'm not running because I 'm a woman , " she answered .
" I 'm running because I " m most ready to hit the ground running in 2009 . "
A follow - up question was then directed to John Edwards , whose wife Elizabeth said last week that he was a better advocate for women than Clinton .
He praised Clinton , but said that he was better on issues of importance to women because of his anti-poverty advocacy .
" More women are affected by the minimum wage than men are affected by the minimum wage .... there are more women in poverty than men in poverty , " he argued .
" On the issues that most affect women , I have the strongest record . "
Candidates juggle legalizing gay marriage CNN later showed two videos with questioners asking about legalizing gay marriage .
Rep. Dennis Kucinich gave an unequivocal ' yes ' when asked if he would support gay marriage .
Senator Dodd said he supported civil unions , and Senator Edwards stuck to the notion that he would not enforce his personal beliefs that marriage is for a man and a woman via government law .
In a sense , Edwards attempted to emote his way through the question .
" I have been an enormous journey on this issue , I feel enormous conflict about it , " he remarked .
" This is a very , very difficult issue for me . "
Senator Obama chose a different path , differentiating between what the government and religious institutions should be allowed to do regarding same - sex marriage .
" The civil unions that I propose would make sure that all rights conferred by the state are equal for same sex couples as well as heterosexual couples , " he said .
" It 's up to the individual denominations ...[ but ] all those critical civil rights should be even . "
Clinton prefers Afghanistan to Darfur
As the candidates were asked whether or not US troops should get involved in the genocide in Darfur , Bill Richardson emphasized the need for America to get more engaged in diplomacy .
" It 's diplomacy ... it's getting China to pressure Sudan , it 's getting the European Union to participate in sanctions in Sudan , " the New Mexico Governor offered among several steps to stop the killing .
" The answer here is caring about Africa ... that 's how we restore American leadership .
" But Senator Biden offered a more hasty response .
" I 'm so tired of this ... where we can , America must , " he stated strongly .
" Those kids will be dead by the time diplomacy is over . "
Senator Clinton disagreed , saying that America should focus on UN and African Union troops for Sudan .
" American ground troops I do n't think belong in Darfur at this time , " she said .
" We 're stretched thin in Afghanistan . "
Richardson on Iraq : Forget Bush 's legacy Senator Biden continued to promote his foreign policy leadership when asked about what America should do in Iraq .
" We ca n't just pull out now ... if we started today , it would take one year , one year to get 160,000 troops out logistically , " he said .
He went on to discuss his decentralized government proposal for Iraq .
Subsequently , Senator Clinton appeared to question the idea that America could do any good in Irq .
" I happen to agree that there is no military solution and the Iraqis refuse to pursue a political solution , " she argued .
But Rep.
Kucinich challenged the idea that any of the other candidates were living up to the message they were promoting on ending the war in Iraq .
" The American people did n't expect us to give them a Democratic version of the war , " the Ohio Congressman argued .
Governor Richardson appeared to agree .
" The lives of our troops are more important than George Bush 's legacy , " the New Mexico Democrat stated , arguing for a complete withdrawal of troops within six months .
Senator Clinton faulted the Pentagon 's failure to do any planning for ending the war in short order .
" It 's time for us to admit that it 's going to be complicated , " she said regarding withdrawal .
" And we need to start planning that now . "
Obama hits back at Romney for sex ed remarks Senator Obama used the debate to rebut former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney 's suggestion that he was wrong - headed for supporting age - appropriate sexual education for young children .
" Ironically , this is a proposal that he himself supported when he was running for Governor of Massachusetts , and he forgot , " the Illinois Democrat said to laughs .
Obama also defended sending his children to a private school in place of a public school , saying that the issue was n't about him .
" We do n't have good schools , public schools , for all kids , " he said .
" The question is whether ordinary parents who can't work the system can get their kids into good schools . "
Senator Biden also engaged in some self - criticism for his support of the No Child Left Behind program .
" It was a mistake , " the Delaware Democrat admitted .
" The reason I voted for it , against my better instinct is I had great faith in Ted Kennedy . "
Richardson used his direct experience with the program to explain why he was disappointed with the major education reform .
" I would scrap it , it does n't work , the New Mexico Governor said .
" It is not just an unfunded mandate , the one size fits all does n't work ... if a school is not doing well , we help that school . "
Obama digs at Clinton 's 1993 health care failure Senator Obama used a question about health care to take a swipe at Senator Clinton 's time as First Lady .
" Everybody 's going to have a plan ... we had plans before under a Democratic administration in the 90s , and a Democratic Congress , " he said .
He went on to blame pharmaceutical and insurance companies for crippling earlier health care proposals .
" We have to have a president that makes sure they do n't have a veto power , " he said .
But Clinton defended her record , which she referred to as her ' scars ' as she had in earlier debates .
" We have to have a sense of national commitment that health care is a national value , " the New York Democrat said .
Clinton steers around her husband 's legacy Senator Clinton got one of the night 's final quips when she was asked if it was appropriate for two families , the Bushes and Clintons , to potentially govern the United States for 28 consecutive years .
" I think it is a problem that Bush was elected in 2000 , " she quipped to cheers from the audience .
" I actually thought someone else was elected in that election . "
She went on , " Obviously , I 'm running on my own merits , but I 'm very proud of my husband 's record as President of the United States ... any one of us would be a better president than our current president or the future Republican nominee . "

Abstract :
In this article , I explore through personal narrative the relationship between adjuncts and full - timers and also between adjuncts and support staff .
Special attention is given to the issue of age as a factor structuring social interplay .
And a 42 year old man who drools on himself gets a tenure - track position .
30 , its the new 18
I walked past the bullpen ( the adjunct lounge ) and through the main department offices .
An administrative assistant runs toward me , “ May I help you ? ”
“ Nope .
I ’m fine , thanks . ” I smile at her .
I turn and walk into the copy room .
“ I ’m sorry this copy room is n’t for students .
There are copy machines in the library and downstairs next to the pop machine . ”
I nod and pull the final out of my leather briefcase .
“ Okay ”
“ This is a faculty copy room ” she repeats .
“ Yep . ” I nod at her .
Its not that I ’m stupid .
Well I am clearly stupid …
I am teaching college while other people with 12,000 dollar a day coke habits are in respectable industries like real estate and human trafficking where at least you can be honest .
I ca n’t even figure out how to make an extra 12,000 a year .
Ever hear a group of realtors sitting around talking about “ changing sh$t ” ?
Ever heard a pimp say , “ when is the world gonna wake up and realize we need social justice ” ?
“ You ’re going to have to leave ”
Here I turn trying to remain calm .
“ I AM a faculty member .
I ’ve been teaching here for three years . ”
“ Oh you look so young ” she giggles .
“ Sorry ”
“ Sorry ?
I walk past your desk three times a week .
I ’m 30 years old ”
By this time I ’m pissed off , but I still fake a smile .
This is the fourth time I ’ve had this exchange .
“ Do many students carry stacks of other students papers around ?
Do they wear ties to school ? ”
“ I said I was sorry . ”
She storms off .
I hope that I ’ve pissed her off so bad she ’ll never talk to me again .
Pimps do n’t have to prove their old enough to be pimps .
I place the first page of the final in the copy machine and begin my fifteen minute wait for the copier to power up .
Its 7:30 in the morning , I ’ve just finished teaching a class of automotive students .
Before class one of my students asked , “ do you think I ’m retarded . ”
“ Um … no . ” I ask not sure where this is going .
“ Why ? ”
“ Well my speech professor told me , I ’m a retard .
She said I should n’t even be in college . ”
He ’s on the verge of tears .
A pimp would probably tell a college student they were retarded , but would the student believe it ?
“ Well I see no difference between you and any of my students .
You ’re a pleasure to have in class and speaking of the class .
I have your last paper . ” I delivered an “ A ” to him . ”
For once I ’m happy I actually forced myself to grade the papers on time .
Still waiting for the copy machine to warm up , the admin assistant walks past the door .
Glares at me .
When I enter the classroom another student tells me their speech teacher called him a “ piece of sh$ % ” .
I swallow hard .
I can not get involved in conflict between students and other professors .
I do n’t even have a contract .
I do n’t have health insurance .
No office .
No voicemail .
I ca n’t even get the tech lady to re-instate my password so I can use the ELMO .
I ca n’t have a conflict with another faculty member over a student , I make 18 cents on the dollar of what a full - timer makes .
“ Well if that ’s true .
If a professor is mistreating you , what you should do is talk to the division chair .
So if you do n’t like my performance or another person ’s performance , I would say going to the division chair would be the next step . ”
I look him straight in the eye .
His expression is blank .
So I repeat myself several times .
Finally I give up .
“ Go complain to the division chair , this woman is wrong for saying this sh%# to you .
If you tell anyone that I told you this , I ’ll claim you ’re a liar .
I ca n’t loose my job . ”
He nods and thanks me .
As the copy machine light comes on Tom Carrol breezes into the room and lifts the lid .
In one smooth motion he tosses the first page of the final onto the prep desk and lays down his ditto .
“ Sorry , I ’m running late . ”
He smiles .
“ So did you apply for the full - time position opening up here ?
You ’re kind of young , but you ’ve got some experience . ”
I ’m ABD and have taught for six years .
I ’ve worked on five federally funded multi-million dollar grants .
Student and peer evaluations place me in the top 2 % of the college ’s faculty .
The last guy that beat me out for a full - time position wears Haiwain shirts and drools on himself .
For three months he threw all of my campus mail in the trash , and bumped me in the hallway every time he passed me .
During a faculty BBQ , he spent the duration of the time telling me how I was just a twinkle in my father ’s eye when the Cuban missile crisis happened .
I ’ve kicked people in the nuts for less , but that ’s out in the real world .
This is academia .
I ’m not saying they did n’t make a good hiring choice at the college .
After all when you look at my credentials and then consider that he has an M.A. and worked odd jobs for five years before he taught for one year as an adjunct , who would you have hired ?
Its true students drop his class to transfer into mine , but you ’ve forgotten the most important fact he ’s 42 .
“ So sue ! ” my hair stylist tells me .
“ Are you nuts ? ” I shake my head .
“ I ’d never work in academia again .
I mean once you sue , lets face it everyone talks .
I ’d have to get a big cash out and something like this , it just wo n’t work . ”
She laughs .
“ Maybe you should get into real estate .
My cousin does that and makes a killing .
Him and his wife they flip houses and she ’s illiterate . ”
“ Is she really ? ” I look hard at myself in the mirror .
“ Yeah , she ’s a bitch too .
I hate her .
Always throwing her boobs up in your face .
Big deal . ”
“ Do you think I ’m loosing my hair ? ”
“ Bald men are sexy honey , ” she winks into the mirror and smiles .
I sigh .
Back in the copy room , I look at Tom and smile .
“ Yes , yes I turned in my application early in the week . ”
After he leaves and I finish my copies , I put three boxes of staples and a box of pens in my jacket pocket and walk out .
The administrative assistant is playing online poker as I pass her desk .
I like Perl .
It 's a language that , like Fortran , Cobol , Ada and Algol , made its mark on the world .
It had a unique style , a large following of loyal users , and a lot of important software got written with it .
Languages never really seem to die .
Well , perhaps not many people are coding in Algol anymore , but you can still find plenty of resumes on Monster.com with Fortran , PL / 1 , and so on .
When people get worked up enough , they can write a lot of code , and then later it becomes nontrivial to rewrite it to the same specifications in a more modern language .
So there 's still a market for Fortran programmers working on giant old legacy Fortran code bases .
Heck , there 's still a market for Perl programmers .
But if I ever start my own company , Perl wo n't be allowed there , any more than Algol will be allowed there .
You 'll only be able to use Perl if there 's no other option , and as far as I 'm concerned , there 's always another option .
I 've written looooong , passionate essays about Perl that I never actually published .
I used Perl for years , loved it , came off the high , raged against the machine for a while , tried to make unreasonable people see reason , and wrote a lot about it .
But I 'm not going to publish that stuff because , quite simply , I do n't care anymore .
You see , someday I will start my own company , and I 'll decide my own hiring bar .
I 'll of course be my own company 's chief technical officer ( would n't you ? ) , so I 'll decide how I expect people to engineer their software .
And there will be no Perl .
So there 's no need for me to get worked up about its use at Amazon .
Whew .
I feel so much better .
However , when I start my own company , I 'll have to write up some coding conventions , and someone may eventually ask why they can't use Perl .
So today I 'm writing a short , dispassionate , take - it - or - leave - it explanation , and I 'll point them to this when the time comes .
If they 're persistent enough , I 'll also point them to the door .
These things are so much easier when you just do n't care .
Stuff I Like About Perl
Perl 's not all bad , of course .
It has some brilliant ideas .
Ten years ago it was a great language .
Today , not so great anymore .
Perl was created by Larry Wall , whom I 'll just call " Larry " for this blog .
Smart guy .
Has some broken mental models , but he 's smart .
Perl 's best features were things that " mainstream " programming languages did n't have .
Lisp , Smalltak , Prolog , and other academic - ish languages all had their own great ideas .
But they hid the OS from you , since people were n't sure which OS would " win " .
And they had rich data structures , but they pretty much ignored the importance of Strings , the ultimate poor man 's data structure .
Larry 's first great decision was to embrace the Unix operating system in his language .
It has wrappers and even syntactic support for lots of Unix stuff .
Operating systems are basically big libraries : big complex toys that you can drive around like a forklift if you have the right tools .
Perl made Unix kinda fun , even more so than it already was .
Great idea , fifteen years ago .
But pretty much all languages have OS - integration facilities these days .
Larry 's second great decision was to elevate the String to the status of Citizen , First Class .
That 's been useful , because Unix 's model is to store all of its configuration ( and logs , and virtually everything else , even passwords ) in plain - text ASCII files .
It has n't worked so well for XML , HTML , and other heirarchical string structures , nor for multibyte , but regexps still have their many uses .
All languages have that stuff now .
Perl 5's " extensions " to regexps are now the standard .
You would be hard - pressed to find a language these days that does n't have support for them .
( No fair mentioning Emacs Lisp . * sniff * . )
Of course , Perl5 regexps are actually so complex that it 's proven extremely difficult to write an interpeter for them .
The Java classes implementing Perl5 regexps are about 7,000 lines of code , and if you look at java.util.regex .
Pattern.java , you 'll get a free peek into the Intern Project from Hell .
Damien Conway threw up his hands , or maybe just threw up , and decided to " start fresh " in Perl 6 with built - in syntax for CFGs .
Good luck , DC .
What else ?
There 's a lot to like about Perl .
In no particular order ...
I like having built - in hashes .
Larry was smart to have copied that idea from Awk .
The Lisp folks are still hurting from that one .
Dunno what they were thinking .
" Hashtables , we can do " said Zawinski .
Like , um , the point is that he should have been saying " Hashtables , we 've done . "
Not to mention that there 's no syntax for them in Lisp ; everything is ( make - hashtable - this ) and ( update - hashtable - that ) .
It 's a real pisser .
Lisp does have associative arrays , but they 're implemented as O ( n ) lists - of - lists under the hood , so they 're no good for large data sets .
Incidentally , you might think I'm a Smug Lisp Weenie , but I 'm not .
Lisp is a mess .
The Lisp communities are perpetually at war , the languages are creaking with arthritis , and installing any open - source Common Lisp is a serious undertaking compared to installing Perl , which is all conveniently located in one 40 - gigabyte binary .
I 'll have my share to say about Lisp at some point , have no fear .
Lisp is an ideal , the One True Amber of languages , but unfortunately all of the implementations so far have been Shadows .
If 'n ya know what I mean .
Double - incidentally , I 'm sure some of you are thinking : " OK , ummm , ah , what should I use ?
You seem to hate everything . "
Yep !
Sunny G. put it best , actually .
He said I reminded him of Dostoyevsky .
He says I 'm a " tortured soul " , which evidently makes me a good blogger , on account of my liver going to crap , or something along those lines .
We were having beers at the time , so his exact wording is a bit fuzzy now .
But he 's right .
I do hate everything -- at least all programming languages .
Or perhaps I should say " dislike ? "
No , I think " hate " will do nicely .
All languages suck .
At this junction in human history , the best thing you can do as a programmer ( other than perhaps write your own language ) is not to get too attached to any particular one , and choose them as appropriate for the task at hand , since each language has its niche .
Perl 's niche , for instance , is in an alcove with a plaque over it at the Languages Museum .
If you really want advice , and you 've considered carefully and decided that for some task you need a flexible , dynamically typed language with great string support , great OS integration , and a strong community with libraries , documentation , and so on , use Ruby .
Or Python .
Or even Guile or Common Lisp , depending on your stomach for parens .
But my best advice is to make up your own advice , and follow that .
Let 's see , where was I ...
Oh yes .
The stuff I like about Perl .
Now I see why I added the padding - paragraphs above ; this section is going to be rather short , methinks .
What else , what else ... oh yes !
I like ... wait , sorry , that 's Ruby .
OK , I 'm sure there 's something .
Unix commands , string processing , built - in arrays and hashes , lots of C - language operators ...
Yep , I guess that about wraps it up .
Everything else even remotely interesting about Perl has been done better in other languages now .
Insanity is Not Good Business Practice
I could write a fat book about what I do n't like about Perl .
But I 'm halfway through my second glass of wine , and experience shows that this means I 'll become cohinernet soon .
So I 'll go through it fast .
First : Larry is insane .
This means more to me than anything in the language itself .
I prefer my heroes to have a firm grasp on sanity .
I was never a fan of Don Quixote .
Larry says
God talks to him , and tells him that He hates non-Perl programmers .
Larry is a fruit cake , a nut job , crazy as a loon , batty as a belfry .
Do n't believe me ?
OK .
For starters , go read this speech by Larry Wall :
Now consider the ideas Larry would like us to deduce from his little speech :
Other languages are hammers that can hit things and hurt them .
Perl is duct tape that fixes things .
Perl is a young , hip , slightly dysfunctional family .
Other languages are just dysfunctional families , period .
Perl is cute , funny , fun , smart , and trendy .
Other languages are stodgy , boring , depressing , and have no sense of humor .
All of Perl 's critics belong to various cults .
These cults are trying to turn everyone into mindless robots .
Perl is associated with the Open Source movement .
No other languages are , just Perl .
Perl focuses on individual freedom and creativity .
Other languages are grim , sterile , cold - war era , industrial Marxist labor camps and slag mines .
Other languages are little babies .
Perl is the President of the United States .
Perl is associated with God .
Other languages are associated with the Grim Reaper .
Perl is humble ; other languages are arrogant .
You can only perform great Good if you 're also capable of great Evil .
Because you can write the most awful programs imaginable in Perl , you can therefore also write programs that are far greater than those of any other language .
Perl is postmodern , so Perl advocates are allowed to employ logical fallacies , cheerleading , dramatic swings of opinion , fence - straddling , evangelism , and finger pointing as needed in order to defend their position .
... and so on .
Woah , did he really say all that ?
Psh .
That 's not the half of it .
Go back , read it closely , and see for yourself .
Now do a Google search for " perl religion " .
Looky looky , the first link is a Slashdot interview with Larry entitled : Larry Wall on Perl , Religion , and ... , in which Larry talks extensively about his conversations with God , in which God evidently explains to Larry that He only likes Perl programmers .
Larry also says that the world will put him up on a pedestal and claim that he is the Renaissance - y - est man who ever lived .
He means that in the most modest possible sense , I 'm sure .
OK , enough about Larry .
He 's not interesting enough to talk about any more .
Snake Eyes
This section is just a snippet from the Perl documentation .
I have it all as Emacs Info pages .
Ah , how the heart leaps when I say that .
Info 's nice , to be sure , but its main interest to me is that it 's loosely based on Knuth 's T E X typesetting program .
I 've been reading a lot of Donald Knuth lately .
I 'll have to tell you about Knuth sometime .
He 's a Cool Guy , and I do n't bestow that honorific lightly in his case .
I just do n't know if I could do him justice .
Buy his books , read them .
He 's a great man .
In any case , here 's Damning Evidence , Exhibit B , in the case of Sane People vs. Perl .
I encourage you to read it all .
Try to understand it .
This is the documentation , written by Larry of course , for an operator consisting of two period characters , and we 're not talking Rosencrantz and Guildenstern .
Good luck !
Range Operator
--------------
Binary " .. " is the range operator , which is really two different operators
depending on the context .
In a list context , it returns an array of values
counting ( by ones ) from the left value to the right value .
This is useful for
writing `for ( 1..10 ) ' loops and for doing slice operations on arrays .
Be aware
that under the current implementation , a temporary array is created , so you'll
burn a lot of memory if you write something like this :
for ( 1 .. 1_000_000 ) {
# code
}
In a scalar context , " .. " returns a boolean value .
The operator is bistable ,
like a flip - flop , and emulates the line - range ( comma ) operator of * sed* , * awk * ,
and various editors .
Each " .. " operator maintains its own boolean state .
It
is false as long as its left operand is false .
Once the left operand is true ,
the range operator stays true until the right operand is true , * AFTER * which
the range operator becomes false again .
( It does n't become false till the next
time the range operator is evaluated .
It can test the right operand and become
false on the same evaluation it became true ( as in * awk* ) , but it still returns
true once .
If you do n't want it to test the right operand till the next
evaluation ( as in * sed* ) , use three dots ( " ... " ) instead of two . )
The right
operand is not evaluated while the operator is in the " false " state , and the
left operand is not evaluated while the operator is in the " true " state .
The
precedence is a little lower than || and && .
The value returned is either the
null string for false , or a sequence number ( beginning with 1 ) for true .
The
sequence number is reset for each range encountered .
The final sequence number
in a range has the string " E0 " appended to it , which does n't affect its numeric
value , but gives you something to search for if you want to exclude the
endpoint .
You can exclude the beginning point by waiting for the sequence
number to be greater than 1 .
If either operand of scalar " .. " is a numeric
literal , that operand is implicitly compared to the $ .
variable , the current
line number .
Examples :
As a scalar operator :
if ( 101 .. 200 ) { print ; } # print 2nd hundred lines
next line if ( 1 .. /^$ / ) ; # skip header lines
s/^/> / if ( /^$ / .. eof ( ) ) ; # quote body
As a list operator :
for ( 101 .. 200 ) { print ; } # print $ _ 100 times
@foo = @foo [ $ [ .. $ # foo ] ; # an expensive no - op
@foo = @foo [ $ # foo - 4 .. $ # foo ] ; # slice last 5 items
The range operator ( in a list context ) makes use of the magical autoincrement
algorithm if the operaands are strings .
You can say
@alphabet = ( ' A ' .. ' Z ' ) ;
to get all the letters of the alphabet , or
$ hexdigit = ( 0 .. 9 , 'a ' .. 'f ' ) [ $ num & 15 ] ;
to get a hexadecimal digit , or
@z2 = ( ' 01 ' .. ' 31 ' ) ; print $ z2 [ $mday ] ;
to get dates with leading zeros .
If the final value specified is not in the
sequence that the magical increment would produce , the sequence goes until the
next value would be longer than the final value specified .
Actually , a lot of Perl documentation is like that .
You really have no idea how many times I 've wanted to use the f - word so far in this blog .
Really , no idea .
But I swore passionately to remain dispassionate .
So no f-words .
Well , " flip - flop " , maybe .
Heh .
Ot - Nay Oo -Tay Ight - Bray ( if you catch my meaning )
OK , enough fooling around .
Let 's get right to the heart of the matter .
Perl has references .
Not , mind you , the kind of friendly helper - elf style references from languages like , say , every other flip - flopping language in the universe .
You see , those references are merely double - pointers , and they 're automatically de- double - pointered for you , because the compiler or interpreter in question ( along with its author ) has what you might call the Humane Instinct .
As in : Oh , the Humanity .
That kind of Humane .
( Glass Three , can you tell ? )
Perl 's references are basically pointers .
As in , C - style pointers .
You know .
Addresses .
Machine addresses .
What in the flip - flop are machine addresses doing in a " very high - level language ( VHLL ) " , might you ask ?
Well , gosh , what they 're doing is taking up about 30 % of the space in all Perl documentation worldwide .
Being nominally responsible for developer training here , you 'd think I might tend to notice when some particular concept , such as Perl 's references , takes up 1/3 of the classroom time .
And 1/3 of the discussion time .
And 1/3 of my farging blog .
And you'd be right , you would .
They 're not pulling their weight .
Not by a long shot .
Languages are hard to design .
They are .
Really .
Language acquisition is one of the most fundamental activities of humankind , one of the most researched , yet still among the least understood .
It 's been studied by linguists , by psychologists , by anthropologists , by neuroscientists , by philosophers .
Language is one of the Great Mysteries .
How can a set of arbitrary symbols , arranged according to arbitrary rules , imprint images so deeply in our minds ?
Is there a Universal Grammar , as Chomsky theorized ?
Is the human brain a blank slate , capable of adapting to any language , or is it hardwired to accept only certain patterns ?
Is one to believe Wittgenstein 's Tractatus , that language is unable to represent the images imprinted on our minds , and is to forever bewitch us with nonsense ?
Are language designers forever to apologize for their work ?
Really .
I 'm serious .
Hard to design .
You have to give Larry credit for trying and succeeding so wildly .
Larry , here 's some credit .
Do n't let it go to your head .
Every language designer screws up now and then .
No exceptions .
Gosling says he got the precedence of some Java operators wrong .
if ( !( that 's instanceof Understatement ) ) , I do n't know what is .
McCarthy frets about all the parens in let clauses .
As if those are the only ones to fret about .
And Guido has been known to physically murder people who complain about Python 's syntactic whitespace .
But Larry outclassed them all .
Not only did he make a mistake which , in the grand scheme of things , is to language design what Chernobyl is to backyard barbecue accidents , he wo n't actually admit it was a mistake .
Instead he markets it as your educational problem .
The mistake is that very early on , Larry decided to flatten lists by default .
Hence , if you write this :
@x = ( 1 , 2 , 3 , ( 4 , 5 ) ) ;
It automagically turns into ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ) .
Convenient , eh ?
Sure it is .
If you want to be your own father 's sister , it 's extremely convenient .
If you want every file in your filesystem to be in the root directory , it 's darnright useful .
It 's especially advantageous if you want to collapse the entire universe into a single electron , since that 's about all you can do with it .
Oops !
Oh yeah , right .
Trees .
Graphs .
Object models .
Window systems .
Company organizations .
Relationships .
Meaning and semantics .
Heirarchical knowledge representation .
Gosh .
Forgot all about those .
Whoops .
I could talk and talk about it , dispassionately of course , but I just do n't care .
The long and the short of it is that by flattening lists , Larry prevented the Perl world from creating nested data structures .
Before Perl 5 came out , the workaround was to take advantage of Perl 's other Great Evil , which is that variables can contain more simultaneous values than Imelda Marcos 's closest can contain shoes .
So you could build heirarchical data structures by simply hacking the typeglob slot system .
Heck , you can do it with Strings if you 're determined enough .
To alleviate the situation , in Perl 5 , Larry added references , which are sort of like C pointers , but more confusing , and with none of the inherent value of pointers .
Then he marketed them a lot , saying things like " references are FUN " , and " you can take a reference to ANYTHING " , and you are a " COMPLETE DUMBASS if you can't understand references " , and so on .
He sprayed on some more syntax to cover up the smell , so there are now dual syntaxes for virtually every Perl declaration , as if auto - flattening , pseudo - type sigils and typeglobs were n't bad enough .
Perl zombies everywhere dutifully memorized the inner workings of references , which merely furthered their zombification .
And that 's where it stands today .
Perl works the way you do .
It 's All Downhill From There
Perl also has " contexts " , which means that you can't trust a single line of Perl code that you ever read .
Every operator in Perl ( not just the Range operator ) has six different behaviors depending on the invisible context in which its surrounding expression is being evaluated .
When you evaluate a hash in a string context , for instance , you get back a string that 's a fraction , such as " 7/10 " , the numerator of which represents the current number of keys in the hash , and the denominator of which represents of total number of buckets allocated .
And so on , and so forth .
There are no rules , no heuristics , no patterns .
It 's pure memorization .
Commit the Perl Periodic Table of the Operators to memory , and you 're officially 1/1000th of the way down the road to Perl Zombiedom .
Like any well - designed system , Perl of course has hundreds of global variables .
They 're typically two characters long , the first of which is a dollar - sign , and the second of which is either an ASCII character or a Unicode character .
Changing the value of any one of these hundreds of variables changes the meaning of at least 10 % of the lines of code in your code base .
One can only speculate as to what $ξ does , or $ 葉 for that matter .
I 'm sure it's in the docs somewhere .
And Perl itself is the world 's ugliest , most un-maintainable binary .
Perl zealots have written articles intended to be motivational , but they clearly call out the fact that if Larry ever gets hit by a bus , nobody will be able to do anything to Perl anymore .
Perl 6 is not the answer .
Damien gave perhaps the most compelling PowerPoint presentation in the history of technology when he visited us at Amazon 2 years ago .
But even if Perl 6 should ever materialize , which is a matter of some debate , I believe it 's been too damaged by Larry 's broken mental models to be a viable language .
It does show tiny hints of promise now and then ; back when Damien gave his talk here , I chatted with him afterwards about list flattening , and mentioned that it was the root of all evil .
He was a bit taken aback , and said they were n't planning on changing that feature .
I read recently that they 've decided to change it after all ; you 'll have to set some godawful global variable , possibly dollar - unicode - chinese - horse - symbol , to turn on auto - list flattening .
The Right Set of Legos
There 's still no real hope , though .
Perl provides too many specific building blocks and not enough generic ones .
Perl 6 will obviously be no exception .
Specific building blocks -- i.e. , shortcuts -- are nice to have around when you need that particular shortcut .
That 's how a language gets its reputation , its niche .
Perl 's shortcuts are all about string processing and list slicing and scripting and so on .
Unfortunately , writing virtually anything " generic " in Perl requires you to be a contortionist , as my Amazon Developers Journal programming challenge about string permutations so clearly demonstrated .
Larry provides you with thousands of shortcuts , but there 's nothing so fundamental as providing parity across list and string operations , and a full set of consistent higher - order functions that work on every collection type .
I guess he forgot that one .
To illustrate just how important this is , let 's talk Legos .
A programming language is just like a set of Legos , you know .
When I was a kid I played with Legos , and built all sorts of pathetic , dumpy little houses and spaceships and stuff .
I loved them .
Those Legos let me build anything my imagination came up with .
Decades later , Legos are still going strong , but they 've turned into jigsaw puzzles .
You can buy a Pirate Ship Lego set , and with it you can build ... a Pirate Ship !
And , and , you can move the people around on it !
But try building a crocodile and you 're screwed , unless the set came with a big misshapen Lego in the form of a crocodile .
Of course then you 're screwed if you want a lion .
And so on .
With the right set ( and number ) of generically - shaped Lego pieces , you can build essentially any scene you want .
At the " Downtown Disney " theme park at Disney World in Orlando , there 's a Legoland on the edge of the lagoon , and not only does it feature highly non-pathetic Lego houses and spaceships , there 's a gigantic Sea Serpent in the actual lake , head towering over you , made of something like 80 thousand generic lego blocks .
It 's wonderful .
Dumb people buy Lego sets for Camelot or Battlestars or whatever , because the sets have beautiful pictures on the front that scream : " Look what you can build ! "
These sets are sort of the Ikea equivalent of toys : you buy this rickety toy , and you have to put it together before you can play with it .
They 've substituted glossy fast results for real power , and they let you get away with having no imagination , or at least no innovative discipline .
Perl 's exactly the same .
Perl 's success is all predicated on its marketing , nowadays ; after all , any idiot can see that there are much better languages out there .
Take your pick .
But Perl 's marketing shows you glossy pictures -- look at our arrays !
Our hashes !
Our clever contexts and typeglobs and references !
Look how postmodern we are !
And programmers new to high - level programming ideas ( including truly new programmers , and also C/C++ programmers who 've spent months writing buggy char - buffer manipulation routines ) see the marketing and think : Gosh .
A pirate ship .
That 's soooo cool .
A Farewell to Perl
In the fifteen years since Perl was first introduced , language designers have figured out that ( a ) Perl had some good ideas worth copying , ( b ) Perl had many other bad ideas worth nothing whatsoever , and ( c ) marketing is all - important .
Most programmers only ever master one language , and the difficulty of the feat ( particularly if the language is insane , in the way that Perl and C++ are insane ) makes the programmers never want to learn another language .
You need marketing to get adoption .
Larry
Wall is a formidable marketeer , better at it than most Harvard business school graduates .
I wrote a complete essay about this that I was ready to publish , but I decided it 's perhaps a bit too controversial .
The gist of it is that languages really are religions , and they maintain their grip on their laity by fear of Death .
After programmers spend years memorizing the proper incantations , telling them that their hard - won language is going away is like pointing a gun at their family .
They feel that learning another language would take years , during which time they lose their value and could easily become unemployed .
It 's not just a simple matter of starving -- they could lose their medical insurance , get hit by a car , die on the hospital steps , and their family would starve .
When I say languages are religions , it 's a pretty serious business .
Insecure programmers feel their very lives are on the line .
It 's no wonder that so much spittle flies when we get into language wars .
Thoreau says the mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation .
Not programmers , though .
They lead lives of really loud desperation .
Desperate or not , those people are n't going to work for me .
I demand excellence from my co-workers .
The disease , nay , the virus of programming - language religion has a simple cure : you just write a compiler .
Or an interpreter .
One for any language other than the one you know best .
It 's as easy as that .
After you write a compiler ( which , to be sure , is a nontrivial task , but if there 's some valid program out there that you could n't ever write , then you 're not justified in calling yourself a programmer ) , the disease simply vanishes .
In fact , for weeks afterwards , you can't look at your code without seeing right through it , with exactly the same sensation you get when you stare long enough at a random - dot stereogram : you see your code unfold into a beautiful parse tree , with scopes winding like vines through its branches , the leaves flowering into assembly language or bytecode .
When you write a compiler , you lose your innocence .
It 's fun to be a shaman , knowing that typing the right conjuration will invoke the gods of the machine and produce what you hope is the right computation .
Writing a compiler slays the deities , after which you can no longer work true magic .
But what you lose in excitement , you gain in power : power over languages and over language - related tools .
You 'll be able to master new languages rapidly and fearlessly .
You may lose your blind faith , but you gain insight into the hauntingly beautiful machinery of your programs .
For many , it deepens their real faith .
Regardless , it lets them sit at the table with their peers as equals .
But I do n't care .
I 'm tired of fighting ignorance .
I 'm off to find smart people and do great things .
Well , it 's late , so I think I 'll just go read a book .

Another terrific essay Steve .
I 'm citing your blog to potential new - hires as another reason to work at Amazon ...
On the clunkiness of the alternatives to Perl ...
You include lisp , and with some good reason ( The lack of truly polymorphic access to the built - in containers in common lisp is rather annoying .
And string support is a bit insane in places . )
But at least lisp lets you _fix_ the things that you do n't like , and in a seamless way .
It 's easy ( as Paul Graham is doing in Arc ) to write a variant of ' let ' that defaults to a single binding and so eliminates all of the parentheses .
And if you do n't like the default hashtable functions , just write some convenient syntax wrappers .
e.g. Michael Parker has written reader - syntax macros that implement most of Awk in Common Lisp
" Lisp is n't a language , it 's a building material . " - Alan Kay .

( Is it bad form to reply to my own comments ? )
I wrote ...
>>>

But I just noticed that ( coincidentally ) Michael Parker has written at least a partial fix for that too :
http://www.geocities.com/mparker762/
>>>
Also a generalized reference system , so you can get and set lists , arrays , strings , hashtables etc polymorphically .
>>>
This is not yet a full generalized container system , but
it 's a handy first step .
If language designers can't be relied upon to get everthing right in every case ( as seems likely ) , then the best alternative is to give the users a way to fix and extend things themselves .

But what do you do until that day when you get to start your own non-Perl - based tech company ?
Is there gritting of teeth involved , or do you just go about your daily business , secure in the knowledge that you will do it differently - someday ?
I 'm being a little cheeky , but it's also sort of a serious question stemming from my newness to Amazon .
I had a whole lot of flexibility at earlier positions , and I used this to my advantage : using Python when I thought it was the right tool for the job , using Ruby for other projects .
That worked fine , but these were smaller ponds where I was a relatively big fish .
What happens here , where it's a very very big pond indeed ?

I 'd say the ad hominem attacks on Wall were unnecessary , except they seem to form at least 1/3 of your argument .
If you had ever met the guy , or attended a State of the Onion talk , you would see how humble this guy is .
Expectations are so high for his talks to be hilarious and insightful simultaneously that sometimes he misses both marks , understandably .
And , you have to give some slack since the talk was intended to be given only with aural sarcasm and only for Perl & Linux zealots .
Anyway , I think of perl perhaps in a reverse way , trying not to miss the forest for the trees .
There are certainly too many quirks in the language , that basically just have to be memorized ( list flattening is one of them ) - and probably more in Perl than in any other language .
Perl does n't appear to be derived from a minimal set of regular rules ; rather it is , but to a language theorist there are so many exceptions as to drive you crazy .
Perl is to computer languages as English is to natural languages .
Generally these are the result of well - intended DWIM ( Do What I Mean ) that has aged poorly .
That 's why perl has a " cult " - if your DWIM matches well with perl 's DWIM , you are a happy camper ; if not you are stevey . :)
Actually the large number of well - intended yet stupid DWIM 's in Perl 5 are the driving force for Perl 6 .
If it ever arrives , it 's anybody 's guess whether Ruby programmers will flee to Perl6 the way Perl5 programmers are currently fleeing to Ruby .
Ultimately the productivity , success , and happiness of the people using perl will have to be the judge of the success of the language itself .
I wish your future non-Perl company well .
But do n't worry about Perl at Amazon .
All our programmers who use Perl also use at least 1 other language daily ... let 's get the same from our Java programmers .
Posted by : Doug T. at December 8 , 2004 07:05
Thanks for the well - considered comments , Doug .
The essay is just my own opinions , and language discussions always come down to matters of taste , so my responses here are of little worth .
Nevertheless ...
> I 'd say the ad hominem attacks on Wall were unnecessary
I 'm afraid they really are necessary .
Larry has turned what was a gentleman 's war into guerilla tactics .
He consistently and cleverly ( I never said he was n't brilliant ) slanders other languages and language communities , and encourages this behavior in his lieutenants .
He 's made logical fallacies fair game , and he regularly crosses the bounds of common decency , so I have no qualms about employing ad hominem in response .
I 've given it considerable thought , and tried for at least a year to finish this essay .
It was only when I realized I have to combat his tactics with my own political commercials that I was able to make progress .
So ad - hominem it is .
He 's crazy , and I 'm not going to politely gloss over the issue .
Reminds me of this movie dialogue :
Will Graham : I know that I 'm not smarter than you .
Doctor Hannibal Lecktor :
Then how did you catch me ?
Will Graham :
You had ... disadvantages .
Doctor Hannibal Lecktor : What disadvantages ?
Will Graham : Passion .
And you 're insane .
> you would see how humble this guy is .
What he 's like in person is irrelevant .
Most of the world hears his message through his writing , as he well knows .
His speech is by no means an atypical example of his writing , so his behavior at conferences can only be considered posturing .
He is the consummate marketer , after all .
> Perl is to computer languages as English is to natural languages .
This is far and away the strongest argument against Perl .
English is a terrible language , desperately in need of spelling and grammatical reform .
By anyone 's standards , it should be the last model you 'd use for a design philosophy .
Larry uses " Just like English " as one of his typical silly appeals to nonreason .
Not surprisingly , Perl is n't very popular in non-English - speaking countries ; they know better .
> Ultimately the productivity , success , and happiness of the people
> using perl will have to be the judge of the success of the language
> itself .
This might be true , if you find a way to include the productivity , success and " happiness " of people who are forced to use it because there 's so much of it at Amazon .
Many people are miserable about the whole Perl experience , yet Perl 's marketing ( which is also conducted internally by card - carrying cult members ) makes folks feel it 's their fault for not liking it better .
> let 's get the same from our Java programmers .
Indeed .
Everyone ought to be comfortable with at least five languages .
Twenty is even better .
The one I 've been tackling most recently , incidentally , is PostScript .
Knowing a whole bunch of languages is very nearly as effective as writing a compiler or interpreter .
Perl , for all its flaws , is still preferable to C++ in most cases .

This specification was obsoleted by OAuth Core 1.0 Revision A on June 24th , 2009 to address a session fixation attack .
The OAuth Core 1.0 Revision A specification is being obsoleted by the proposed IETF draft draft - hammer - oauth .
The draft is currently pending IESG approval before publication as an RFC .
Implementers should use RFC 6749 : The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework instead of this specification .
December 4 , 2007
OAuth Core 1.0
Abstract
The OAuth protocol enables websites or applications ( Consumers ) to access Protected Resources from a web service ( Service Provider ) via an API , without requiring Users to disclose their Service Provider credentials to the Consumers .
More generally , OAuth creates a freely - implementable and generic methodology for API authentication .
An example use case is allowing printing service printer .example.com ( the Consumer ) , to access private photos stored on photos.example.net ( the Service Provider ) without requiring Users to provide their photos.example.net credentials to printer.example.com .
OAuth does not require a specific user interface or interaction pattern , nor does it specify how Service Providers authenticate Users , making the protocol ideally suited for cases where authentication credentials are unavailable to the Consumer , such as with OpenID .
OAuth aims to unify the experience and implementation of delegated web service authentication into a single , community - driven protocol .
OAuth builds on existing protocols and best practices that have been independently implemented by various websites .
An open standard , supported by large and small providers alike , promotes a consistent and trusted experience for both application developers and the users of those applications .

The key words “ MUST ” , “ MUST NOT ” , “ REQUIRED ” , “ SHALL ” , “ SHALL NOT ” , “ SHOULD ” , “ SHOULD NOT ” , “ RECOMMENDED ” , “ MAY ” , and “ OPTIONAL ” in this document are to be interpreted as described in [ RFC2119 ] ( Bradner , B. , “ Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels , ” . ) .
Domain name examples use [ RFC2606 ] ( Eastlake , D. and A. Panitz , “ Reserved Top Level DNS Names , ” . ) .
3. Definitions
Service Provider : A web application that allows access via OAuth .
User : An individual who has an account with the Service Provider .
Consumer : A website or application that uses OAuth to access the Service Provider on behalf of the User. Protected Resource(s ) : Data controlled by the Service Provider , which the Consumer can access through authentication .
Consumer Developer : An individual or organization that implements a Consumer .
Consumer Key : A value used by the Consumer to identify itself to the Service Provider .
Consumer Secret : A secret used by the Consumer to establish ownership of the Consumer Key. Request Token : A value used by the Consumer to obtain authorization from the User , and exchanged for an Access Token .
Access Token : A value used by the Consumer to gain access to the Protected Resources on behalf of the User , instead of using the User ’s Service Provider credentials .
Token Secret : A secret used by the Consumer to establish ownership of a given Token .
OAuth Protocol Parameters : Parameters with names beginning with oauth_ .
4. Documentation and Registration
OAuth includes a Consumer Key and matching Consumer Secret that together authenticate the Consumer ( as opposed to the User ) to the Service Provider .
Consumer - specific identification allows the Service Provider to vary access levels to Consumers ( such as un-throttled access to resources ) .
Service Providers SHOULD NOT rely on the Consumer Secret as a method to verify the Consumer identity , unless the Consumer Secret is known to be inaccessible to anyone other than the Consumer and the Service Provider .
The Consumer Secret MAY be an empty string ( for example when no Consumer verification is needed , or when verification is achieved through other means such as RSA ) .
4.1 . Request URLs
OAuth defines three request URLs :
The three URLs MUST include scheme , authority , and path , and MAY include query and fragment as defined by [ RFC3986 ] ( Berners - Lee , T. , “ Uniform Resource Identifiers ( URI ) : Generic Syntax , ” . ) section 3 .
The request URL query MUST NOT contain any OAuth Protocol Parameters .
For example :
http://sp.example.com/authorize
4.2 . Service Providers
The Service Provider ’s responsibility is to enable Consumer Developers to establish a Consumer Key and Consumer Secret .
The process and requirements for provisioning these are entirely up to the Service Providers .
The Service Provider ’s documentation includes :
The URLs ( Request URLs ) the Consumer will use when making OAuth requests , and the HTTP methods ( i.e. GET , POST , etc. ) used in the Request Token URL and Access Token URL .
Signature methods supported by the Service Provider .
Any additional request parameters that the Service Provider requires in order to obtain a Token .
Service Provider specific parameters MUST NOT begin with oauth_ .
4.3 . Consumers
The Consumer Developer MUST establish a Consumer Key and a Consumer Secret with the Service Provider .
The Consumer Developer MAY also be required to provide additional information to the Service Provider upon registration .
5. Parameters
OAuth Protocol Parameter names and values are case sensitive .
Each OAuth Protocol Parameters MUST NOT appear more than once per request , and are REQUIRED unless otherwise noted .
5.1 . Parameter Encoding
All parameter names and values are escaped using the [ RFC3986 ] ( Berners - Lee , T. , “ Uniform Resource Identifiers ( URI ) : Generic Syntax , ” . ) percent - encoding ( % xx ) mechanism .
Characters not in the unreserved character set ( [ RFC3986 ] ( Berners - Lee , T. , “ Uniform Resource Identifiers ( URI ) : Generic Syntax , ” . ) section 2.3 ) MUST be encoded .
Characters in the unreserved character set MUST NOT be encoded .
Hexadecimal characters in encodings MUST be upper case .
Text names and values MUST be encoded as UTF - 8 octets before percent - encoding them per [ RFC3629 ] ( Yergeau , F. , “ UTF - 8 , a transformation format of Unicode and ISO 10646 , ” . ) .
unreserved = ALPHA , DIGIT , '-' , '.' , '_' , '~ '
5.2 . Consumer Request Parameters
OAuth Protocol Parameters are sent from the Consumer to the Service Provider in one of three methods , in order of decreasing preference :
In addition to these defined methods , future extensions may describe alternate methods for sending the OAuth Protocol Parameters .
The methods for sending other request parameters are left undefined , but SHOULD NOT use the OAuth HTTP Authorization Scheme ( OAuth HTTP Authorization Scheme ) header .
5.3 . Service Provider Response Parameters
Response parameters are sent by the Service Provider to return Tokens and other information to the Consumer in the HTTP response body .
The parameter names and values are first encoded as per Parameter Encoding ( Parameter Encoding ) , and concatenated with the ‘ &’ character ( ASCII code 38 ) as defined in [ RFC3986 ] ( Berners - Lee , T. , “ Uniform Resource Identifiers ( URI ) : Generic Syntax , ” .) Section 2.1 .
For example :
oauth_token=ab3cd9j4ks73hf7g&oauth_token_secret=xyz4992k83j47x0b
5.4 . OAuth HTTP Authorization Scheme
This section defines an [ RFC2617 ] ( Franks , J. , Hallam - Baker , P. , Hostetler , J. , Lawrence , S. , Leach , P. , Luotonen , A. , and L. Stewart , “ HTTP Authentication : Basic and Digest Access Authentication , ” . ) extension to support OAuth .
It uses the standard HTTP Authorization and WWW - Authenticate headers to pass OAuth Protocol Parameters .
It is RECOMMENDED that Service Providers accept the HTTP Authorization header .
Consumers SHOULD be able to send OAuth Protocol Parameters in the OAuth Authorization header .
The extension auth - scheme ( as defined by [ RFC2617 ] ( Franks , J. , Hallam - Baker , P. , Hostetler , J. , Lawrence , S. , Leach , P. , Luotonen , A. , and L. Stewart , “ HTTP Authentication : Basic and Digest Access Authentication , ” . ) ) is OAuth and is case - insensitive .
5.4.1 . Authorization Header
The OAuth Protocol Parameters are sent in the Authorization header the following way :
For example :
Authorization : OAuth realm = " http://sp.example.com/ " , oauth_consumer_key =" 0685bd9184jfhq22 " , oauth_token= " ad180jjd733klru7 " , oauth_signature_method=" HMAC-SHA1 " , oauth_signature = " wOJIO9A2W5 mFwDgiDvZbTSMK%2FPY%3D " , oauth_timestamp = " 137131200 " , oauth_nonce = " 4572616e48616d6d65724c61686176 " , oauth_version = " 1.0 "
5.4.2 . WWW - Authenticate Header
Service Providers MAY indicate their support for the extension by returning the OAuth HTTP WWW - Authenticate header upon Consumer requests for Protected Resources .
As per [ RFC2617 ] ( Franks , J. , Hallam - Baker , P. , Hostetler , J. , Lawrence , S. , Leach , P. , Luotonen , A. , and L. Stewart , “ HTTP Authentication : Basic and Digest Access Authentication , ” . ) such a response MAY include additional HTTP WWW - Authenticate headers :
For example :
WWW - Authenticate : OAuth realm = " http://sp.example.com/ "
The realm parameter defines a protection realm per [ RFC2617 ] ( Franks , J. , Hallam - Baker , P. , Hostetler , J. , Lawrence , S. , Leach , P. , Luotonen , A. , and L. Stewart , “ HTTP Authentication : Basic and Digest Access Authentication , ” . ) , section 1.2 .
6. Authenticating with OAuth
OAuth authentication is the process in which Users grant access to their Protected Resources without sharing their credentials with the Consumer .
OAuth uses Tokens generated by the Service Provider instead of the User ’s credentials in Protected Resources requests .
The process uses two Token types :
Request Token : Used by the Consumer to ask the User to authorize access to the Protected Resources .
The User- authorized Request Token is exchanged for an Access Token , MUST only be used once , and MUST NOT be used for any other purpose .
It is RECOMMENDED that Request Tokens have a limited lifetime .
Access Token : Used by the Consumer to access the Protected Resources on behalf of the User. Access Tokens MAY limit access to certain Protected Resources , and MAY have a limited lifetime .
Service Providers SHOULD allow Users to revoke Access Tokens .
Only the Access Token SHALL be used to access the Protect Resources .
OAuth Authentication is done in three steps :
The Consumer obtains an unauthorized Request Token .
The User authorizes the Request Token .
The Consumer exchanges the Request Token for an Access Token .
6.1 . Obtaining an Unauthorized Request Token
The Consumer obtains an unauthorized Request Token by asking the Service Provider to issue a Token .
The Request Token ’s sole purpose is to receive User approval and can only be used to obtain an Access Token .
The Request Token process goes as follows :
6.1.1 . Consumer Obtains a Request Token
To obtain a Request Token , the Consumer sends an HTTP request to the Service Provider ’s Request Token URL .
The Service Provider documentation specifies the HTTP method for this request , and HTTP POST is RECOMMENDED .
The request MUST be signed and contains the following parameters :
oauth_consumer_key : The Consumer Key. oauth_signature_method :
The signature method the Consumer used to sign the request .
oauth_signature :
The signature as defined in Signing Requests ( Signing Requests ) .
oauth_timestamp :
As defined in Nonce and Timestamp ( Nonce and Timestamp ) .
oauth_nonce :
As defined in Nonce and Timestamp ( Nonce and Timestamp ) .
oauth_version : OPTIONAL .
If present , value MUST be 1.0 .
Service Providers MUST assume the protocol version to be 1.0 if this parameter is not present .
Service Providers ’ response to non- 1.0 value is left undefined .
Additional parameters :
Any additional parameters , as defined by the Service Provider .
6.1.2 . Service Provider Issues an Unauthorized Request Token
The Service Provider verifies the signature and Consumer Key .
If successful , it generates a Request Token and Token Secret and returns them to the Consumer in the HTTP response body as defined in Service Provider Response Parameters ( Service Provider Response Parameters ) .
The Service Provider MUST ensure the Request Token cannot be exchanged for an Access Token until the User successfully grants access in Obtaining User Authorization ( Obtaining User Authorization ) .
The response contains the following parameters :
oauth_token : The Request Token .
oauth_token_secret : The Token Secret .
Additional parameters :
Any additional parameters , as defined by the Service Provider .
If the request fails verification or is rejected for other reasons , the Service Provider SHOULD respond with the appropriate response code as defined in HTTP Response Codes ( HTTP Response Codes ) .
The Service Provider MAY include some further details about why the request was rejected in the HTTP response body as defined in Service Provider Response Parameters ( Service Provider Response Parameters ) .
6.2 . Obtaining User Authorization
The Consumer cannot use the Request Token until it has been authorized by the User. Obtaining User authorization includes the following steps :
6.2.1 . Consumer Directs the User to the Service Provider
In order for the Consumer to be able to exchange the Request Token for an Access Token , the Consumer MUST obtain approval from the User by directing the User to the Service Provider .
The Consumer constructs an HTTP GET request to the Service Provider ’s User Authorization URL with the following parameter :
oauth_token : OPTIONAL .
The Request Token obtained in the previous step .
The Service Provider MAY declare this parameter as REQUIRED , or accept requests to the User Authorization URL without it , in which case it will prompt the User to enter it manually .
oauth_callback : OPTIONAL .
The Consumer MAY specify a URL the Service Provider will use to redirect the User back to the Consumer when Obtaining User Authorization ( Obtaining User Authorization ) is complete .
Additional parameters :
Any additional parameters , as defined by the Service Provider .
Once the request URL has been constructed the Consumer redirects the User to the URL via the User ’s web browser .
If the Consumer is incapable of automatic HTTP redirection , the Consumer SHALL notify the User how to manually go to the constructed request URL .
Note :
If a Service Provider knows a Consumer to be running on a mobile device or set - top box , the Service Provider SHOULD ensure that the User Authorization URL and Request Token are suitable for manual entry .
6.2.2 . Service Provider Authenticates the User and Obtains Consent
The Service Provider verifies the User ’s identity and asks for consent as detailed .
OAuth does not specify how the Service Provider authenticates the User .
However , it does define a set of REQUIRED steps :
The Service Provider MUST first verify the User ’s identity before asking for consent .
It MAY prompt the User to sign in if the User has not already done so .
The Service Provider presents to the User information about the Consumer requesting access ( as registered by the Consumer Developer ) .
The information includes the duration of the access and the Protected Resources provided .
The information MAY include other details specific to the Service Provider .
The User MUST grant or deny permission for the Service Provider to give the Consumer access to the Protected Resources on behalf of the User .
If the User denies the Consumer access , the Service Provider MUST NOT allow access to the Protected Resources .
When displaying any identifying information about the Consumer to the User based on the Consumer Key , the Service Provider MUST inform the User if it is unable to assure the Consumer ’s true identity .
The method in which the Service Provider informs the User and the quality of the identity assurance is beyond the scope of this specification .
6.2.3 . Service Provider Directs the User Back to the Consumer
After the User authenticates with the Service Provider and grants permission for Consumer access , the Consumer MUST be notified that the Request Token has been authorized and ready to be exchanged for an Access Token .
If the User denies access , the Consumer MAY be notified that the Request Token has been revoked .
If the Consumer provided a callback URL in oauth_callback ( as described in Consumer Directs the User to the Service Provider ( Consumer Directs the User to the Service Provider ) ) , the Service Provider constructs an HTTP GET request URL , and redirects the User ’s web browser to that URL with the following parameters :
oauth_token : The Request Token the User authorized or denied .
The callback URL MAY include Consumer provided query parameters .
The Service Provider MUST retain them unmodified and append the oauth_token parameter to the existing query .
If no callback URL was provided , the Service Provider instructs the User to manually inform the Consumer that authorization has completed .
6.3 . Obtaining an Access Token
The Consumer exchanges the Request Token for an Access Token capable of accessing the Protected Resources .
Obtaining an Access Token includes the following steps :
6.3.1 . Consumer Requests an Access Token
The Request Token and Token Secret MUST be exchanged for an Access Token and Token Secret .
To request an Access Token , the Consumer makes an HTTP request to the Service Provider ’s Access Token URL .
The Service Provider documentation specifies the HTTP method for this request , and HTTP POST is RECOMMENDED .
The request MUST be signed per Signing Requests ( Signing Requests ) , and contains the following parameters :
oauth_consumer_key : The Consumer Key. oauth_token : The Request Token obtained previously .
oauth_signature_method :
The signature method the Consumer used to sign the request .
oauth_signature :
The signature as defined in Signing Requests ( Signing Requests ) .
oauth_timestamp :
As defined in Nonce and Timestamp ( Nonce and Timestamp ) .
oauth_nonce :
As defined in Nonce and Timestamp ( Nonce and Timestamp ) .
oauth_version : OPTIONAL .
If present , value MUST be 1.0 .
Service Providers MUST assume the protocol version to be 1.0 if this parameter is not present .
Service Providers ’ response to non- 1.0 value is left undefined .
No additional Service Provider specific parameters are allowed when requesting an Access Token to ensure all Token related information is present prior to seeking User approval .
6.3.2 . Service Provider Grants an Access Token
The Service Provider MUST ensure that :
The request signature has been successfully verified .
The Request Token has never been exchanged for an Access Token .
The Request Token matches the Consumer Key .
If successful , the Service Provider generates an Access Token and Token Secret and returns them in the HTTP response body as defined in Service Provider Response Parameters ( Service Provider Response Parameters ) .
The Access Token and Token Secret are stored by the Consumer and used when signing Protected Resources requests .
The response contains the following parameters :
oauth_token : The Access Token . oauth_token_secret : The Token Secret .
Additional parameters :
Any additional parameters , as defined by the Service Provider .
If the request fails verification or is rejected for other reasons , the Service Provider SHOULD respond with the appropriate response code as defined in HTTP Response Codes ( HTTP Response Codes ) .
The Service Provider MAY include some further details about why the request was rejected in the HTTP response body as defined in Service Provider Response Parameters ( Service Provider Response Parameters ) .
7. Accessing Protected Resources
After successfully receiving the Access Token and Token Secret , the Consumer is able to access the Protected Resources on behalf of the User .
The request MUST be signed per Signing Requests ( Signing Requests ) , and contains the following parameters :
oauth_consumer_key : The Consumer Key. oauth_token : The Access Token . oauth_signature_method :
The signature method the Consumer used to sign the request .
oauth_signature :
The signature as defined in Signing Requests ( Signing Requests ) .
oauth_timestamp :
As defined in Nonce and Timestamp ( Nonce and Timestamp ) .
oauth_nonce :
As defined in Nonce and Timestamp ( Nonce and Timestamp ) .
oauth_version : OPTIONAL .
If present , value MUST be 1.0 .
Service Providers MUST assume the protocol version to be 1.0 if this parameter is not present .
Service Providers ’ response to non- 1.0 value is left undefined .
Additional parameters :
Any additional parameters , as defined by the Service Provider .
8. Nonce and Timestamp
Unless otherwise specified by the Service Provider , the timestamp is expressed in the number of seconds since January 1 , 1970 00:00:00 GMT .
The timestamp value MUST be a positive integer and MUST be equal or greater than the timestamp used in previous requests .
The Consumer SHALL then generate a Nonce value that is unique for all requests with that timestamp .
A nonce is a random string , uniquely generated for each request .
The nonce allows the Service Provider to verify that a request has never been made before and helps prevent replay attacks when requests are made over a non-secure channel ( such as HTTP ) .
9. Signing Requests
All Token requests and Protected Resources requests MUST be signed by the Consumer and verified by the Service Provider .
The purpose of signing requests is to prevent unauthorized parties from using the Consumer Key and Tokens when making Token requests or Protected Resources requests .
The signature process encodes the Consumer Secret and Token Secret into a verifiable value which is included with the request .
OAuth does not mandate a particular signature method , as each implementation can have its own unique requirements .
The protocol defines three signature methods : HMAC - SHA1 , RSA - SHA1 , and PLAINTEXT , but Service Providers are free to implement and document their own methods .
Recommending any particular method is beyond the scope of this specification .
The Consumer declares a signature method in the oauth_signature_method parameter , generates a signature , and stores it in the oauth_signature parameter .
The Service Provider verifies the signature as specified in each method .
When verifying a Consumer signature , the Service Provider SHOULD check the request nonce to ensure it has not been used in a previous Consumer request .
The signature process MUST NOT change the request parameter names or values , with the exception of the oauth_signature parameter .
9.1 . Signature Base String
The Signature Base String is a consistent reproducible concatenation of the request elements into a single string .
The string is used as an input in hashing or signing algorithms .
The HMAC - SHA1 signature method provides both a standard and an example of using the Signature Base String with a signing algorithm to generate signatures .
All the request parameters MUST be encoded as described in Parameter Encoding ( Parameter Encoding ) prior to constructing the Signature Base String .
9.1.1 . Normalize Request Parameters
The request parameters are collected , sorted and concatenated into a normalized string :
The oauth_signature parameter MUST be excluded .
The parameters are normalized into a single string as follows :
Parameters are sorted by name , using lexicographical byte value ordering .
If two or more parameters share the same name , they are sorted by their value .
For example : a=1 , c=hi%20 there , f=25 , f=50 , f=a , z=p , z=t Parameters are concatenated in their sorted order into a single string .
For each parameter , the name is separated from the corresponding value by an ‘ =’ character ( ASCII code 61 ) , even if the value is empty .
Each name - value pair is separated by an ‘ &’ character ( ASCII code 38 ) .
For example : a=1&c=hi%20there&f=25&f=50&f=a&z=p&z=t
9.1.2 . Construct Request URL
The Signature Base String includes the request absolute URL , tying the signature to a specific endpoint .
The URL used in the Signature Base String MUST include the scheme , authority , and path , and MUST exclude the query and fragment as defined by [ RFC3986 ] ( Berners - Lee , T. , “ Uniform Resource Identifiers ( URI ) : Generic Syntax , ” . ) section 3 .
If the absolute request URL is not available to the Service Provider ( it is always available to the Consumer ) , it can be constructed by combining the scheme being used , the HTTP Host header , and the relative HTTP request URL .
If the Host header is not available , the Service Provider SHOULD use the host name communicated to the Consumer in the documentation or other means .
The Service Provider SHOULD document the form of URL used in the Signature Base String to avoid ambiguity due to URL normalization .
Unless specified , URL scheme and authority MUST be lowercase and include the port number ; http default port 80 and https default port 443 MUST be excluded .
For example , the request :
HTTP://Example.com:80/resource?id=123
Is included in the Signature Base String as :
http://example.com/resource
9.1.3 . Concatenate Request Elements
The following items MUST be concatenated in order into a single string .
Each item is encoded ( Parameter Encoding ) and separated by an ‘ &’ character ( ASCII code 38 ) , even if empty .
The HTTP request method used to send the request .
Value MUST be uppercase , for example : HEAD , GET , POST , etc .
The request URL from Section 9.1.2 ( Construct Request URL ) .
The normalized request parameters string from Section 9.1.1 ( Normalize Request Parameters ) .
See Signature Base String example in Appendix A.5.1 ( Generating Signature Base String ) .
9.2 . HMAC-SHA1
The HMAC - SHA1 signature method uses the HMAC - SHA1 signature algorithm as defined in [ RFC2104 ] ( Krawczyk , H. , Bellare , M. , and R. Canetti , “ HMAC : Keyed - Hashing for Message Authentication , ” . ) where the Signature Base String is the text and the key is the concatenated values ( each first encoded per Parameter Encoding ( Parameter Encoding ) ) of the Consumer Secret and Token Secret , separated by an ‘ &’ character ( ASCII code 38 ) even if empty .
9.2.1 . Generating Signature
oauth_signature is set to the calculated digest octet string , first base64 - encoded per [ RFC2045 ] ( Freed , N. and N. Borenstein , “ Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions ( MIME ) Part One : Format of Internet Message Bodies , ” . ) section 6.8 , then URL - encoded per Parameter Encoding ( Parameter Encoding ) .
9.2.2 . Verifying Signature
The Service Provider verifies the request by generating a new request signature octet string , and comparing it to the signature provided by the Consumer , first URL - decoded per Parameter Encoding ( Parameter Encoding ) , then base64 - decoded per [ RFC2045 ] ( Freed , N. and N. Borenstein , “ Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions ( MIME ) Part One : Format of Internet Message Bodies , ” . ) section 6.8 .
The signature is generated using the request parameters as provided by the Consumer , and the Consumer Secret and Token Secret as stored by the Service Provider .
9.3 . RSA -SHA1
The RSA - SHA1 signature method uses the RSASSA - PKCS1 - v1_5 signature algorithm as defined in [ RFC3447 ] ( Jonsson , J. and B. Kaliski , “ Public - Key Cryptography Standards ( PKCS ) # 1 : RSA Cryptography ; Specifications Version 2.1 , ” . ) section 8.2 ( more simply known as PKCS # 1 ) , using SHA - 1 as the hash function for EMSA - PKCS1 - v1_5 .
It is assumed that the Consumer has provided its RSA public key in a verified way to the Service Provider , in a manner which is beyond the scope of this specification .
9.3.1 . Generating Signature
The Signature Base String is signed using the Consumer ’s RSA private key per [ RFC3447 ] ( Jonsson , J. and B. Kaliski , “ Public - Key Cryptography Standards ( PKCS ) # 1 : RSA Cryptography ; Specifications Version 2.1 , ” . ) section 8.2.1 , where K is the Consumer ’s RSA private key , M the Signature Base String , and S is the result signature octet string :
S = RSASSA - PKCS1 - V1_5 - SIGN ( K , M )
oauth_signature is set to S , first base64 - encoded per [ RFC2045 ] ( Freed , N. and N. Borenstein , “ Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions ( MIME ) Part One : Format of Internet Message Bodies , ” . ) section 6.8 , then URL - encoded per Parameter Encoding ( Parameter Encoding ) .
9.3.2 . Verifying Signature
The Service Provider verifies the signature per [ RFC3447 ] ( Jonsson , J. and B. Kaliski , “ Public - Key Cryptography Standards ( PKCS ) # 1 : RSA Cryptography ; Specifications Version 2.1 , ” . ) section 8.2.2 , where ( n , e ) is the Consumer ’s RSA public key , M is the Signature Base String , and S is the octet string representation of the oauth_signature value :
RSASSA -PKCS1-V1_5-VERIFY ( ( n , e ) , M , S )
9.4 . PLAINTEXT
The PLAINTEXT method does not provide any security protection and SHOULD only be used over a secure channel such as HTTPS .
It does not use the Signature Base String .
9.4.1 . Generating Signature
oauth_signature is set to the concatenated encoded values of the Consumer Secret and Token Secret , separated by a ‘ &’ character ( ASCII code 38 ) , even if either secret is empty .
The result MUST be encoded again .
These examples show the value of oauth_signature for Consumer Secret djr9rjt0 jd78 jf88 and 3 different Token Secrets :
jjd999tj88uiths3 : oauth_signature = djr9rjt0jd78jf88%26jjd999tj88uiths3 jjd99$tj88uiths3 : oauth_signature = djr9rjt0jd78jf88%26jjd99%2524tj88uiths3 Empty : oauth_signature = djr9rjt0 jd78 jf88%26
9.4.2 . Verifying Signature
The Service Provider verifies the request by breaking the signature value into the Consumer Secret and Token Secret , and ensures they match the secrets stored locally .
10 . HTTP Response Codes
This section applies only to the Request Token and Access Token requests .
In general , the Service Provider SHOULD use the response codes defined in [ RFC2616 ] ( Fielding , R. , Gettys , J. , Mogul , J. , Frystyk , H. , Masinter , L. , Leach , P. , and T. Berners - Lee , “ Hypertext Transfer Protocol – HTTP / 1.1 , ” . ) Section 10 .
When the Service Provider rejects a Consumer request , it SHOULD respond with HTTP 400 Bad Request or HTTP 401 Unauthorized .
HTTP 400 Bad Request Unsupported parameter Unsupported signature method Missing required parameter Duplicated OAuth Protocol Parameter
HTTP 401 Unauthorized Invalid Consumer Key Invalid / expired Token Invalid signature Invalid / used nonce
Appendix A. Appendix A - Protocol Example
In this example , the Service Provider photos.example.net is a photo sharing website , and the Consumer printer .
example.com is a photo printing website .
Jane , the User , would like printer .
example.com to print the private photo vacation. jpg stored at photos.example.net .
When Jane signs - into photos.example.net using her username and password , she can access the photo by going to the URL http://photos.example.net/photo?file=vacation.jpg .
Other Users cannot access that photo , and Jane does not want to share her username and password with printer.example.com .
The requests in this example use the URL query method when sending parameters .
This is done to simplify the example and should not be taken as an endorsement of one method over the others .
Appendix A.1. Documentation and Registration
The Service Provider documentation explains how to register for a Consumer Key and Consumer Secret , and declares the following URLs :
Request Token URL : https://photos.example.net/request_token, using HTTP POST User Authorization URL : http://photos.example.net/authorize, using HTTP GET Access Token URL : https://photos.example.net/access_token, using HTTP POST Photo ( Protected Resource ) URL : http://photos.example.net/photo with required parameter file and optional parameter size
The Service Provider declares support for the HMAC - SHA1 signature method for all requests , and PLAINTEXT only for secure ( HTTPS ) requests .
The Consumer printer.example.com already established a Consumer Key and Consumer Secret with photos.example.net and advertizes its printing services for photos stored on photos.example.net .
The Consumer registration is :
Consumer Key : dpf43f3p2l4k3l03 Consumer Secret : kd94hf93k423kf44
Appendix A.2 . Obtaining a Request Token
After Jane informs printer.example.com that she would like to print her vacation photo stored at photos .
example.net , the printer website tries to access the photo and receives HTTP 401 Unauthorized indicating it is private .
The Service Provider includes the following header with the response :
WWW - Authenticate : OAuth realm = " http://photos.example.net/ "
The Consumer sends the following HTTP POST request to the Service Provider :
https://photos.example.net/request_token?oauth_consumer_key=dpf43f3p2l4k3l03&oauth_signature_method=PLAINTEXT&oauth_signature=kd94hf93k423kf44%26&oauth_timestamp=1191242090&oauth_nonce=hsu94j3884jdopsl&oauth_version=1.0
The Service Provider checks the signature and replies with an unauthorized Request Token in the body of the HTTP response :
oauth_token=hh5s93j4hdidpola&oauth_token_secret=hdhd0244k9j7ao03
Appendix A.3 . Requesting User Authorization
The Consumer redirects Jane ’s browser to the Service Provider User Authorization URL to obtain Jane ’s approval for accessing her private photos .
http://photos.example.net/authorize?oauth_token=hh5s93j4hdidpola&oauth_callback=http%3A%2F%2Fprinter.example.com%2Frequest_token_ready
The Service Provider asks Jane to sign - in using her username and password and , if successful , asks her if she approves granting printer .
example.com access to her private photos .
If Jane approves the request , the Service Provider redirects her back to the Consumer ’s callback URL :
http://printer.example.com/request_token_ready?oauth_token=hh5s93j4hdidpola
Appendix A.4 . Obtaining an Access Token
Now that the Consumer knows Jane approved the Request Token , it asks the Service Provider to exchange it for an Access Token :
https://photos.example.net/access_token?oauth_consumer_key=dpf43f3p2l4k3l03&oauth_token=hh5s93j4hdidpola&oauth_signature_method=PLAINTEXT&oauth_signature=kd94hf93k423kf44%26hdhd0244k9j7ao03&oauth_timestamp=1191242092&oauth_nonce=dji430splmx33448&oauth_version=1.0
The Service Provider checks the signature and replies with an Access Token in the body of the HTTP response :
oauth_token=nnch734d00sl2jdk&oauth_token_secret=pfkkdhi9sl3r4s00
Appendix A.5 . Accessing Protected Resources
The Consumer is now ready to request the private photo .
Since the photo URL is not secure ( HTTP ) , it must use HMAC - SHA1 .
Appendix A.5.1 . Generating Signature Base String
To generate the signature , it first needs to generate the Signature Base String .
The request contains the following parameters ( oauth_signature excluded ) which are ordered and concatenated into a normalized string :
oauth_consumer_key : dpf43f3p2l4k3l03 oauth_token : nnch734d00sl2jdk oauth_signature_method : HMAC-SHA1 oauth_timestamp : 1191242096 oauth_nonce : kllo9940pd9333jh oauth_version : 1.0 file : vacation.jpg size : original
The following inputs are used to generate the Signature Base String :
GET http://photos.example.net/photos file=vacation.jpg&oauth_consumer_key=dpf43f3p2l4k3l03&oauth_nonce=kllo9940pd9333jh&oauth_signature_method=HMAC-SHA1&oauth_timestamp=1191242096&oauth_token=nnch734d00sl2jdk&oauth_version=1.0&size=original
The Signature Base String is :
GET&http%3A%2F%2Fphotos.example.net%2Fphotos&file%3Dvacation.jpg%26oauth_consumer_key%3Ddpf43f3p2l4k3l03%26oauth_nonce%3Dkllo9940pd9333jh%26oauth_signature_method%3DHMAC-SHA1%26oauth_timestamp%3D1191242096%26oauth_token%3Dnnch734d00sl2jdk%26oauth_version%3D1.0%26size%3Doriginal
Appendix A.5.2 . Calculating Signature Value
HMAC -SHA1 produces the following digest value as a base64 - encoded string ( using the Signature Base String as text and kd94hf93k423kf44&pfkkdhi9sl3r4s00 as key ) :
tR3 +Ty81lMeYAr/Fid0kMTYa/WM=
Appendix A.5.3 .
Requesting Protected Resource
All together , the Consumer request for the photo is :
http://photos.example.net/photos?file=vacation.jpg&size=original
Authorization : OAuth realm = " http://photos.example.net/ " , oauth_consumer_key =" dpf43f3p2l4k3l03 " , oauth_token= " nnch734d00sl2jdk " , oauth_signature_method=" HMAC-SHA1 " , oauth_signature = " tR3%2BTy81lMeYAr%2FFid0kMTYa%2FWM%3D " , oauth_timestamp = " 1191242096 " , oauth_nonce = " kllo9940pd9333jh " , oauth_version = " 1.0 "
And if using query parameters :
http://photos.example.net/photos?file=vacation.jpg&size=original&oauth_consumer_key=dpf43f3p2l4k3l03&oauth_token=nnch734d00sl2jdk&oauth_signature_method=HMAC-SHA1&oauth_signature=tR3%2BTy81lMeYAr%2FFid0kMTYa%2FWM%3D&oauth_timestamp=1191242096&oauth_nonce=kllo9940pd9333jh&oauth_version=1.0
photos.example.net checks the signature and responds with the requested photo .
Appendix B. Security Considerations
Appendix B.1. Credentials and Token Exchange
The OAuth specification does not describe any mechanism for protecting Tokens and secrets from eavesdroppers when they are transmitted from the Service Provider to the Consumer in Section 6.1.2 ( Service Provider Issues an Unauthorized Request Token ) and Section 6.3.2 ( Service Provider Grants an Access Token ) .
Service Providers should ensure that these transmissions are protected using transport - layer mechanisms such as TLS or SSL .
Appendix B.2. PLAINTEXT
Signature Method
When used with PLAINTEXT signatures , the OAuth protocol makes no attempts to protect User credentials from eavesdroppers or man - in - the - middle attacks .
The PLAINTEXT signature algorithm is only intended to be used in conjunction with a transport - layer security mechanism such as TLS or SSL which does provide such protection .
If transport - layer protection is unavailable , the PLAINTEXT signature method should not be used .
Appendix B.3 . Confidentiality of Requests
While OAuth provides a mechanism for verifying the integrity of requests , it provides no guarantee of request confidentiality .
Unless further precautions are taken , eavesdroppers will have full access to request content .
Service Providers should carefully consider the kinds of data likely to be sent as part of such requests , and should employ transport - layer security mechanisms to protect sensitive resources .
Appendix B.4 . Spoofing by Counterfeit Servers
OAuth makes no attempt to verify the authenticity of the Service Provider .
A hostile party could take advantage of this by intercepting the Consumer ’s requests and returning misleading or otherwise incorrect responses .
Service providers should consider such attacks when developing services based on OAuth , and should require transport - layer security for any requests where the authenticity of the Service Provider or of request responses is an issue .
Appendix B.5 . Proxying and Caching of Authenticated Content
The HTTP Authorization scheme ( OAuth HTTP Authorization Scheme ) is optional .
However , [ RFC2616 ] ( Fielding , R. , Gettys , J. , Mogul , J. , Frystyk , H. , Masinter , L. , Leach , P. , and T. Berners - Lee , “ Hypertext Transfer Protocol – HTTP / 1.1 , ” . ) relies on the Authorization and WWW - Authenticate headers to distinguish authenticated content so that it can be protected .
Proxies and caches , in particular , may fail to adequately protect requests not using these headers .
For example , private authenticated content may be stored in ( and thus retrievable from ) publicly - accessible caches .
Service Providers not using the HTTP Authorization scheme ( OAuth HTTP Authorization Scheme ) should take care to use other mechanisms , such as the Cache - Control header , to ensure that authenticated content is protected .
Appendix B.6 . Plaintext Storage of Credentials
The Consumer Secret and Token Secret function the same way passwords do in traditional authentication systems .
In order to compute the signatures used in the non- PLAINTEXT methods , the Service Provider must have access to these secrets in plaintext form .
This is in contrast , for example , to modern operating systems , which store only a one - way hash of user credentials .
If an attacker were to gain access to these secrets - or worse , to the Service Provider ’s database of all such secrets - he or she would be able to perform any action on behalf of any User .
Accordingly , it is critical that Service Providers protect these secrets from unauthorized access .
Appendix B.7 . Secrecy of the Consumer Secret
In many applications , the Consumer application will be under the control of potentially untrusted parties .
For example , if the Consumer is a freely available desktop application , an attacker may be able to download a copy for analysis .
In such cases , attackers will be able to recover the Consumer Secret used to authenticate the Consumer to the Service Provider .
Accordingly , Service Providers should not use the Consumer Secret alone to verify the identity of the Consumer .
Where possible , other factors such as IP address should be used as well .
Appendix B.8 . Phishing Attacks
Wide deployment of OAuth and similar protocols may cause Users to become inured to the practice of being redirected to websites where they are asked to enter their passwords .
If Users are not careful to verify the authenticity of these websites before entering their credentials , it will be possible for attackers to exploit this practice to steal Users ’ passwords .
Service Providers should attempt to educate Users about the risks phishing attacks pose , and should provide mechanisms that make it easy for Users to confirm the authenticity of their sites .
Appendix B.9 . Scoping of Access Requests
By itself , OAuth does not provide any method for scoping the access rights granted to a Consumer .
A Consumer either has access to Protected Resources or it does n’t .
Many applications will , however , require greater granularity of access rights .
For example , Service Providers may wish to make it possible to grant access to some Protected Resources but not others , or to grant only limited access ( such as read - only access ) to those Protected Resources .
When implementing OAuth , Service Providers should consider the types of access Users may wish to grant Consumers , and should provide mechanisms to do so .
Service Providers should also take care to ensure that Users understand the access they are granting , as well as any risks that may be involved .
Appendix B.10 .
Entropy of Secrets
Unless a transport - layer security protocol is used , eavesdroppers will have full access to OAuth requests and signatures , and will thus be able to mount offline brute - force attacks to recover the Consumer ’s credentials used .
Service Providers should be careful to assign Token Secrets and Consumer Secrets which are long enough - and random enough - to resist such attacks for at least the length of time that the secrets are valid .
For example , if Token Secrets are valid for two weeks , Service Providers should ensure that it is not possible to mount a brute force attack that recovers the Token Secret in less than two weeks .
Of course , Service Providers are urged to err on the side of caution , and use the longest secrets reasonable .
It is equally important that the pseudo - random number generator ( PRNG ) used to generate these secrets be of sufficiently high quality .
Many PRNG implementations generate number sequences that may appear to be random , but which nevertheless exhibit patterns or other weaknesses which make cryptanalysis or brute force attacks easier .
Implementors should be careful to use cryptographically secure PRNGs to avoid these problems .
Appendix B.11 .
Denial of Service / Resource Exhaustion Attacks
The OAuth protocol has a number of features which may make resource exhaustion attacks against Service Providers possible .
For example , if a Service Provider includes a nontrivial amount of entropy in Token Secrets as recommended above , then an attacker may be able to exhaust the Service Provider ’s entropy pool very quickly by repeatedly obtaining Request Tokens from the Service Provider .
Similarly , OAuth requires Service Providers to track used nonces .
If an attacker is able to use many nonces quickly , the resources required to track them may exhaust available capacity .
And again , OAuth can require Service Providers to perform potentially expensive computations in order to verify the signature on incoming requests .
An attacker may exploit this to perform a denial of service attack by sending a large number of invalid requests to the Service Provider .
Resource Exhaustion attacks are by no means specific to OAuth .
However , OAuth implementors should be careful to consider the additional avenues of attack that OAuth exposes , and design their implementations accordingly .
For example , entropy starvation typically results in either a complete denial of service while the system waits for new entropy or else in weak ( easily guessable ) secrets .
When implementing OAuth , Service Providers should consider which of these presents a more serious risk for their application and design accordingly .
Appendix B.12 .
Cryptographic Attacks
SHA - 1 , the hash algorithm used in HMAC - SHA1 signatures , has been shown ( De Canniere , C. and C. Rechberger , “ Finding SHA - 1 Characteristics : General Results and Applications , ” . ) [ SHA1 ] to have a number of cryptographic weaknesses that significantly reduce its resistance to collision attacks .
Practically speaking , these weaknesses are difficult to exploit , and by themselves do not pose a significant risk to users of OAuth .
They may , however , make more efficient attacks possible , and NIST has announced ( National Institute of Standards and Technolog , NIST . , “ NIST Brief Comments on Recent Cryptanalytic Attacks on Secure Hashing Functions and the Continued Security Provided by SHA - 1 , ” . ) [ NIST ] that it will phase out use of SHA - 1 by 2010 .
Service Providers should take this into account when considering whether SHA - 1 provides an adequate level of security for their applications .
Appendix B.13 .
Signature Base String Compatibility
The Signature Base String has been designed to support the signature methods defined in this specification .
When designing additional signature methods , the Signature Base String should be evaluated to ensure compatibility with the algorithms used .
The Signature Base String cannot guarantee the order in which parameters are sent .
If parameter ordering is important and affects the result of a request , the Signature Base String will not protect against request manipulation .

All the crucial proteins in our bodies must fold into complex shapes to do their jobs .
These snarled molecules grip other molecules to move them around , to speed up important chemical reactions or to grab onto our genes , turning them " on " and " off " to affect which proteins our cells make .
Recently , scientists have discovered that RNA - the stringy molecule that translates our genetic code into protein - can act a lot like a protein itself .
RNA can form loopy bundles that shut genes down or start them up without the help of proteins .
Since the discovery of these RNA clumps , called " riboswitches , " in 2002 , scientists have been striving to understand how they work and how they form .
Now , researchers at Stanford University are looking closer than ever at how the three - dimensional twists and turns in a riboswitch come together by grabbing it and tugging it straight .
By physically pulling on this loopy RNA , they have determined for the first time how a three - dimensional molecular structure folds , step by step .
The researchers used a machine called an " optical trap " to grab and hold the ends of an RNA molecule with laser beams .
Based on technology developed by Bell Labs researchers in 1986 , the machine was designed by a team led by Steven Block , the Stanford W. Ascherman , M.D. , Professor and a professor of applied physics and of biology .
The optical trap allows them to hold the ends of the RNA tightly , so they can pull it pin-straight , then let it curl up again .
In the Feb. 1 issue of Science , their paper , of which Block is senior author , describes the development of every loop and fold in one particular RNA riboswitch , and the energy it takes to form or straighten each one - an unprecedented achievement that opens the door for equally thorough studies of other molecules and their behaviors .
The researchers are the first to study the energy and folding behavior of a riboswitch in this detailed , physical way .
More important , they are the first to use directly applied force to determine how a molecule makes a three - dimensional bundle , a tertiary structure .
No other research has tracked the formation of such a complex structure , fold by fold .
Previous studies typically have used biochemical techniques rather than lasers , which can directly grab and tug the RNA .
Biochemical techniques give less clear estimates of how molecules fold in real time .
They often give a description of the molecule 's average folding behavior , which must be interpreted by mathematical models .
Crystallography - a technique involving freezing the molecule in place - provides a good picture of its shape , but not how it forms or the energy involved .
" What we 're interested in is understanding , in a very fundamental way , how biomolecules take the shapes they do , and how they perform the functions they do , " Block said .
" No one has been able to explore in great detail tertiary structure yet . "
RNA riboswitches must have this tertiary structure to work .
" Most RNAs just make secondary [ two - dimensional ] structure .
But the ones that really do stuff , " he added , " those all have tertiary structure . "
What RNA can do
RNA has the job of copying the genetic code from DNA ( transcription ) , and using that code to build the proteins organisms need to live ( translation ) .
To make RNA , a protein called RNA polymerase moves along the length of a strand of DNA .
It reads a pattern in the building blocks of DNA , nucleic acids whose names are abbreviated A , C , G and T , and it makes RNA with a complementary pattern .
This long strand of RNA is then the recipe for a specific protein .
Another structure called a " ribosome , " which is also made of RNA , then reads this recipe and makes a protein to order .
The RNA copied from DNA generally does not twist up very much , often only forming two - dimensional loops or tight bends called " hairpins . "
Occasionally , its loops and hairpins form a three - dimensional structure that does nothing .
Sometimes , though , this snarl of loops and hairpins works as a riboswitch .
The RNA begins to bundle up while it is being made , so the jumbled portion is attached to a tail still under construction .
The riboswitch must have a tertiary structure , because it likes to make a pocket and grab small molecules .
When a riboswitch clutches the right molecule , it folds up even more tightly , tugging on its own incipient long tail and changing its shape in a way that will affect its eventual protein product .
That RNA tail usually has a hairpin fold that straightens out when pulled .
By tugging out this kink in the RNA , a riboswitch changes how the RNA is translated into protein , effectively turning the gene on or off .
The riboswitch Block 's team studied grabbed onto a molecule called adenine , the nucleic acid dubbed " A . "
Whenever the riboswitch gripped a free - floating adenine , a gene that makes a protein crucial to adenine production stopped working correctly .
The RNA responsible for translating it to the protein had changed shape .
The riboswitch regulated how much adenine was available in the cell ; when there was plenty , it shut down the adenine factory .
Before scientists discovered riboswitches , they thought only proteins controlled genes this way .
" Your average RNA at random is not going to do that , " Block said .
" These are highly evolved things . "
The closest look
The researchers who study molecular folding in Block 's lab cannot actually see an RNA molecule under the microscope , but they can see two polystyrene beads ; they attach one on either end , and that creates a dumbbell shape the laser beams can manipulate .
Their largest beads are 1,000 nanometers across , so 1,000 of them lined up would be a millimeter long .
The beads are enormous relative to the RNA , and so are the lasers holding them .
To keep the lasers from coming too close together and merging their light into a single beam , the researchers need to attach some extra length to the RNA .
To do this , they tack a long strand of DNA on one side .
Under the microscope , the two plastic beads look like tiny pearls against a gray backdrop .
The researchers pull the beads apart , taking into account two factors : force and extension .
By understanding how much force it takes to cause a certain amount of extension of the RNA , they can describe with unsurpassed accuracy how the folds form and the energy needed to make each fold happen .
" When you pull it apart , different structures will pop open - pop , pop , pop-and you can see the order in which different structural elements get pulled apart , " Block said .
" You can map out the order in which the pieces come together , for both folding and unfolding . "
Learning by force
To build a clear picture of how their riboswitch folded in real time , the researchers mapped out the energy of the molecule 's folding based on the forces required to uncurl it and the time the RNA took to re-curl .
Block calls the energy graph the " crown jewel of the work , " adding that " all the numbers you 'd like to know about this folding sequence are right in front of you in that diagram . "
Block 's team could only attain this detailed " energy landscape " of the RNA 's folding by physically toying with the molecule .
The particular RNA they studied folds four times , and each time it adopts a more stable , more comfortable configuration with lower energy .
If it grabs an adenine , it hangs on tightly because it is in its most stable state .
But because molecules are always jiggling , sometimes a fold pops open briefly .
The more stable each fold is , the less likely it is to come undone .
The researchers stretched out the RNA to study all four folded states , noting how stable each one was .
Using force , Block 's team described not only the energy of each fold in the RNA , but the energy it needed to go from one folded state to the next , and how often the folds popped open and closed in real time .
The researchers watching little white beads move under the microscope got the closest look yet at how a molecule with a three - dimensional structure behaves in life , thanks to a pair of keen , green lasers and a little judicious tugging .
" It 's so cool to be able to take a single molecule and bend it to your will , " Block said .

Some exercise is better than none ; more exercise is generally better than less , and no exercise can be disastrous .
by eMedExpert staff
Medical references reviewed : August , 2018
We all unconsciously know that exercise is good for us .
It is fair to say that everyone wants to be healthy .
At the same time , it is probably equally fair to say that most of us are not exercising enough .
You can find a number of tips , tricks and hacks on how to get motivation to do just about everything , including exercising .
The main incentive that can make you start exercising is overall health improvement .
But what exactly exercise can do for you ?
Here is the list of scientifically proven health benefits the regular exercise brings .
It is never late to begin exercising5 .
Regular physical activity provides benefits to men and women of all ages .
1 Longevity
People who are physically active live longer .
Regular exercise reduces the risk of dying prematurely 4,5 .

2 New brain cells development
Exercise stimulates the formation of new brain cells ( neurons ) 6, 7 .
Also , exercise strengthens connections between those cells .
The areas of the brain that are stimulated through exercise are associated with memory and learning .
Researches from the Netherlands found that decline in cognitive functioning is associated with a higher mortality risk3
3 Cognitive and mental function enhancement
Physical activity improves cognitive performance , information processing and may delay cognitive impairment and dementia1,2 .
For instance , older people who are involved in regular physical work , excercise or other activity perform better in tests which require them to use their memory , solve prolems and make decisions .
And what about children ?
University of Illinois researchers8,9 have found that physical activity may enhance the academic achievements of children by improving their attention and working memory skills .
Lack of physical activity is one of the major risk factors for cardiovascular diseases
4 Prevention of cardiovascular disease
There is a direct relation between lack of physical activity and death from cardiovascular disease10 .
Regular physical activity makes your heart , like any other muscle , stronger .
A stronger heart can pump more blood with less effort .
Regular exercise protects from heart disease by lowering blood pressure , increasing levels of good HDL cholesterol , reducing levels of bad LDL cholesterol , and preventing blood clots formation .
In a long - term Swedish study women and men who were physically active at least twice a week had a 41 % lower risk of developing coronary heart disease than those who performed no physical activity11 .
5 Cholesterol lowering effect
Physical exercise favourably influences blood cholesterol levels by decreasing LDL cholesterol , triglycerides and total cholesterol and increasing HDL cholesterol12,13 .
Physical exercise positively alters cholesterol metabolism by increasing the production and action of several enzymes in the muscles and liver that function to convert some of the cholesterol to a more favorable form , such as HDL - cholesterol .
6 Prevention and control of type 2 diabetes
There is strong evidence 14,15 ( e.g. Finnish Diabetes Prevention Study and the Diabetes Prevention Program in the USA ) that moderate physical activity combined with weight loss and balanced diet can reduce the risk risk of developing diabetes in high - risk individuals by 50 - 60 % .
People with impaired glucose regulation may delay the onset of type 2 diabetes or prevent it altogether by doing regular physical excercise as it is improves their insulin resistance and glucose tolerance .
7 Blood pressure lowering
The ways by which exercise can cause a reduction in blood pressure are unclear , but all forms of exercise seem to be effective in reducing blood pressure .
Regular exercise decreases blood pressure in approximately 75 % of hypertensive persons with an average decrease of 11 and 8 Hg mm for systolic and diastolic blood pressure respectively 17 .
Regular exercise may decrease blood pressure in overweight and obese persons even without changes in body weight .
Aerobic exercise produces slightly greater blood pressure lowering effect in people with hypertension than in people with normal blood pressure .
Low physical activity increases the risk of hypertension16 .
8 Prevention of neoplastic ( cancer ) diseases
Evidence exists that physical activity may be associated with a lower risk of several common forms of cancer , most notably colon and breast cancer18,19 .
9 Reduced risk of stroke
Research data indicates that moderate and high levels of physical activity may reduce the risk of total , ischemic , and hemorrhagic strokes20 .
This is extremely important for people aged 40 and more , as stroke risk may be lowered by as much as 50 percent in people who engage in regular physical activity and as a result have better physical function .
Stroke risk reduction is relative to people who have problems with usual activities like klimbing stairs , kneeling , or bending .
10 Weight control
Regular physical activity helps to reach and maintain a healthy weight .
If you take in more calories than needed in a day , exercise offsets a caloric overload and controls body weight .
It speeds the rate of energy use , resulting in increased metabolism .
When metabolism increases through exercise , you will maintain the faster rate for longer periods of a day .
11 Muscle strength
Clinical studies21 repeatedly show that strength training increases muscle strength and decreases body fat .
12 Attractive body
With perfect body you look better in clothes and you look better naked .
Exercise helps reduce body fat by building muscle mass .
Both resistance and aerobic exercise improve body composition even without dieting22 .
13 Bone strength
An active lifestyle benefits bone density .
Regular weight - bearing exercise promotes bone formation , delays bone loss and may protect against osteoporosis ( form of bone loss associated with aging ) 23 .
14 Strong immune system
Regular moderate exercise training is beneficial for immune function .
The findings from some studies support the possibility that exercise may delay immunosenescence ( age dependent decline in immune function ) 24 .

15 Better night sleep
If you suffer from poor sleep , daily exercise can make the difference .
The natural dip in body temperature five to six hours after exercise may help to fall asleep .
Researches from the Stanford University School of Medicine25 found that regular exercise provides improvement in general quality of sleep , quicker sleep - onset , longer sleep duration and feeling rested in the morning .
16 Better sex life
Regular exercise maintains or improves sex life .
Physical improvements in muscle strength and tone , endurance , body composition and cardiovascular function can all enhance sexual functioning in both men and women .
Men who exercise regularly are less likely to have erectile dysfunction and impotence26 .
17 Back pain remedy
Regular physical excercise is a good method to prevent back pain .
It makes your muscles stronger and more flexible , and improves your postore .
High quality studies 27 prove that exercise is effective for recurrent low back pain .
18 Stress management
Physical activity stimulates release of chemicals called endorphins .
Endorphinss give you a feeling of happiness and positively affect your overall sense of well - being .
19 Alternative to antidepressants
Study after study has shown that exercise promotes mental health and reduces symptoms of depression 28,29 .
The antidepressant effect of regular physical exercise is comparable to the potent antidepressants .
According to research about 30 minutes of exercise per day for 3 - 5 days per week can significantly improve symptoms of depression .
However , smaller amounts of activity ( as little as 10 to 15 minutes at a time ) have been shown to improve mood in the short term .
Severe , exhaustive exercise delays gastric emptying , interferes with gastrointestinal absorption , and may provoke heartburn and gastrointestinal bleeding .
20 Gastrointestinal tract benefits
Exercise is beneficial for persons suffering from cholelithiasis and constipation .
Physical activity may reduce the risk of diverticulosis , gastrointestinal haemorrhage , and inflammatory bowel disease31 .
21 Therapy for postmenopausal women
High - intensity exercise significantly reduces negative changes related to the menopausal transition30 .

Scientists See Far - Off Solar System Much Like Ours Scientists spot star with five planets .
Could one have water ?
Nov. 6 , 2007  --
Far away , around a star in the constellation Cancer the crab , scientists say they have discovered new evidence that we may not be alone .
A group of scientists working in Hawaii and California reported today that the star 55 Cancri has a complete solar system -- five planets , in almost circular orbits , at least one of which seems to be in the star 's " habitable zone , " where temperatures are likely to be right for liquid water to exist .
It has been more than a decade since astronomers found the first so - called " exoplanets " -- planets orbiting other stars -- and the total count is now more than 250 .
But most of them were vastly larger than the Earth and followed lopsided , elliptical orbits .
If they orbited close enough to their host stars to be warm , they would alternately fry and freeze -- not the best conditions for life to take root .
" This discovery of the first - ever quintuple planetary system has me jumping out of my socks , " said Geoff Marcy , an astronomer at the University of California at Berkeley who is one of the world 's leading discoverers of far - away planets .
" We now know that our sun and its family of planets is not unusual . "
Marcy and other scientists have been scanning the heavens , openly hoping to find planets like Earth .
" This discovery shows that our Milky Way contains billions of planetary systems , " said Marcy .
Slight Wobble Proves Noteworthy
The scientists who reported the find today said they have been watching 55 Cancri for 18 years , using the Keck Observatory in Hawaii and the Lick Observatory in California as part of a project funded by NASA and the National Science Foundation .
The star is 41 light years away , more than 240 trillion miles .
Because of the great distances , they could not directly see the planets , but they could watch the star wobbling , ever so slightly , because of the gravity exerted on it by the planets as they orbited .
Then they did the math .
They concluded that one of the planets is in an orbit about 72.5 million miles from the star , taking 260 Earth days to circle it once .
It 's therefore closer to its host star than the Earth is to the sun ( 93 million miles ) -- but they said that is a promising sign because 55 Cancri is slightly fainter than the sun is .
" This object , " said Jonathan Lunine of the University of Arizona at Tucson , " would have a very temperate climate .
It would be a little bit warmer than the Earth , but not very much . "
Is there a prospect for life on that distant world ?
Any answer to that question , said the scientists , would be pure conjecture .
But Debra Fisher , an astronomer from San Francisco State University , pointed out that our Earth would be too small to be seen from other stars if there were anyone out there using technology like ours .
It 's quite possible , she said , that 55 Cancri has more planets in its temperate zone -- and even moons around those planets -- that we can not see .
" There could be Earths , there could be 10 Earth - mass planets , and we would just not have detected them , " she said .
This discovery , said the researchers , raises the odds other worlds are capable of supporting life .
Space telescopes of the future , flying above the Earth 's atmosphere , may be able to spot them .
" There may be terrestrial planets around most stars , " said Lunine .
We just have n't found them yet . "
Aging Infrastructure
by Ron Paul by Ron Paul
DIGG THIS
The recent and tragic bridge collapse in Minnesota raises many questions in Americans ’ minds about our aging infrastructure , and what is being done to maintain it .
Questions such as : " Was I - 35 an isolated accident or are we approaching days when crumbling bridges and bursting pipes will be regular features on the evening news ? "
The poor ratings on the inspection report of that bridge , and similar deficiency findings on as many as 25 % of our bridges suggests the latter .
Estimates on what it will cost to bring deficiencies in our infrastructure back up to par range from massive to astronomical .
Billions of tax dollars at all levels of government are devoted to infrastructure , but one problem is that politicians love to cut ribbons .
Political capital is gained not from maintaining or repairing our systems , but from building new bridges , new stadiums , and new roads , often of questionable real utility .
Seldom is there a ceremony or photo opportunity for repairing or maintaining something already in place .
As the so - called Highway Trust Fund is set to go bankrupt as early as 2009 , private investment firms are gearing up for partnerships , which could be a positive step , if handled sensibly .
What we need to avoid are items such as the Trans Texas Corridor ( TTC ) , which is phase 1 of the NAFTA Super Highway .
The Spanish firm Cintra is set to take over toll collections after the TTC ’s completion ; however it is unclear that they ’ll have any obligations for maintenance .
The cost is being socialized , while the profit is privatized , effectively making the American people pay for it twice .
Infrastructure , in a capitalist model , is an asset worthy of maintaining to ensure continuity of revenue .
In a government - controlled model infrastructure is nothing but a cumbersome liability .
This should be taken into consideration when developing plans to keep our current infrastructure safe .
Privatization should be used to encourage maintenance and safety , and where private companies truly invest and bear the upfront costs in return for ability to collect tolls or usage fees in some form .
But public / private partnerships that look more like corporate welfare must be avoided .
We should re-examine how we handle the taxes we collect for infrastructure and how we allocate that money .
At the very least reins need to be put on the Highway Trust Fund .
Funds collected from the gas tax should go into the Trust Fund — period .
Even the most ardent liberal and passionate conservative can agree that when they pay gasoline taxes , the least they expect is a road and bridge system that wo n’t crumble beneath their feet .
Before any subsidies or welfare payments are paid out , before social security is handed out to illegal immigrants , or health care is given to everyone , before bridges to nowhere are built at home , or entire countries bombed and rebuilt abroad , before any other myriad of exotic government projects are even considered , infrastructure should be attended to and taken seriously .

Future values
A previous post described future values ( or simply “ futures ” ) , which are values depend on information from the future , e.g. , from the real world .
There I gave a simple denotational semantics for future values as time / value pairs .
This post describes the multi- threaded implementation of futures in Reactive ‘s Data .
Reactive module .
A simple representation
Futures are represented as actions that deliver a value .
These actions are required to yield the same answer every time .
Having a special representation for the future that never arrives ( mempty ) will allow for some very important optimizations later .
data Future a = Future ( IO a ) | Never
A value can be “ forced ” from a future .
If the value is n’t yet available , forcing will block .
force :: Future a -> IO a force ( Future io ) = io force Never = hang -- block forever
Threads and synchronization
The current implementation of futures uses Concurrent Haskell ‘s forkIO ( fork a thread ) and MVar s ( synchronized communication variables ) .
Except for trivial futures ( pure / return and mempty ) , the action in a future will simply be reading an MVar .
Internal to the implementation :
newFuture :: IO ( Future a , a -> IO ( ) ) newFuture = do v <- newEmptyMVar return ( Future ( readMVar v ) , putMVar v )
The MVar is written to as the final step of a forked thread .
Importantly , it is to be written only once .
( It ’s really an IVar . )
future :: IO a ->
Future a future mka = unsafePerformIO $ do ( fut , sink ) <- new Future forkIO $ mka >>= sink return fut
Note that the actual value is computed just once , and is accessed cheaply .
Functor , Applicative , and Monad
The Functor , Applicative , and Monad instances are defined easily in terms of future and the corresponding instances for IO :
instance Functor Future where fmap f ( Future get ) = future ( fmap f get ) fmap _ Never = Never instance Applicative Future where pure a = Future ( pure a ) Future getf <*>
Future getx = future ( getf <*> getx ) _ <*> _ = Never instance Monad Future where return = pure Future geta >>= h = future ( geta >>= force . h)
Never >>= _ = Never
Monoid — racing
The remaining class to implement is Monoid .
The mempty method is Never .
The mappend method is to select the earlier of two futures , which is implemented by having the two futures race to extrat a value :
instance Monoid ( Future a ) where mempty =
Never mappend = race race :: Future a -> Future a ->
Future a
Racing is easy in the case either is Never :
Never `race` b = b a `race` Never = a
Otherwise , spin a thread for each future .
The winner kills the loser .
a `race` b = unsafePerformIO $ do ( c, sink ) <- new Future let run fut tid = forkIO $ do x <- force fut kill Thread tid sink x mdo ta <- run a tb tb <- run b ta return ( ) return c
The problem
This last piece of the implementation can fall short of the semantics .
For a `mappend` b , we might get b instead of a even if they ’re available simultaneously .
It ’s even possible to get the later of the two if they ’re nearly simultaneous .
Edit ( 2008 -02-02 ) : although simultaneous physical events are extremely unlikely , futures are compositional , so it ’s easy to construct two distinct but simultaneous futures in terms of on a common physical future .
What will it take to get deterministic semantics for a `mappend` b ?
Here ’s an idea : include an explicit time in a future .
When one future happens with a time t , query whether the other one occurs by the same time .
What does it take to support this query operation ?
A simpler implementation
In this implementation , futures ( other than Never ) hold actions that typically read an MVar that is written only once .
They could instead simply hold lazy values .
data Future a = Future a | Never
Forcing a future evaluates to weak head normal form ( WHNF ) .
force :: Future a -> IO a force ( Future a ) = a `seq` return a force Never = hang
Making new future would work almost identically , just adding an unsafePerformIO .
newFuture :: IO ( Future a , a -> IO ( ) ) newFuture = do v <- newEmptyMVar return ( Future ( unsafePerformIO $ readMVar v ) , putMVar v )
The Functor , Applicative , and Monad instances simplify considerably , using function application directly , instead of the corresponding methods from the Functor , Applicative , and Monad instances of IO .
instance Functor Future where fmap f ( Future a ) = Future ( f a ) fmap _ Never = Never instance Applicative Future where pure a = Future a Future f <*>
Future x = Future ( f x ) _ <*> _ = Never instance Monad Future where return = pure Future a >>= h = h a Never >>= _ = Never
The Monoid instance is completely unchanged .
How does this implementation compare with the one above ?
It ’s simpler , as stated .
It ’s a bit more efficient .
Each MVar is only read once .
Also , the Functor , Applicative , and Monad instances no longer create threads and MVars .
, , and instances no longer create threads and MVars .
The type statically enforces that forcing a future always gives the same result .
Forcing a future reduces the value to WHNF and so is probably a little less lazy than the implementation above .
I ’ve tried out this implementation and found that it intermittently crashes some examples that work fine in the IO version .
I have no idea why , and I ’d be very interested in ideas about it or anything else in this post .
Future values A previous post described future values ( or simply “ futures ” ) , which are values depend on information from the future , e.g. , from the real world .
There I gave a simple ...

ツッコミ やTrackBackを狙ったspamが増えています。日記を書いている自分では気づいていないかも知れませんが、フィード(RSS)経由で日記を読んでいると、かなりの数のツッコミspamを読まされることになって、読者が迷惑していることが少なくありません。
tDiary 2.2からは標準でspamフィルタが付属していますが、適切な設定をしないとspamを撃退することができません。読者のためにも、きちんとspamフィルタを設定しましょう。
この記事では、最低限の設定で効果的にspamを撃退できるフィルタの設定方法をお教えします。
メール欄をトラップにする 「 hide - mail - fieldプラグイン 」 のっけから標準のspamフィルタでない機能ですが、最近のspamには非常に効果がある方法です。この手法では、「人間には見えないがspamボット
には見える」というトラップ(罠)用のフィールドを用意して、そこにおびき出します。うまいトラップを用意できれば、かなりの割合のspamを撃退できます。
tDiaryのツッコミフォームには、名前、E-mail、本文のフィールドがありますが、このうちE-mail欄は必須ではありません。E-mail欄を人間には見えないようにすることで、「E-mailを入力してあるツッコミはspam」という判断をします。
設定は以下の手順で行います : 設定ページの 「 プラグイン選択 」( 基本カテゴリ ) から「 hide - mail - field.rb」を選択して有効にします。 これだけではspamフィルタは有効になりません。続いて「spamフィルタ」(セキュリティカテゴリ)を開きます。
「 ツッコミのメールアドレスが以下のパターンに当てはまる場合はspamとみなす。正規表現が使えます」の内容に「@」を入力してOKします。 これで、E-mail欄に「@」(メールアドレスに必ず含まれる文字)が入っているツッコミはすべてspamと見なせます。人間がツッコミフォームを見ると、E-mail欄が消えていることがわかります。 また、万が一E-mail欄が消えないブラウザを使っている人のために、ツッコミ欄の注意書きを書き換えておきましょう。設定ページに「メール欄隠し」(セキュリティカテゴリ)が増えているので、そこに「spam対策でE-mail欄は隠してあります。もしE-mail欄が見えていても、何も入力しないで下さい。」のような注意書きを加えておきましょう
。
ツッコミに含まれ るURLの数を制限する ほとんどのツッコミspamは、自サイトへ誘導したり、メールで問合せをしてもらうことが目的です。後者については最初の「E-mail欄トラップ」で捕まえられますが、本文にURLを書き込んでいくタイプについては、別の手法が必要です。 標準のspamフィルタには「ツッコミ中のURLの数」を制限する設定があるので、これを制限しましょう。ここに2〜5程度の数値を設定しておくことで、複数のURLを本文に入れていくspamをはじくことができます。この数値は、あなたの日記の読者の傾向から、正当なツッコミなら何個以下だろう、という経験則で導き出します。 また、HTMLの断片を書き込んでいくspamも多いです。このため、「href=」のようなリンクを生成するHTMLに必ず含まれるような文字列をキーにしてspam判定をするのも得策です。「ツッコミ本文が以下のパターンに当てはまる場合はspamとみなす。」の設定に「href=」を入力しておくと効果的です。
リンクのな いTrackBackをはじく TrackBack機能を有効にしている人も多いでしょう。TrackBackは自動的に相互リンクを生成することに使われるのが一般的ですが、TrackBack spamでは、TrackBackを受け付ける側へのリンクを張らず、一方的に逆リンクを生成しようとするものがほとんどです。 そこで、TrackBackを受信したら、送付元の内容を調べて、自分のサイトへのリンクがなければspamとみなすフィルタが装備されています。以下のように設定します : 設定ページから「 spamフィルタ」(セキュリティカテゴリ)を選択します。
「 内容によるフィルタ」の一番最後に「 TrackBack送信元の」……という項目があります。ここを「中に自サイトへのリンクがあれば受信する」にしてOKします。 これで設定は完了です。TrackBack spamのほとんどはこれで撃退できるでしょう。
President Putin has acted against the activities of foreign NGOs
The Russian foreign ministry said the council , which promotes British culture abroad , was operating illegally .
The British PM 's office denied that the Council had acted illegally .
Russian officials have said the move was a retaliatory measure in the ongoing dispute over the London murder of Russian exile Alexander Litvinenko .
Relations between the UK and Russia have worsened since the former KGB agent was murdered in November 2006 .
In July , Britain expelled four Russian diplomats over Moscow 's refusal to extradite a key suspect in the murder .
Russia followed by expelling four British diplomats .
NGOs curbed
Russian foreign ministry officials said the British Council had violated Russian laws , including tax regulations .
The Russian Foreign Minister linked the move to the Litvinenko case
But in an interview with the BBC , Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov explicitly linked the order to Britain 's expulsion of Russian diplomats in July .
He said Russia had been left with no choice but to retaliate over the affair .
Both the British Council and the UK Foreign Office said the council was fully compliant with Russian tax laws and operates on the basis of an agreement signed in the 1990s .
The council announced three months ago that it was closing nine regional offices by the end of the year and transferring operations to Russian partners .
Those closures leave the headquarters in Moscow , plus offices in St Petersburg and Yekaterinburg .
But a spokesman for UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown rejected the Russian allegations .
" The British Council 's activities in Russia are compliant with Russian and international law under the Vienna Convention and the 1994 cultural agreement between Britain and Russia , " he said .
" The Council is fully entitled to operate in Russia , both in Moscow and elsewhere .
We , the Council and its Russian partner organisations have every intention that its programme will continue , " the spokesman said .
A British Council spokeswoman told the BBC that the council intends to continue its operations in Russia at the three remaining offices .
The council is a registered charity funded by the British government .
Its stated purpose is to promote British culture and education and build relationships between people in the UK and other countries .
Moscow has acted to curb NGOs in recent years , accusing foreign governments of using them for political purposes .
The new IE8 version targeting switch , announced on IEBlog and A List Apart , has been the talk of the web .
Some web standards experts , like Eric Meyer and Jeffrey Zeldman see the switch in a positive light .
Others , including Dean Edwards , Robert O’Callahan and Anne van Kesteren think the proposal is a bad idea .
We do n’t talk much about what other browsers are doing on this blog .
While we ’re happy to collaborate on web standards and testing , and sometimes share a little friendly rivalry , we try to keep our focus on making the best Web browser engine we can , not on the competition .
So we ’re not going to give in - depth commentary on the IE team ’s decision .
Straddling compatibility and Web standards is a tough job requiring tough choices .
However , some have asked if other browser engines , including WebKit , would adopt a similar version switch .
For example , the original announcement asks , “ I , for one , hope other browser vendors join Microsoft in implementing this functionality . ”
I ca n’t make any definitive statement for all time , but such an approach does not seem like a good idea to us currently .
Why , you may ask ?
There are a few reasons .
Mode Switches in WebKit
WebKit , like most browser engines , has a quirks mode that is triggered by certain old HTML doctypes , or lack of a doctype declaration in text / html .
Documents with newer or unknown doctypes , or sent as XML , are processed in standards mode .
Like Mozilla and Opera , we apply only a limited set of nonstandard behaviors in quirks mode , and otherwise fix bugs across both modes , if they do not have a specific significant impact on Web compatibility .
This is in contrast to the IE approach of completely freezing old behavior in quirks mode .
We actually have a few modes besides that .
A handful of doctypes trigger what is called “ almost standards mode ” , which is standards mode with one minor deviation , mainly affecting how images lay out in table cells ; this is copied from Mozilla .
In addition , we have a few rendering and DOM differences between documents served with an XML MIME type and those served with an HTML MIME type , but we are trying to reduce these over time .
And finally , we have a Dashboard compatibility mode that has a few extra quirks beyond quirks mode , to handle Dashboard widgets that were coded to depend on old WebKit bugs .
Maintainability
As you can see , this is quite a few modes already .
Having lots of modes raises a number of challenges for maintaining the engine .
First , the more different modes there are , the harder it is to fully test the engine .
We have an aggressive approach to automated testing , and our layout tests often find critical problems before they are shipped or even checked in .
Having more modes means many things need to be tested in multiple modes .
So that ’s more tests , more time for developers to run the test suite , and more chances of missing code coverage , especially when different modes interact .
Second , implementing mode switches hurts hackability of the code .
Hackability is one of our core project goals .
It ’s part of the reason new contributors can dive in quickly , and enables us to rapidly develop new features , while improving performance , stability , and security .
There ’s two plausible ways to add more modes .
One is to make all engine changes conditional on a version flag .
Another is to have a whole second copy of the layout code .
Either would be a huge additional barrier to entry for developers , and would make it harder to maintain the code .
So , bottom line , we ’d like to see fewer modes , not more .
Mobile - Readiness
In addition to maintainability , an important feature of the WebKit engine is the ease with which it is deployed on limited - capability devices such as mobile phones .
Some of the more prominent examples include Nokia ’s S60 Browser , Apple ’s iPhone and iPod touch , and Google ’s Android platform .
These and other products all include a full - powered version of WebKit , no compromises .
However , having more mode switches cuts against this .
The extra code ( possibly whole extra copies of the engine , at the very least a whole lot of extra if statements ) would be a significant burden on mobile devices .
It ’s not very well aligned with our mission of staying lean and mean .
Commitment to Standards and Interoperability
Yet another reason we feel more mode switches are not a good idea for WebKit is our commitment to Web standards , and to interoperability with other browsers .
We strongly believe that Web standards are the path forward for interoperability , and we work closely with Web standards groups and other browser vendors to align behavior .
Part of this commitment is delivering standards - compliant behavior out of the box .
We do n’t ask you to set a special preference , or to add extra markup to your web page , or anything else beyond the long established standards mode switch .
That means WebKit can truly pass standards - based tests like Acid2 and someday the forthcoming Acid3 , and we ’ll work more like other standards - based browsers over time .
In general , web developers are happy to get automatic ever - advancing standards support from our engine , and indeed our support for advanced CSS3 properties has unleashed a wave of creativity in iPhone web apps .
Reducing Engine Fragmentation
Another key reason to avoid more modes is to reduce the number of different compatibility profiles that web content authors have to deal with .
With many different vendors shipping WebKit - based products , we rely a lot on the fact that uptake of WebKit - based browsers is really fast .
Already many web developers are focusing primarily on Safari 3 and not Safari 2 , because in only a few months the majority of users have upgraded .
But locking in compatibility would mean you have to think about the compatibility profiles of old browsers a lot longer .
And no one wants to think about the state of the engine in Safari 2 – I sure do n’t !
We made thousands of fixes and improvements and those fixes deserve to stick .
We Don’t Really Need It
Finally , while we sympathize with the tough road that the IE team has to travel to achieve a high degree of standards compliance , we have n’t really experienced the same problem .
The IE team has mentioned severe negative feedback on the IE7 release , due to sites expecting standards behavior from most browsers , but IE6 bugs from IE .
But WebKit already has a high degree of standards compliance .
And we are not in the enviable but tough position of being the most widely used browser .
The fixes we do for standards compliance rarely cause widespread destruction , and when they do , it ’s often a sign that the standards themselves may need revision .
We do not get complaints from web content authors about their sites breaking , on the contrary we get a lot of praise for each version of the engine handling web sites better .
Conclusion
So , in conclusion , we do n’t see a great need to implement version targeting in Safari .
We think maintaining multiple versions of the engine would have many downsides for us and little upside .
The IE team is , of course , under different constraints and free to make their own choices .
IN the summer of 1984 , Burt Shavitz , a beekeeper in Maine , picked up Roxanne Quimby , a 33 - year - old single mother down on her luck , as she hitchhiked to the post office in Dexter , Me . More than a dozen years Ms. Quimby ’s senior , the guy locals called “ the bee - man ” sold honey in pickle jars from the back of his pickup truck .
To Ms. Quimby , he seemed to be living an idyllic life in the wilderness ( including making his home inside a small turkey coop ) .
She offered to help Mr. Shavitz tend to his beehives .
The two became lovers and eventually birthed Burt ’s Bees , a niche company famous for beeswax lip balm , lotions , soaps and shampoos , as well as for its homespun packaging and feel - good , eco-friendly marketing .
The bearded man whose image is used to peddle the products is modeled after Mr. Shavitz .
Today , the couple ’s quirky enterprise is owned by the Clorox Company , a consumer products giant best known for making bleach , which bought it for $ 913 million in November .
Clorox plans to turn Burt ’s Bees into a mainstream American brand sold in big - box stores like Wal - Mart .
Along the way , Clorox executives say , they plan to learn from unusual business practices at Burt ’s Bees  many centered on environmental sustainability .
Clorox , the company promises , is going green .
But not even Clorox can sanitize the details of a fallout between Mr. Shavitz and Ms. Quimby that began in the late 1990s  when Ms. Quimby managed to buy out the bee - man for a low , six - figure sum .
She has been paid more than $ 300 million for her stake in Burt ’s Bees , and she spends her time traveling , refurbishing fancy homes in Florida and preserving large tracts of land in Maine .
Burt himself , now 72 , makes his home again in the converted turkey coop  expanded but without running water or electricity  but with $ 4 million or so to his name .
" Intellectual property " is one of those ideologically loaded terms that can cause an argument just by being uttered .
The term was n't in widespread use until the 1960s , when it was adopted by the World Intellectual Property Organization , a trade body that later attained exalted status as a UN agency .
WIPO 's case for using the term is easy to understand : people who've " had their property stolen " are a lot more sympathetic in the public imagination than " industrial entities who've had the contours of their regulatory monopolies violated " , the latter being the more common way of talking about infringement until the ascendancy of " intellectual property " as a term of art .
Does it matter what we call it ?
Property , after all , is a useful , well - understood concept in law and custom , the kind of thing that a punter can get his head around without too much thinking .
That 's entirely true - and it's exactly why the phrase " intellectual property " is , at root , a dangerous euphemism that leads us to all sorts of faulty reasoning about knowledge .
Faulty ideas about knowledge are troublesome at the best of times , but they 're deadly to any country trying to make a transition to a " knowledge economy " .
Fundamentally , the stuff we call " intellectual property " is just knowledge - ideas , words , tunes , blueprints , identifiers , secrets , databases .
This stuff is similar to property in some ways : it can be valuable , and sometimes you need to invest a lot of money and labour into its development to realise that value .
Out of control
But it is also dissimilar from property in equally important ways .
Most of all , it is not inherently " exclusive " .
If you trespass on my flat , I can throw you out ( exclude you from my home ) .
If you steal my car , I can take it back ( exclude you from my car ) .
But once you know my song , once you read my book , once you see my movie , it leaves my control .
Short of a round of electroconvulsive therapy , I can't get you to un - know the sentences you 've just read here .
It 's this disconnect that makes the " property " in intellectual property so troublesome .
If everyone who came over to my flat physically took a piece of it away with them , it 'd drive me bonkers .
I 'd spend all my time worrying about who crossed the threshold , I 'd make them sign all kinds of invasive agreements before they got to use the loo , and so on .
And as anyone who has bought a DVD and been forced to sit through an insulting , cack - handed " You would n't steal a car " short film knows , this is exactly the kind of behaviour that property talk inspires when it comes to knowledge .
But there 's plenty of stuff out there that 's valuable even though it 's not property .
For example , my daughter was born on February 3 , 2008 .
She 's not my property .
But she 's worth quite a lot to me .
If you took her from me , the crime would n't be " theft " .
If you injured her , it would n't be " trespass to chattels " .
We have an entire vocabulary and set of legal concepts to deal with the value that a human life embodies .
What 's more , even though she 's not my property , I still have a legally recognised interest in my daughter .
She 's " mine " in some meaningful sense , but she also falls under the purview of many other entities - the governments of the UK and Canada , the NHS , child protection services , even her extended family - they can all lay a claim to some interest in the disposition , treatment and future of my daughter .
Flexibility and nuance
Trying to shoehorn knowledge into the " property " metaphor leaves us without the flexibility and nuance that a true knowledge rights regime would have .
For example , facts are not copyrightable , so no one can be said to " own " your address , National Insurance Number or the PIN for your ATM card .
Nevertheless , these are all things that you have a strong interest in , and that interest can and should be protected by law .
There are plenty of creations and facts that fall outside the scope of copyright , trademark , patent and the other rights that make up the hydra of Intellectual Property , from recipes to phone books to " illegal art " like musical mashups .
These works are not property - and should n't be treated as such - but for every one of them , there 's an entire ecosystem of people with a legitimate interest in them .
I once heard the WIPO representative for the European association of commercial broadcasters explain that , given all the investment his members had put into recording the ceremony on the 60th anniversary of the Dieppe Raid in the second world war , they should be given the right to own the ceremony , just as they would own a teleplay or any other " creative work " .
I immediately asked why the " owners " should be some rich guys with cameras - why not the families of the people who died on the beach ?
Why not the people who own the beach ?
Why not the generals who ordered the raid ?
When it comes to knowledge , " ownership " just does n't make sense - lots of people have an interest in the footage of the Dieppe commemoration , but to argue that anyone " owns " it is just nonsensical .
Copyright - with all its quirks , exceptions and carve outs - was , for centuries , a legal regime that attempted to address the unique characteristics of knowledge , rather than pretending to be just another set of rules for the governance of property .
The legacy of 40 years of " property talk " is an endless war between intractable positions of ownership , theft and fair dealing .
If we 're going to achieve a lasting peace in the knowledge wars , it 's time to set property aside , time to start recognising that knowledge - valuable , precious , expensive knowledge - is n't owned .
Ca n't be owned .
The state should regulate our relative interests in the ephemeral realm of thought , but that regulation must be about knowledge , not a clumsy remake of the property system .
Last night I spoke to Adam Savage , co-host of MythBusters .
He 's in Alaska , where current temperatures range between 0 to 30 degrees below zero .
He just finished a test on " cabin fever " ( he would n't say how long he lasted before murdering his cabin mates and running out into the frozen wilderness wearning nothing but longjohns and a sleeping cap ) and is now working on another episode up in the 49th state .
But the real reason I talked to him was to find out about the next episode of MythBusters ( airing this Wednesday ) .
It tackles the famous " plane on a conveyor belt problem , " that has pitted brother against brother and friend against friend for years .
To get to the bottom of the thought - problem , Adam and Jamie used a real plane , in this case a 400 - lb ultralight , and a large conveyor belt .
Did the plane take off ?
You 'll have to wait until Wednesday to find out , but Adam said even the pilot guessed wrong .

Paedophile brain : Red areas show where white matter content is down
Researchers used sophisticated MRI scans to compare the brains of paedophiles and non-sexual criminals .
Paedophiles had significantly less of a substance called " white matter " , responsible for wiring the different parts of the brain together .
The study , by the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health in Toronto , appears in the Journal of Psychiatry Research .
Not being able to choose your sexual interests does n't mean you can't choose what you do "
Dr James Cantor
Centre for Addiction and Mental Health
The study follows work by Yale University which uncovered differences in the thought patterns of paedophiles .
They team found activity in parts of paedophiles ' brains were lower than in other volunteers when shown adult , erotic material .
It had been widely thought that paedophilia was triggered by childhood trauma or abuse .
However , the condition has also been linked to low IQ , suggesting a possible link to brain development .
Paedophiles are also three times more likely to be left - handed .
Lead researcher Dr James Cantor said the latest study found a signficant lack of white matter connecting six different areas of the brain all known to play a role in sexual arousal .
His theory is that the lack of adequate wiring between the different centres results in paedophiles not being able to differentiate between appropriate and inappropriate sexual objects .
No excuse
However , Dr Cantor stressed the latest study did not suggest that paedophiles could not be held criminally responsible for their actions .
He said : " Not being able to choose your sexual interests does n't mean you can't choose what you do . "
Dr Narender Ramnani , an expert in cognitive neuroscience at Royal Holloway University of London , was surprised by the results .
He said : " Environmental factors cause changes in the structure of the brain , so it is not clear whether these differences occur because of environmental factors , or whether these are in fact innate developmental traits that make people susceptable to such traits . "
A total of 127 men participated in the study ; approximately equal numbers of paedophiles and non-sexual offenders .
Update , easy way to make a Flutterfly
THIS IS AN UPDATE
First you need to create a postscript file .
I suggest you do your drawing in Inkscape .
It 's an open sourced program for vector drawing .
But not just that , it is the only app I have that lets me save drawings as //CLEAN / / postscript files that we can work with later .
So even if you do your original drawing in Illustrator , save it as a .SVG and reopen it in Inkscape , and from that application save your drawing as a .ps file .
Postscript .
Don Lancaster wrote some postscript code that can take a post script file and then turn it into a simple text file that contains the numbers 0 - 7 .
The meaning : 0 - E1 - NE2 - N3 - NW4 - W5 - SW6 - S7 - SEU means move the pen upD means move the pen downand that 's all we 're going to be using=========================ALL
FILES CAN BE FOUND AT : For those who like to hear the instructions here 's a video:=========================Some people were having trouble figuring out how to create a flut file , so Bryn helped everyone out by creating this program that does it for you , make sure to send it a file that is " fair " , that is without any showpage 's , or quit commands in the .ps .
The program automatically spits them out , but check the ps if you hit the error page .
-- The old way to create a Flutterfy -- Once you saved your drawing as a postscript file .
Open it up in a text editor like notepad .
Also open up the file yourpostscripthere .ps in notepad .
Cope the entire body of your postscript drawing and paste it in flutterafy .
ps right after the line that says : % =============
YOUR POSTSCRIPT SOURCE FILE STARTS HERE =============== %
=============
MUST NOT INCLUDE SHOWPAGE , QUIT , ETC ...
===============then you paste your stuff in here %
==============
YOUR POSTSCRIPT SOURCE FILE ENDS HERE ================then change the paths in these two lines :/ destfilename ( c://pope.txt ) def(./pope.txt ) readflutfile % read selected flutfilechange these to the values you want to find your finished flut file at .
Resave yourpostscripthere.psand install http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/doc/GPL/index.htm
Ghostscript ] :
Once you have ghostscript installed you can either drag yourpostscripthere .ps to the icon , or open it up inside ghostscript , it 'll create a flutfile for you in the place you told it to c://whateveryousaid ( remember to use doube /'s like c://sommat // ..) So now you 'll have a flut file .
here 's a demo for ya :( this is the stencil that i cut out , it says " hello lasers ! " ) next you need to open a C compiler .
the old version of bloodshed DEV CPP works great !
Get v 4.0 , not the new one .
This is the flutafy .cpp file that you can edit to run your own flut file .
Right now if you compile it it will create an executable that will accept any filename as a parameter .
So you just drag your . txt or . flut file over to the .exe and it'll start chomping .
chompchompchomp .
I 'm providing this code so if you want to make any improvements you can .
Please share with me though .
If you do n't know much about programming .
Here is the executable :
And if you have XP you 'll need this one : XP users will need this DLL to run this code :( For instructions on how to install a DLL , Lifehacker has a nice one . )
Now you can drag any file that has 0 - 9 for step directions ( a flut file .
I have some in : http://modati.com/lasercutter/) and it will start communicating with the laser cutter you just made .
If your parallel port is plugged in and everything is working okay you should be cutting in no time !- LoveBilal Ghalib
New Reason.tv episode with Drew Carey
:
Vikki Reyes has had it with Locke High , the school her daughters attend in the Watts neighborhood of Los Angeles .
She walked in on class one day and recalls “ the place was just like a zoo ! ”
Students had taken control , while the teacher sat quietly with a book .
Frank Wells has also had it with Locke High .
When he became principal he says gangs ruled the campus .
He tried to turn things around but ran into a “ brick wall ” of resistance from the school district and teachers union .
Locke seemed destined to languish in high crime and low test scores until Wells , Reyes , and many reform - minded teachers joined with a maverick named Steve Barr in an attempt to break free from the status quo .
Their battle is just one example of the charter school education revolt that ’s erupting across the nation .
Joe Lieberman and Zell Miller both have a lot in common ; they are conservative Democrats who went from working with Republicans in a bipartisan manner to workingthem against Democrats .
Miller was a governor of Georgia and , briefly , a U.S. Senator .
He suffered a public nervous breakdown on the stage of the Republican National Convention when he endorsed Bush and viciously savaged his old friend and collegue John Kerry .
After Miller 's performace in 2004 , the DNC passed a rule , informally known as the Zell Miller rule , which disqualifies any elected Democrat who endorses a Republican from being a super delegate .
Yesterday the Chairman of the Connecticut Democratic Party , Nancy DiNardo , noting that Lieberman has endorsed McCain , said the Zell Miller rule clearly applies and that Lieberman has lost has status as one of Connecticut 's 12 super delegates .
I was wondering where that leaves reactionary Democratic congressional freshman Chris Carney , who denounced Hillary Clinton and declared that he would like seeing Republicans Mike Bloomberg and Chuck Hagel in the White House .
Is Carney going to be allowed to sit as a super delegate for Pennsylvania ?

PARIS ( Reuters ) - Vivendi condemned as “ indecent ” the contract terms between its Universal Music Group ( UMG ) unit and Apple Inc , the computer maker whose iTunes online store dominates the digital music market .

Vivendi condemned as " indecent " the contract terms between its Universal Music Group unit and Apple Inc , the computer maker whose iTunes online store dominates the digital music market .
REUTERS / Dylan Martinez / Files
Vivendi is one of many large media companies that are trying to challenge Apple ’s grip on the digital entertainment market and obtain more control over pricing .
It said it was in talks with rival distributors .
“ The split between Apple and ( music ) producers is indecent ...
Our contracts give too good a share to Apple , ” Vivendi Chief Executive Jean - Bernard Levy told reporters at a gathering on Monday organized by the association of media journalists in France .
At present , UMG , the world ’s largest record company , gets 0.70 euro ( $ 0.99 ) out of the 0.99 euro retail price charged by iTunes , Vivendi said .
Among other things , Levy called for the remuneration of a new release to be higher than for a 30 - year - old classic .
“ We should have a differentiated price system , ” he said .
UMG renews its music distribution contracts with Apple every month after having failed to agree a longer - term arrangement earlier this year .
The music publisher can end its contract with Apple at one month ’s notice , but Levy declined to say whether UMG was ready to bypass Apple altogether .
“ We are in a phase during which many different actors are talking to each other ...
We are trying to put in place several projects to ensure that music is better remunerated ...
We are not just talking to Apple , ” he said .
In August , NBC Universal , a unit of General Electric , decided against renewing its contract to sell television shows on iTunes and this month reached a deal to sell TV downloads to online retailer Amazon .
ARTIST’S IMAGE
Commenting on the outlook for revenues at UMG , Levy said : “ At constant exchange rates , we should probably be stable again in 2007 . ”
Fleshing out UMG ’s strategy , Levy said it planned to focus on better exploiting the “ monetization of an artist ’s image ” which included branded clothes and TV shows .
“ This is what we hope will revive our business , ” Levy said .
“ People indulge in piracy but spend a lot of money on many other things that are linked to an artist . ”
Levy forecast that “ in the not so distant future ” , traditional music products such as DVDs and CDs would make up less than 50 percent of music publishing revenues .
At the half - year stage , digital music sales made up 15 percent of UMG ’s total music revenue .
Separately , Levy said Vivendi expects the profitability of its pay - TV group Canal Plus to improve in 2007 , excluding restructuring costs .
“ We hope to generate , excluding restructuring costs , an EBIT margin of above 7 percent this year ” at Canal Plus , Levy said .
In 2006 , Canal Plus ’s earnings before interest and taxation ( EBIT ) reached between 4 and 5 percent of revenue , on a comparable basis excluding restructuring costs .
Levy said Canal Plus aimed to reach an operating margin of 20 percent by 2010 , matching the level of British rivals and narrowing the gap with U.S. peers with margins near 30 percent .
“ To get there , we need savings and particularly in ( TV ) content , ” Levy said , adding that Canal Plus planned to cut 200 to 250 million euros in TV content costs , which now hovered around 2 billion euros annually .
But Levy acknowledged that competition for good TV content such as film or sports rights remained high , particularly against new entrants such as France Telecom which he described as a “ semi- public company ” with deep pockets .
Vivendi shares closed down 1.2 percent at 29.74 euros .
This list is a combination of other lists I have already written about scientology but with more of a focus on the deaths caused by the organization .
Be sure to read the afterword for details on the up coming protests against the group .
“ I have taken what 1 consider to be the most expedient way out of my present predicament .
I harbor no resentment against anyone , except the Church of Scientology .
They have a great deal to do with my demise .
To play with people ’s defense mechanisms in the manner that they do is a criminal thing at best .
l hope they can be outlawed . ” — Suicide note by James Hester
10 . Scientology is a Secret Organization
The swift and calculated responses from the group have managed to do what no other organisation or government has done – censor certain information from the internet .
You can find out how to make a bomb on the internet , but you can not find out what you have to do to pass the top levels in the Church of Scientology .
Ironically , considering they are so secretive , it does not stop them using information taken from people they audit against them if they turn on the group .
This would be the same as a person confessing to a priest , leaving the Church , and having the priest publish their confession on the internet .
9. L. Ron Hubbard Was a Drug Abuser
L Ron Hubbard was a drug abuser , which is ironic considering the organisation is very anti-drugs and even runs an organisation called Narconon to help people get off drugs .
His son , Ronald , had this to say :
“ I have personal knowledge that my father regularly used illegal drugs including amphetamines , barbituates and hallucinogens .
He regularly used cocaine , peyote , and mescaline . ” — Ronald DeWolf a.k.a. L. Ron Hubbard , Jr. Affadavit in Schaick v. Church of Scientology , US District Court Mass. , No. 79-249
When Hubbard was in Las Palmas during 1967 he wrote a letter to his wife .
In it Hubbard tells his wife : “ I ’m drinking lots of rum and popping pinks and greys . ”
See the decision by Judge Paul G. Breckenridge , Jr. in Scientology v. Armstrong , Los Angeles Superior Court , Case No. C 420153 .
8. L. Ron Hubbard Was a Liar
Mr Hubbard told his followers that he was Nuclear Physicist :
Developed by L. Ron Hubbard , C.E. , Ph.D. , a nuclear physicist , Scientology has demonstrably achieved this long - sought goal .
Doctor Hubbard , educated in advanced physics and higher mathematics and also a student of Sigmund Freud and others , began his present researches thirty years ago at George Washington University .
[ Hubbard , “ P.E. Handout ” , HCO Information Letter of 14 April 1961 ]
In fact , Hubbard had no scientific degrees .
In February 1953 he decided to obtain a “ degree ” from Sequoia University , a notorious “ degree mill ” in Los Angeles that was eventually shut down by the Californian state government in 1958 .
[ Quoted in Russell Miller , Bare - Faced Messiah , page 212 ] .
7. Dirty Tricks
Scientology is famous for using dirty tricks against its detractors .
The worst of these tricks is called Fair Game .
The organisation claims to have ceased using fair game but many people have experienced harassment since that claim was made .
What is fair game ?
“ May be deprived of property or injured by any means by any Scientologist without any discipline of the Scientologist .
May be tricked , sued or lied to or destroyed . ”
Hubbard
As part of fair game , Scientology members have created and distributed pamphlets full of lies and slander against people who have publicly protested against them .
6. Anti-Psychiatry
Hubbard ( founder of Scientology ) decided that psychiatrists were an ancient evil that had been a problem for billions of years .
He taught that they assisted the evil alien Lord Xenu in his genocide 75 million years ago .
The results of Scientology ’s hatred of medicine and psychiatry has lead to numerous deaths .
The second half of this list describes five of those deaths :
5. Kyle Thomas Brennan
Kyle Brennan was a young man who suffered from depression .
He lived with his mother as his father ( a scientologist ) lived in Clearwater Florida to be close to the organization ’s headquarters .
The father regularly sent Scientology materials to his son which Kyle considered ridiculous .
Kyle visited his father for a holiday and died in his care .
According to Kyle ’s mother : “ I am uncertain as to what unfortunate events led to the tragic death of my dear son , who at the time was staying with his Scientologist father .
I can say that his depression medication was not found on his person when the police searched the crime scene .
I was also informed that when Kyle ’s father found him he waited forty - five minutes before calling for medical assistance .
He called a fellow Scientologist first , and then waited for him to arrive on the scene before calling an ambulance or the police . ”
4. Elli Perkins
On March 13 , 2003 , Jeremy Perkins , a 28 year old untreated schizophrenic , stabbed his mother Elli 77 times .
She bled to death on her bedroom floor .
Jeremy is currently being held at Rochester Psychiatric Center , having been found not responsible for Elli ’s murder by reason of mental disease or defect .
Jeremy , under the care of the CoS was taking vitamins for his mental disorder , rather than his prescribed schizophrenia medicine .
3. Josephus Havenith
An autopsy report lists his death as “ probable drowning ” but notes that his head was not under water .
He died in February 1980 at the Scientology Fort Harrison Hotel in a bathtub filled with water so hot it had burned his skin off .
2. Heribert Pfaff
According to the records , Heribert P. died august 28 , 1988 , during the night from a heavy epileptic attack .
He hit his head on the night table .
The scientology doctor reports that he prescribed vitamins for his patient - despite regular attacks - instead of treating him with proper medication .
Such medication was indeed not detected in his blood during the post - mortem examination .
1. Lisa McPherson
On December 5 , 1995 , Lisa McPherson died .
Scientology had held her against her will for 17 days .
During that time , she tried to leave , became violent , and refused to eat .
At the time of her death , she had bruises and abrasions on her body , and she had lost over 30 pounds in just 17 days .
Some text on this page is taken from the website Scientology Associated Deaths – I have shown just 5 of the many many deaths listed there .

Leo Laporte plays the “ what if ” game with the iPhone , more or less asking why anyone would buy a computer that did n’t support user - installable applications and was locked to one particular commercial network .
He ’s correct insofar as that the iPhone is , technically , a computer .
And Apple could promote it as such .
And , if they did , many of us — where by “ us ” I mean people like Leo , and me , and you , a reader of a site as nerdy as Daring Fireball — would be delighted .
But here ’s the thing :
Apple is n’t selling or promoting the iPhone as a general purpose handheld computer .
So , much like with Macworld ’s Rob Griffiths ’s what does Apple want us to do if we want to develop and install third - party apps , buy another brand of smartphone ?
question , the answer really is that the iPhone , as of today , is n’t for you if you feel you must be able to install and modify software on it .
There are all sorts of other devices that are , at heart , technically , computers , but which are n’t sold or promoted or marketed as such .
Like say , TiVos .
And iPods .
What ’s different and weird and , I think , unique about the iPhone is that for a few weeks before the release of the 1.1.1 update , we got a taste of what the iPhone could be like as an open computing platform .
But the fact that clever iPhone hackers figured out how to do it with the 1.0.x iPhone software in no way obligated Apple to support these techniques going forward .
Laporte asks :
What if the company that made the computer sent down an update that checked to see if you had installed your own applications and deleted them if so ?
This is a common sentiment regarding the 1.1.1 update — that it deletes third - party applications .
That ’s not a fair description , though .
All iPhone updates , including the earlier 1.0.1 and 1.0.2 updates , are installed as complete clean installations of the entire system .
One of the advantages of a closed system is that it ’s far easier to create upgrades for — a “ just wipe the whole system clean and re-install the new one from scratch ” installer is far easier to write than a “ let ’s carefully update only those files that are new and leave everything else , including third - party stuff we do n’t even know about , in place ” installer .
To argue that Apple should have left third - party apps and hacks installed is to argue that Apple should have expended some amount of engineering resources to support something they neither endorsed nor encouraged in the first place .
You can argue that they should have done it anyway , on the grounds that it would have made iPhone hacking enthusiasts happy , but this line of argument logically leads all the way back to arguing that Apple should be endorsing , at least tacitly , the use of the iPhone as a general - purpose handheld computer .
Clearly Apple knew that the 1.1.1 update would remove any additional or modified iPhone software , and that it would block existing methods of restoring them .
But , just as clearly , everyone involved with iPhone hacking , from the developers writing iPhone apps to the users installing them , was fully aware that this was going on through subversion .
Laporte :
Would you ever trust a company like that again ?
That ’s the wrong conclusion to draw from the 1.1.1 update .
Frustrating ?
Disappointing ?
Sure .
Foolish ?
Time will tell .
But nefarious , dishonest , or even at all surprising ?
Not in the least .
If anything , the lesson to be drawn is that Apple is quite trustworthy — iPhone 1.1.1 is and does exactly what Apple has claimed the iPhone is and does .
To be trustworthy is to do what you say you will do ; to do whatever someone else wishes you to do is to be obsequious .
Laporte draws a second analogy to a purchased cow :
Let ’s say you ’re selling me a cow .
You tell me that that cow is being sold for the express purpose of making milk .
I agree , and buy the cow .
Later I decide that I ’d prefer to make cheese .
You say that ’s a violation of our agreement and kill my cow .
But that ’s not fair at all .
Apple did n’t kill or damage a single unlocked iPhone .
They released a new software update which iPhone users had to agree to install , which could only be done after acknowledging a very strongly - worded warning stating that the update might render unlocked iPhones inoperable .
The 1.1.1 update is not mandatory .
Unlocked iPhones running the 1.0.2 software work as well today as they did a week ago .
It ’s hard to work the concept of a “ software update ” into a cow analogy , but here goes :
You willingly purchase a cow , which , the purveyor of said cow makes explicitly clear , is intended only to be used to produce milk .
You buy it and figure out a way to make cheese .
Two months later the purveyor of the cow offers you a pill , free of charge , which , if administered to the cow , will result in slightly better - tasting milk , but which pill comes with a stern and plainly worded warning that , if administered to a cow that had been used to produce cheese ( which , recall , was made clear from the outset the cow was not intended for ) , the pill might kill the cow , and that , even if it does n’t kill the cow , will prevent all previously known cheese - making hacks from working .
Further , let ’s stipulate that there is no medical or bovine pharmacological reason the pill could not have instead been engineered in such a way that it would enable the cow to produce the better - tasting milk and still allow the previously discovered cheese - producing hacks to continue unabated — that the reason for this frustrating limitation is , at best , marketing , and at worst , spite — and so that , in some way , the whole situation is , undeniably , at least somewhat shitty .
Regardless how strenuously you disagree with the decisions that led the upgrade pill to be engineered in this way , and with the anti-cheese - making restriction in the first place , the pill is what it is , and if you choose to administer this pill to your hacked - to - produce - cheese cow , it does not amount to the purveyor of said cow coming into your barn and killing it .
It amounts to you killing your cow .
( And , again , for the record , your humble analogy - stretcher is himself quite enamored with the idea of allowing these clever cows to produce cheese . )
The NYT has an article today about how the mortgage ‘ crisis ’ has spread to even people with good credit and prime loans .
This is an example of one of the ‘ innocent ’ people caught up in the mortgage mess :
An example of the spreading credit crisis is seen in Don Doyle , a computer engineer at Lockheed Martin who makes a six - figure income and had a stellar credit score in 2004 , when he refinanced his home in Northern California to take cash out to pay for his daughter ’s college tuition .
Mr. Doyle , 52 , is now worried that he will have to file for bankruptcy , because he cannot afford to make the higher variable payments on his mortgage , and he cannot sell his home for more than his $ 740,000 mortgage .
“ The whole plan was to get out ” before his rate reset , he said .
“ Now I am caught .
I ca n’t sell my house .
I ’m having a hard time refinancing .
I ’ve avoided bankruptcy for months trying to pull this out of my savings . ”
My take on this , after the jump …
He took a loan that he knew he could n’t afford because he planned on selling and making a profit before he had to pay what he knowingly agreed to pay .
How is that worthy of our sympathy ?
I ’ve been looking for a condo for years and refused to buy because prices were too high and I was most certainly not going to get an ARM .
I pity this guy , sure , but I do n’t think the government ( i.e. , you and I ) should bail him out .
He gambled and lost .
He did n’t have to get an ARM .
He did n’t have to buy such an expensive house .
And from all accounts , he was n’t cheated or lied to .
He knew that his rates were going to go up , he knew that when they went up they ’d be more than he could afford , he just figured he ’d cash in before his obligation to pay more kicked in .
He knowingly gambled and lost .
Not our fault .
But clearly his .
It ’s almost primary time , voters of America , so get ready for more electoral shenanigans !
The venerable southern state of Virginia is fast out of the gates this election season , thanks to the local Republican Party , which came up with the ingenious idea of requiring voters who want to take part in February ’s presidential primary to pledge that they ’ll also cast their vote for the Republican presidential nominee next Nov. 4 .
WDBJ7.com :
There ’s no practical way to enforce the oath .
Virginia does n’t require voters to register by party , and for years the state ’s Republicans have fretted that Democrats might meddle in their open primaries .
Virginia Democrats are n’t seeking such an oath for their presidential primary , which is held the same day — February 12th .

Joe Kennedy , who last pitched for the Toronto Blue Jays during a seven - year major league career , died early Friday morning while at home with family in Florida .
He was 28 .
The cause of death could not immediately be determined , agent Damon Lapa said .

2001 -03 Tampa Bay
2004 -05 Colorado
2005 - 07 Oakland
2007 Arizona

After going to bed early , Kennedy woke up at about 1:15 a.m .
Friday and collapsed as he was leaving a bedroom at the home of his
wife 's parents , Hillsborough County sheriff 's spokeswoman Debbie
Carter said , according to The Associated Press .
Hillsborough County Fire Rescue took Kennedy to
Brandon Hospital , where he was pronounced dead , she said .
" We were terribly shocked , " Blue Jays president Paul Godfrey
said , according to the AP .
" From what we understand he was in Bradenton ... to be the
best man at a wedding today . "
Kennedy compiled a 43 - 61 record in seven seasons with the Tampa Bay Rays , Colorado Rockies , Oakland Athletics , Arizona Diamondbacks and Blue Jays .
A left - hander , Kennedy broke into the majors in 2001 with the Devil Rays .
In three full seasons with Tampa Bay he made 72 starts , compiling an 18 - 31 record .
Godfrey said he did n't have any particulars on the cause of death .
" When a 28 - year - old man dies , it 's terrible , " he said .
Florida Marlins vice president Dan Jennings , who was Tampa Bay 's scouting director when the Rays selected Kennedy in the eighth round of the 1998 draft , learned of Kennedy 's death Friday morning from Craig Weissmann -- the scout who signed Kennedy out of Grossmont College in El Cajon , Calif .
" There are no words to describe this , '' Jennings told ESPN.com .
" It 's very , very tragic .
My condolences go out to him and his family . ''
Jennings said he remembers Kennedy primarily for his competitiveness on the mound .
" Joe was on a mission from the moment we signed him , and that mission was to be a major league pitcher , '' Jennings said .
" He was very much a competitive kid who liked challenging hitters .
Joe Kennedy 's best season was 2006 , when he was 4 - 1 with a 2.31 ERA in 39 games for Oakland .

" I remember joking around with him in the clubhouse one year during interleague play .
We were on our way to San Francisco to face the Giants , and we were having fun with him about facing Barry Bonds .
Joe told us , ' You know what ?
If he gets me , he 'll have to earn it , because I 'm gonna challenge him . '
That 's just who Joe was . ''
Since 2004 , Kennedy had two stints each with Colorado and Oakland .
He started the 2007 season with Oakland , was claimed off waivers in August by Arizona ,
then designated for assignment before being signed by the Blue Jays on Aug. 29 .
Godfrey said Toronto was interested in bringing Kennedy back .
" We had every intention to speak to him , " he said .
" We had him on our list to talk to . "
Kennedy had a career 4.79 ERA , pitching 908 2/3 innings over 222 career appearances .
Kennedy made his major league debut on June 6 , 2001 as a starting pitcher .
He went five innings , earning a win against the Blue Jays .
He made his last appearance in relief on Sept. 29 , 2007 in a 5 - 3 win over Tampa Bay .
" The entire Oakland 's A's organization sends our thoughts out to Joe 's family , " said Oakland assistant general manager David Forst .
" He was a valued member of our organization for almost two years , and certainly a guy we loved having around . ''
Kennedy was married with a 1 - year old son .
" He was a great father .
He loved that boy and his wife both more than anything in the world .
That son of his was the apple of his eye , " Weissmann told AP .
" He just was really looking forward to
everything that a father shares with a son . "

PARIS ( Reuters ) - A video of French President Nicolas Sarkozy telling a bystander to “ get lost ” has become a hit on the Internet .
French President Nicolas Sarkozy ( L ) shakes hand with visitors at the International Agricultural Fair at the Porte de Versailles in Paris February 23 , 2008 .

Sarkozy was filmed by a journalist from the daily Le Parisien on a walkabout at the annual farm fair in Paris on Saturday .
Sarkozy offered his hand to a man who said : “ Do n’t touch me , you are soiling me . ”
In reply , Sarkozy said , without dropping his smile : “ Get lost , dumb ass . ”
The video was posted on Le Parisien ’s website www.leparisien.fr.on and by midday on Sunday it had been seen by more than 350,000 people , a spokeswoman for the newspaper said .
“ It has created quite a controversy , ” she said .
The video is the first to come up when searching for Sarkozy on Dailymotion and YouTube .
Sarkozy ’s popularity ratings are in freefall and his hands - on style of government is attracting growing criticism .
In November , Sarkozy had a heated exchange with fishermen during protests against rising fuel costs .
The president challenged a fisherman who had insulted him .
“ Come down and say that , ” Sarkozy , elected in May , was quoted as saying .
“ Do n’t think that by insulting me you will solve fishermen ’s problems . ”
After the incident , Sarkozy said he refused to have insults hurled at him and would only accept a dialogue between “ civilized people . ”
Francois Hollande , head of the Socialist party , said Sarkozy was not behaving like a head of state and called on him to improve his behavior .
“ One should not get into a brawl ...
One does not call down a fisherman or a worker to explain what he said , one does not get into a fight with someone who does not want to shake your hand , ” Hollande said on pay - TV channel Canal plus .
Sarkozy ’s spokesman , David Martinon , declined to comment on the fair incident .
The number of people satisfied with the president fell 9 percentage points in a month to 38 percent , according to an Ifop poll in the Sunday paper Le Journal du Dimanche .
Up to 17,000 women in Britain are being subjected to " honour " related violence , including murder , every year , according to police chiefs .
And official figures on forced marriages are the tip of the iceberg , says the Association of Chief Police Officers ( ACPO ) .
It warns that the number of girls falling victim to forced marriages , kidnappings , sexual assaults , beatings and even murder by relatives intent on upholding the " honour " of their family is up to 35 times higher than official figures suggest .

The crisis , with children as young as 11 having been sent abroad to be married , has prompted the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to call on British consular staff in Bangladesh , India and Pakistan to take more action to identify and help British citizens believed to be the victims of forced marriages in recent years .
The Home Office is drawing up an action plan to tackle honour - based violence which " aims to improve the response of police and other agencies " and " ensure that victims are encouraged to come forward with the knowledge that they will receive the help and support they need " .
And a Civil Protection Bill coming into effect later this year will give courts greater guidance on dealing with forced marriages .
Commander Steve Allen , head of ACPO 's honour - based violence unit , says the true toll of people falling victim to brutal ancient customs is " massively unreported " and far worse than is traditionally accepted .
" We work on a figure which suggests it is about 500 cases shared between us and the Forced Marriage Unit per year , " he said : " If the generally accepted statistic is that a victim will suffer 35 experiences of domestic violence before they report , then I suspect if you multiplied our reporting by 35 times you may be somewhere near where people 's experience is at . "
His disturbing assessment , made to a committee of MPs last week , comes amid a series of gruesome murders and attacks on British women at the hands of their relatives .
Marilyn Mornington , a district judge and chair of the Domestic Violence Working Group , warned that fears of retribution , and the authorities ' failure to understand the problem completely , meant the vast majority of victims were still too scared to come forward for help .
In evidence to the home affairs committee , which is investigating the problem , she said : " We need a national strategy to identify the large number of pupils , particularly girls , missing from school registers who have been taken off the register and are said to be home schooled , which leads to these issues .
Airport staff and other staff need to be trained to recognise girls who are being taken out of the country .
" We are bringing three girls a week back from Islamabad as victims of forced marriage .
We know that is the tip of the iceberg , but that is the failure end .
It has to be part of education within the communities and the children themselves . "
Women who have been taken overseas to be married against their will are now being rescued on an almost daily basis .
The Government 's Forced Marriage Unit ( FMU ) handled approximately 400 cases last year – 167 of them leading to young Britons being helped back to the UK to escape unwanted partners overseas .
And it is not just women who are affected .
Home Office figures show that 15 per cent of cases involve men and boys .
In an attempt to crack down on the crimes being committed in the name of honour , police are to introduce a new training package that will give all officers instructions on handling honour cases .
In addition , detectives are believed to be conducting a " cold case " style review of previous suicides amid suspicions that cases of honour killings are more common than previously thought .

Almost all victims of the most extreme crimes are women , killed in half of cases by their own husbands .
Sometimes murders are carried out by other male relatives , or even hired killers .
The fear that many thousands are left to endure honour violence alone may be supported by the disturbing details of the incidence of suicide within the British Asian community .
Women aged 16 to 24 from Pakistani , Indian and Bangladeshi backgrounds are three times more likely to kill themselves than the national average for women of their age .
A report published last week by the Centre for Social Cohesion found that many women felt unable to defy their families and therefore " suffer violence , abuse , depression , anxiety and other psychological problems that can lead to self - harm , schizophrenia and suicide " .
James Brandon , co-author of Crimes of the Community : Honour - based Violence in the UK , said : " The Government is still not taking honour crime seriously .
Until this happens , the ideas of honour which perpetuate this violence will continue to be passed on through generations .
Religious leaders , local authorities and central government must work together to end such abuses of human rights . "
The human cost of honour crime was vividly captured in a haunting video message from murdered Banaz Mahmood , who revealed how her own father had tried to kill her after she abandoned her arranged marriage and fell in love with another man .
In the grainy message she told how he plied her with brandy – the first time she had ever drunk alcohol – pulled the curtains and asked her to turn around .
The 19 - year - old fled , but less than a month after making the grainy video on a mobile phone , Banaz was dead .
Her naked body was found buried in a yard in Birmingham in 2006 , more than 100 miles from her London home .
She had been raped and tortured by men hired by her uncle to kill her .
Mahmood 's father , uncle and one of her killers were sentenced to a total of 60 years in jail for the murder .
And the fatal potential of honour disputes was laid bare last month when a coroner said he was convinced that a Muslim teenager who feared she was being forced into an arranged marriage by her parents had suffered a " vile murder . "
Ian Smith said the concept of an arranged marriage was " central " to the circumstances leading up to the death of 17 - year - old Shafilea Ahmed , whose decomposed body was discovered on the banks of the River Kent at Sedgwick , Cumbria , four years ago .
After running away from home in February 2003 , Shafilea told housing officers : " My parents are going to send me to Pakistan and I 'll be married to someone and left there . "
The tragic story of the bright teenager who wanted to go to university and study law is far from the only example of the anguish suffered by British teenagers in recent years .
Toafiq Wahab , British consul in Dhaka , Bangladesh , recalls a " rescue mission " to recover a 17 - year - old who called his office from Sylhet .
" We had to track her down and 36 hours from taking that call , we had turned up at her house with an armed police escort , " he said .
" The house was filled with over 20 of her relations , most of whom were from Britain and stunned to see me .
They obviously did not want her to leave .
We simply asked her if she wanted to leave and go back to the UK in the presence of all her family and she agreed .
I then spoke to the family and explained what we were doing and tried to make them understand .
In the end , we had to get the police to assist in helping us to leave . "
Former Bradford policeman Philip Balmforth , who works with vulnerable Asian women , said he saw 395 cases of forced marriage in the city last year .
" I had a case of a 14 - year - old girl at school , " he recalled .
" The teacher tells me that the girl claims to have been married .
So I went along to the school with a Muslim colleague .
We saw the girl .
We asked her a few questions and we were not sure .
Then the girl said : ' If you do n't believe me I have the video at home . ' "
In Bradford alone , a total of 250 girls aged between 13 and 16 were taken off the school rolls last year because they failed to return from trips abroad .
Campaigners suspect many were victims of forced marriages .
" If contacted by concerned young British men and women in the UK , the FMU provides free and confidential advice on the potential dangers of being forced into marriage overseas and precautions to take to help avoid this happening , " said a Foreign Office spokesperson last night .
" If we learn that a British national overseas is being forced into marriage , or has already been forced into marriage , we look at various means of consular assistance ranging from action through the courts to rescue missions . "
" The FMU can also help to arrange accommodation for victims for when they return to the UK and can refer victims to counselling and supports groups , legal centres , and so on .
" When it is necessary , the FMU and our embassies and high commissions work closely with the police and judiciary overseas in order to organise emergency rescue and repatriation missions . "
Britain's hidden scandal
The kidnap victim
In June 2000 Narina Anwar , 29 , and her two sisters claim they were tricked by their parents into going on a family holiday to a remote village in Pakistan , where they were held captive for five months in an attempt to force them to marry three illiterate villagers .
The sisters fled to Lahore and contacted the British High Commission , which persuaded their parents to hand over their children 's passports so they could return home .
The ' slave '
Gina Singh , 28 , sued her former mother - in - law for £ 35,000 in 2006 after she was forced to work 17 hours a day around the house .
Ms Singh , from Nottingham , was forbidden to leave the house on her own after an arranged marriage in 2002 .
The runaway wife
In 1983 , Zana Muhsen and her sister Nadia , from Birmingham , were pushed by their father to visit Yemen and forced to marry .
Zana , now 35 , escaped eight years later .
Her father had sold her for a few thousand dollars .
The experience is recounted in her book , ' Sold ' .
The murder victim
Surjit Athwal disappeared with Bachan Athwal , her mother - in - law , after a family wedding in India in 1998 .
Her body was never found .
Bachan later boasted that she arranged for her son , Sukhdave , to murder Surjit after finding out that she was having an affair .
The attempted suicide
Shafilea Ahmed was the victim of a suspected honour killing .
The 17 - year - old 's body was found months after she had returned from a trip to Pakistan in 2003 .
On the trip she drank bleach .
The coroner said he saw it as a ' desperate measure ' to avoid a forced marriage .

At the heart of the Siegelman scandal in Alabama is the question of selective justice .
In 2002 , a lobbyist / landfill developer told the U.S. Attorney ’s office that he used illegal campaign contributions to bribe some of the biggest names in Alabama Republican politics , including Sen. Jeff Sessions ( R - Ala . ) , a Bush - appointed federal judge William Pryor Jr. He also identified Alabama Gov. Don Siegelman ( D ) .
The U.S. Attorney ’s office proceeded to ignore every piece of evidence against Sessions and Pryor , and prosecute Siegelman with everything prosecutors could come up with .
One person involved in the prosecution said they left the Republicans alone on purpose because they had Rs after their name : “ Sessions and Pryor were on the home team . ”
Given what we ’ve learned over the course of the year about the politicization of U.S. Attorneys ’ offices , and the pressure to prosecute Dems and look the other way for Republicans , the next question , of course , is what drove the process in Alabama .
Republican lawyer Dana Jill Simpson , answering questions under oath from House investigators , implicated Karl Rove in the mess .

It happens time and time again on mailing lists and discussion forums – someone posts some code in the context of an example and then there is an outcry .
“ The code is lousy ! ” , someone says .
So you look and you realize that “ lousy ” , to this person , means that that it does n’t use language feature X , that just came out in the last release ; or that its author did n’t use idiom Y , which someone in some recent article proved is necessary to write “ good ” code in a particular language .
Sound familiar ?
It happens all the time .
The truth is , I was one of those guys .
Years ago , I took a lot of pride in the fact that I was knew all of the nooks and crannies of C ++.
I nearly memorized the ARM ( Annotated C++ Reference Manual ) , and in flamewars on the net , I did my language - lawyerly best to point out little problems in posted code , and ( I thought ) advance the state of practice a bit .
But , I always felt odd about it .
If writing code one way was okay before the introduction of a new language feature , what made it bad immediately afterward ?
Java and C# offer some great examples .
If you are working in Java 5 or 6 , you must use varargs when you can .
If you ’re working in C# 2.0 , well , you must make a class static if all of its members are static .
It ’s just the right thing to do .
Then , of course , there ’s the issue of generics .
Before their introduction , people would cast objects as they retrieved them from containers .
Afterward , “ good practice ” dictated that you use type - safe collections and avoid the casts .
It was just seen as “ the right thing to do . ”
But , of course , if you work in JavaScript , Python , or Ruby , you can play by different rules because these " rightness " rules vary across languages .
It ’s hard to fault anyone for trying to keep up with language developments .
If there are , now , safer and better ways of writing code , is n’t it important to move along ?
I think it is , but only to a point .
The fact of the matter is , there is a strong psychological component to language expertise .
The people who become language lawyers ( and I was one of them ) are n’t doing anything complex , they are actually doing something very simple .
They are sitting down and learning all of the rules and using them as a point of leverage .
They think , " I am valuable if I know the right way to use the language . "
But , frankly , there is harder work out there .
If you want to see that harder work , try to give advice to people who are working in less than current environments .
Try to write libraries and tools for people who are working in antiquated environments .
That is the point where you see the continuum .
You can write good code without the latest features .
People do it all the time .
There is n't some continually moving standard for good practice in a language , there are hundreds of islands , places where people have discovered what works for them in their environment .
Sure , there are incremental advantages to using the new bells and whistles but they are n't going to make you or break you .
Language expertise is fine , but it is n’t the most valuable thing out there .
If someone programs conscientiously , I can work with them .
I have a lot of respect for people who write solid code despite not having completely up to date language knowledge .
Language knowledge is easy : you read , you think , you try .
And , you can catch up .
Conscientiousness , though , is the thing that really matters .
Next to it , language expertise is easy .
George Farthing , an expatriate British man living in America , was diagnosed as clinically depressed , tanked up on antidepressants , and scheduled for a controversial shock therapy when doctors realized he was n't depressed at all , he was just British !
Farthing , a man whose characteristic pessimism and gloomy perspective were interpreted as serious clinical depression , was led on a nightmare journey through the American psychiatric system .
Doctors described Farthing as suffering from pervasive negative anticipation : a belief that everything will turn out for the worst , whether it ’s trains arriving late , England ’s chances of winning any national sports events , or his own prospects of getting ahead in life .
The doctors reported that the satisfaction he seemed to get from his pessimism was particularly pathological .
“ They put me on everything — lithium , Prozac , St. John ’s wort , ” Farthing says .
“ They even told me to sit in front of a big light for half an hour a day or I 'd become suicidal .
I kept telling them this was all pointless , and they said that was exactly the sort of attitude that got me here in the first place . ”
Dr. Isaac Horney , a psychotherapist , explored Farthing ’s family history and could n’t believe his ears .
Farthing spoke of growing up in a gray little town where it rained every day , of treeless streets lined with identical houses , and of passionately backing a football team that never won .
Although Farthing had six months of therapy , he mainly wanted to talk about the weather .
“ I felt he was n't responding to therapy at all , ” says Horney , who recommended electroconvulsive therapy .

Farthing takes up the story : “ Hopeless case ?
I was all strapped down on the table , and they were about to put the rubber bit in my mouth when the psychiatric nurse picked up on my accent and said , ‘ Oh my God , I think we 're making a terrible mistake ! ’ ” Identifying Farthing as British changed the diagnosis of clinical depression to rather quaint and charming .
He was immediately discharged from the hospital with a selection of brightly colored leaflets and an I Love New York T - shirt .

COLORADO SPRINGS — Fort Carson sent soldiers who were not medically fit to war zones last month to meet “ deployable strength ” goals , according to e-mails obtained by The Denver Post .
One e-mail , written Jan. 3 by the surgeon for Fort Carson ’s 3rd Brigade Combat Team , says : “ We have been having issues reaching deployable strength , and thus have been taking along some borderline soldiers who we would otherwise have left behind for continued treatment . ”
Capt .
Scot Tebo ’s e-mail was , in part , a reference to Master Sgt. Denny Nelson , a 19 - year Army veteran , who was sent overseas last month despite doctors ’ orders that he not run , jump or carry more than 20 pounds for three months because of a severe foot injury .
Nelson took the medical report to the Soldier Readiness Process , or SRP , site on Fort Carson , where health - care professionals recommended Nelson stay home .
The soldier , who has a Bronze Star and is a member of the Mountain Post ’s Audie Murphy Chapter , was sent to Kuwait on Dec. 29 .
Nelson says he was one of at least 52 soldiers deployed who should not have been , and a veterans group says the military is endangering soldiers to meet its goals .
But Fort Carson officials say they do not believe unfit soldiers have been sent to the Middle East and say there is no repercussion for not meeting goals .
They say the battalion commander has the final decision as to who is deployed .
On Jan. 5 , a physician in Kuwait sent a strongly worded e-mail to Tebo urging him to send Nelson back to the U.S .
“ This soldier should NOT have even left CONUS ( the United States ) .
. . .
In his current state , he is not full mission capable and in his current condition is a risk to further injury to himself , others and his unit , ” said the physician , Maj .
Thomas Schymanski .
Nelson , 38 , had fractured his leg and destroyed the tendons that hold the bones in his feet together while jumping on his daughter ’s trampoline .
He arrived back at Fort Carson on Sunday .
“ I just want to make sure these soldiers get back safe .
I got back , and the only reason I got back safe is because I ’m an E - 8 ( master sergeant ) .
If I was a private or a specialist , I guarantee you , I ’d be in Iraq , ” he said .
“ If nothing comes out of this other than those soldiers coming back home before one of them gets killed , then I can sleep at night .
But God forbid if something happens , and I did n’t do anything . . . . ”
Nelson went through Fort Carson ’s Soldier Readiness Process , a clearinghouse where legal , medical and financial records are examined , and it was recommended that he stay home .
No number on “ no go ’s ”
Fort Carson could not say Wednesday how many soldiers were considered “ no - go ’s ” by medical professionals at the SRP site but were ultimately sent overseas .
“ The SRP , what they do is they screen soldiers for deployment , . . . and if a soldier is identified as a no - go in the SRP site , then the soldier is seen by a specialist , ” said Maj .
Harvinder Singh , the 3rd Brigade Combat Team ’s rear detachment commander .
Nelson said he was not seen by a specialist or any medical professional after the SRP site identified him as a no - go .
Nelson was to serve as a liaison officer and assist soldiers in transitioning from Kuwait to Iraq .
Singh said he does not believe medically unfit soldiers have been deployed to Iraq .
He said soldiers with medical issues are only sent to theater if there is a light - duty job for them and medical services are available in theater .
He said 3,500 of the brigade ’s 3,700 soldiers were deployed .
The others probably stayed home because medical services could not be found for them in theater .
Goals for commanders
Dee McNutt , spokeswoman for Fort Carson , said she knew of no Army policy that defined “ deployable strength . ”
“ Every commander has a goal , and you try to achieve that goal , . . . but there is no repercussion if you do n’t hit that goal , ” Singh said .
Col .
James Terrio , deputy commander for clinical services at Evans Army Community Hospital , said , “ The issue with who you take , it is the commander ’s decision . ”
A commander , he said , is familiar with the level of danger and the needs of the unit .
A job in Kuwait , for instance , would not require a soldier to wear Kevlar , and a job as a liaison officer would not require running or walking .
Of the 1.6 million service members who have served in Iraq , 34 percent have served two tours in Iraq or Afghanistan .
Paul Sullivan , executive director of Veterans for Common Sense , said : “ The military must follow existing law and examine our soldiers before they deploy to the Iraq and Afghanistan war zones .
And the military must stop sending soldiers with physical or psychological conditions that require medical treatment into the war zones because this endangers the soldier , the unit and the mission . ”
Nelson said units are being deployed so rapidly , with 15 months in theater and 12 months off , that “ they ’re having trouble getting them healthy . ”
Nelson said that when he arrived at Camp Buehring in Kuwait , he was told he would be going to Iraq sooner than he thought .
“ The agreement was that I was going to be in Kuwait for four or five months , do physical therapy , and then when I ’m healthy , I go forward to Iraq , ” Nelson said .
“ I ’m not going to Iraq not being able to wear any of my gear , not carry a weapon .
I become a liability to everybody around me because if they get mortared , they ’re going to have to look out for me because obviously , I ca n’t run .
I ca n’t look out for myself .
Now I ’ve got soldiers worrying about my welfare , instead of their own . ”
Nelson said there were two soldiers deployed with a torn rotator cuff .
Another soldier was sent overseas who had mental - health issues , and another suffered from nerve damage to his groin area and had been taking morphine for seven months .
When that soldier went to a clinic in Iraq to ask for more pain medication , medical professionals said he could not have it and he was sent home , according to Nelson .
Instead of going to Iraq , he went to another Kuwait post , Camp Arifjan .
Nelson said he was told by superiors that he would be in charge of 52 soldiers who were receiving medical treatment .
“ I expected to find a whole bunch of people , but when I got there , they were all gone .
They were already all in Iraq , ” Nelson said .
Those soldiers would have received medical treatment in Iraq , said Singh .
Fort Carson was at the heart of a congressional investigation last year after reports revealed soldiers were not receiving quality medical care after returning from Iraq .
Some soldiers with post - traumatic stress disorder said they were punished , rather than treated , or thrown out of the Army for “ personality ” problems .
Still , the White House is not convinced it must act .
The deliberations are tightly held , and aides to Mr. Bush say he will not make a decision about whether to offer a stimulus package , or what it should contain , until later this month , in time for his State of the Union address scheduled for Jan. 28 .
Appearing in New York on Monday , Mr. Bush ’s Treasury secretary , Henry M. Paulson Jr. , echoed that approach , and cautioned against any rush to action .
“ Working through the current situation and getting the policy right , ” Mr. Paulson said , “ is more important than getting the policy announced quickly . ”
On Capitol Hill , Democrats were positioning themselves to get ahead of any proposal the White House might present .
Aides to Nancy Pelosi , the House speaker , said that she had yet to conclude decisively that a stimulus package was needed , but that she had met with a group of economic advisers last month who urged her to take swift action aimed at stabilizing the jittery economy and lifting consumer confidence .
The group included Lawrence H. Summers , a Treasury secretary under President Bill Clinton ; Felix G. Rohatyn , the financier and former ambassador to France ; and Laurence D. Fink , the chairman and chief executive of BlackRock , the global investment firm .
An aide to Ms. Pelosi said the three were “ unanimous in saying that we should move out ahead . "
In an interview over the weekend , Mr. Summers said he believed that there was now a greater than 50 percent chance of a recession this year .
“ My view is that now is the time to be thinking about policies that would provide recession insurance , ” Mr. Summers said , “ and if we wait until it ’s entirely clear that there is a recession , it will be too late . ”
But Democratic leaders said there was already a general consensus within the party that any stimulus package would be temporary and targeted to the middle class and the poor .
Among the proposals under consideration are a $ 500 across - the - board rebate , possibly to be returned to taxpayers in their paychecks through the payroll tax system , as well as a plan to restore the $ 1,000 per child tax credit to many low - income families that currently do not qualify for it .
The more I read about food additives , the more my convictions to feed my family natural , organic food is confirmed .
Just yesterday , my daughter brought home tons of junk Valentine ’s Day candy from school .
At first , she wanted to eat it , but then we had a talk about the candy ’s contents .
By the time her father got home , she was explaining to him why the candy was bad , and as always , we offered to trade her the junk candy for organic sweets .
In the past , I have written about how food additives have been linked to hyperactivity in children .
Recently , there has been more discussion on the harmful effects of food additives .
Here ’s a round up of articles I have lately come across on the subject :
Chemical Food Additives – Are They Slowly Killing Our Children ?
Some children are more sensitive to food chemicals and display immediate effects soon after ingestion of additives , colours in particular .
In small amounts additives are not harmful .
Effects are dose related and , tragically , dose for weight , children are consuming several times more additives than the acceptable daily intake ( ADI ) … The mixtures of the additives had a much more potent effect on nerve cells than each additive on its own .
The effect on cells was up to four times greater when Brilliant Blue and MSG were combined , and up to seven times greater when Quinoline Yellow and Aspartame were combined …
Risk of toxic additives , in isolation or in combination , is evidently most high among infants and children .
Age is an important susceptibility factor , with infants and young children being most vulnerable to chemical carcinogens .
Scientific risk assessment data suggests that infants ( newborns ) have a limited capability to detoxify due to premature development of the liver and drug - metabolising enzymes , furthermore their extremely small body weight may provoke toxicity …
The fact that young children have higher nutritional requirements , smaller body masses and their diet is less varied than those of adults suggests that they may have the greatest susceptibility to toxic effects .
For example , their soft drink and dairy consumption alone may be as much as 16 times greater than that of adults .
Processed Meats are Too Dangerous for Human Consumption Says World Cancer Research Fund
The review says that processed meats are too dangerous for human consumption .
Practically all red meat used in frozen prepared meals was said to be unsafe as well as other processed meats including bacon , sausage and hot dogs .
The World Cancer Research Fund claims the link to cancer is through the carcinogenic ingredient known as sodium nitrite , which is used in the production of all such products to make the color more attractive to consumers .

Did you know that there is a check cashing place on Folsom Boulevard , between Mather and La Loma , which is not next to any liquor store ?
It is sad but true .
How can this lonely outpost possibly hope to survive out here , by itself , on a flat slab in the middle of a dry city block ?
I 'm sure it seemed like a good idea at the time , to transform a shuttered Long John Silvers fish place into a check cashing outlet , but someone forgot to that turning checks into cash is only half the battle , because you CAN'T DRINK CASH .

Star Wars ' Yoda , " the ancient and revered Jedi Master "
Barney and Daniel Jones want fellow devotees to be able to join them close to their home on Anglesey .
Barney , 26 - or Master Jonba Hehol - and Daniel , 21 - Master Morda Hehol - head the UK Church of the Jedi , in honour of the film 's good knights .
They say their services will include sermons on " the Force , " light sabre training , and meditation techniques .
Hairdresser Barney became interested in the Jedi faith after 390,000 other Star Wars fans across England and Wales declared it as their religion on the 2001 census .
An internet campaign was fought to see Jedi officially included in the list and although this did not happen , collators included a special code to register the Jedis .
He said : " As children we always watched the Star Wars films anyway .
We noticed that there were a couple of sites on the internet , Jedi church sites .
Obviously , if someone starts to try and use the good force for greed and power , they are going to bring negative interference into the meetings
Barney Jones
" We printed off a couple of sermons and did a sermon in our house for a couple of friends one night . "
Barney and his musician brother Daniel , from Holyhead , help run four websites devoted to the development of the " faith " .
They plan to go to the official opening of a Surrey - based branch or " chapter " of the UK Church of the Jedi in April , and hope to hire an Anglesey venue for their own services .
Already six followers regularly meet in north Wales to discuss setting up the " church " .
It is hoped Jedi church members will resist Darth Vader 's dark side
" My brother and I would hold sermons , do talks and get guest speakers , " explained Barney .
" We would read out essays members of the congregation have submitted on their feelings about the Jedi and the Force : do meditation , relaxation and visualisation techniques and a bit of light - sabre training . "
Watching the films as children gave the brothers a good understanding of the " faith , " said Barney .
" We had a knowledge of the Force from that and the teachings of Yoda .
We 've read the teachings on the internet .
" Our father is a karate black belt , we used to train with him , which is where we got the martial arts . "
Barney , who has watched the Star Wars films " multiple dozens of times , " does not wear film - themed clothing in public , but he and his brother would do so at Jedi church meetings .
' Sense of unity '
He said : " My brother and I will wear the Jedi robes , the dark brown robes ... the congregation would be in black .
Really to bring a sense of unity to the meetings . "
Although the current members are all men , women are not excluded , as Barney Jones points out : " Princess Leia helped them out a lot . "
However , any congregation member drawn to the dark side of the Force , embodied in the film by Darth Vader , would be advised they are following the wrong path and could face expulsion .
Barney explained : " Obviously , if someone starts to try and use the good force for greed and power , they are going to bring negative interference into the meetings .
" We cannot have the Force disrupted by negative interference . "
A MAC address is a unique identifier assigned to your network card , and some networks implement MAC address filtering as a method of security .
Spoofing a MAC address can be desired for multiple reasons , and it is very easy to spoof your MAC address in Mac OS X 10.4 , 10.5 , 10.6 , 10.7 , OS X 10.8 , and OS X 10.9 .
For the purpose of this article , we are going to assume you want to spoof your Mac ’s wireless MAC address , meaning your wi-fi card .
Without further ado , here ’s a three step process on how to do just that …
Retrieving your current MAC address
First , you ’re going to want your current wireless MAC address so you can set it back without rebooting .
Launch the Terminal app and type the following command :
ifconfig en1 | grep ether
You ’ll know see something like :
ether 00:12:cb:c6:24:e2
And the values after ‘ ether ’ makeup your current MAC address .
Write this down somewhere so you do n’t forget it .
If you do , it ’s not the end of the world , you ’ll just have to reboot to reset it from a change .
Note , it ’s possible that your Mac has the wi-fi card on en0 , so you may need to adjust the string accordingly .
Spoofing a MAC address
To spoof your MAC address , you simply set that value returned from ifconfig to another hex value in the format of aa : bb : cc:dd : ee: ff .
You can generate a random one if need be .
For this example , we will set our wireless MAC address to 00:e2:e3:e4:e5:e6 by issuing the following command :
sudo ifconfig en1 ether 00:e2:e3:e4:e5:e6
The sudo command will require that you enter your root password to make the change .
Again , some Macs use en0 , so if you run into any issues you can try that .
Verifying the Spoofed MAC address worked
If you want to check that the spoof worked , type the same command as earlier :
ifconfig en1 | grep ether
Now you will see :
ether 00:e2:e3:e4:e5:e6
Meaning your MAC address is now the value you set it to .
If you want to further verify the spoof , simply login to your wireless router and look at the ‘ available devices ’ ( or attached devices ) list , and your spoofed MAC address will be part of that list .
If you want to set your MAC address back to its real value , simply issue the above ifconfig commands with the MAC address that you retrieved in step 1 .
You can also reboot your Mac .
Enjoy !
Note : Reader Dee Brown points out the following , which may help with some users having difficulties : “ running 10.5.6 you need to do the trick to disassociate from the network .
**** DO NOT TURN AIRPORT OFF ****.
What you will have to do is click your airport and click join network and enter some bogus name as the network ssid .
Then while it ’s trying to connect click cancel .
At this point you may spoof using the sudo ifconfig en1 ether command ”
other readers point out that Dee Brown ’s trick works in 10.5.7 and above too .
Thanks Dee !
Update :
If you ’re still having problems with MAC address spoofing in Leopard or Snow Leopard , the above method still works but try disassociating with any wireless network BUT keep your wireless Airport on ( as mentioned above ) – an easy way to do this is to type the following in the command line :
airport -z
Note that you have to have the ‘ airport ’ command setup to work for users , you can do that by copy and pasting this command into the Mac Terminal :
sudo ln -s / System / Library / PrivateFrameworks / Apple80211.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/airport /usr/sbin/airport
Once disassociated from the network you should be able to spoof your MAC address as usual
Updated 2/28/2012 : For Mac OS X Lion , the Airport interface is now called “ Wi - Fi ” and thus the command to spoof a MAC address in OS X 10.7 , OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion , and OS X Mavericks , is :
sudo ifconfig en0 Wi -Fi aa: bb:cc:dd:ee:ff
For some computers Wi - Fi may be the interface but you spoof by specifying “ ether ” instead .
sudo ifconfig en0 ether aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff
Remember to disassociate from any network beforehand with “ airport - z ” while keeping the card active .
If you continue to have problems or receive a “ bad value ” message , try turning the wireless NIC off and on again using the following :
sudo ifconfig en0 down
Now re-enable the NIC :
sudo ifconfig en0 up
Then proceed to spoof the MAC address :
sudo ifconfig en0 ether aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff
Reenabling the network card may cause it to join the last available wireless network .
The MAC address should stay spoofed until reboot , but you can always check what your MAC address is in the GUI or command line with networksetup - listallhardwareports if you ’re curious about the current status .
Spyware tsar targets your home computer
He once flew wealthy business executives to the edges of space in Russian fighter jets for $ 10,000 a time .
He offered people the chance to turn their life stories into CD - Roms .
And he planted pop-up adverts in personal computers with sophisticated but notorious ' spyware ' .
ERTUGRUL : Aiming at BT and other net customers .
Kent Ertugrul is clearly a man with grand ideas .
Now the American former investment banker is back , this time with a controversial deal involving broadband .
TalkTalk , BT and Virgin Media , the three biggest broadband providers in the country with more than nine million customers , last week announced a deal with Ertugrul 's Aim - listed Phorm that will put ' targeted advertising ' in front of millions of internet users .
Ertugrul used his links to the former Soviet security apparatus to develop the Phorm software , which tracks what internet users look at to allow companies to throw ' relevant ' advertisements on to web pages that have signed up to the system .
BT and its rivals love the idea because it would give them a chunk of advertising revenue that until now has been carved up between website developers and search engines such as Google .
But customers ' appetite for this type of advertising is regarded as small , especially because , unless different family members use separate log-ons , searches by one member will influence the ads seen by others , creating a situation fraught with pitfalls .
Banner advertising is not loved by users anyway and an ' adblock ' program is one of the most popular software downloads on the internet .
Some spyware software can also gather information about email addresses and even passwords and credit card numbers , but Phorm insists that it will actually protect privacy and will warn web browsers if they go to a site that steals identities .
' All that exists is a random number in our server and some details of websites visited and a time stamp , ' said Ertugrul .
' We even ignore numbers longer than three digits so we do n't inadvertently harvest a credit card number .
There is no way that we or anyone else can use this information to identify a user or even discover the internet address the user is browsing from . '
Ertugrul , 42 , who was educated at St Paul 's public school in London , said that accountant Ernst & Young had conducted a privacy audit on the new software and given it a clean bill of health and stressed that the system also included a service to detect scam websites , although he conceded that the latest version of Microsoft 's Internet Explorer already automatically warned users .
BT was unable to say whether users would opt in and be invited to switch on the Phorm tracking system or whether they would have to switch it off .
' Customers will have a clear choice , ' a spokesman said .
Virgin Media said : ' We have n't decided yet . '
Financial Mail has found that Ertugrul and his company were responsible for one of the most unpopular pieces of spyware software , PeopleOnPage , which once installed was difficult to shift .
The software made pop -up adverts appear in front of web pages that consumers were trying to view .
The leading internet security company F - Secure said Ertugrul 's PeopleOnPage was a ' very advanced system used to evade anti-virus and spyware scanners ' .
Rival Symantec described the technology behind PeopleOnPage as ' high risk ' for the consumer .
Ertugrul confirmed he was responsible for PeopleOnPage .
The development team for the new software was recruited from Moscow 's elite Lebedev Institute of Precision Mechanics and Computer Engineering , a vital part of of the Cold War spying effort and still a centre for developing Russia 's ' national security ' computer systems .
One senior internet industry figure said : ' I can't see this as good for customers .
The company has been relaunched since the days of PeopleOnPage , but I hope TalkTalk and the others have done very good due diligence indeed . '
Other internet service providers , including Orange and BSkyB , are still considering whether to sign up .
A BT spokesman said : ' We have done due diligence through Dun & Bradstreet and are happy that the system is secure and that Phorm are fine .
We are comfortable with having their computers installed in our operations . '
Whatever doubts outsiders may hold , Ertugrul does not lack faith in his product .
He was recently issued options to buy the company 's shares when their prices reach £ 100 , £ 200 and £ 300 .
The shares are currently worth £ 33 .
He is also keen to be around to cash them in .
Last Friday , the board called a special meeting to set up new rules for the firm , making it far more difficult for directors to be removed .
Matt Welch , the new editor of Reason , gave a talk at the Cato Institute about his new book , John McCain : The Myth of a Maverick , in which he sums up the grave danger to the republic represented by the McCain campaign .
Welch remarked that McCain is part of the “ imperial class , ” pointing to the politico - military legacy of his father , an admiral , to underscore the point that the putative GOP nominee is revving up his motor to become the most militaristic American president since at least Teddy Roosevelt  perhaps the most belligerent ever .
I agree with him about McCain , but what I want to focus on is the rise of this “ imperial class , ” which seems like a good moniker : certainly it captures the essence of what this phenomenon is all about  a development made possible by and intimately bound up with our “ progress ” on the road to empire .
The evidence for the rise of this new class  and its exponentially increasing power  is all around us .
U.S. arms exports have hit a new high .
Since 9/11 , the United States has stood astride the global arms market and shows no signs of slacking off .
In 2006 , Washington wrapped up the biggest number of new arms deals , to the tune of some $ 16.9 billion , over 40 percent of the worldwide total .
Russia came in second , with a mere $ 8.7 billion .
More than half of the global arms deliveries were made by the U.S .
Just last week , on Feb. 8 , 18 “ defense ” - related contracts were announced totaling $ 326,664,244 .
That makes 58 publicly - reported defense contracts for the week , totaling $ 1,584,635,220 .
Last month , there were 223 publicly - reported defense contracts , totaling $ 19,625,989,716 .
While the civilian economy is shrinking , the military sector is expanding  and , if either of the eventual major party candidates have their way , the military expenditures will balloon .
The Democrats , like the Republicans , are pledged to an even bigger U.S. military .
It ’s good for business , if your business is war or war - related , and it ’s good for votes  especially the votes , active support , and political contributions of the growing group of Americans whose livelihoods , and claim to some sort of social status , depend on the continuation of our foreign policy of perpetual war .
A perfect example of how this works is the campaign to expand NATO , which succeeded in admitting the former Warsaw Pact nations to the Western alliance .
The political vehicle for this opening up of a largely outmoded military alliance was the Committee for NATO Expansion , led by Randy Scheunemann , a high - flying Washington lobbyist for the arms industry , who also authored the 1998 Iraq Liberation Act , authorizing $ 98 million in Pentagon aid for Ahmed Chalabi and his fellow “ heroes in error . ”
Scheunemann now serves as  what else ?
 a senior national security adviser to John McCain .
Along with Bruce Jackson , until 2002 planning and strategy vice president at Lockheed Martin , Scheunemann lobbied Congress and the various NATO aspirants to procure the funding that would get prospective NATO members up to code , so to speak , and bring their military assets up to Western standards .
It was a very profitable venture , all around  and what we have to show for it is a whole lot of arms - related millionaires , both in the U.S. and Eastern Europe , and what Vladimir Putin calls a new Western - initiated arms race , with no end in sight .
For a relatively paltry investment  chump change , really  the military - industrial complex hauls in boatloads of cash .
It ’s nice work , if you can get it .
The problem is that the rest of us pay , in the form of taxes , to subsidize this politically powerful new class : an America that is n’t producing anything all that useful , except for bombs and subprime mortgage securities , is growing poorer as a result of their labors .
Every dollar locked up in the dead end of military equipment , which cannot be used except for a single , rather limited purpose , is one less dollar that is invested in productive capital , i.e. , an investment that expands the private market , creates non-government jobs , and generally increases the level of well - being in our society .
In effect , the military - industrial complex lives very much like a vampire , draining the life ’s blood from the productive sector and reducing the availability of capital investment where it ’s really needed .
Our foreign policy massively misallocates the distribution of wealth in our society and pumps funds into areas that are not productive , while starving those sectors that would benefit the civilian economy .
Conservatives , who are trenchant critics of socialism , at least in theory , in practice fail to see or appreciate the consequences of their drunken - sailor spending when it comes to the military .
The caveats that they apply to government spending in the domestic sphere are forgotten  or even inverted  when it comes to military outlays .
Yet problems such as influence - peddling  and worse  are encountered whenever monies are being handed out by an elected body .
Lobbies spring up , a narrow but vocal and very well - organized slice of the public becomes very passionate about maintaining and expanding these subsidies , and a politically driven process expands the program , whatever it might be , so far beyond its original intent that it becomes a kind of parody  like the $ 1,000 toilet or the $ 800 screwdriver , only on a much larger scale .
As America drives  or is pushed  toward empire , the power of this class increases with each milestone passed .
More Americans become dependent on their military - oriented subsidies , whether they be Washington insiders with Pentagon contracts or ordinary workers who make good union wages manufacturing cluster bombs for export to the Middle East ’s bright , shining example of democracy .
This permanent war economy is financed by government , of course , which goes into debt in order to pay for the biggest orgy of arms spending in history .
That debt eats away at the very heart of our prosperity and threatens to hollow out our economic system as the markets shake and quiver , hinting at a financial meltdown that every half - awake economist and market maven expects  and fears .
A few profit while the rest of us suffer the consequences .
That is n’t capitalism ; that ’s government - subsidized cronyism .
We are borrowing from the Chinese in order to pay the costs of our Middle Eastern empire , but what will we do when they no longer buy our debt ?
When they dump our securities , our “ empire ” goes down the tubes  and the warlords of Washington know it .
Unlike the Roman , the Spanish , and the British versions , the American Empire will have a very short life , and our enemies are looking forward to the collapse .
As Osama bin Laden put it in his message to the American people on the eve of the 2004 election :
“ All that we have to do is to send two mujahedeen to the farthest point East to raise a piece of cloth on which is written al - Qaeda in order to make the generals race there to cause America to suffer human economic and political losses without their achieving for it anything of note other than some benefits to their private companies .
This is in addition to our having experience in using guerilla warfare and the war of attrition to fight tyrannical superpowers as we alongside the mujahedeen bled Russia for 10 years until it went bankrupt and was forced to withdraw in defeat .
All praise is due to Allah .
“ So we are continuing this policy in bleeding America to the point of bankruptcy .
Allah is willing and nothing is too great for Allah . ”
While the financial system creaks and totters and groans , some are fearless : they ’re laughing all the way to the bank .
The Imperial class could not have a better champion and exemplar than McCain .
If and when he is elected , we will be at war not only with Iran , Syria , and some portion of Pakistan , but we ’ll be in a global face - off with the Russians , who will come back into fashion as credible villains shortly after President McCain has Scheunemann draft the “ Russia Liberation Act , ” authorizing the expenditure of funds for eventual “ regime change ” in the Kremlin .
NOTES IN THE MARGIN
As you may have noticed  or not , if you came here directly , instead of going to the home page first  this is the first day of what we at Antiwar.com call “ pledge week , ” after public television ’s fund drives .
Of course , it is n’t done the old - fashioned way , with a telephone crew and us giving our pitch .
Instead , we hijack our readers , make them read a splash page , and then return them to our regularly scheduled program of the best foreign policy - related news and commentary on the Web .
Yet , in my mind , it ’s still “ pledge week ” in the sense that we ’re just like those PBS executives , albeit without the government subsidies , wondering if our high - minded and committed audience will come through , or if , perhaps , they ’ll be forced to cancel their uplifting and / or informative programs and instead give their audience what they really want : the latest on Britney Spears !
Pardon me for rambling , but I know you do n’t want to hear about the latest celebrity “ news ”  the real world is what interests you .
Yet we ca n’t continue to give you the kind of hard news and even harder commentary you ’ve come to expect without getting your financial support right now .
We do n’t have any big corporate contributors , no “ sugar daddy ” to succor us when times are tough  and they are tough , as you ’ve no doubt noticed .
We all know the economy is going bad , for the reasons outlined above , and there ’s not a whole lot we can do about it except to advocate the kind of comprehensive change that the end of the rule of militarism in America would signify .
Yes , times are tough , but someone has to watch the War Party , and that ’s our job .
We do it so you do n’t have to , but we need your support in order to continue our work .
So give today , as much as you can  and , do n’t forget that your contribution is tax - deductible .

From Newsweek :
Just hours after the Times ’s story was posted , the McCain campaign issued a point - by - point response that depicted the letters as routine correspondence handled by his staff — and insisted that McCain had never even spoken with anybody from Paxson or Alcalde & Fay about the matter .
“ No representative of Paxson or Alcalde & Fay personally asked Senator McCain to send a letter to the FCC , ” the campaign said in a statement e-mailed to reporters .
But that flat claim seems to be contradicted by an impeccable source : McCain himself .
“ I was contacted by Mr. Paxson on this issue , ” McCain said in the Sept. 25 , 2002 , deposition obtained by NEWSWEEK .
“ He wanted their approval very bad for purposes of his business .
I believe that Mr. Paxson had a legitimate complaint . ”
While McCain said “ I do n’t recall ” if he ever directly spoke to the firm ’s lobbyist about the issue — an apparent reference to Iseman , though she is not named — ” I ’m sure I spoke to [ Paxson ] . ”

the key to victory .
When you know what you want and how you intend to get it , you ’re much more likely to come out of the appointment smiling .
“ Start out with an ideal and end up with a deal . ” — Karl Albrecht , co-founder of Aldi .
Let ’s go through the different phases of a deal and prep for each one .
Skipping one of these will most likely hurt your chances so do n’t slack off on any of them .
Before the appointment …
Know what you want .
Sit down and work out exactly :
What you need and what want .
Secure the needs first and negotiate with the wants ( aka the extra stuff you can do without )
How much you can afford
How far you ’re prepared to compromise on both ( afford vs. spend )
If you ’re looking at a long - term deal , look beyond the immediate price and make sure you can afford the payments without stretching your budget to its breaking - point .
Find out what ’s available .
Do some research to find out how realistic your goals are versus what the market is offering .
You probably were n’t expecting to find a mortgage rate at 1 % or a luxury car for 50 pounds / dollars a month , but you should never assume that the price you are willing to pay is the floor for the market .
You could still be surprised by the deals offered if you look hard enough .
Re-evaluate your goals :
If you had seriously underestimated the price , you may need to re-think .
Ask yourself :
Do you want a cheaper car ( house , TV , holiday , etc. ) ?
Can you afford to pay more ?
Where does this item fall on the need / want spectrum ?
Should you wait until prices come down / you ’ve saved up ?
If you ’d overestimated the price , you ’re free to raise your expectations , lower your budget or ( ideally ) both .
‘ Arm ’ yourself .
Knowledge is power , so make sure you understand :
Which professional bodies oversee the industry
The technical / legal terms involved
What costs the seller really amassed in order to offer you this product
Find out if the product / industry has been in the news recently .
This might tell you who to avoid , or if the industry ’s about to go through some changes which could cost you time , money , emotional stress down the road .
Ask around to see if anyone you know has done something similar recently .
If not , see what case studies / testimonials you can find .
Mouse Print , Consumerist , and other sites report on shady dealings out there so once again , do your homework !
Select your supplier .
Shop around .
The bigger the deal you ’re looking at , the more time you should invest : with a mortgage , for example , a tiny difference in the interest rate can save you thousands .
It ’s often a good idea to start with a company you ’re currently doing business with .
If you ’re looking to refinance your mortgage , for example , talk to your current mortgage provider – if they do n’t want to lose your business , they may offer you a good deal .
Understand how the company works .
Do they offer their own product (s ) or are they simply reselling something ?
Do they work with a range of partners , or will they check the entire market for you ?
How do they decide which partner gets YOUR business ?
That is an absolute key question .
If your business goes to the highest bidder , I ’d steer clear .
Arrange your appointment .
This should give you some insight into how they do business .
If they ’re unprofessional , unhelpful , or hard to get hold of , maybe you should choose a different company .
Remember , a company works it ’s hardest when they ’re trying to win you as a customer .
If they are terrible at that , imagine how terrible the service will be once they get your money .
In the appointment …
Remember who ’s the customer .
As a ( potential ) paying customer , you are entitled to the person ’s time and expertise .
Tell them what you want and let them explain your options .
Have a calculator and notepad ready , and take the time to do whatever calculations you find necessary .
Show what you know .
Depending on the type of company you ’re dealing with ( and the amount of leeway the person has ) , showing that you ‘ know your stuff ’ could put you at a psychological advantage .
So tell them what other deals you have been offered / seen advertised .
Show them you understand the technical terms , and the pros and cons of the most common options .
Admit what you do n’t know .
If you need something explained , ask .
Do n’t let them ‘ blind you with science ’ .
Any specialist can use technical terms to gloss over drawbacks – or to sell ‘ benefits ’ you do n’t really want or need .
Make them repeat themselves in layman ’s terms , then take a good look at what they ’ve just said .
Give and take .
Do n’t be too inflexible .
Compromise – if you ’re being offered a good deal , do n’t turn it down because there ’s one tiny thing missing .
Consider new ideas – just make sure you understand the pros and cons , and find out if you can ‘ mix and match ’ elements of various options .
Do n’t be rushed into anything .
If you ’re happy with the deal , get them to draw up the paperwork and tell them you ’ll be back in a day or two .
At the very least , you should read the small print – and ‘ sleep on it ’ .
If it ’s complex / full of legal terms , you might consider taking it to an independent specialist .
Do n’t feel pressured .
You can always walk away from the deal .
If you ’re not impressed with their ‘ final offer ’ , thank them for their time and say you need to look elsewhere .
( If they offer you a better deal at this point , so much the better . )
After the appointment …
The end ?
If you ’ve found a product you ’re happy with , great .
If not , think about the appointment you ’ve just had , make some notes and use the experience to prepare for an appointment with another company .
If you have enough of these haggling sessions , you just may elicit a bidding war for your business .
So what do you think ?
Is this something you can do when it comes time to negotiate or are you going to take the first offer thrown your way ?

Katoucha became a global catwalk star in the 1980s
Her body was spotted under a bridge by a passer - by a month after she vanished .
Officials said her death seemed to be accidental , but that a post - mortem examination was needed to determine the exact cause of death .
She was one of the first black African models to become a global catwalk star , in the 1980s .
The mother of three , originally from Guinea , disappeared after being dropped off from a party .
Her handbag was later recovered near the houseboat where she lived .
Outspoken campaigner
Aged 47 , and known simply as Katoucha , she worked with some of the world 's top designers at the height of her career , including Yves Saint - Laurent and Christian Lacroix .
I embodied the most arrogant and admired kind of femininity , I who was supposed to be diminished
Katoucha Niane
She left the catwalk in 1994 , but in recent years made headlines as an outspoken campaigner against female circumcision , launching a foundation against the practice .
Having undergone the procedure herself at the age of nine , in Guinea , Ms Niane recounted the ordeal in a recent book , called In My Flesh .
She said she saw her career as a top model as a form of " revenge " for the horror of genital mutilation .
Former FBI director J. Edgar Hoover sought to suspend habeas corpus RAW STORY
Published : Saturday December 22 , 2007

Print This Email This According to a newly declassified document , the New York Times reports , a plan by former FBI director J. Edgar Hoover sought to suspend habeas corpus during wartime , with the intention of imprisoning thousands of Americans indefinitely .
Hoover 's plan was submitted to the White House twelve days after the start of the Korean War .
Under the plan , approximately 12,000 people deemed as " potentially dangerous " to national security , 97 % of whom were American citizens , would have been rounded up and sent to military prisons without due process .
# EXCERPTS :
The prisoners eventually would have had a right to a hearing under the Hoover plan .
The hearing board would have been a panel comprised of one judge and two citizens .
But the hearings will not be bound by the rules of evidence ,  [ Hoover 's ] letter noted .
The Constitution says habeas corpus shall not be suspended unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion , the public safety may require it .
The plan proposed by Hoover , the head of the F.B.I. from 1924 to 1972 , stretched that clause to include threatened invasion or attack upon United States troops in legally occupied territory .
In September 1950 , Congress passed and the president signed a law authorizing the detention of dangerous radicals if the president declared a national emergency .
Truman did declare such an emergency in December 1950 , after China entered the Korean War .
But no known evidence suggests he or any other president approved any part of Hoovers proposal .

McCain cracks waterboading joke after slamming Giuliani for same Michael Roston
Published : Monday January 28 , 2008
del.icio.us |
Print This Email This Senator John McCain 's campaign for president in Florida received a major lift after earning the endorsement of Governor Charlie Crist .
How did McCain get Crist , who disagrees with the senator on government - backed catastrophe insurance , to support his campaign ?
Simple :
He tortured him , according to the Palm Beach Post 's campaign blog : Crist was asked if McCain used that tenacious , unyielding persistence in seeking the guvs endorsement .
 Well , not that much ,  Crist began answering .
 It was just waterboarding ,  McCain interjected .
The remark appeared in conflict with McCain 's Nov. 2007 broadside against Rudy Giuliani for a joke he made about torture .
The former mayor of New York City joked on the campaign trail that if sleep deprivation was a form of torture , so was running for president .
McCain 's surrogates laid into Giuliani , accusing him of insulting , " all American soldiers who have had to endure real torture and mistreatment while in enemy hands , " according to a story in the New York Sun .
Giuliani 's campaign responded at the time that McCain 's own humorous remarks on the campaign trail showed that he should be able to take a joke .
McCain is no stranger to humor - related controversies in the presidential race .
In April of last year , McCain sang " Bomb Iran , " to the tune of the Beach Boys ' " Barbara Ann " at a South Carolina campaign stop .
And later in the month , McCain joked with Jon Stewart on Comedy Central 's The Daily Show that he had placed an improvised explosive device on his desk .
When fellow Vietnam Veteran Rep. John Murtha ( D - PA ) reacted angrily to the remark , McCain told him and other critics to " lighten up and get a life . "
The U.S. intelligence community 's attempts to clarify its complaints to Congress that the nation 's privacy protections hindered the NSA 's spying on Iraqis suspected of kidnapping American soldiers actually not only demonstrates the intelligence community 's bureaucratic slowness , but also the breadth of the powers temporarily handed to them by Congress this summer and the misleading rhetorical tricks it will play to get that power permanently .
Prior to the August update to the nation 's spy laws , the NSA was barred from wiretapping landline phones and the internet inside the United States , unless they had a warrant from a secret , acquiescent spying court .
To force a telephone operator to wiretap a phone line inside the United States or turn over the contents of emails from a server in the United States , the NSA would have to show reasonable cause that the person was an agent of a foreign power or a terrorist .
Outside the United States , the NSA was free to wiretap and eavesdrop on foreigners without limits , but had to hide information when one of the parties was believed to be a U.S. person ( basically anyone legally inside the United States ) .
So in the case McConnell presented to Congress last week , the intelligence community used its ears to find Iraqis it believed to be involved in the kidnapping of American soldiers .
Then they learned something from that surveillance that led them to believe that the supposed bad guys were using some communication service that passed inside the U.S .
Most likely this was an email address run by a U.S. provider .
So to stay within the law , the NSA needed – under the old law – to get a warrant to start listening in .
More precisely , they needed an emergency authorization which could then be followed up on three days later with a proper court warrant .
The Protect America
Act – passed in haste this summer by lawmakers frightened by phantoms of attacks on the Capitol – changed that .
And the Administration wants to make that power permanent .
But the new law is not just about the NSA not having to prepare a court order to start surveillance on a Yahoo or Hotmail email account that it suspects is being used by a foreigner .
In fact , its about ordering Yahoo or Microsoft to open their email systems in perpetuity to the NSA so that it can start looking at the content of all emails sent from or to IP blocks it believes to be outside the country and begin monitoring all U.S. - based communications services on a meta - level , with an option to get at content when it thinks it should .
As Director of National Intelligence spokesman Ross Feinstein told TPM Muckraker , the intelligence community wants instant - on access :
Should we be spending time having to go through such a process to intercept foreign to foreign communications ?
* Even a few seconds is too long of a delay .
* Why are we giving 4th Amendment protections to Iraqi Insurgents , located overseas , who have taken U.S. soldiers hostage ?
I wholeheartedly disagree that this was a bureaucratic process that delayed the Intelligence Community .
The law was outdated , and led to this delay .
The Protect America
Act has alleviated those issues .
( Emphasis added )
TPM Muckraker suggests , and rightfully so , that the timeline shows that the Justice Department was the bureaucratic morass where the application for emergency surveillance bogged down .
The Justice Department says that 's not the case , even though the orders merely had to show probable cause that the targets in Iraq were agents of a foreign power .
They say the four hour delay was due to " novel " legal reasons .
Justice Department spokesman Dean Boyd also told TPM Muckraker that " Had [ the DoJ lawyers ] chose to ignore the requirements of FISA , I suspect they would be the subject of substantial criticism from you and others . "
" If anything , this anecdote demonstrates the absurdity of extending [ the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act 's Fourth Amendment protections to Iraqi insurgents battling U.S. troops .
It also demonstrates the lengths to which the Justice Department goes in order to comply with the legal requirements of FISA , which prior to the Protect America Act , applied to this particular surveillance .
But FISA has no Fourth Amendment protections .
In fact , that 's the point of FISA - exempting U.S. persons from the traditional Fourth Amendment protections that limit what the government can do in criminal wiretaps and searches .
If the government reasonably suspects that a U.S. person is a spy or a terrorist , it can get an order to bug your bedroom and copy your hard drive and tap your phone , without every having to tell you it it did so .
( Although a district court in Oregon just found that exemption process violates the Fourth Amendment ) .
The government can do the same to foreigners outside the country without ever getting court approval .
What FISA does do in effect , however , is give Fourth Amendment Us. communications facilities .
The real question is n't whether Iraqi kidnappers get the protection of the Fourth Amendment .
Clearly they do not .
The question is whether the communication infrastructure used by Americans to do business , talk to their loved ones , coordinate political rallies and express their political opinions should be turned into gigantic microphone that the nation 's spy agencies can monitor constantly for odd patterns and listen in on anytime they wish , with no court supervision , with only a promise that they will only use it to catch real bad guys .
That 's what the Administration and the nation 's intelligence community wants , but they wo n't come out and say that .
Instead they push for that power using misleading edge cases such as the Iraqi kidnapping story .
DNC : Please stop the Clinton Sleaze Campaign Against Barack Obama
by : TM Wheaton
recipient : Voting Democrats
Dear Mr. Dean :
I respectfully but forcefully ask that you request of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton and her surrogates to stop running this smear campaign against Barack Obama .
Her behavior as exhibited in myriad repeated distortions of the facts , incidents of voter suppression , voter intimidation , and the telling of of lies is polarizing the democratic party and is compromising the integrity of the Democratic process .
If she wins the primary through trickery , I and many thousands of others across all 50 states may consider a boycott of the general election or voting for another party 's candidate .
We would like her and her surrogates to publicly apologize to the DNC and to Barack Obama for reducing this race to mudslinging and to disavow the politics of division that she has been engaging in .
Thank you .
Mind that age !

If the girl and her future partner choose to use the eggs , the woman will become the first in the world to give birth to her own biological half - sister or brother .
Flavie Boivin was born with a genetic disorder called Turner syndrome which affects one in 2,500 female births .
Women with the condition have very few eggs from birth and reach the menopause extremely early , so are often infertile by the time they may want to have children .
Melanie Boivin , a 35 - year - old lawyer from Montreal , decided to donate some of her own eggs to her daughter because of lengthy waiting lists for donor eggs which she believed would only be worse when Flavie is older .
Mrs Boivin , who has two other children , an 11 - year - old son and a two - year - old daughter who does not have Turner syndrome , approached fertility doctors at McGill University in Montreal to ask if they would consider storing her eggs .
" For a complete year I was thinking about it and did some research on the internet and was discussing it with my partner because we were concerned about the ethical questions .
Would I look at the child as my grandchild or as my own ?
We were also concerned about the financial impact , the physical impact on me and the emotional impact on the family .
After a year I was convinced there were more advantages than disadvantages , " said Mrs Boivin .
" What made us sure was the fact that I was there to help my daughter .
The role of a mother is essentially to help her children and if I could do anything in my power to help her I had to do it and because of my age I had to do it now .
I told myself if she had needed another organ like a kidney I would volunteer without any hesitation and it is the same kind of thought process for this , " she added .
Fertility specialists at the university referred the case to an ethics committee , which approved the procedure .
If Flavie wishes to use the eggs , she will need to seek approval from another ethics committee before her treatment can go ahead .
Because Turner syndrome is a genetic condition which can be passed from parent to child , it is likely that any embryos produced from her mother 's eggs would be tested for the condition using a technique called pre-implantation genetic diagnosis .
Seang Lin Tan , who treated Mrs Boivin , said that whilst women with Turner syndrome are often unable to produce their own eggs , their wombs are usually completely healthy , and many women with the condition have given birth to embryos made from donated eggs .
He gave details of the case at the annual meeting of the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology in Lyon yesterday .
" It 's up to the daughter and her future partner to decide whether to use the eggs or not .
She does n't have to , and they may decide to donate the eggs to another couple and then have somebody else give eggs to them , " Professor Tan said .
In Britain , fertility law prohibits frozen eggs from being stored for longer than 10 years .
Mrs Boivin added : " I do not want to oblige her to use the eggs , I want to give her the option .
I was trying to open another door for her .
It is very difficult to imagine how I will react when the situation [ of Flavie having a child using her eggs ] arises .
She will need to make the decision and if she wants to go further I will be supportive and will see this child as any other grandchild . "
With HD DVD , things are just going from bad , to really bad , to worse , to car - crash - you - ca n 't - stop - looking - at .
You can file this one under that latter category , as Wal - Mart has officially announced its intentions to stop stocking HD DVD players and movies by June .
According to reports , the retailer came to the decision after Netflix and Best Buy made announcements concerning their position in the HD format war .
Susan Chronister of Wal - Mart wrote on the company 's blog , " By June Wal - Mart will only be carrying Blu-ray movies and hardware machines , and of course standard - def movies , DVD players , and up - convert players . "
Susan went on to deliver what we consider a total burn by adding , " if you bought the HD [ DVD ] player like me , I 'd retire it to the bedroom , kid 's playroom , or give it to your parents to play their John Wayne standard - def movies , and make space for a BD player . "
Look , we 're not gonna say that this is it for HD DVD , but ... uh , it does n't look real great .

First , an illustrative anecdote : A little over a year ago , Iraq ’s prime minister Nuri al - Maliki arrived in Washington and addressed Congress .
The event was supposed to be a booster for the elected Iraqi leadership , showing U.S. support for the new government .
But at the time , Israel was pummeling Beirut in response to Hizballah ’s capture of two Israeli soldiers , so U.S. legislators naively tried — and failed — to get Maliki to condemn Hizballah .
And , revealing the extent to which Washington is encased in a bubble when it comes to matters involving Israel in the Middle East , Senators Chuck Schumer , Harry Reid and Dick Durbin wrote Maliki a letter saying the following : “ Your failure to condemn Hezbollah ’s aggression and recognize Israel ’s right to defend itself raise serious questions about whether Iraq under your leadership can play a constructive role in resolving the current crisis and bringing stability to the Middle East . ”
To cut bluntly to the chase , there is scarcely a single politician in the Arab world willing to endorse Washington ’s definitions of the problems or the solutions when it comes to Israel ’s impact on the region — and that even among the autocrats with whom the U.S. prefers to work , much less that rare breed that Maliki represents , i.e. a democratically elected leader .
It is the U.S. leadership that is in denial about what is needed to create security in the region .
Indeed , the grownups in Washington know this better than anyone .
In response to the same crisis in Lebanon , former National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft wrote :
Hezbollah is not the source of the problem ; it is a derivative of the cause , which is the tragic conflict over Palestine that began in 1948 .
The eastern shore of the Mediterranean is in turmoil from end to end , a repetition of continuing conflicts in one part or another since the abortive attempts of the United Nations to create separate Israeli and Palestinian states in 1948 .
But nobody in power listens to Brent Scowcroft any more .
Washington ’s Israel bubble so detaches it from an objective view of the Middle East that Howard Dean ’s 2003 call for the U.S. to adopt an “ even - handed ” position between Israel and the Palestinians has longsince entered the U.S. political playbook as an example of foot - in - mouth campaigning .
( See my earlier entry on how well Barack Obama has learned this lesson . )
Like the tech - bubble and real estate - bubble , Washington ’s “ Israel bubble ” is unhealthy and dangerous — in fact , it not only jeopardizes U.S. interests throughout the region and beyond ( by serving as Exhibit A for any anti-American element anywhere in the Islamic world to win the political contest with America ’s friends ) , but it is also exceedingly bad for Israel : Particularly over the past decade , the U.S. has essentially enabled Israeli behavior so self - destructive that it may have already precluded any chance of it being able to live at peace with its neighbors .
It is the lancing of this Israel bubble — in the best interests of the United States , the Arab world , and Israel ’s own prospects for peaceful coexistence with its neighbors — that John Mearsheimer and Steven Walt have dedicated themselves , first in last year ’s London Review of Books essay and now in a new book , titled “ The Israel Lobby . ”
They argue , firstly , that the absolute bias hardwired into U.S. policy towards Israel is neither a rational foreign policy for the U.S. or even particularly helpful to Israel .
And they further make the case that this policy has been maintained and extended with increasingly destructive effect by the interventions and activities of a network of groupings they broadly define as the Israel lobby , which actively puts Israel positions ( rather than American ones ) at the forefront of U.S. policy ( on issues ranging from the Palestinians to Iran ) , and which uses its considerable reach in the political process in Washington to ensure that challenging the U.S. bias towards Israel , as Dean did , is considered political suicide for a politician with presidential ambitions .
Their book is a comprehensive scholarly work , but its purpose is unashamedly political .
The book has a number of weaknesses —
I find its analytical approach often static and institutional ; insufficiently dynamic and , dare I say it , insufficiently dialectical .
On the nature of the U.S. - Israel relationship in last summer ’s disastrous war in Lebanon , for example , I disagree with their denial of responsibility on Washington ’s part — the original impulse to take some form of action may have come from the Israeli leadership , but as I made clear at the time , it was hard to avoid the suspicion that the scale and objectives of the operation became defined by Washington , and they were plainly goals for which Israel had not prepared its forces .
Also , the process of skewing U.S. bias towards Israel may reveal the machinations of a lobby , but they have also become deeply - entrenched tropes in U.S. political and civil society — tropes which now function quite independently of the lobby ’s interventions .
But regardless of a number of specific instances that I might analyse somewhat differently , I have no quarrel with its central argument that U.S. policy on Israel and its neighbors is grotesquely biased in favor not only of Israel , but of Israel ’s most self - destructive impulses .
As such , it is a policy dangerous to U.S. interests and ultimately to those of Israel itself .
This biased is maintained and policed in substantial part by an aggressive lobbying effort by an elaborate pro-Israel political infrastructure .
Despite its analytical weaknesses , it is a refreshingly candid and courageous ( given the all too common fate of those who tackle this taboo — just take a look at the important logging of this stuff at Muzzlewatch ) embrace of what has long been the “ third rail ” of American foreign policy , insisting that a debate be conducted where none has been tolerated until now .
And , its significance may be measured in part by the response it has elicted .
Not so much the predictable fulminations of Abe Foxman in his prebuttal of Mearsheimer and Walt , The Deadliest Lies , or the manic chatter of Haaretz ’s resident arbiter of all things Hebrew Nationalist in America , Shmuel Rosner — all of that may be par for the course .
But M&W share with Jimmy Carter that ability to call forth a rather unfortunate habit among sections of America ’s liberal punditocracy , in which sharp and fundamental criticisms of Israel must be discredited and squashed , even at the cost of the cool reason for which the pundits in question are usually known .
To put it unkindly , when Israel is under the spotlight , many liberal commentators feel compelled to embarrass themselves in its defense .
I noticed this phenomenon last year when Jimmy Carter made the entirely valid comparison between Israel ’s West Bank regime and the apartheid system that prevailed in South Africa until 1994 .
That prompted Michael Kinsley — a well - known and generally smart liberal pundit — to denounce Carter ’s comparison in an op - ed that only served to show how little he knew about either the Middle East or apartheid South Africa .
Clearly , though , the idea that Israel was committing crimes equivalent to apartheid clearly made Kinsley so uncomfortable that he felt compelled to blurt out something — anything , really , to negate Carter , and make the discomfort he caused go away .
( I critiqued his lame response to Carter in an earlier post . )
This phenomenon is reflective of a trend that has been confirmed to me anecdotally dozens of times , both in the U.S. and at home in South Africa , where some Jewish liberals of faultlessly progressive politics on every other issue turn into raving tribal belligerents of the Ariel Sharon hue when the conversation turns to Israel .
We ’ve all seen it , dozens of times , I ’m sure — although I ’m pleased to say I know a lot more whose politics are consistent , and are not prone to being possessed by Zionist Mr. Hydes .
David Remnick is not among them , unfortunately .
In response to Mearsheimer and Walt , New Yorker editor Remnick offers a fresh specimen of the denial pathology .
What is most strking about his piece , however , is that it is more of a kvetch , designed to discredit M&W in the eyes of New Yorker readers , than a serious engagement with their argument .
For example , Remnick notes that M&W are realists , i.e. they make their case for a foreign policy based on national interests .
Remnick writes :
“ There is a strong moral case for supporting Israel ’s existence , ” [ M&W ] write , but they deny that Israel is of critical strategic value to the United States .
The disappearance of Israel , in their view , would jeopardize neither America ’s geopolitical interests nor its core values .
Such is their “ realism . ”
The latter line seems to be dropped in with a note of bitter irony , as if it somehow damns the authors , who repeatedly make clear their belief that the U.S. should support Israel where it ’s right to exist is threatened , but note that its existence is not actually under threat , right now — instead , the U.S. is being called upon to underwrite its brutal occupation policies .
But the argument that Israel ’s disappearance would not substantially harm U.S. national interests is a perfectly legitimate one in the realist framework , bereft of emotion : Israel safeguards no vital national interests of the United States , and is more of a liability than an asset in the broad U.S. strategic approach to the Middle East .
Those who argue that Israel has value as a U.S. ally can point only to tactical advantages , e.g. Israel ’s intelligence services can better infiltrate radical groups than can their American allies .
No doubt .
But on the strategic plane , such advantages are negated by the fact that by unconditionally backing Israel and its regime of occupation over the Palestinians , it becomes virtually impossible for any Arab leader to openly associate with U.S. goals .
It was precisely this recognition of Israel ’s limited strategic value to the U.S. in a post - Cold War world that led Yitzhak Rabin , a longtime hawk , to embrace the Oslo deal presented to him by Shimon Peres .
Like the leaders of apartheid South Africa in the late 80s , Rabin had come to recognize ( particularly in the era of the first Bush administration ) that Israel could no longer count on unconditional U.S. backing given Washington ’s interests elsewhere in the region .
As a result , it was compelled to seek an accomodation with the Palestinian national leadership .
Of course , this was an exceedingly good thing .
Unfortunately , Rabin need n’t have worried , because the changing domestic political atmosphere in the U.S. — the success of the Israel lobby beyond its wildest dreams , particularly as a result of the backing of perhaps its latterly most important constituent , the Evangelical Christian Zionists , had meant that Israel could count on U.S. backing regardless of its behavior in relation to the Palestinians .
M&W are simply pointing out that this does not accord with an accurate reading of U.S. national interests .
Remnick notes that M&W “ are right to describe the moral violation in Israel ’s occupation of Palestinian lands .
( In this , most Israelis and most American Jews agree with them . ) ”
But then he complains that they reveal a nefarious agenda in blaming Israel for all ills in its relationship with the Palestinians , and the Arab more broadly .
The narrative rightly points out the destructiveness of the Israeli settlements in the occupied territories and America ’s reluctance to do much to curtail them , but there is scant mention of Palestinian violence or diplomatic bungling , only a recitation of the claim that , in 2000 , Israel offered “ a disarmed set of Bantustans under de-facto Israeli control . ”
( Strange that , at the time , the Saudi Prince Bandar told Yasir Arafat , “ If we lose this opportunity , it is not going to be a tragedy .
This is going to be a crime . ” )
But while Remnick may satisfy his liberal conscience by conceding the idea that the occupation is bad , what he ’s not answering is M&W ’s case that it is bizarre to the point of inexplicable that the U.S. no longer bothers to even threaten to take steps to restrain Israel from this “ moral violation . ”
U.S. support for Israel is unconditional , settlements and all .
The sad fact , for the likes of Remnick , is that the occupation is not some aberration on Israel ’s part ; there really is no longer any real distinction , in practice on the ground , between Israel and its occupation of the lands it captured in 1967 .
As Henry Siegman recently explained in an excellent piece in the London Review of Books , Israel quite simply has no inclination to withdraw from the occupied territories , and its ideas of a “ peace process ” are essentially limited to the pursuit of Palestinian surrender .
As for evoking the authority of Prince Bandar , oy .
Remnick himself had suggested that debate on U.S. Middle East policy was welcome , and that it should include questions such as “ whether we should be supplying arms to the Saudis . ”
Uh , Dave , those deals are typically negotiated by Bandar .
And by the way , since when did this Bush - Cheney acolyte become a voice of Arab authority ?
How many Arab leaders were willing to publicly endorse the deal offered at Camp David ?
( Bandar himself would n’t , you can be sure .
And nor would Mahmoud Abbas . )
Remnick is entirely correct that most American Jews would agree with M&W about the occupation , but that simply underlines a point they make throughout the book — that the positions and interventions of the Israel lobby are not representative of mainstream American Jewish opinion ; they ’re way to the right of it .
It ’s not a “ Jewish lobby , ” it ’s a lobby of people — many of them Evangelical Christians — supporting the positions of the hardline nationalist right in Israel .
Remnick also attempts the rather silly argument that U.S. support for Israel has little impact on the appeal of Osama bin Laden and other radicals in the Arab world , because Bin Laden ’s objective is to overthrow Arab autocracies backed by the U.S.
Yes , of course it is , but the point is that Bin Laden hardly needs to break a sweat in “ proving ” American malfeasance to any Muslim audience — he simply needs to point for Washington ’s unswerving support of Israel , and the argument is over .
And that precludes U.S. allies in the Arab world from attaining any popular legitimacy .
While denying that M&W are anti-Semites , Remnick nonetheless questions the bona fides of their intervention .
His message to his readers is , do n’t worry about what these guys are saying , they ’re just grinding an axe .
Wink .
“ Taming the influence of lobbies , if that is what Mearsheimer and Walt desire , is a matter of reforming the lobbying and campaign - finance laws , ” but he suggests that , intead , the authors are a product of a polarized political moment , reducing all ills to a single cause — the Israel lobby .
But Remnick has n’t honestly engaged with their arguments aside from clucking over the settlements :
Does Remnick agree , for example , that the U.S. should leave Israel no choice but to withdraw its West Bank settlements , by threatening to cut off the spigot if it does n’t stop and reverse its colonization of the West Bank ?
Should the U.S. not use its considerable power over Israel to march it back to its 1967 borders ?
That , really , is what ’s at issue here .
Remnick ’s own Israel bubble has been taking a bit of a battering of late :
Just three weeks ago , he found himelf compelled to write a subtle smear of Avrum Burg , largely attributing the former Knesset speaker ’s renunciation of Zionism to his supposed personality defects !
Plainly , Remnick has little appetite for engaging with Burg ’s notion that , as he put it , he had always considered himself a human being , a Jew and a Zionist until he began to recognize that his Zionism negated the other two aspects of his identity .
Burg , like Mearsheimer and Walt , had clearly made Remnick uncomfortable .
But he ’s substantially correct in challenging the M&W idea that the lobby is singularly responsible for policing America ’s public discourse on Israel .
After all , nobody asked Remnick to write these pieces .
Nor did anyone tell Kinsley to try and shoot down Jimmy Carter ’s apartheid argument .
Just as important as challenging the Israel lobby is drawing attention to the deep - rooted tropes of knee - jerk defensiveness in sections of the liberal - Jewish intelligentsia that allows them to avert their eyes and cling to fantasy when Israel is an agent of oppression .

Christmas is over , as you read this -- but I 'm writing it the week before .
I have no idea yet what Santa brought , but I can bet on a few things .
I 'll bet , for instance , that Santa was much more generous with the children of rich parents than with the children of poor ones .
And yet , unfair as this might seem , I 'll bet that the poor kids had at least as much fun , on average , as the rich ones -- and maybe more .
Partly because the poor kids are much more likely to have had a neighborhood full of other kids to play with and hang out with .
On the other hand the more well - to - do kids are more likely to have both their father and mother still living in the same house with them , and that makes a big difference , too .
So maybe , on average , everybody pretty much had as good a Christmas as anybody else .
Some better , some worse .
The statistics can tell us some things , but happiness is n't measurable .
It comes to people one at a time , and to different degrees .
I 'll bet , though , that the quality of everyone 's Christmas depended far more on the quality of their family life and the personalities of the people they live with than the amount of money spent on gifts for them .
Kids with kindly parents had merrier Christmases than those who were tiptoeing around hoping not to get anybody mad .

So now we 're heading to another New Year .
This should be a glorious celebration , because some wonderful things happened in 2007 .
Our President found the commander , and the strategy , that are leading us to victory in the Iraq campaign .
So the lives that were invested in fighting this war on foreign shores instead of at home were not wasted -- they will bring the return that was promised .
It does n't bring any of the lost ones back , but it makes their sacrifice meaningful .
Our economy is robust and , while it is never under anyone 's control , it seems to be doing well , with blips -- in other words , business as usual .
And yet ... somehow , as we head into the New Year , many Americans will actually be frustrated that we 're doing well in the war -- they may even be trying to deny it and convince people that we 're still losing .
Others will be claiming -- falsely -- that our soldiers have caused unending disaster in the countries we liberated from vicious dictatorships .
Many are trying to convince us that financially we 're all in desperate shape , and all that prosperity is illusory , or the wrong kind , or going to the wrong people .
Why such a disparity between reality and the image commonly presented on our national media ?
Why , because it's an election year with a Republican incumbent , of course !
When there 's a Democratic incumbent , then of course everything is rosy and no stories are bad .
All actions were brilliant accomplishments ; all inaction was wise rather than indolent or cowardly .
Everything spins to the plus side .
But in years when a Republican is in control of the White House , you 'd think an asteroid had struck America , the stories are so dire .
All that head - shaking and tongue - clucking .
So worried , these commentators .
Things look so downand dark .
We need a change .
Do n't be deceived .
We 've had eight years with a president of extraordinary courage and moral strength and , yes , wisdom .
Bad at selling himself to the people , but then , he had to contend with the continuous hostility of the press , so it 's not as if we could ever get to know him without them filtering everything .
Our business is not to vote on President Bush this year .
Our business is to look at the candidates and decide which person has the wisdom to deal with problems as yet unforeseen , and the strength of will to stand firm after decisions are made .
We need to determine which candidates are honorable and say what they mean and mean what they say ; which candidates know how to make a promise and keep it , no matter what .
I remember back in 1992 , as I looked at Bill Clinton , saying to anyone who would listen :
If he can't keep his promises to his wife , why should we believe any of the promises he makes to us ?
And , sure enough , he was in office about twenty minutes before he was breaking promises to almost everyone .
( The only exception was his stand in favor of limitless abortion -- which is what won him the silence of the so - called Women 's Movement when he was committing perjury to conceal his exploitation of powerless women . )
His life already revealed his moral character , and we got the president we paid for .
In an election year , we can't possibly guess what future the president will be presiding over .
But we can decide what kind of person will lead us through that future , and what moral principles will guide him .
Will it be the person who obviously took bribes but simply denies it ?
The person who used public money to conceal an adulterous relationship ?
The person who uses religious bigotry as a tool to bring down a frontrunner , even as he claims to stand for constitutional values ?
The person who claims to champion the poor , but treats ordinary people with disdain when he happens to run into them ?
The person who kind of wants to be president but does n't want to do any of the work required to actually get the office ?
I remember commentators nodding wisely and saying that the " character issue " does n't really matter .
I shook my head in despair .
If a candidate 's character is bad , if they can't be trusted , what does it matter what he or she might promise us ?
Look at their life , at their past , at what they actually do .
That 's how you find out the kind of person you 're going to have in charge .
Of course , that is n't how we got George W. Bush .
We got him because he was the most electable Republican in a year when Republicans were desperate to get rid of Bill Clinton .
We did n't know at the time how dishonest and stupid Al Gore was -- that was revealed later , in his attempt to steal the election and his fraudulent exploitation of the global warming scare .
But enough people in the right states were fed up with a cynical , unprincipled presidency to vote for the other guy , whoever he was .
And we ended up with a decent man in the office -- and a patient one , who has put up with an unprecedented level of slander and misrepresentation while governing us very well .
There was an old saying once : " God protects fools , drunks , and the United States . "
Sometimes I think that having George W. Bush as President was God 's last gesture of protection .
If we 're so stupid we can't recognize a good man when we 're led by one , if we can't take responsibility for our own defense and the defense of helpless people in other lands , if we can't recognize when we 're truly blessed and keep trying to make changes that can only make our situation worse -- well , maybe it 's time for God to say , in effect , " OK , kids .
You think you know how to do it better .
Go ahead .
Have it your way . "
So even as we are living in a wonderful time , prosperous and victorious , I face this New Year with foreboding , because I 'm not sure the American majority wants to be free and strong and decent anymore , not at a national level or a personal one .
The people who revel in weakness , dependence , and indecency are so numerous now , and feel so justified in their appalling , self - destructive beliefs and behavior , that I wonder how much longer this will be a nation that 's worth defending .
We 're a nation founded , not on ethnicity , but on ideals .
When we reach a point when most of us no longer believe in those ideals , then what are we standing on ?
Why do we exist as a people ?
Should we exist , when our existence , as a nation , has no more meaning than that of countries born of chance rather than design ?
That 's the kind of thing I think about when New Year 's comes around .
Just be glad you 're not spending New Year 's Eve at my house .
It 's so gloomy , with me brooding around the house about the fall of empires and the decay of civilizations ...

Let me end the year with reviews of some music that I 've been listening to for the past while .
Jane Monheit 's new album , Surrender , is a gorgeous thing .
Her voice has a dreamy quality to it , and on this album she has reached the pinnacle , doing the things she does best .
Several Brazilian songs -- including a perfect rendition of " So Many Stars , " arranged by and sung with Sergio Mendes -- mark her as someone who understands that jazz was transformed in Brazil into a new music with far more life in it than the American Be -Bop dead end .
When she and Ivan Lins sing " Rio de Maio " ( " River of May , " perhaps an answer to " Waters of March " ) , not only is her Portuguese accent nearly perfect , her musical nuances are exquisite .
Her choices never seem analyzed , and yet they are endlessly surprising and endlessly right .
The best track on this album is , of all things , " Moon River . "
Nothing against Andy Williams , but this song has never been so beautiful before .
Monheit 's vocalizations never feel like showing off ; instead , it 's as if we 're overhearing someone 's meditations .
Or perhaps the feelings of her heart .
If you 've never listened to Monheit , give her a try .
This is music for people who actually remember what a melody is , and what a voice is supposed to do with it .
The next album I 've fallen in love with is called Love Songs of the 70s .
This was the last decade when pop music actually had songs ( now real songs linger mostly in jazz and country ) .
But the singer drew together an astonishingly eclectic range of songs -- and nailed them all .
How about Gilbert O'Sullivan 's weird and whiny " Alone Again ( Naturally ) " -- would you believe it can be a soulful introspection with a rather sweet melody ?
Then David Gates 's " If , " matching him high note for high note , and yet making the song sound more mature ; with this singer , it is n't just a series of romantic conceits , it 's more like a set of serious promises .
" You Are So Beautiful , " with all the passion of Joe Cocker , but without the torture .
" Mandy , " as sweetly as Manilow did it , but not overproduced , so now you realize it really is a song full of regret for a love lost .
" When I Need You , " " Laughter in the Rain , " along with soul songs like " Will It Go Round in Circles " and " Let 's Stay Together . "
The singer is never imitating the original performers -- every song is made his own -- and yet he is still true to the kind of song it 's supposed to be .
The result is that we hear a voice of extraordinary range and power , and a singer with a perfect sensitivity to the meaning of the words , so he 's never showing off , he 's simply placing exactly the right emotion into musical form .
In short , this is a great album that proves that those were good songs and not just popular records .
And the singer is ...
Donny Osmond .
Osmond left " cuteness " far behind him .
This is a man 's voice ; this is the heart of someone who knows something about what life means , and so he can take a song inside him and bring it out again as something new .
Even the wretched excess of Dan Hill 's " Sometimes When We Touch , " sung by a mature singer with some real understanding , becomes music instead of overacting .
I think Osmond 's time on Broadway was more pivotal in his singing career than anyone really understood .
He 's still a pop singer , but I 'm hearing Broadway vocal techniques in his voice .
His ability to absolutely control his range -- he flows into and out of falsetto with almost no missteps , and he can pop that belting voice with amazing power -- is something that is almost unknown in pop music .
But his native talent is still there :
His pitch is dead on all the time .
In an era when many pop singers seem not to know what pitch is , making it gratingly painful to listen to them sing at a melody like a toddler trying to spear a grape with a fork , it 's a relief to listen to a singer who has absolute mastery over his voice and the music he 's singing .
Forget the child ; forget the cute teenager .
Donny Osmond is a man .
A man who may well be the best pop singer we have right now .
Taylor Swift 's self - titled debut album looked appallingly overdone , from the cover : A holographic 3D picture that looked like somebody 's misguided pre-wedding picture .
What a delightful surprise , then , to find that Swift is actually a powerful country singer who knows how to nail a song to the wall like a manifesto .
" Should 've Said No " is brilliantly performed .
I had to look to see who wrote this great song , because I wondered how this newcomer was able to get her hands on an anthem that any of the big stars would have faunched over .
Guess what ?
She wrote it herself .
She wrote or co-wrote every song on the album .
No surprise that her album has gone platinum .
She 's the real thing .
She 's going to be an important country and pop singer for a long time to come , and she does n't depend on other people to bring her the songs that will make her memorable .
Is n't it nice when somebody who 's being hyped to death is actually worth it ?
Nobody 's hyping Shannon Brown -- not with the treatment Taylor Swift is getting , anyway -- but she 's also a new country singer to be reckoned with .
She co-wrote most of her songs , and most of them are by or with John Rich and Vicky McGehee .
The combination is a strong one -- every song on her debut album is excellent .
But the best is , not by mere coincidence , the title track : " Corn Fed . "
By the end of the song I felt as if I 'd grown up in Iowa instead of the suburbs in the bay area of California .
And , finally : I 'm a fan of Alison Krauss , but not of Robert Plant , so I had trepidation in approaching their first collaborative album , Raising Sand .
My fears were needless .
Together , their very different musics become something new and really quite fine .
I hope this is n't the last album they do together .
Martin Bosworth wrote in his piece on John Edwards ’ withdrawal from the Democratic Presidential race : “ Edwards did not fit the assumed narrative the media wanted to run with in this campaignâ € “ he was the outsider , the guy who wasnâ€™t campaigning on experience or the audacity of hope .
Moreover , he was speaking painful truths about class , corporatism , and how our lives are dictated and controlled by the power elite .
So the media machine cranked up the distortion and tried to smear him into oblivion with stupid trivialities .
Yet , through all that , his message persevered . ” ( italics mine )
If this is true , why is JE out of the race ?
What Edwards is really doing is paying the price for being a white guy at the time of historic ( and mostly just ) back lash against the “ aristocracy of white guys ” that has been the target of the concerted efforts of “ liberals ” who are n’t liberal at all .
What these “ liberals ” ( too often media pundits ) are are ideologues who proclaim that someone would make a better ( read “ more media interest worthy ” )
Presidential candidate simply because that person is a ) a woman or b ) an African - American .
Justice is one thing – ideology is another – this is ideology at its most reeking ….
Yes , I hear your scornful retorts : “ These are the times that try [ white ] men ’s souls … ” yadda , yadda … .
I do n’t say this to discredit Hillary or Obama , both of whom have real merit .
I say this because the drive to push forward a woman or black candidate is ( I fear ) a media creation that allows the media then to control the narrative of the Democratic campaign – and the election .
And the Democratic Party , which plays the sucker to every narrative the media creates for it , is playing the sucker again .
John Edwards has addressed overtly and directly real issues plaguing our country at this historical moment – the shift toward a class system that the “ Repugnacans ” have engineered – and their systematic removal of any realistic opportunity for those in the rapidly developing underclass to better themselves .
Edwards , like me , Sam Smith , and many others across this country , has been able to work hard , gain success , and rise to a position of both ( in a relative sense ) wealth and power because of the past social and economic policies of the Democratic Party .
I do n’t begrudge him any of his success the way the entitled scions of the Right do – to do so would be to repudiate my own life .
What I find most repellent in The Left ’s rejection of JE is its own smug self - righteousness that it is doing so for the “ correct ” reasons .
Not so .
The Left is rejecting Edwards because he reminds too many of us in the LeftÂ® of what WE came from – how we scrambled and worked and took advantage of opportunities made available by FDR , HST , JFK , and LBJ .
It ’s easier to glom onto the myth of Hillary as a deserving member of her gender or Obama as a deserving member of his race ( despicably patronizing behavior masquerading as visionary open - mindedness ) than to stand up and say “ offering opportunities for people to better themselves has been and should always be a basic tenet of the Democratic Party . ”
That would mean supporting Edwards – who espouses these positions – and rejecting the more fashionable idea of supporting Hillary or Obama because they represent a “ historic opportunity . ”
Poll after poll has shown that Edwards would defeat John “ I ’m a war President , too ” McCain in a general election .
Neither Hillary Clinton nor Barack Obama has fared as well .
I told the members of S&R privately weeks ago that I believed McCain would be the Republican candidate and that he might well defeat Obama or Clinton .
And , in another media manipulated tilt at the windmill of history , the Democrat Party ( let ’s just buy into the humiliation that the Republican rulers of the media heap upon us , shall we ? ) will lose the 2008 election – and relegate our children and their children to lives increasingly indistinguishable from those of kids in those countries who provide us with illegal immigrants .
I ’m reminded of the way Sam Smith and I have often laughingly scoffed that the only Marxists left are those wearing tweed in tony offices in universities .
The closest they ever get to the “ revolution ” is the occasional Cuban cigar obtained from a Canadian friend .
Those of us who ’ve benefited from the Democratic Party ’s social and economic policies that allowed us to get educations and move up the economic and social ladder are like tweedy Marxists .
We ’re interested in opportunity as an intellectual abstract .
In plain English , too many of us are full of shit .
Opportunity is only opportunity if it ’s at work on the ground helping kids do better than their parents .
Edwards has spoken to this issue in ways that no other Democratic candidate has – or seems interested in doing .
What the Democratic Party needs now are people who vote Democratic because they see a tangible gain for themselves in doing so .
It ’s not about race or gender – it ’s about message .
As my grandfather , a North Carolina tobacco farmer , used to say , “ there are fools – and then there are damned fools . ”
The Democratic Party has , I believe , shown itself to be in the latter group by rejecting a candidate whose message has more in common with those Democratic Presidents mentioned above than either of the remaining candidates .
We will soon , I fear , be able to rue our decision at our leisure .
The Democratic measure was an amendment offered by Senator Jim Webb of Virginia , a former military man ( and former Republican ) .
His proposal sought to ensure a decent interval of " dwell time " at home for US soldiers before being sent back to Iraq .
Democrats thought they had hit on an unassailable formula for being pro-troops while at the same time keeping pressure on the Bush administration .
Republicans smelled a plan to render a sustained large troop presence unworkable .
Now , the US Senate is an oddly conceived body .
It was chiefly a constitutional sop to small states with its assurance that each state would have two senators .
But it was also designed to allow minorities to halt stampeding majorities .
One senator can stop anything .
As a result , through most of its history the Senate has been a deeply intransigent body , the reactionaries ' last line of defence .
And since the Democrats took over this year , Republicans - under their leader , Mitch McConnell of Kentucky - have stalled so much that they 're on pace to set a new record for blocked legislation by a factor of three .
Then , having gummed up the works , McConnell et al turn around and accuse the Democrats of running a do - nothing Congress !
This , in a nutshell , is why the Democrats have not been able to end the war .
Republican legislators know that , however unpopular the war may be , a united pro-war front might help the party keep the White House in 2008 , because they can run on the accusation that the Democrats wish defeat and disgrace upon these great United States of America .
Here , Mrs Clinton enters the picture .
Her near flawless campaign last week executed the near flawless unveiling of her healthcare plan .
This was much anticipated , partly because of the dramatic failure in 1993 - 94 under her watch and partly because people wanted to see how ambitious she would be .
Lo and behold , the plan was much more far - reaching than anyone expected ( and thus pleasing to liberals ) , and it avoided some of the errors of the past ( thus passing muster with the pundit class ) .
If Clinton actually becomes president , she will have laid a strong foundation from which to spring into action on the great piece of unfinished business of 20th - century American liberalism .
But ... those Republicans , and that Senate .
It has gone down in history that Hillary blew healthcare the first time around because of her tone - deafness and unwillingness to compromise .
But there 's more to the story - much more .
Paul Starr was one of the Clinton administration 's leading healthcare reform experts .
Writing in The American Prospect , he argues convincingly that conservatives and Republicans were set against allowing the Clintons to pass any healthcare reform " because if it succeeded , it might renew New Deal beliefs in the efficacy of government , whereas a defeat of the health plan could set liberalism back for years " .
That is the main reason the Clinton plan failed , just as current GOP obstinacy is the main reason the Democrats can't end the war .
And if anything , Republican fear of liberal success is greater today , and will be greater in 2009 , than in 1993 , and they will fight any Democratic president tooth and nail .
And the 47 million without healthcare , and the thousands dying in Iraq ?
As usual , they are beside the point .

The band Radiohead is trying an interesting experiment , offering its new album In Rainbows for download and letting each customer decide how much to pay .
You can name a price of zero and download the album for free , if you want , or you can pay whatever price you think is fair .
Now Andy Greenberg at Forbes is reporting that despite Radiohead ’s free - if - you - choose offer , many users are downloading the album from P2P systems rather than getting it from the band ’s site .
Some commentators find this surprising , but in fact it should have been predictable .
Why are some people getting In Rainbows from P2P rather than the band ’s site ?
Probably because they find P2P easier to use .
Radiohead ’s site makes you click and click to get the music .
First you have to click through a nearly content - free splash screen .
Then you click through another splash screen telling you things you probably already knew .
Then you click an “ ORDER ” button , and click away a dialog box telling you something you already knew .
Then after some headscratching , you realize you need to click the “ VIEW BASKET ” button , which takes you to a form asking you to name your price , in U.K. currency .
( They link you to a third - party site , offering a large collection of currency - conversion tools – several more clicks to find the one you want . )
After choosing your price , you click “ PAY NOW ” , at which point you get to stare at a “ You are currently in a queue ” screen for a while , after which you set up an daccount enter some personal information ( including your email address and mobile phone number ) and agree to some terms of service ( which are benign , but it ’s more time and more clicks to verify that ) .
Finally , you get to download the music .
It ’s easy to see why somebody might prefer a P2P download .
Leaving aside legal issues – and let ’s face it , many people do – the moral argument against unauthorized P2P downloading seems pretty weak in this case , where downloaders are n’t depriving the band ( or anyone else ) of revenue .
This is an interesting natural experiment that tells us something about why people use P2P .
If people normally choose P2P over authorized channels because P2P is cheaper , we would expect customers to shift toward the authorized channel when it offers a zero price .
But if people choose P2P for convenience , then we ’d expect a shift toward more P2P use for this album , because people have fewer moral qualms about P2P downloading this album than they would for a normal album .
The clunkiness of Radiohead ’s site improves the experiment by sharpening the ease - of - use factor .
It ’s too early to tell how the experiment will come out , but news reports so far indicate that the ease - of - use factor is probably more important than some pundits think .
This is yet more evidence that had the record industry embraced easy - to - use Internet music technologies early on , things would be very different now .
[ UPDATE ( Oct 21 , 2007 ) : Bill Zeller documents how technical issues completely prevent a large number of users from legally downloading In Rainbows from Radiohead ’s site . ]
NEW YEAR'S EVE has been and gone , but for oilmen , the party continues .
On January 2nd , helped across the line by a New York trader eager for bragging rights , the first business day of the year , the price of their product topped $ 100 a barrel for the first time .
Oil is now almost five times more expensive than it was at the beginning of 2002 .
It would be natural to assume that ever increasing price reflects ever greater scarcity .
And so it does , in a sense .
Booming bits of the world , such as China , India and the Middle East have seen demand for oil grow with their economies .
Meanwhile , Western oil firms , in particular , are struggling to produce any more of the stuff than they did two or three years ago .
That has left little spare production capacity and , in America at least , dwindling stocks .
Every time a tempest brews in the Gulf of Mexico or dark clouds appear on the political horizon in the Middle East , jittery markets have pushed prices higher .
This week , it was a cold snap in America and turmoil in Nigeria that helped the price reach three figures .
No wonder , then , that the phrase “ peak oil ” has been gaining ground even faster than the oil price .
With each extra dollar , the conviction grows that the planet has been wrung dry and will never be able to satisfy the thirst of a busy world .
Geography , not geology
Yet the fact that not enough oil is coming out of the ground does not mean not enough of it is there .
There are many other explanations for the lacklustre response to the glaring price signal .
For one thing , oil producers have tied their own hands .
During the 1980s and 1990s , when the price was low and so were profits , they pared back hiring and investment to a minimum .
Many ancillary firms that built rigs or collected seismic data shut up shop .
Now oil firms want to increase their output again , they do not have the staff or equipment they need .
Worse , nowadays , new oil tends to be found in relatively inaccessible spots or in more unwieldy forms .
That adds to the cost of extracting oil , because more engineers and more complex machinery are needed to exploit it — but the end of easy oil is a far remove from the jeremiads of peak - oilers .
The gooey tar - sands of Canada contain almost as much oil as Saudi Arabia .
Eventually , universities will churn out more geologists and shipyards more offshore platforms , though it will take a long time to make up for two decades of underinvestment .
The biggest impediment is political .
Governments in almost all oil - rich countries , from Ecuador to Kazakhstan , are trying to win a greater share of the industry 's bumper profits .
That is natural enough , but they often deter private investment or exclude it altogether .
The world 's oil supply would increase markedly if Exxon Mobil and Royal Dutch Shell had freer access to Russia , Venezuela and Iran .
In short , the world is facing not peak oil , but a pinnacle of nationalism .
None of that will help consumers or governments .
The economic toll of expensive oil is just as high whether geology or politics is to blame — and the best response is just the same .
Policy should encourage energy efficiency and support research into alternative fuels .
Governments seeking to shield their citizens with subsidies or price caps should instead expose them to the full cost to foster frugality .
All this will be hard and unpopular .
But politicians might console themselves with the thought that even the most recalcitrant petro-regime is more malleable than the brute realities of geology .
Canada 's oil sands , open arms alluring
As companies flock to abundant resources , groups raise concerns about environment
More and more oil companies are diving into Canada 's oil - soaked sands , eager to capitalize on vast resources in a stable country that welcomes outsiders .
In 2007 alone , Royal Dutch Shell , Marathon Oil Corp. and BP increased or established positions in the sands , either to extract the thick , tarlike oil or work with a Canadian producer to refine it in the United States .
They joined the slew of Canadian producers as well as ConocoPhillips , Chevron Corp. , Exxon Mobil Corp. , Devon Energy and others that have sands operations or joint ventures .
Moratorium suggested
But environmental concerns about increases in emissions and possible toxic chemical releases into waterways are growing along with the oil action .
Some environmental groups advocate a pullback or a moratorium on new projects to address those concerns , while others are pushing for the industry to take the lead in a greener approach .
" We know that the tar sands are an important part of the oil supply to the United States , but it needs to be done responsibly , " said Gary Stewart , a senior adviser to the International Boreal Conservation Campaign .
Earlier this month , a report from Toronto - based advocacy group Environmental Defence charged that oil sands operations have turned Canada into " the world 's dirty energy superpower . "
" It 's time to clean it up or shut it down , " Rick Smith , the group 's executive director , said in the report , which calls for government to crack down on polluters .
Plan to cut emissions
Jim Law , a spokesman for Alberta Environment , an agency of the province 's government , said monitoring and enforcement are extensive , although officials are well aware that increased production means more potential for pollution .
Reducing emissions during such a growth spurt is far from easy , he said .
But the government last month unveiled the beginnings of a plan to cut emissions in half by 2050 through increased efficiency , capturing carbon dioxide emissions and permanently injecting them underground and requiring that all new operations incorporate that technology into their building plans .
" We understand the importance of the oil sands , and the international attention that 's being focused on them , " Law said .
" In the short term , we are honest enough to admit that our emissions will rise as we bring more operations on stream .
But we will see a turning point . "
Expensive operations
Canada 's oil sands industry is at least 40 years old .
But growth was slow until recent years when high oil prices justified the expensive operations .
At a recent conference in Houston , ConocoPhillips Canada President Kevin Meyers compared the tarlike bitumen far underground to a hockey puck at room temperature .
It must be melted by injected steam before it can be pumped to the surface , an energy - intensive process that consumes a lot of natural gas .
Once retrieved , it must be diluted to be transported by pipeline .
Then it requires much processing to convert the heavy oil into usable refined products , so production costs can be four to five times as high as conventional light oil production .
But Canada has 179 billion barrels of proven oil reserves — second only to Saudi Arabia .
And though Alberta increased its royalties last year , the country 's " come on in " attitude has encouraged an influx as access shrinks in other resource - rich countries less willing to allow outsiders to control operations , such as Russia and Venezuela .
Of the 9.9 million barrels a day in total crude imports to the United States as of November , 1.9 million came from Canada .
Saudi Arabia was second at 1.5 million barrels .
Canada 's oil sands now produce about 1.3 million barrels a day , and that could ramp up to 3 million barrels a day by 2015 , according to the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers .
" This is a strategic resource not just for North America , not just for Canada , but for meeting global oil demand , " Meyers said .
Stewart , the conservationist , acknowledged that Canada 's current and potential output clearly illustrate that the boom will continue .
But he hopes the U.S. players , many of whom are already involved in other environmental initiatives , will reduce emissions and police possible water contamination without waiting for Canadian government orders to do so .
" We 're not trying to exclude the industry .
That 's not what we 're talking about at all , " said Stewart , who lives about 275 miles south of Fort McMurray , Alberta , the hub of much of the oil sands activity .
" We 're talking about doing it right . "
Going the extra mile
Greg Stringham , vice president of CAPP , said regulations governing sands operations are fairly strict .
" But they 're not necessarily enough , " he said , adding that some companies do the minimum they think they can .
Others , though , are stepping beyond those regulations to do more , he said .
For example , Oklahoma City - based Devon Energy satisfies the need for water in its bitumen operation by drilling into a deep underground aquifer that contains saltwater , much like brine , rather than siphoning freshwater supplies .
Once the water is used to heat and melt bitumen , it is treated and returned to the aquifer .
Devon spokesman Chip Minty said that when the company was drilling for water sources , it initially hit a reservoir that contained borderline drinkable water .
" Instead of using that , we spent another $ 1 million or $ 2 million to drill another well and go farther to get the stuff that was really bad .
We wanted to ensure we were not tapping into water that could have any use for any other purpose , " Minty said .
Stringham said other Canadian companies , including Syncrude and Suncor , have sought to increase efficiency by finding ways to get bitumen out of the ground using less natural gas to heat steam .
Techniques they are studying in newer developments include using water that is n't superheated , and perhaps as cool as room temperature , to melt and move bitumen .
" The lower the temperature of the water , the less amount of fuel has to go into it , " Stringham said .
" It saves them money and saves on emissions . "
Meyers , of ConocoPhillips , said at the recent conference that oil sands operations clearly " have a significant environmental footprint " with emissions , water use and intense use of natural gas .
" We have to do more " to decrease emissions per barrel of production , he said .
" How are we going to do that ?
Technology , " Meyers said .
The Alberta government has a similar view , and is relying heavily on encouraging study and implementation of carbon capture and storage technology .
Carbon capture
2
The oil industry is well - acquainted with injecting COinto the ground to force oil and natural gas out of underground formations .
But the concept of capturing millions of tons of the greenhouse gas to combat climate change and then transporting it to distant oil and gas reservoirs or brine formations is in its infancy .
Law , of the Alberta government agency , said the industry has dedicated $ 500 million to carbon capture and storage research .
In addition , the province will assemble a council of government and industry representatives to develop a plan to use that technology to cut emissions in half .
First they need the technology and infrastructure to make it work .
" We expect to have a strategy after the fall of this year , " Law said .

IN DEEPEST Washington state , trooper Dusty Pierpont stands in front of a roundabout trying to persuade motorists to like them .
Washington started building roundabouts in 1997 .
By 2001 there were 17 ; now there are over 100 , according to Brian Walsh of the state 's transport department .
But trooper Pierpont is still needed to soothe those first - time ( or even tenth - time ) nerves .
America may be sluggardly on general road - building , but it is experiencing a boom in modern roundabouts , which ( for those who have not yet met them ) do the job of any ordinary four - way , stop - sign or traffic - light crossroads .
They are more efficient and safer than the old traffic circles , such as Columbus Circle in Manhattan , which have been built in America for the past century .
( Modern designs include mechanisms for slowing traffic down as it nears the roundabouts , for example , and do not allow pedestrians onto the centre of the circle ) .
Although exact statistics are hard to come by , the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety ( IIHS ) estimates that America has 1,000 modern - style roundabouts .
Britain has 10,000 , Australia 15,000 and France 20,000 .
Nowadays America is adding perhaps 150 to 250 new roundabouts a year , not counting mini - ones in suburbs .
Even the Alaskan town of North Pole is building three new roundabouts , one at the corner of Santa Claus Lane and St Nicholas Drive .
The arguments for roundabouts are strong .
There are no costly traffic lights to build or maintain .
Unless something is coming round , cars need not stop , so congestion is reduced and fuel is saved .
Most important is safety .
About 45 % of all crashes in America occur at crossroads , often because of misjudged left turns .
At a roundabout , outside Britain and other countries that drive on the left , drivers can only turn right .
A 2001 study by the IIHS found that roundabouts have 80 % fewer crashes with injuries than ordinary intersections .
Other research also points to big reductions .
So roundabouts may be a small reason why America 's roads are slowly getting safer .
Last year injuries in motor - vehicle crashes were down an estimated 6 % .
Even so , drivers are often sceptical .
“ We lose far more roundabouts that could have been built , because of city councils or a trucking company , ” says Mr Walsh .
There are also plenty of doubts in North Pole , according to the Fairbanks Daily News - Miner .
After all , who wants Rudolph prancing round in circles ?

The Best Brewer In The World Does n't Have A Brewery
Struise bottles its liquid art for the global marketSANTA ROSA , Calif. , January 29 , 2008
Tens of thousands of beer reviewers around the world , many having tasted over 1000 beers , have chosen the best brewer in the world -- and that brewer is Struise of Woesten - Vleteren , Belgium .
Struise however does n't have a brewery .
And they 're not professional brewers either .
The Belgian brewing team of Carlo , Peter , Phil and Urbain , does its brewing in its spare time away from working their day jobs .
They have a relationship with a brewery in Woesten - Vleteren , Belgium -- not far from the former world champion brewers at Westvleteren Abbey -- where they bring in their own ingredients and brew on their own equipment .
The result has unequivocally been nothing short of world class .
 Not being a commercial brewery that needs to turn over product in order to stay alive means that we can wait until our beers are perfect before releasing them ,  explains Carlo .
This means their distributors in Europe , American and Japan , are patient .
And their consumers are just as patient .
It 's not uncommon to get your Struise after sitting on a waiting list at a mail order beer shop .
Selling their beer overseas is critical to Struise 's success .
Urbain explains ,
 We have found Belgium to be a very traditional and difficult market .
The majority of Belgian beer consumers drink the usual industrial stuff from big breweries .
A smaller percentage will experiment with the better Belgian ale styles and trappists .
Even there , there 's almost no room for innovation .
Struise is all about innovation .
They tapped into the online beer scene many years ago and , unlike most other European brewers , have used internet resources to experience beer from around the world , most notably from the United States and Denmark .
They 've created a unique style of beer making , harmonizing popular styles from around the world with their own pure invention .
So what 's it taste like ?
You can read the reviews at RateBeer.com but a short preview :
Their gigantic Imperial Stout , Black Albert , weighs in at a monster 13 % and hammers notes of dark chocolate and plums .
Struise Pannepot Grand Reserva Oak
Aged matured ten months in Calvados oak barrels .
Their ruby - colored Earthmonk is wine - like and tart .

An Associated Press article on tonight ’s meeting in Miramar about the new draft of the state science standards is already up on the Florida Times - Union website .
The story does not give an overall impression of attendance or how many people spoke and such .
The focus was mainly on just two people on opposite sides of the debate .
For those who have been following this adventure for the past few months , you probably thought that Polk County was the Florida poster child for anti-science sentiments .
This story , though , shows that even Polk County can be one - upped :
Last month Taylor County School Board unanimously approved a resolution saying the district is opposed to teaching evolution as a fact .
No , that is not a joke , people .
Here it is in the Taylor County school board meeting minutes of Nov. 20 .
Scroll down to page seven and you ’ll see :
Upon motion by Danny Lundy , seconded by Darrell Whiddon the Board adopted / approved the : 1 . ) Resolution regarding the new Sunshine State Standards for Science .
The adoped resolution is as follows :
Whereas , the Florida Department of Education has drafted and is now proposing new Sunshine State Standards for Science , the Taylor County School Board opposes the implementation of the new standards as currently presented .
Whereas , the new Sunshine State Standards for Science no longer present evolution as theory but as “ the fundamental concept underlying all of biology and is supported in multiple forms of scientific evidence , ” we are requesting that the State Board of Education direct the Florida Department of Education to revise / edit the new Sunshine State Standards for Science so that evolution is presented as one of several theories as to how the universe was formed .
Whereas , the Taylor County School Board recognizes the importance of providing a thorough and comprehensive Science education to all the students in Taylor County and to all students in the state of Florida , it recognizes as even more important the need to present these standards through a fair and balanced approach , an approach that does not unfairly exclude other theories as to the creation of the universe .
NOW THEREFORE , BE IT RESOLVED by the Taylor County School Board of Taylor County , Perry , Florida , that the Board urges the State Board of Education to direct the Florida Department of Education to revise the new Sunshine State Standards for Science such that evolution is not presented as fact , but as one of several theories .
So , Taylor County joins our long list of Florida school boards who need you to educate them on what exactly science is and is n’t .
Click here for our list and the school board contact information .
As crazy as the Taylor County school board is , we must not forget that it ’s the state board of education that needs our direct attention .
One state board member , Donna Callaway , apparently is not backing off of her intention to vote against the standards .
Callaway says she does n’t “ expect everyone to agree with me or like me .
You have to make tough decisions . ” …
A long time attendee of First Baptist Tallahassee , Callaway has already indicated she will vote against the standards .
If you think Taylor County school board members and Ms. Callaway are wrong on this issue , as Florida Citizens for Science does , then do n’t just sit around waiting to see what happens .
Do something !
Write , call , e-mail … make your voice heard !
Use information from our county list and combine it with our “ All I Want … is a Good Science Education ” call to action project .
Do n’t let Florida be the laughingstock of the country … and world .
Not another warning about war with Iran !
Well , suck it up .
President George W. Bush ’s speech Tuesday makes clear his plan to attack Iran , and how the intelligence , as was the case before the attack on Iraq , is being “ fixed around the policy . ”
It ’s not about putative Iranian “ weapons of mass destruction ”  not even ostensibly .
It is about the requirement for a scapegoat for U.S. reverses in Iraq , and the felt need to create a casus belli by provoking Iran in such a way as to “ justify ” armed retaliation  perhaps extending to an attempt to destroy its nuclear - related facilities .
Bush ’s Aug. 28 speech to the American Legion came five years after a very similar presentation by Vice President Dick Cheney .
Addressing the Veterans of Foreign Wars on Aug. 26 , 2002 , Cheney set the meretricious terms of reference for war on Iraq .
Sitting on the same stage that evening was former CENTCOM commander Marine Gen. Anthony Zinni , who was being honored at the VFW convention .
Zinni later said he was shocked to hear a depiction of intelligence ( Iraq has WMD and is amassing them to use against us ) that did not square with what he knew .
Although Zinni had retired two years before , his role as consultant had enabled him to stay up to date on key intelligence findings .
“ There was no solid proof that Saddam had WMD … I heard a case being made to go to war , ” Zinni told Meet the Press three and a half years later .
( Zinni is a straight shooter with considerable courage , and so the question lingers : why did he not go public ?
It is all too familiar a conundrum at senior levels and , almost always , the result comes out badly .
It is a safe bet he regrets letting himself be guided by a misguided professional courtesy and / or slavish adherence to classification restrictions , when he might have prevented our country from starting the kind of war of aggression branded at Nuremberg as the “ supreme international crime . ” )
Zinni was not the only one taken aback by Cheney ’s words .
Then - CIA Director George Tenet says Cheney ’s speech took him completely by surprise .
In his memoir , Tenet wrote , “ I had the impression that the president was n’t any more aware than we were of what his number - two was going to say to the VFW until he said it . ”
Yet , it could have been anticipated .
Just five weeks before , Tenet himself had told his British counterpart that the president had decided to make war on Iraq for regime change and that “ the intelligence and facts were being fixed around the policy . ”
When Bush ’s senior advisers came back to town after Labor Day , 2002 , the next five weeks were devoted to selling the war , a major “ new product ” of the kind that , as then - White House chief of staff Andy Card explained , no one would introduce in the month of August .
After assuring themselves that Tenet was a reliable salesman , Cheney and then - Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld allowed him to play a supporting role in advertising bogus yellowcake uranium from Niger , aluminum tubes for uranium enrichment , and mobile trailers for manufacturing biological warfare agents , in order to scare Congress into voting for war .
It did on Oct. 10 and 11 , 2002 .
Well , this week , aware or not , it was the president himself who mouthed the “ new product ”  war with Iran  and , in the process , made clear how “ fixed ” intelligence is being arrayed to “ justify ” it .
The case is too clever by half , but the Bush / Cheney team is clearly hoping the product will sell .
Iran ‘s Nuclear Plans
It has been like waiting for Godot … the endless wait for the latest National Intelligence Estimate on Iran ’s nuclear plans .
That NIE turns out to be the quintessential dog that did n’t bark .
The most recent published NIE on the subject was issued two - and - a - half years ago and concluded that Iran could not have a nuclear weapon until “ early - to mid-next decade . ”
That estimate followed a string of NIEs dating back to 1995 , which predicted , with embarrassing consistency , that Iran was “ within five years ” of having a nuclear weapon .
The most recent NIE , published in early 2005 , extended the timeline and provided still more margin for error .
Basically , the timeline was moved 10 years out to 2015 , but a fit of caution yielded the words “ early - to - mid next decade . ”
On Feb. 27 , 2007 , at his confirmation hearings to be Director of National Intelligence , Michael McConnell repeated that formulation verbatim .
A “ final ” draft of the follow - up NIE mentioned above had been completed in February 2007 , and McConnell no doubt was briefed on its findings prior to his testimony .
The fact that this draft has been sent back for revision every other month since February speaks volumes .
Judging from McConnell ’s testimony based on the NIE draft of February , its judgments are probably not alarmist enough for Vice President Dick Cheney .
( Shades of Iraq . )
It is also a safe bet that last December the newly confirmed defense secretary , Robert Gates , was taken to the woodshed by the avuncular Cheney , when Gates suggested to Congress that Iran ’s motivation in seeking a nuclear weapon would be deterrence :
“ While they [ the Iranians ] are certainly pressing , in my opinion , for a nuclear capability , I think they would see it in the first instance as a deterrent .
They are surrounded by powers with nuclear weapons 
Pakistan to the east , the Russians to the north , the Israelis to the west , and us in the Persian Gulf . ”
Apparently , the newly minted secretary of defense had n’t gotten Cheney ’s memo .
Unwelcome News ( to the White House )
There they go again  those bureaucrats at the International Atomic Energy Agency .
On Aug. 28 , the very day Bush was playing up the dangers from Iran , the IAEA released a note of understanding between the IAEA and Iran on the key issue of inspection .
The IAEA declared :
“ The agency has been able to verify the non-diversion of the declared nuclear materials at the enrichment facilities in Iran and has therefore concluded that it remains in peaceful use . ”
The IAEA deputy director announced that the plan just agreed to by the IAEA and Iran will enable closure by December on the nuclear issues that the IAEA began investigating in 2003 .
Other IAEA officials now express confidence that they will be able to detect any military diversion or any uranium enrichment above a low grade , as long as the Iran - IAEA safeguard agreement remains intact .
Shades of the preliminary findings of the very intrusive U.N. inspections conducted in Iraq in early 2003 before the U.S. warned the U.N. in mid-March to withdraw its inspectors , lest they be shocked - and - awed .
Vice President Cheney can claim , as he did three days before the attack on Iraq , that the IAEA is simply “ wrong . ”
But Cheney ’s credibility has sunk to prehistoric levels ; witness the fact that the president himself was enlisted to address the Iranian nuclear threat this time around .
And he did it with new words .
President ’s New Formulation
Did you notice the care that President Bush took to read the exact words of the new formulation on Iran ’s nuclear intentions ?
Not only did he pronounce “ nuclear ” correctly , he faithfully articulated an altered formula ( see below ) .
The wording suggests to me that the White House has concluded that the “ nuclear threat ” from Iran is “ a dog that wo n’t hunt , ” as Lyndon Johnson might have put it .
The latest news from the IAEA is , for the White House , an extra hurdle .
And there is always the possibility that some patriotic truth - teller will make available to the press the judgments of the latest draft NIE on Iran ’s nuclear capability .
Or a new Gen .
Zinni - type figure might decide to speak out from the Pentagon to head off another unnecessary war .
It is just too much of a stretch to suggest that Iran could be a nuclear threat to the United States within the next 17 months , and that ’s all the time Bush and Cheney have got to honor their open pledge to Israel to eliminate Iran ’s nuclear potential .
Besides , some American Jewish groups , increasingly concerned over a backlash if young Americans are seen to have been asked to fight and die to eliminate perceived threats to Israel ( but not to the U.S. ) , have been urging the White House to back off the nuclear - threat rationale for war on Iran .
This is how the president put it on Aug. 28 :
“ Iran ’s active pursuit of technology that could lead to nuclear weapons threatens to put a region already known for instability and violence under the shadow of a nuclear holocaust . ”
Press reporting has focused on the rhetorical flourish “ under the shadow of a nuclear holocaust . ”
But , in my view , it is the earlier part of the sentence that is most significant .
It is quite a different formulation from earlier Bush rhetoric charging categorically that Iran is “ pursuing nuclear weapons , ” including this ( erroneous ) comment at a joint press conference with Afghan President Hamid Karzai in early August :
“ This [ Iran ] is a government that has proclaimed its desire to build a nuclear weapon . ”
The ( Very ) Bad News
Bush and Cheney have clearly decided to use alleged Iranian interference in Iraq as the preferred casus belli .
And the charges , whether they have merit or not , have become much more bellicose .
Thus , Bush on Aug. 28 :
“ Iran ’s leaders … cannot escape responsibility for aiding attacks against coalition forces …
The Iranian regime must halt these actions .
And until it does , I will take actions necessary to protect our troops .
I have authorized our military commanders in Iraq to confront Tehran ’s murderous activities . ”
How convenient : two birds with one stone .
Someone to blame for our losses in Iraq , and “ justification ” to confront the ostensible source of the problem .
Vice President Cheney has reportedly been pushing for military retaliation against Iran if the U.S. finds hard evidence of Iranian complicity in supporting the “ insurgents ” in Iraq .
Again , President Bush on Aug. 28 :
“ Recently , coalition forces seized 240 - millimeter rockets that had been manufactured in Iran this year and that had been provided to Iraqi extremist groups by Iranian agents .
The attacks on our bases and our troops by Iranian - supplied munitions have increased in the last few months … ” QED
Recent U.S. actions , like arresting Iranian officials in Iraq  eight were abruptly kidnapped and held briefly in Baghdad on Aug. 28 , the day Bush addressed the American Legion  suggest an intention to provoke Iran into some kind of action that would justify “ coalition ” retaliation .
The evolving rhetoric suggests that the most likely targets at this point would be training facilities inside Iran  some 20 targets that are within range of U.S. cruise missiles already in place .
Iranian retaliation would be inevitable , and escalation likely .
It strikes me as shamelessly ironic that the likes of our current ambassador at the U.N. , Zalmay Khalilizad , one of the architects of U.S. policy toward the area , is now warning publicly that the current upheaval in the Middle East could bring another world war .
Bottom Line
In my view , air strikes on Iran are inevitable , unless grassroots America can arrange a backbone transplant for Congress .
The House needs to begin impeachment proceedings without delay .
These , in turn , could possibly give our senior military leaders second thoughts about unleashing the dogs of wider war .
Rabies shots recommended : for this time those dogs can , and will , come back and bite us .
Yes , some of us have been saying that for many months .
The deterioration of the U.S. position in Iraq ; the perceived need for a scapegoat ; the continuing deference given to perceived Israeli security concerns ; and the fact that time is running out for the Bush / Cheney administration to end Iran ’s nuclear program together make a volatile mix .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The Supreme Court refused Tuesday to hear an appeal from poet Amiri Baraka , whose controversial poem about the September 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks led to the elimination of an honorary post he held as New Jersey 's poet laureate .
The justices declined without comment to intervene in Baraka 's lawsuit against current and former state officials who he says retaliated against him for his public reading of " Somebody Blew Up America . "
At issue was whether state officials had " legislative immunity " from such suits , even when they targeted an individual for special treatment , as Baraka alleges .
Baraka , a self - described " poet icon and revolutionary political activist " was named poet laureate in 2002 by then - Gov. James McGreevey , on the recommendation of the state 's Council for the Arts .
The post was designed to encourage poetry by having the honoree stage at least two public readings a year .
The honorarium paid $ 10,000 a year for a two - year term .
Two months after his appointment , Baraka -- a longtime resident of New Jersey -- read the poem in question before a local arts festival .
Among the poem 's lines :
" Who knew the World Trade Center was gonna get bombed
" Who told 4000 Israeli workers at the Twin Towers
" To stay home that day
" Why did Sharon stay away ? "
State officials were outraged , but under the law , McGreevey could not fire the poet from his appointed post .
Baraka refused the governor 's request to resign , saying his work was neither anti-Semitic nor racist .
McGreevey then supported eliminating the poet laureate position , which the Legislature did in July 2003 .
State officials denied the poet 's claims that they " commenced a concerted campaign " to target Baraka , who turned 73 last week .
Much of the case turned on specific things McGreevey and other officials may or may not have done .
In an open letter after the vote , Baraka called it a " confirmation of the ignorance , corruption , racism , and criminal disregard for the U.S. Constitution . "
Baraka 's
Web site refers to the case , saying , " The recital of the poem ' that mattered ' engaged the poet warrior in a battle royal with the very governor of New Jersey and with a legion of detractors demanding his resignation as the state 's poet laureate because of " Somebody Blew Up America 's " provocatively poetic inquiry ( in a few lines of the poem ) about who knew beforehand about the New York City World Trade Center bombings in 2001 . "
In its 2 - 1 ruling in March , the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals concluded , " Baraka , like any person , was free to speak his views .
But he had no protected legal interest in the maintenance of the position of poet laureate of New Jersey . "
The judges also said , " Baraka 's vague references to the conduct of the unknown defendants [ state officials ] are insufficient to constitute allegations " made by him that he was personally targeted for reprisal .
The case is Baraka v. McGreevey ( 07-79 ) .
In another decision announced Tuesday , the Supreme Court refused to intervene in the pending transfer of an alleged terrorist held by the U.S. military , despite his fears of being tortured if sent back to his home country of Algeria .
Ahmed Belbacha has been incarcerated at the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , for five years , and has been fighting in federal courts to stay there .
He has said that because of his Islamist beliefs , he would be punished by the Algerian government if he returns .
The ruling from the high court means the military may proceed with its repatriation efforts , but there is no word when any transfer would take place .

Hashing in Smalltalk 25 February , 2008
Andrés Valloud has just published “ Hashing in Smalltalk : Theory and Practice ” on Lulu .
He describes the book as providing “ a strong foundation for hashing , hash functions , and their application in the context of software development .
The first part develops hashing and hash functions from first principles .
The behavior characteristics required of hash functions are examined in detail .
A thorough description of how hash functions are constructed follows , complete with a rich survey of existing hash functions .
But often times existing hash functions are inappropriate for the task at hand .
To address this problem , the second part shows how to build novel hash functions that are both efficient and of very high quality for many of the types of data that occur in practice . ”
The book compares algorithms and implementations of hashing across the main Smalltalks ( Squeak , Dolphin , Visual Works and VisualAge ) , as well as other languages including C , C++ , C# , Java , OCaml and ML .
It ’s available for $ 40/€32.20 /£22.04 .
Andrés has also posted a great illustration of the dangers of the use of inappropriate hashing functions .

On the contrary , I feel that it ’s a natural part of any project - based work .
Acknowledging this eventuality will allow you to be prepared when it finally rears it ’s ugly code - retrofitting , design - wrecking head .
Anticipating unforeseen changes in your plans forces you to be more adaptable , and promotes the development of a solution that ’s flexible and malleable to your client ’s ever - changing needs .
2. Commit enough time to requirements - gathering .
Easy enough , fairly common sense , but we ’re all guilty of rushing the planning phase of projects .
Maybe it ’s because of time and budgetary constraints , or our eagerness to show our clients tangible results , or the assurance we get that the project ’s in the bag once we start it ( and wo n’t be given to competition ) .
Skimping on this step can lead to agony at the end , and can take the form of unanticipated feature requirements because of our failure to establish the client ’s actual needs .
Take time to survey the people involved , observe and shadow employees to see how they might use the system you ’re developing , and get an accurate estimation of the technical expertise the organization has .
An ounce of prevention is worth a few thousand lines of code revision .
3 . Giving a hand might cost you your arm .
If you constantly give in to changes , you might be get more of them in the future .
Try to set boundaries of what is and is n’t appropriate to revise , this not only prevents unneeded requests for changes , but gives the project strict quality - control guidelines .
When you do decide to comply to un -scoped demands , make sure that you indicate that you ’re doing something out - of - scope , and that this can cause delays and additional financial requirements .
This may make them re-consider the value of the feature requested , or at least give you an extension in time and budget .
4 . Be the devil ’s advocate when changes are requested .
You were hired and assigned to the project because of your knowledge and expertise in the solution required .
If a client asks for a Flash - based navigation menu , it is your expert obligation to convince them that the CSS - based menu you developed is a much better solution .
Do n’t be afraid to contradict unwise feature requests ; providing well - formed reasons will assure them that you know your “ shizznit ” , and they may actually allow you to proceed as originally planned .
5 . Be task - oriented , not vision - oriented .
Be clear on what it is , exactly , you ’re developing for them .
Do n’t promise a grand , exciting , but ambiguous / ambitious end result .
Instead of giving broad generalizations such as “ I ’ll be developing a search engine optimized website ” , try to outline the deliverables that you will provide , such as : “ I ’ll be using image replacement techniques for sub - headings , creating and implementing a Sitemap.xml , submitting the site to major search engines , and optimizing page titles with relevant keywords ” .
This makes the project less ambiguous and prevents additional tasks , such as developing a link - exchange program to increase page rank results , which is clearly not part of your duties .
6 . Shed the “ Customer is Always Right ” mentality .
You , more often than not , are a more qualified judge of how things should be developed .
You ’re not working to get a big tip at the end .
You ’re working ( most probably ) on a flat rate fee or an agreed - upon compensation .
All you have to worry about is your reputation and producing an excellent solution .
The employer can hate everything about you , but if you ’ve provided an amazing profit - generating product , you ’ll get hired back to do more .
In the end , it ’s more about profits and deliverables and less about how your employer loves your “ reasonable personality ” ( because they love nothing more than making a bundle of cash or reducing their overhead due to the solution you developed ) .
So do n’t give in to unwarranted requests and unreasonable timelines simply because you want to be on your employer ’s good side .
Do n’t feel pressured to do something that is n’t in the job description or something you feel will lead to a less desirable end product .
7. Research before committing .
Assuage the temptation to immediately accommodate a change in project scope , no matter how seemingly simple .
If you think the budget and timeline can handle a modification in plans , research thoroughly on what the change actually entails before committing .
For example , in a CMS development project I was involved in , I was asked if it was possible to migrate the system from our servers , to the client’s .
This was n’t part of the project scope , as the original plan was to also provide hosting for the system .
I agreed to it thinking that a database export / import and file migration would take an hour ’s work at most .
I failed to account for the fact that our server set - up ( being IIS 6.0 / Windows and the client ’s being Apache / Linux ) and server settings were different .
Suffice it to say that it took longer than anticipated and the task is still unfinished .
8. Realize that feature creep is a two - way street .
Clients and employers are n’t ( purely ) evil .
They do n’t intend to make our jobs more difficult .
Oftentimes it ’s our desire to please , to prove our worth , and our perfectionist mentality that can be , in part if not equally , to blame .
If feature creep happens , it ’s only because we allow it to .
I hope this article was able to impart some tips on how to manage feature creep .
The suggestions here are based on my own mistakes with regards to allowing scope creep to affect my projects .
I hope that by reading this , you have better luck in alleviating the impact that features out - of - scope can have on your timelines and budgets .
I ’d like to ask : should feature creep be accepted as part of any project , or should it be prevented flat out ?
Are these tips ideal but unrealistic , and in what sense ?
Share your thoughts !
Many thanks to people who shared suggestions in the previous post on keyboard navigation .
I 'm looking forward to trying them out on Cozi 's site .
Continuing a discussion of keyboard navigation , it 's worth asking whether the Tab navigation model itself is a problem that needs fixing .
The Tab model works well in the small dialogs for which it was designed , but has completely failed to scale up to navigating complex web sites .
Consider two user interfaces , one old and one contemporary :
Windows 95 dialog with approximately 10 focusable controls
Default MSN.com home page with approximately 200 focusable controls
Note that the relative scale of these two screens has been preserved .
Both spatially and logically , the user has a much , much larger area to move around .
Modern operating system UIs provide two standard mechanisms for moving the focus around a window using the keyboard : a linear Tab model , and explicit keyboard shortcuts ( e.g. , Alt keys ) .
The Tab model is the most commonly used for moving between fields in a UI .
It evolved from a UI intended for navigating through the modest collection of input fields that could fit on small character - based display ( with , for example , 24 rows of 80 characters ) , and represented an evolution in turn from Tab keys on typewriters .
The Tab model has n't evolved much since the character - based days .
A single control in the active window has the keyboard focus .
This control indicates its active state in one of several ways : button - like controls and list boxes show a dotted marquis or other highlighting effect , while text controls show an insertion point or selection .
Pressing the Tab key moves the keyboard focus through the focusable ( interactive ) controls on the page in a linear order defined at design time by the programmer .
Pressing Shift + Tab moves the focus through that order in reverse .
That the Tab model was adequate for simple dialogs like the one above is evidenced by the model 's survival over decades of change in UIs .
To my mind this model has completely broken down , however , in its application to typical web pages .
The first issue is one of scale : the page above has twenty times the number of focusable controls as the simple dialog .
A user trying to use the keyboard to reach a link in the middle of the page might have to press the Tab key 125 times to reach it .
( Or , if they were exceptionally efficient , they could tab around the other direction and only have to press Shift + Tab 75 times . )
The second issue is that the page has a much more complex two - dimensional columnar layout that the dialog , but that layout cannot be captured in the one - dimensional tab order .
To the user , the behavior of the Tab key is therefore quite unpredictable .
The other standard keyboard navigation technique — explicit keyboard shortcuts — are also inadequate for complex user interfaces .
Microsoft Windows allows users to move the focus directly to a control on the dialog by pressing a keyboard shortcut , generally the Alt key plus a single letter in the control ’s label .
( OS / X does this too , although I find it less discoverable and generally weaker in execution . )
This system is workable for dialogs with a small number of controls and a reasonable distribution of letter frequencies in control labels , but is obviously unable to scale well beyond a handful of controls .
( I remember once running out of available letters in a large dialog and having to resort to using the label 's trailing colon as the shortcut character . )
The leading web browsers have adopted these legacy keyboard navigation techniques despite their inadequacy to scale up to modern web - based UIs .
Mozilla Firefox , for its part , does offer one more keyboard navigation technique : Emacs - style incremental searching .
This lets the user move the focus to a specific link by typing the apostrophe ( ' ) , or to specific text by typing a slash ( / ) , then typing the initial text of the desired target .
This is quite fast , although I personally find this method less than satisfying .
I find it less brain - taxing to just point at the thing I want instead of having to read it and type it .
I also have trouble keeping straight the three different keys for the three slightly different kinds of search Firefox offers for searching within a single page .
In practice this UI does n't work well for long scrolling pages : you need to be able to see the thing you want .
Once you start typing and move the focus somewhere , you can't easily move the focus to an adjacent element without starting over or falling back to tabbing .
The incremental search mechanism can't target controls other than textual links , and then only if the link text is unique .
A substantial number of links are images , and do n't even have visible text .
And finally , because the keyboard shortcuts are unmodified by a key like Ctrl , they do n't work if the keyboard focus is already in a text box .
Interestingly , a much better user interface for navigating screens with lots of elements is already ubiquitous — but not on PCs .
It 's found on mobile phone web browsers , which of necessity do a good job at keyboard navigation .
They support two - dimensional directional navigation by using Left , Right , Up and Down arrow keys ( or a joystick ) to move to the " nearest " element in the corresponding direction .
For example , if you press the Right key , heuristics determine whether there 's an element you might be trying to reach towards the right , and if there are multiple elements , which element you probably want .
Significantly , these heuristics respect the rendered visual representation of the page , not the structure of the document 's object model or the original location of elements at design time .
This is necessary to account for the fact that the user may be viewing the page at a different width than the designer used , with different fonts , at different sizes , etc.
Directional navigation UIs also tightly connect keyboard focus and scroll position , allowing someone to continually press the Up and Down keys to move through focusable controls and to page over large blocks of text .
The first time I saw a directional navigation UI was actually in the original WebTV browser , later acquired by Microsoft and rebranded as MSN TV .
I was inspired by that UI to push for inclusion of directional navigation support in Windows Presenation Foundation ( " Avalon " ) , and was happy to hear that that work eventually saw the light of day in the .NET 3.0 release .
( I have n't played with the final result myself , but my understanding is that you can turn it on or off for a page via its DirectionalNavigation property .
I 'm not sure if that feature made it into Silverlight . )
Directional navigation works so well on mobile devices , I 'm hoping it will get built into a browser someday .
To avoid conflict with the existing semantics of arrow keys , the final UI could optionally support a keyboard modifier like Ctrl .
( So that , e.g. , Ctrl + Left means move the focus to the " nearest " control to the left ) .
Microsoft has already filed for a patent on the very elegant heuristics in the WPF DirectionalNavigation feature , so it would make a natural addition to a future version of Internet Explorer .
I 'd love to see a similar approach adopted by Firefox , or at least developed as a Firefox add - on .
Dutch RFID Transit Card Hacked
The Dutch RFID public transit card , which has already cost the government $ 2B — no , that ’s not a typo — has been hacked even before it has been deployed :
The first reported attack was designed by two students at the University of Amsterdam , Pieter Siekerman and Maurits van der Schee .
They analyzed the single - use ticket and showed its vulnerabilities in a report .
They also showed how a used single - use card could be given eternal life by resetting it to its original “ unused ” state .
The next attack was on the Mifare Classic chip , used on the normal ticket .
Two German hackers , Karsten Nohl and Henryk Plotz , were able to remove the coating on the Mifare chip and photograph the internal circuitry .
By studying the circuitry , they were able to deduce the secret cryptographic algorithm used by the chip .
While this alone does not break the chip , it certainly gives future hackers a stepping stone on which to stand .
On Jan. 8 , 2008 , they released a statement abut their work .
Most of the links are in Dutch ; there is n’t a whole lot of English - language press about this .
But the Dutch Parliament recently invited the students to give testimony ; they ’re more than a little bit interested how $ 2B could be wasted .
My guess is the system was designed by people who do n’t understand security , and therefore thought it was easy .

Philippe Marschall pointed me to the Arc Challenge :
Write a program that causes the url said ( e.g. http://localhost:port/said ) to produce a page with an input field and a submit button .
When the submit button is pressed , that should produce a second page with a single link saying " click here . "
When that is clicked it should lead to a third page that says " you said : ... " where ... is whatever the user typed in the original input field .
The third page must only show what the user actually typed .
I.e. the value entered in the input field must not be passed in the url , or it would be possible to change the behavior of the final page by editing the url .
The solution in Arc consists of 23 parse tree nodes :
( defop said req ( aform [ w / link ( pr " you said : " ( arg _ " foo " ) ) ( pr " click here " ) ] ( input " foo " ) ( submit ) ) )
My solution in Seaside only requires 14 parse tree nodes :
| something |
something := self request : ' Say something ' .
self inform : ' Click here ' .
self inform : something
The running application can be tested below :
Say something
Obviously people will argue that I did n’t exactly play with the rules .
In the second step I do n’t use a link , but a submit button .
You are right .
Unfortunately Seaside does n’t provide a ready - made page that uses a link to proceed .
However , and in my opinion this is far more important , the data is not passed through hidden post fields or through the URL .
There is no way to fake the output of the last step .
Another important point is readability .
Read the Smalltalk code from top to bottom .
I reads like english prosa and it simply does what it says .
Without bells and whistles .
And – does your framework support the back button as well ?
Does it also prevent you from XSS attacks ?
HOUSTON ( Reuters ) - Europe finally got a place of its own in space when astronauts attached the European laboratory Columbus to the International Space Station on Monday .
Slideshow ( 23 images )
Using a robot arm , they lifted the gleaming 10 - tonne cylinder from space shuttle Atlantis and hooked it to the station to complete Columbus ’ journey and end a long wait for European space officials .
“ Houston , Munich , the European Columbus laboratory module is now part of the ISS , ” French astronaut Leopold Eyharts radioed to Earth .
Columbus has been in the works for two decades and was supposed to have been delivered in 2002 .
But it was delayed by events including the destruction of shuttle Columbia in 2003 , which grounded the space shuttle fleet for 2 - 1 / 2 years .
“ Today has been a truly momentous step and a historic day for Europe , ” European Space Agency space station manager Alan Thirkettle said in a briefing at NASA ’s Johnson Space Centre .
“ You might imagine we ’re rather happy and overjoyed , ” he said .
“ There were whoops and cheers . ”
The $ 1.9 billion ( 973 million pound ) Columbus lab , 23 feet long and nearly 15 feet in diameter , is the heart of a $ 5 billion investment in the space station program by 10 European countries .
It is lined with refrigerator - sized racks to be used for wide - ranging space research .
Even at the end , nothing came easily for Columbus , which was launched aboard Atlantis on Thursday .
DELAYED SPACEWALK
NASA had to postpone installation for a day when German astronaut Hans Schlegel , scheduled to take part in an accompanying spacewalk , fell ill with a still - undisclosed ailment .
Space rookie Stan Love filled in and , working with lead spacewalker Rex Walheim , prepared Columbus for its move from the shuttle .
Love ’s lack of training and a struggle to attach a clasp for the robot arm caused the spacewalk to drag on almost eight hours , an hour and a half longer than planned .
The European Space Agency has counted on the successful deployment of Columbus and the March 8 launch of a cargo ship to proceed with programs that will include involvement in NASA ’s plan to send humans to the moon again .
“ This will be the first time Europe will have a permanent base in space , ” said Eyharts , who launched aboard Atlantis and then transferred to the station crew to remain in orbit and set up the new lab .
“ We hope that this first participation will help in reinforcing our technical expertise and our experience of operations to be able to go further and participate with the future of space exploration , ” Eyharts said recently .
Japan is still waiting for NASA to launch its space station contribution -- a three - part laboratory named Kibo .
The U.S. space agency plans to begin installing the Japanese lab during its next shuttle mission in March .
NASA has 11 more construction and resupply flights remaining before the $ 100 billion station is complete and the space shuttles are retired in 2010 .
How Lucky We Are To Live In A World With So Many Moral Men
Jeffrey Goldberg , " Should the U.S. Invade Iraq ? " , October , 2002 :
The administration is planning today to launch what many people would undoubtedly call a short - sighted and inexcusable act of aggression .
In five years , however , I believe that the coming invasion of Iraq will be remembered as an act of profound morality .
Osama bin Laden , " Declaration of War against the Americans Occupying the Land of the Two Holy Places , " August , 1996 :
Terrorizing you , while you are carrying arms in our land , is a legitimate right and a moral obligation .
AND : Just before the invasion of Iraq , the right - wing American Catholic philosopher Michael Novak gave a speech about its necessity at the Vatican .
The speech 's subtitle was " A Moral Obligation . "
“ Despite all the talk you may hear today about the threat to newspapers from the Internet and new technologies , today ’s order actually deals with something quite old - fashioned , ” Mr. Copps said .
“ Powerful companies are using political muscle to sneak through rule changes that let them profit at the expense of the public interest . ”
And Robert M. McDowell , a Republican commissioner , was sharply critical of the cable restrictions .
“ The cap is out of date , is bad public policy and is not needed in today ’s public market , ” he said .
He called the cable rule “ archaic industrial policy ” that would surely be struck down by an appeals court , as an earlier rule was six years ago .
Although Mr. Martin appears to have won a high - stakes battle within the commission over some of the most important proposals of his tenure , he has expended significant political capital and made political enemies of powerful industry groups and influential lawmakers .
For opposite reasons , both proposals approved on Tuesday have been criticized by industry .
The Newspaper Association of America has attacked the proposal for being too modest , and said that Mr. Martin did not go far enough .
“ Today ’s vote is only a baby step in the actions needed to maintain the vitality of local news , in print and over - the - air , in all communities across the nation , ” the president of the Newspaper Association , John F. Sturm , said .
“ Eliminating the cross - ownership ban completely would enhance localism by enabling broadcasters to increase local news and would not distract from the diversity of viewpoints available to local audiences . ”
The cable television industry has said it has repeatedly been an unfair target of Mr. Martin , and that his efforts to regulate the industry are at odds with the broader policies of the Bush administration to remove or lessen regulations .
Over the last year , the commission has approved a series of proposals over the objections of the cable television industry , including one last December to force municipalities to accelerate the local approval process for the telephone companies to offer video services in new markets .
Another one last October struck down thousands of contracts that gave individual cable companies exclusive rights to provide service to an apartment building .
As one of many ways to reach people with our content we have decided to do an experiment and make one of our most popular television series available through BitTorrent .
This technology makes it possible for us to make our content available in a very high quality without having to invest in large server farms and expensive bandwidth .
The very popular series called « Nordkalotten 365 » has been aired on traditional TV in Norway .
Over 900 000 of Norway ’s 4,6 million watched the show in average , and the marketshare was close to 50 % !
« Nordkalotten 365 » is now made available for download .
In this series the experienced hiker Lars Monsen has traveled alone through the north of Scandinavia for one year .
The first episode is already published and the next episodes will be made available as they are encoded .
The files are MPEG4 H.264 , 1024×576 25 fps , 3 Mbit /s. No DRM .
So far the experiment has been a huge success .
After one day roughly 8000 people have downloaded the torrent file .
Because of the limited statistics reporting from the Amazon S3 tracker we are using we do n’t have exact numbers from the tracker itself .
Taking into account that Norway is a small country with only 4,5 million people this number is above expectations .
The file has been out there for one day , and at this point only the first episode of the series is available .
The bittorrent technology seems to work especially well for completely legal and high quality downloads .
People happily seed the file and the download speeds achieved are reported to several megabits / s .
The whole 600 MB file downloading in minutes or even seconds for the people with fast connections .
The files can be downloaded with the use of any bittorrent client , but the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation are promoting the free and open source Miro player as the most user friendly and easy way to get hold of the television series .
The reactions from the audience have been extremely positive .
More than a hundred comments on the article announcing the experiment ( Norwegian ) express solid gratitude and people that are impressed by the move .
The Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation will keep on with experiments like these and try to make more content available through this technology in addition to the more traditional channels of streaming , podcasts and DVD sales .

SAN FRANCISCO - U.S. veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are planning to descend on Washington from Mar. 13 - 16 to testify about war crimes they committed or personally witnessed in those countries .
" The war in Iraq is not covered to its potential because of how dangerous it is for reporters to cover it , " said Liam Madden , a former Marine and member of the group Iraq Veterans Against the War .
" That 's left a lot of misconceptions in the minds of the American public about what the true nature of military occupation looks like . "
Iraq Veterans Against the War argues that well - publicised incidents of U.S. brutality like the Abu Ghraib prison scandal and the massacre of an entire family of Iraqis in the town of Haditha are not the isolated incidents perpetrated by " a few bad apples " , as many politicians and military leaders have claimed .
They are part of a pattern , the group says , of " an increasingly bloody occupation " .
" The problem that we face in Iraq is that policymakers in leadership have set a precedent of lawlessness where we do n't abide by the rule of law , we do n't respect international treaties , so when that atmosphere exists it lends itself to criminal activity , " argues former U.S. Army Sergeant Logan Laituri , who served a tour in Iraq from 2004 to 2005 before being discharged as a conscientious objector .
Laituri told IPS that precedent of lawlessness makes itself felt in the rules of engagement handed down by commanders to soldiers on the front lines .
When he was stationed in Samarra , for example , he said one of his fellow soldiers shot an unarmed man while he walked down the street .
" The problem is that that soldier was not committing a crime as you might call it because the rules of engagement were very clear that no one was supposed to be walking down the street , " he said .
" But I have a problem with that .
You can't tell a family to leave everything they know so you can bomb the shit out of their house or their city .
So while he definitely has protection under the law , I do n't think that legitimates that type of violence . "
Iraq Veterans Against the War is calling the gathering " Winter Soldier , " after a quote from the U.S. revolutionary Thomas Paine , who wrote in 1776 : " These are the times that try men 's souls .
The summer soldier and sunshine patriot will , in this crisis , shrink from the service of his country ; but he that stands it now , deserves the love and thanks of man and woman . "
Organisers say video and photographic evidence will also be presented , and the testimony and panels will be broadcast live on Satellite TV and streaming video on ivaw.org .
Winter Soldier is modeled on a similar event held by Vietnam Veterans 37 years ago .
In 1971 , over 100 members of Vietnam Veterans Against the War gathered in Detroit to share their stories with fellow citizens .
Atrocities like the My Lai massacre had ignited popular opposition to the war , but political and military leaders insisted that such crimes were isolated exceptions .
" Initially even the My Lai massacre was denied , " notes Gerald Nicosia , whose book " Home to War " provides the most exhaustive history of the Vietnam veterans ' movement .

" The U.S. military has traditionally denied these accusations based on the fact that ' this is a crazy soldier ' or ' this is a malcontent ' -- that you can't trust this person .
And that is the reason that Vietnam Veterans Against the War did this unified presentation in Detriot in 1971 . "
" They brought together their bona fides and wore their medals and showed it was more than one or two or three malcontents .
It was medal - winning , honored soldiers -- veterans in a group verifying what each other said to try to convince people that these charges cannot be denied .
That people are doing these things as a matter of policy . "
Nicosia says the 1971 Winter Soldier was roundly ignored by the mainstream media , but that it made an indelible imprint on those who were there .
Among those in attendance was 27 - year - old Navy Lieutenant John Kerry , who had served on a Swift Boat in Vietnam .
Three months after the hearings , Nicosia notes , Kerry took his case to Congress and spoke before a jammed Senate Foreign Relations Committee .
Television cameras lined the walls , and veterans packed the seats .
" Many very highly decorated veterans testified to war crimes committed in Southeast Asia , " Kerry told the committee , describing the events of the Winter Soldier gathering .
" It is impossible to describe to you exactly what did happen in Detroit -- the emotions in the room , and the feelings of the men who were reliving their experiences in Vietnam .
They relived the absolute horror of what this country , in a sense , made them do . "
In one of the most famous antiwar speeches of the era , Kerry concluded : " Someone has to die so that President Nixon wo n't be -- and these are his words -- ' the first president to lose a war ' .
We are asking Americans to think about that , because how do you ask a man to be the last man to die in Vietnam ?
How do you ask a man to be the last man to die for a mistake ? "
Nicosia says U.S. citizens and veterans find themselves in a similar situation today .
" The majority of the American people are very dissatisfied with the Iraq war now and would be happy to get out of it .
But Americans are bred deep into their psyches to think of America as a good country and , I think , much harder than just the hurdle of getting troops out of Iraq is to get Americans to realise the terrible things we do in the name of the United States . "
Aaron Glantz has reported extensively from Iraq and on the treatment of U.S. soldiers when they return home .
He is editor of the website www.warcomeshome.org and will be co-hosting Pacifica Radio's live broadcast of the Winter Soldier hearings from Mar. 14 - 16 .

Natural gas distributed throughout the Marcellus black shale in northern Appalachia could conservatively boost proven U.S. reserves by trillions of cubic feet if gas production companies employ horizontal drilling techniques , according to a Penn State and State University of New York , Fredonia , team .
" The value of this science could increment the net worth of U.S. energy resources by a trillion dollars , plus or minus billions , " says Terry Engelder , professor of geosciences , at Penn State .
The Marcellus shale runs from the southern tier of New York , through the western portion of Pennsylvania into the eastern half of Ohio and through West Virginia .
In Pennsylvania , the formation extends from the Appalachian plateau into the western valley and ridge .
This area has produced natural gas for years , but the Marcellus shale , a deep layer of rock , is officially identified as holding a relatively small amount of proven or potential reserves .
However , many gas production companies are now interested in the Marcellus .
Engelder , working with Gary Lash , professor of geoscience , SUNY Fredonia , has conservatively estimated that the Marcellus shale contains 168 trillion cubic feet of natural gas in place and optimistically suggests that the amounts could be as high as 516 trillion cubic feet .
" Conservatively , we generally only consider 10 percent of gas in place as a potential resource , " says Engelder .
" The key , of course , is that the Marcellus is more easily produced by horizontal drilling across fractures , and until recently , gas production companies seemed unaware of the presence of the natural fractures necessary for magnifying the success of horizontal drilling in the Marcellus . "
The U.S. currently produces roughly 30 trillion cubic feet of gas a year , and these numbers are dropping .
According to Engelder , the technology exists to recover 50 trillion cubic feet of gas from the Marcellus , thus keeping the U.S. production up .
If this recovery is realized , the Marcellus reservoir would be considered a Super Giant gas field .
Engelder , who has studied this area of the U.S. for most of his career and began looking into fractures under a National Science Foundation grant 25 years ago , has identified and mapped natural fractures in the Marcellus shale .
He and Lash will present some of their recent work at the 2008 American Association of Petroleum Geologists Annual Convention and Exhibition this spring .
The researchers look at the patterns of fractures in the shale and determine which are important for gas production .
Fractures that correlate with the folding of the ridge and valley system are less common in black shale .
However , because of their orientation , the fractures that formed prior to the folding will release gas if the wells cross the fracture zones .
These fractures , referred to as J1 fractures by Engelder and Lash , run as slices from the northeast to the southwest in the Marcellus shale and are fairly close together .
While a vertical well may cross one of these fractures and other less productive fractures , a horizontally drilled well aimed to the north northwest will cross a series of very productive J1 fractures .
" It takes $ 800,000 to drill a vertical well in the Marcellus , but it takes $ 3 million to drill a horizontal well , " says Engelder .
Companies that drill gas wells need to be certain that horizontal drilling will produce the gas they expect and the work by Engelder and Lash suggests that it will .
" We know that the Marcellus shale appears as an outcrop near Batavia , N.Y. , east of Buffalo , " says Engelder .
" And we can see the fractures in the Marcellus in the exposed sections of the ridge and valley areas to the southeast .
Because we see them going through the folded areas , we know they were there before the folding .
If it happened earlier , then we know they have to be in the intervening basin as well . "
The natural fractures in the Marcellus shale are the key to recovering large amounts of gas .
As heavily organic sediments were laid down 365 million years ago , the black shale of the Marcellus formed .
As the organic material decayed and degraded , methane and other components of natural gas formed and dispersed through the pores in the rock .
About 300 million years ago , the pressure of the gas caused fractures to form in the shale .
It was not until 280 million years ago that the eastern portion of Pennsylvania was pushed into the folding of the ridge and valley province that makes up that area .
Gas that occurs in pockets underground is considered a conventional reservoir ; gas that is distributed throughout the rock , like the Marcellus , is called an unconventional reservoir .
The Penn State - Fredonia approach is not restricted to production of the Marcellus shale , but can be applied to any gas - bearing shale with this type of fracture .
Because the approach begins with a vertical well and then drills horizontally in the direction that will crosscut the productive fractures , old vertical wells can be reused .
" We can go back to wells that are already drilled and played out , and then drill horizontal from there , " says Engelder .
" Reusing old wells has both economic and environmental value . "

AMD reached its lowest share price for more than four years last week and , as a result , its market value dropped to around US $ 5 billion – that 's $ 400 million less than it paid for ATI in July 2006 .
Intel , AMD ’s major competitor in the CPU business , has been on a roll for the past 18 months and is now worth around US $ 162 billion , which makes the chip giant more than 32 times the size of AMD in monetary terms
Even worse for AMD is that its partner - cum - archrival , Nvidia , has a market cap of around $ 19 billion , which makes it almost four times as valuable as the struggling platform company .
It ’s fair to say things have n’t been going well for AMD since the middle of last year , as its two major rivals launched products that remain largely uncontested even today .
Neither the Core 2 Extreme QX6700 nor the GeForce 8800 GTX have been truly surpassed in terms of performance yet and it ’s not going to happen until next year .
There are no two ways about it : the Phenom launch was a disappointment .
This was largely down to the fact that the company found an erratum in the L3 cache Translation Lookup Buffer , which could cause serious system instabilities in certain scenarios and it prevented the company from launching a 2.4GHz Phenom CPU at the eleventh .
AMD issued a TLB fix to motherboard manufacturers to implement into their BIOSes and when the results for the TLB fix came out , it was n’t pretty
This was n’t all that disappointed us about the Phenom launch though , as AMD also prevented all but a select few publications from running their own independent benchmarks on the new CPUs before the launch .
I do n’t think there was any malice in that choice personally , but it did n’t really help AMD ’s street cred when , come launch day , reviews were few and far between .
It ’s not all doom and gloom though , because I consider the Radeon HD 3800 - series ’ launch to have been a success , even though there is a shortage of hardware in the channel at the moment .
Let ’s hope that AMD ’s fortunes in 2008 change for the better because as an industry we need AMD to continue to innovate and deliver great choice to consumers .
In recent times , we would n’t have had great products like the GeForce 8800 and Core 2 , if it wasn ' for AMD 's forward - thinking innovations like the Athlon 64 and Radeon X1900 - series , which were class leading products at their time of introduction ( and continued to be class - leading for much of their lives ) .
Do you have a thought on AMD 's current situation ?

Washington , DC – Anticipating an important Senate vote on warrantless wiretapping on Monday , January 28 , the American Civil Liberties Union released the following statement , which can be attributed to Caroline Fredrickson , director of the Washington Office of the ACLU :
" The Republican shenanigans on warrantless wiretapping are simply playing politics with fear and are unacceptable .
The American people and the Democrats in the Senate are not and should not be hoodwinked into giving up vital constitutional freedoms by the Republicans ’ incessant fearmongering .
We urge senators to vote against cutting off debate on Monday and reject Republican efforts to force the unconstitutional Intelligence Committee bill through the Senate .
" Senators should have the opportunity to consider a wide range of important amendments , including measures on stripping retroactive immunity for telecommunications providers and provisions that would offer increased privacy protections .
" We agree with Senator Feingold when he stated that Monday ’s cloture vote will be a test of whether the majority is willing to stand up to the administration and stand up for our rights .
" The truth is , the sunset of the Protect America Act is nothing to be afraid of .
Surveillance is always allowable under the tried - and - true Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court that ’s operated for almost thirty years .
Even the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee has said we ’re not facing a crisis .
" We urge the Senate to stand firm and not rubberstamp the administration ’s warrantless wiretapping . "

Emily the Cow
On November 14 , 2005 , Emily bolted from the killing floor and focused on survival by jumping over a 5 - foot high gate out of a slaughterhouse .
She escaped and spent a month in the snowy woods .
She was very brave and very strong having eluded the police , slaughterhouse workers and animal control officers for forty days and forty nights .
This is a true story .
I met Emily and heard of her stories .
When she escaped the slaughterhouse she was a two year old cow who could not produce milk , so the milk industry decided that she was not useful and unprofitable .
Dairy cows are usually slaughtered when they are 5 or 6 years old because their milk production declines and those who cannot produce milk are immediately slaughtered .
There are horrifying stories of how cows are treated before they are slaughtered .
Emily was found by the Randa family who recognized the connection between human suffering and animal suffering .
They took her into their family and brought her to a sanctuary .
The Randas bought Emily from the slaughterhouse and she was welcomed to her new home at the Peace Abbey on December 24 , 1995 .
Emily became the campaign for the Farm Animal Reform Movement , which is a non-profit public interest organization that promotes planetary health through plant based eating .
This organization advocates plant - based vegan diets to save animals .
Emily was involved in the conferences that voiced animals ’ rights .
She was also an important member of the Hindu community .
She attended religious events at the nearby Hindu Temple .
In Hinduism , the cow is highly respected and worshiped .
One of the reasons why Hindus worship the cow is because of a cow named Kamadhenu who was believed to be the mother of all the cows .
In Hindu Mythology , Kamadhenu was a miraculous cow who could give her owner whatever he desired .
Visitors from India came to bless her as a sacred cow and brought her a handmade sacred cow blanket .
She was happy , healthy and safe .
Things began to change in early March .
Emily began to lose weight and her abdomen filled with fluid … Emily had cancer .
Her cancer had been growing inside of her since the age of two , which prevented her from becoming pregnant and producing milk .
The mammary gland of a calf and the udder is almost fully developed by six months of age .
By this stage the udder has four separate glands and a median ligament , teat and gland cisterns .
As the udder increases in cell size and cell numbers through lactations , the milk producing capacity increases .
However , a cow cannot produce milk until she is pregnant .
With Emily , a plausible explanation would be that as her udder increased in cell size and numbers , they must have produced and reproduced cancerous cells .
These cells could have prevented her from becoming pregnant and prevented her from producing milk .
There was very little that the doctors could do for her .
Sunday , March 30 , 2003
Sherborn , Massachusetts
OnEmily died in her sleep of uterine cancer .
The whole community came to give their respects to her .
Lewis Randa summarized in his eulogy over Emily that “ Emily was more that just a cow .
She was , for people who loved her , an important creature who put them in touch with a greater understanding of animals and how humans should treat them .
Her eyes would melt your heart and make you appreciate what animals have to offer . ”
She is now buried at the Peace Abbey in

If Trish Burns is your friend and you spent last Saturday night eating dinner at her house , there is a very good chance her cat “ Smitten ” sat on your food .
Or licked it .
Or walked through it , dipping her litter - soaked paws in the various dishes with each delicate step .
Trish has never trained her cat properly and the kitchen table is definitely NOT off limits to this curious feline .
In fact , Smitten loves to jump on the table and sniff about ( usually when no one is looking ) , checking out the latest food additions to her favorite perch .
It probably would have been a good idea if Trish covered the various dishes of food she put out for her buffet - style dinner .
But she did n’t .
She filled the crowded table with a lasagna , ham , potato salad , Caesar salad , broccoli and asparagus at 6:30 pm .
Her guests did n’t enter the kitchen until 7:30 pm .
This gave Smitten a full hour to enjoy “ first dibs . ”
Without a Trace
Smitten ’s dainty little paws and butt leave little , if any , trace of her furry , flea - filled touch .
Her sticky little tongue ( which spent most of the afternoon in her anus ) produces a very small quantity of saliva .
So you probably did n’t even notice that Smitten licked your broccoli about twenty times .
Luckily , most people at the party were pretty buzzed ( especially Mike , he had like 6 gin and tonics before he got there ) and did n’t discern any cat - flavoring in the food .
Jane however , did take note of a couple of gray hairs sticking to a piece of ham , but she did n’t say anything because Trish worked so hard making all the food .
She did n’t want to upset her .

More News …
NEW YORK — While sailing the ocean near Haiti , Christopher Columbus in 1493 reported seeing three mermaids from a distance .
The Genoese explorer was not impressed .
Up close , the sea maidens were “ not as pretty as they are depicted , ” he wrote in his journal , “ for somehow in the face they look like men . ”
Many scientists now think that what Columbus probably saw was a manatee , an aquatic mammal that resembles a flippered hippo .
In a new exhibition opening at the American Museum of Natural History ( AMNH ) here this weekend , viewers can digitally superimpose the picture of a mermaid atop that of a manatee and see how Columbus and countless other sailors might have been fooled .
Entitled Mythic Creatures : Dragons , Unicorns & Mermaids , the exhibition traces the possible origins of some of the world ’s most famous “ imaginary ” beasts and also their lesser - known counterparts .
Nature and myth “ This museum has a long history of studying and presenting great stories about the natural world and the culture of humanity , ” said AMNH president Ellen Futter at a press preview of the exhibition earlier this week .
“ In this exhibition , we extend that tradition further , by looking at the intersection of nature and culture , those moments when people glimpse something fantastical in nature . ”
The exhibition deftly combines nature and myth , paleontology and anthropology , and delightfully campy models of mythical creatures with real fossils .
Upon first entering the exhibition , visitors are greeted by a 17 - foot - long , green , European dragon of the sort that legend says Saint George slew .
Its sinuous and colorful Chinese counterpart hangs from the ceiling in one of the last rooms of the exhibition .
In the mythical water - creatures section , large tentacles and the head of a giant squid - inspired kraken rise from the floor , its body mostly hidden .
An imaginary bestiary Mythic Creatures borrows specimens and artifacts from the fossil , art and anthropological collections of the AMNH and other museums , and examines how such objects might have — through imagination , misidentification , speculation or outright deception — given birth to fantastical creatures .
“ Faced with awesome nature , our imaginations might create something to be revered , something beautiful , something to be gently feared or something simply whimsical and playful , perhaps even magical , ” Futter said .
“ I trust that this exhibition will show you a little of all of these . ”
Visitors can touch a real narwhal tusk , which for centuries many Europeans accepted as proof of the unicorn ’s existence .
Or glimpse the beaked skull of a protoceratop dinosaur , one of the fossil animals that practically litter the Gobi Desert even today , and which traders long ago might have mistaken for the remains of a griffin — a mythical creature with the head and forelimbs of an eagle and the body of a lion .
The exhibition makes a convincing argument for why the same creatures pop up in the stories of cultures separated by great spans of time and distance .
Mermaids , for example , were probably born in the minds of lonely European sailors , and as their boats touched shore around the world , the image of the half - woman , half - fish creature spread , often becoming intermixed with local beliefs .
“ This is a really intriguing form — the idea of a beautiful woman who also lives in the water , ” Laurel Kendall , one of the museum ’s anthropology curators , told LiveScience .
“ People who have water goddesses , it seems when they encounter the image of the mermaid , [ they find ] this is a great way to represent them . ”
Trivia Mythic Creatures introduces visitors to imaginary beasts most of us have probably never heard of .
There is the Japanese “ Kappa , ” a green monkey - faced creature that had an appetite for children and cucumbers .
Kappas lived in ponds but occasionally walked on land .
They had bowl - shaped indentations on their heads , where they kept a shallow pool of pond water that was the source of their power .
Travelers encountering a Kappa late at night were advised to bow ; when the Kappa bowed in turn , it would spill its water and , powerless , scurry back to its pond .
The exhibition is also a rich source of mythical creatures ’ trivia .
Visitors can learn , for example , that , according to Marco Polo , Genghis Khan possessed the feather of a Roc — a mythical giant bird said to dine on elephants — but that Polo ’s translator , Sir Henry Yule , suspected the feather was only a palm - tree frond .
And , according to the exhibition , not everyone agreed with Columbus about mermaids .
Captain John Smith of Pocahontas fame reported that a mermaid he once glimpsed was “ by no means unattractive . ”
Whether homely or beautiful , the monsters and beasts that once haunted the collective imaginations of our ancestors are given new life in Mythic Creatures .
The exhibition will run from May 26 , 2007 , to January 6 , 2008 .

The Songwriters Association of Canada proposes a $ 5 monthly fee on subscribers ’
Internet bills that would make it legal to download music and hopefully save the failing music industry .
THE PROBLEM
Sales of CDs are down 20 per cent worldwide and 35 per cent in Canada , compared to 2006 .
An estimated 1.6 billion music files are downloaded in Canada each year on " grey - market " peer - to - peer systems , representing $ 1.6 billion in lost revenue , using the iTunes price model of 99 cents per download .
The total number of purchased downloads in Canada was 38 million in 2005 .
The ratio of shared to paid downloads is 98:2 ( 98 % shared files vs. 2 % purchased downloads ) .
Virtually every song ever recorded is available through peer - to - peer file - sharing ( more than 79 million recordings ) .
Only 3 million songs are available on legal sites .
Sources : Songwriters Association of Canada ; Canadian Record Industry Association ; PricewaterhouseCoopers LLB
WHAT'S THE PLAN ?
SAC is calling for the creation of the Right to Equitable Remuneration for Music File Sharing , which would make it legal to share music on peer - to - peer networks in exchange for the monthly fee .
The fee – amounting to an estimated $ 500 million to $ 900 million annually in Canada – would be administered by a collective of artists , songwriters , music publishers and record labels .
" Monetizing peer - to - peer file - sharing would generate significant new revenue for creators and the music industry , " says acting SAC president Eddie Schwartz , " and re-establish revenue levels ( for songwriters ) that we have n't seen since 2000 - 2001 . "
THE FORUM
SAC , which represents the interests of Canadian music composers and lyricists , is advancing its radical proposal at a public forum tomorrow at 7 p.m. at Oakham House at Ryerson University .
It hopes this will be the first step towards legitimizing peer - to - peer music file - sharing activity in this country – and perhaps eventually all over the world – while compensating music creators at the same time .
For more information go to songwriters.ca , or call 1-866-456-7664 .
WHAT'S IN IT FOR CONSUMERS ?
SAC argues the fee would remove the stigma of illegality from file - sharing and represents exceptional value to the consumer , since it would allow unlimited access to the majority of the world 's repertoire of recorded music .
The plan renders digital rights management and the legal protection for digital locks , which prevent copying and file - sharing , " obsolete , " Schwartz says .
" The simple truth is that there 's no way anyone can stop free file - sharing .
It 's exciting to discover new music and natural to want to share it .
File - sharing is n't about the marketplace , it 's social activity , a way to seek out like - minded people , and music has always been used that way .
The SAC proposal may not be the silver bullet that saves the music industry , but it could be the greatest opportunity independent artists and music consumers have .
There are no middlemen , no gatekeepers , no owners of the means of music distribution in this proposal .
Consumers can interact directly with the creators of music . "
WHAT ARE THE OBSTACLES ?
Internet Service Providers may resist adding $ 5 to customers ' monthly bills .
The four major record labels , which have traditionally dominated music distribution , oppose all attempts to establish alternatives or competitors .
The federal government , which will have to be convinced of the merit of the changes in the Copyright Act , is reluctant to intervene in the marketplace unless in the public interest .
Songwriters and authors will have to give up their long - established right to approve or disapprove of the use and means of dissemination of their work .
The only right they will have is the right to be paid for peer - to - peer downloads .
Internet users who do not download music – paid or otherwise – will balk at paying an extra $ 5 a month .
Source : David Fewer , staff counsel with the Canadian Internet Policy and Public Interest Clinic at the University of Ottawa , Faculty of Law
CHORUS OF SUPPORT
" I wholeheartedly believe that this model for file - sharing should be embraced in all countries .
Let 's get it rolling and it can be a template for other performing rights societies throughout the world .
With dwindling record sales because of the thievery , this might be the new paradigm of income source for all songwriters . "
–musician Randy Bachman
" The Canadian Music Creators Coalition endorses the Songwriters Association of Canada in pushing this proposal forward .
We think the Canadian government should be facilitating discussion over the merits of this forward - thinking approach .
This is the first progressive proposal we 've seen in Canada to address file - sharing ... a made - in - Canada approach to ( the issue ) . ''
– Andrew Cash , spokesperson for the organization that monitors legal and policy issues affecting Canadian musicians
" With the Internet I have virtually unlimited access to millions of music files .
Amazing , right ?
Well ... yes and no .
I 'm a songwriter .
Songwriters create ideas .
We 're inventors .
Think about the light bulb and the telephone .
People do n't mind paying for their telephone and electricity each month , but somehow they think music should be free .
The truth is , music has value too .
We believe access to online music should remain unlimited .
We 're just asking that the value of our music be acknowledged and that we be fairly compensated . "
– Bryan Adams collaborator Jim Vallance
" I think if there was an ISP tax of some sort , we can say , ` All music is now available and able to be downloaded and put in your car and put in your iPod and put it up your ass if you want , and it 's $ 5 on your cable bill . ' "
– Trent Reznor , Nine Inch Nails
Should No Child Left Behind
Act be reauthorized ?
- NO
We need a new definition of accountability
America 's schools have fallen into a giant trap .
This trap is epic in its dimensions , because the people capable of leading us out of it have been silenced , and the initiative that could help us is being systematically squashed .
Policymakers and the public have been seduced by a simple formulation .
No Child Left Behind posits that we have troubled schools because they have not been accountable .
If we make teachers and schools pay a price for the failure of their students , they will bring those students up to speed .
But schools are NOT the only factor determining student success .
Urban neighborhoods are plagued by poverty and violence and recent reports in The Chronicle show that as many as 30 percent of the children in these neighborhoods suffer from post - traumatic stress disorder .
Fully 40 percent of our students are English learners , but these students must take the same tests as native English speakers .
Moreover , a recent study provides strong evidence that family - based factors such as the quality of day care , the home vocabulary and the amount of time spent reading and watching television at home account for two - thirds of the difference in academic success for students .
Nonetheless , NCLB holds only the schools accountable .
Teachers are realizing that this is a raw deal .
We can't single - handedly solve these problems , and we can't bring 100 percent of our students to proficiency in the next six years , no matter how " accountable " the law makes us , and no matter the punishments it metes out .
But if we speak up to point out the injustice and unreasonableness of the demands on our schools , we are shouted down , accused of making excuses for ourselves and not having high expectations for our students .
Thus , teachers have been silenced , our expertise squandered .
The fatal flaw of NCLB was that it assumed that teachers were obstacles to change ; that we had to be coerced to set higher standards for ourselves and our students .
As a result we have state - mandated standards , standardized tests - even scripted curriculum to tell us what to say in class .
All of this has demoralized teachers by making us into the problem , rather than a big part of the solution .
But educators have not been completely immobilized .
We have been learning in spite of the hostile conditions , and have discovered that :
-- Although student success is heavily influenced by other factors , an effective teacher can make a huge difference .
-- Teachers who are able to skillfully assess student learning on a daily basis can promote rapid growth by giving timely feedback and tailoring instruction to meet students ' needs .
-- Teachers who collaborate together to develop common assessments and share techniques can build powerful learning communities that allow them to push their students to make great gains .
-- Teachers are capable of developing assessments that reflect the values and skills desired by their local communities - and this yields a much higher level of student and teacher engagement , as can be seen in Nebraska ( www.nde.state.ne.us/focusstars/ index.htm ) .
-- Teachers must be deeply involved in educational policy decisions - without our insights and support , policies on paper will not translate into real - world solutions .
While the recent proposed revisions of NCLB contained some improvements , the law remains fundamentally flawed , and does not deserve to be reauthorized .
We need to step back and create a new vision of accountability - from the classroom up .
Teachers are willing to be accountable for making a difference - that is why we entered this profession .
But we must have reasonable goals that reflect the realities we face .
We need to be given a much bigger role in designing the measures by which our students and schools are judged , and we must have the conditions and resources in our schools that allow for the high quality collaboration we need to succeed .
When we are asked to lead , we will be ready to help show the way .
We are still teachers , after all .

なので、25日までの効果を確認です。
1ヶ月使い続けているとなんだかちょっと髪にコシが出てきた感じがします。
鏡を見ると今までペちゃんとなっていたトップの部分がちょっと盛り上がっている感じ。
おっ！これは良いんじゃないの？
少し期待が持てます 。
やっぱり成分のフラボステロンとかいうのが効果的なのかも知れないですね。
もう少し続けてみることに決定しました！
ミホレ（MIHORE）を使い始めて3ヶ月
ミホレ（MIHORE）をつかってとうとう3ヶ月経ちました。
2ヶ月目くらいから頭皮の環境が良くなってきたのか
抜け毛が少なくなってきました。
酢酸トコフェロールって言う成分がミホレ（MIHORE）には入っているのですがその効果なのかも知れません。
そして、3ヶ月目には髪のボリュームが多くなってきたんです。
白髪交じりだったのに最近は白髪も目立たなくなってきています。
それだけ黒髪が増えてきたのでしょうか？
結構私は効果をはやく実感している方だと思います。
効果が出やすいのは髪への有効成分がナノ化されていて染みこみやすく届きやすくなっているからなのでしょうね。
浸透ナノ 化DDS採用って結構重要ですよね。
実は結構感動して薄毛に悩んでいる友達にも紹介したんです。
そうしたらその人は2ヶ月目で髪のボリュームが私よりもUP。
もともと私よりひどい状態だったのにです。
聞いてみた ら
「 1日に2回使っているの」だそうです。
ミホレ（MIHORE）は1日1回で良いんですが、より効果を高めたいなら2回、朝と晩に着けるのも良いみたいです。
友達も 「なんだか気持ちが軽くなった」って喜んでました。

The federal government 's efforts to create a standardized , secure driver 's license that would also serve as a national ID card have hit some significant stumbling blocks .
Chief among them :
Eight states have voted in the past year not to participate in the program .
Nine others are on the record opposing the proposal .
In total , legislation opposing the plan has been introduced in 38 states .
Behind much of the state legislative opposition to the Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) plan is Missouri state Rep. Jim Guest , a conservative Republican .
His primary concern : REAL ID , as DHS has dubbed the initiative , would not deter terrorists .
Instead , he believes , it would be an unprecedented invasion of individual privacy , creating a databank of personal information to which officials on the local , state , and federal levels would have access .
" I love my freedom , I love my country , and we 're heading down a road here that would take away many of the things we take for granted , " says Representative Guest .
" If we had to start carrying a card around – if we lost our freedom not to – I do n't think we could ever get that back . "
Passed by Congress in 2005 and recommended by the 9/11 Commission , the REAL ID Act requires states to create tamper - and fraud - proof driver 's licenses .
Each would contain a digital photograph , a digital signature , and a machine - readable bar code .
Before issuing a license , a state would have to verify that an individual is a US citizen or has a valid foreign passport and visa .
That information would have to be cross- checked against other states ' , Social Security , immigration , and State Department databases .
The intent is to make it much more difficult for a terrorist to get access to a driver 's license that could be used to board a plane , as most of the 9/11 hijackers did .
Under the original proposal , the citizens of states who fail to meet the REAL ID standards would not be able to use their state driver 's licenses to board planes or enter federal buildings .
Homeland security experts say such a standardized identification system would be helpful in maintaining security .
" This could assure you that people are not using false identifications and boarding planes under false pretenses , " says Michael Greenberger , director of the University of Maryland 's Center for Health and Homeland Security .
" But there are a lot of strong arguments against it .
It 's become very unpopular , politically . "
One reason is the price tag , estimated at $ 14.6 billion .
Congress has so far appropriated only $ 40 million and twice this summer voted against additional funding .
There 's also concern about how difficult it would be to implement .
Critics question how states could verify the legitimacy of many foreign passports .
Conservative libertarians and liberal privacy advocates balk at the requirement that the cards would eventually have an infrared chip containing such personal information as Social Security numbers – machine readable from several feet away .
While critics argue that having a central databank could dramatically increase identity theft , DHS contends the secure nature of the ID would decrease it .
The objections raised by states have already prompted DHS to extend the deadline for implementation from the spring of 2008 to 2013 .
Last week , Guest and the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) sparked more consternation at DHS by claiming it watered down REAL ID requirements so much that it negated the original intent of the program .
In a conference call with state officials , including Guest , DHS reportedly said it is considering further extensions .
DHS also made it clear that if states do n't comply , their citizens could still use passports or go through extended screening to board planes .
" Under repeated and direct questioning about whether or not DHS would enforce penalties against those states that do n't comply , Assistant Secretary Richard Barth said , ' No , we are not going to be blocking the citizens of noncompliant states from doing things like flying , ' " says Tim Sparapani , the ACLU 's senior legislative counsel .
DHS denied it was " watering down " the program and said in statement that the ACLU continues to " spout off erroneous information to confuse and mislead the public . "
In a phone conversation later , DHS spokeswoman Laura Keehner insisted , " The bottom line is that we have not backed off anything .
We will enforce REAL ID . "
But Guest and other state officials say they will fight to repeal the program .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani is trailing in the race for the Republican presidential nomination even on his home turf of New York state , a new poll showed on Monday .

The WNBC / Marist poll ahead of the February 5 primaries in New York showed 34 percent of registered Republicans support John McCain , compared to 23 percent for Giuliani .
Among Republicans likely to vote , McCain kept his 34 percent support , while Giuliani was tied in second place with Mitt Romney at 19 percent .
McCain ’s campaign has been boosted by wins in New Hampshire and South Carolina in the state - by - state race to pick the two candidates to contest the November 4 election to succeed President George W. Bush .
Giuliani , whose once large lead in national polls has evaporated , largely bypassed early voting states and focused on Florida , which votes on January 29 .
As the former New York mayor who won national recognition in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks , Giuliani would hope for a strong showing in New York .
But the poll showed 46 percent of registered Republicans in New York think Arizona Sen.
McCain is the Republican most likely to beat the Democratic candidate in November .
Nineteen percent saw former Massachusetts Gov. Romney as the most electable and 15 percent picked Giuliani as most electable .
Another local politician , New York Sen. Hillary Clinton , appeared to be in a strong position ahead of the New York primary for the Democratic Party nomination .
The poll showed her with the support of 48 percent of Democrats likely to vote in the primary , followed by Illinois Sen. Barack Obama with 32 percent .
The survey of 1,467 New York state registered voters was conducted January 15 - 17 , and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percent , the poll said .
Neither party has established a clear front - runner , as the first major state - by - state battles produced multiple winners .
Responding to the New York poll , the Guiliani campaign issued a statement from New York Republican Rep. Peter King saying the former mayor would win in the state .
“ The people of New York know better than anyone that Rudy is the bold and gutsy leader our country needs right now to tackle the tough challenges , ” King said .
McGill University researchers have uncovered the crucial role played by the enzyme focal adhesion kinase ( FAK ) in the onset of breast cancer .
Using transgenic mice with pre-existing cancers , the McGill team was able to disable the function of FAK in the mammary gland .
" When we did that , we basically blocked tumour progression in our mouse model , " said Dr. Muller , Professor of Biochemistry at McGill , Canada Research Chair in Molecular Oncology and a researcher with the Molecular Oncology Group at the McGill University Health Centre ( MUHC ) .
" This shows that FAK , which was already linked to tumour growth in skin carcinomas , is very critical for tumour progression from a pre-malignant to a malignant state in the mammary tumour system . "
Dr. Muller and his team made a similar breakthrough with an earlier discovery in 2004 , when they showed that the protein beta1 - integrin was similarly critical in the initiation of tumour growth and development of breast cancer in genetically engineered mice .
Likewise , when this gene was blocked , cancerous tumours ceased to grow .
The current discovery about FAK is an exciting sequel to the earlier research , says Dr. Muller , because , unlike beta1 - integrin , kinase enzymes are eminently " druggable " with current technology .
Dr. Muller cautions that this study -- like the Beatson Institute 's earlier research linking FAK to tumour progression in skin carcinomas -- is still preliminary .
" However , developing an FAK inhibitor would certainly add another weapon to the arsenal for dealing with breast cancer , " he said .
The research , led by Dr. William Muller -- along with colleagues from McGill and the Beatson Institute for Cancer Research in Scotland -- was published the week of November 26 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences ( PNAS ) .
The study 's first author is Dr. Hicham Lahlou , a post - doctoral fellow in Dr. Muller 's lab .

In a significant judgment , the Commission deprecated the " audacity and impunity " with which banks have been effecting forcible possession of vehicles and ordered ICICI Bank to pay Rs 50 lakh to a consumer , who was mercilessly beaten by the recovery agents while they snatched a loaned car from him .
Have you been harassed by recovery agents ?
" No civilised society governed by rule of law can brook such kind of conduct , " the Commission 's president Justice J D Kapoor said , adding the violent methods adopted by the recovery agents were serious violation of " human rights " .
Holding the ICICI Bank guilty of " unfair trade practice , " the Commission termed such miscreants as " yahoos " and said they are boorish and a brutal lout , who care a fig for legal and judicial authorities , including the Supreme Court .
While taking to task the leading bank , it vented its anger on ICICI for flouting the apex court 's direction that restrained all the financial institutions from employing musclemen to recover a loan amount or possession of a vehicle .
The Commission , also comprising member Rumnita Mittal , issued notices to the collection manager of ICICI Bank and the CEO of the recovery agency , seeking their explanations over blatant violation of the direction of the highest court of the nation .
Its strong worded order came recently while hearing a complaint by Tapan Bose , whose loaned car was taken away by some recovery agents after beating up his friend 's son with iron rods on January 8 , leading to serious injuries on his skull and other parts of the body .
ICICI , however , refused to own up the act contending the agents were employed separately by the recovery agency and it could not held culpable for any such act as it had asked the agency to conduct themselves in accordance with the law .
Quashing the bank 's argument , the Commission said , " For every illegal acts of the collection agency , the bank is directly liable , " adding the consumer had no concern with an internal agreement between the bank and any other agency and they could not be made to pay the price for it .
It termed the musclemen as " robbers and hardened criminals , " who beat up a consumer for recovering a few thousand rupees , snatching the key of a vehicle and take it away little realising the urgency or emergency of the person .
" They insult everyone , humiliate the inmates and create scenes .
They have driven people to commit suicide for a few thousands , " the Commission said in a release , maintaining there was a civil legal remedy for recovering loans and employing goons for this was beyond the parameters of the law .

Here 's the strange thing :
If we are in a political " season of change " and " change " is now the word most used by presidential candidates , change is n't exactly valued when it comes to presidential runs themselves .
Take , for example , the Democratic debate moderated by ABC News ' Charlie Gibson a week ago .
In that mere hour and a half of television , Gibson , his TV sidekicks like George Stephanopoulos , and the four candidates managed to use the " C " word some 48 times -- being " agents of " or " power voices for change , " " making , " " delivering , " " producing , " " advocating for , " " fighting for , " " believing deeply in , " " loving , " even " embody[ing ] change . "
In the process , they just about ground change into the dust .
But lurking in the background was another use of that word -- as an accusation -- and it went unnoticed .
Here 's Hillary Clinton , for example , launching an attack on Barack Obama :
" You know , I think that , two weeks ago , you criticized Senator Edwards in saying that he was unelectable because he had changed positions over the course of four years , that four years ago he was n't for universal health care ; now , he is .
Well , you 've changed positions within three years on , you know , a range of issues that you put forth when you ran for the Senate , and now you have changed . "
To which , Obama had to respond : " I have been entirely consistent in my position on health care … "
This is typical of our electoral moment and it's another little legacy of the Bush era .
You can probably thank Karl Rove for this one because in 2004 , handling a notoriously single - minded , inflexible , and stubborn candidate , he managed to turn the " C " word into a curse no one is likely to forget .
To change , you remember , was actually to " flip - flop . "
And if there 's one thing in the post - 2004 era that no candidate can now afford to be charged with , it 's flipping and flopping like a fish on the deck of a ship .
John Edwards , for instance , recently changed his position on Iraq in a significant way .
While still in the Iowa caucus race , he called for the withdrawal within 10 months of all American troops in Iraq ( except for a few thousand soldiers left to guard the Baghdad embassy ) , including the trainers of Iraqi troops .
Previously , like the other two leading candidates , he had only called for the withdrawal of American " combat troops " who make up perhaps half of the U.S. troop contingent .
He was not challenged on this in the debate , but had he been , he would surely have little choice but to claim that he , too , had somehow been " consistent , " that he had n't flip - flopped on Iraq .
As a result , the " change " candidates of 2008 , wielding the " C " word for an audience " fired up " for … well , you know what , so just shout it out … must themselves swear that they are " consistent " in their positions , that , in short , they do not change .
The one thing these candidates of change can't go out in public and say is something like : " Well , that was 2002 , but in the intervening years , I 've done a lot of thinking , had new experiences , grown , matured … changed , and so has my position on [ you fill in the issue ] . "
Change may , or may not , turn out to be the Pied Piper of 2008 for the American voter , but it surely will remain the Scylla and Charybdis of twenty - first century presidential politics .
So watch out … be consistent … go ( like the Republican candidates ) for the " eternal " verities … and , while you 're at it , consider the nature of religious consistency in politics , because this election is , so far , not just the non - flip - flop election , but the " faith " election in which even Hillary Clinton has a " Faith , Family and Values " team on her campaign staff , while John McCain claimed on the campaign trail that he thought the Constitution had established a " Christian nation " … but let Tomdispatch regular and professor of religion Ira Chernus tell you the rest .

Is Religion a Threat to Democracy ?
Faith Talk on the Campaign Trail
By Ira Chernus
It 's a presidential campaign like no other .
The candidates have been falling all over each other in their rush to declare the depth and sincerity of their religious faith .
The pundits have been just as eager to raise questions that seem obvious and important :
Should we let religious beliefs influence the making of law and public policy ?
If so , in what way and to what extent ?
Those questions , however , assume that candidates bring the subject of faith into the political arena largely to justify -- or turn up the heat under -- their policy positions .
In fact , faith talk often has little to do with candidates ' stands on the issues .
There 's something else going on here .
Look at the TV ad that brought Mike Huckabee out of obscurity in Iowa , the one that identified him as a " Christian Leader " who proclaims : " Faith does n't just influence me .
It really defines me . "
That ad did indeed mention a couple of actual political issues -- the usual suspects , abortion and gay marriage -- but only in passing .
Then Huckabee followed up with a red sweater - themed Christmas ad that actively encouraged voters to ignore the issues .
We 're all tired of politics , the kindly pastor indicated .
Let 's just drop all the policy stuff and talk about Christmas -- and Christ .
Ads like his are n't meant to argue policy .
They aim to create an image -- in this case , of a good Christian with a steady moral compass who sticks to his principles .
At a deeper level , faith - talk ads work hard to turn the candidate -- whatever candidate -- into a bulwark of solidity , a symbol of certainty ; their goal is to offer assurance that the basic rules for living remain fixed , objective truths , as true as religion .
In a time when the world seems like a shaky place -- whether you have a child in Iraq , a mortgage you may not be able to meet , a pension threatening to head south , a job evaporating under you , a loved one battling drug or alcohol addiction , an ex who just came out as gay or born - again , or a president you just can't trust -- you may begin to wonder whether there is any moral order in the universe .
Are the very foundations of society so shaky that they might not hold up for long ?
Words about faith -- nearly any words -- speak reassuringly to such fears , which haunt millions of Americans .
These fears and the religious responses to them have been a key to the political success of the religious right in recent decades .
Randall Balmer , a leading scholar of evangelical Christianity , points out that it 's offered not so much " issues " to mobilize around as " an unambiguous morality in an age of moral and ethical uncertainty . "
Mitt Romney was courting the evangelical - swinging - toward - Huckabee vote when he , too , went out of his way to link religion with moral absolutes in his big Iowa speech on faith .
Our " common creed of moral convictions … the firm ground on which Americans of different faiths meet " turned out , utterly unsurprisingly , to be none other than religious soil : " We believe that every single human being is a child of God… liberty is a gift of God . "
No doubts allowed here .
American politicians have regularly wielded religious language and symbolism in their moments of need , and such faith talk has always helped provide a sense of moral certainty in a shape - shifting world .
But in the better years of the previous century , candidates used religion mostly as an adjunct to the real meat of the political process , a tool to whip up support for policies .
How times have changed .
Think of it , perhaps , as a way to measure the powerful sense of unsettledness that has taken a firm hold on American society .
Candidates increasingly keep their talk about religion separate from specific campaign issues .
They promote faith as something important and valuable in and of itself in the election process .
They invariably avow the deep roots of their religious faith and link it not with issues , but with certitude itself .
Sometimes it seems that Democrats do this with even more grim regularity than Republicans .
John Edwards , for example , reassured the nation that " the hand of God today is in every step of what happens with me and every human being that exists on this planet . "
In the same forum , Hillary Clinton proclaimed that she " had a grounding in faith that gave me the courage and the strength to do what I thought was right , regardless of what the world thought .
And that 's all one can expect or hope for . "
When religious language enters the political arena in this way , as an end in itself , it always sends the same symbolic message : Yes , Virginia ( or Iowa or New Hampshire or South Carolina ) there are absolute values , universal truths that can never change .
You are not adrift in a sea of moral chaos .
Elect me and you 're sure to have a fixed mooring to hold you and your community fast forever .
That message does its work in cultural depths that arguments about the separation of church and state can never touch .
Even if the candidates themselves do n't always understand what their words are doing , this is the biggest , most overlooked piece in today 's faith and politics puzzle -- and once you start looking for it , you find it nearly everywhere on the political landscape .
The Threat to Democracy
So , when it comes to religion and politics , here 's the most critical question :
Should we turn the political arena into a stage to dramatize our quest for moral certainty ?
The simple answer is no -- for lots of reasons .
For starters , it 's a direct threat to democracy .
The essence of our system is that we , the people , get to choose our values .
We do n't discover them inscribed in the cosmos .
So everything must be open to question , to debate , and therefore to change .
In a democracy , there should be no fixed truth except that everyone has the right to offer a new view -- and to change his or her mind .
It 's a process whose outcome should never be predictable , a process without end .
A claim to absolute truth -- any absolute truth -- stops that process .
For those of us who see the political arena as the place where the whole community gathers to work for a better world , it 's even more important to insist that politics must be about large - scale change .
The politics of moral absolutes sends just the opposite message :
Do n't worry , whatever small changes are necessary , it 's only in order to resist the fundamental crumbling that frightens so many .
Nothing really important can ever change .
Many liberals and progressives hear that profoundly conservative message even when it 's hidden beneath all the reasonable arguments about church and state .
That 's one big reason they are often so quick to sound a shrill alarm at every sign of faith - based politics .
They also know how easy it is to go from " there is a fixed truth " to " I have that fixed truth . "
And they 've seen that the fixed truth in question is all too often about personal behaviors that ought to be matters of free choice in a democracy .
Which brings us to the next danger :
Words alone are rarely enough to reassure the uncertain .
In fact , the more people rely on faith talk to pursue certainty , the more they may actually reinforce both anxiety and uncertainty .
It 's a small step indeed to move beyond the issue of individual self - control to controlling others through the passage of laws .
Campaigns to put the government 's hands on our bodies are not usually missionary efforts meant to make us accept someone else 's religion .
They are much more often campaigns to stage symbolic dramas about self - control and moral reassurance .
Controlling the Passions
American culture has always put a spotlight on the question :
Can you control your impulses and desires -- especially sexual desires -- enough to live up to the moral rules ?
As historian of religion John F. Wilson tells us , the quest for surety has typically focused on a " control of self " that " through discipline " finally becomes self - control .
In the 2008 presidential campaign , this still remains true .
Listen , for example , to Barack Obama : " My Bible tells me that if we train a child in the way he should go , when he is old he will not turn from it .
So I think faith and guidance can help fortify … a sense of reverence that all young people should have for the act of sexual intimacy . "
Mitt Romney fit snugly into the same mold .
He started his widely - heralded statement on religion by talking about a time when " our nation faced its greatest peril , " a threat to " the survival of a free land . "
Was he talking about terrorism ?
No .
He immediately went on to warn that the real danger comes from " human passions unbridled . "
Only morality and religion can do the necessary bridling , he argued , quoting John Adams to make his case : " Our constitution was made for a moral and religious people " -- in other words , people who can control themselves .
That 's why " freedom requires religion . "
All too often , though , the faith - talk view of freedom ends up taking away freedom .
When Romney said he'd be " delighted " to sign " a federal ban on all abortions , " only a minority of Americans approved of that position ( if we can believe the polls ) , but it was a sizeable minority .
For them , fear of unbridled passion is stronger than any commitment to personal freedom .
In the end , it may be mostly their own passions that they fear .
But since the effort to control oneself is frustrating , it can easily turn into a quest for " control over other selves , " to quote historian Wilson again , " with essentially bipolar frameworks for conceiving of the world : good versus bad , us versus them " -- " them " being liberals , secular humanists , wild kids , or whatever label the moment calls for .
The upholders of virtue want to convince each other that their values are absolutely true .
So they stick together and stand firm against those who walk in error .
As Romney put it , " Any person who has knelt in prayer to the Almighty has a friend and ally in me . "
That 's the main dynamic driving the movements to ban abortion and gay marriage .
But they 're just the latest in a long line of such movements , including those aimed at prohibiting or restricting alcohol , drugs , gambling , birth control , crime , and other behaviors that are , in a given period , styled as immoral .
Since it 's always about getting " them " to control their passions , the target is usually personal behavior .
But it does n't have to be .
Just about any law or policy can become a symbol of eternal moral truth -- even foreign policy , one area where liberals , embarked on their own faith - talk campaigns , are more likely to join conservatives .
The bipartisan war on terror has , for instance , been a symbolic drama of " us versus them , " acting out a tale of moral truth .
Rudolph Giuliani made the connection clear shortly after the 9/11 attack when he went to the United Nations to whip up support for that " war . "
" The era of moral relativism … must end , " he demanded .
" Moral relativism does not have a place in this discussion and debate . "
Nor does it have a place in the current campaign debate about foreign policy .
Candidate Huckabee , for example , has no hesitation about linking war abroad to the state of morality here at home .
He wants to continue fighting in Iraq , he says , because " our way of life , our economic and moral strength , our civilization is at stake …
I am determined to look this evil in the eye , confront it , defeat it . "
As his anti-gay marriage statement asks , " What 's the point of keeping the terrorists at bay in the Middle East , if we can't keep decline and decadence at bay here at home ? "
On the liberal side , the theme is more muted but still there .
Barack Obama , for instance , has affirmed that the U.S. must " lead the world in battling immediate evils and promoting the ultimate good .
I still believe that America is the last , best hope of Earth . "
Apparently that 's why we need to keep tens of thousands of troops in Iraq indefinitely .
Clinton calls for " a bipartisan consensus to ensure our interests , increase our security and advance our values , " acting out " our deeply - held desire to remake the world as it ought to be . "
Apparently that 's why , in her words , " we can not take any option off the table in sending a clear message to the current leadership of Iran . "
When words and policies become symbols of moral absolutes , they are usually about preventing some " evil " deed or turning things back to the way they ( supposedly ) used to be .
So they are likely to have a conservative impact , even when they come from liberals .
The Future of Faith Talk
In itself , faith in politics poses no great danger to democracy as long as the debates are really about policies -- and religious values are translated into political values , articulated in ways that can be rationally debated by people who do n't share them .
The challenge is not to get religion out of politics .
It 's to get the quest for certitude out of politics .
The first step is to ask why that quest seems increasingly central to our politics today .
It 's not simply because a right - wing cabal wants to impose its religion on us .
The cabal exists , but it 's not powerful enough to shape the political scene on its own .
That power lies with millions of voters across the political spectrum .
Candidates talk about faith because they want to win votes .
Voters reward faith talk because they want candidates to offer them symbols of immutable moral order .
The root of the problem lies in the underlying insecurities of voters , in a sense of powerlessness that makes change seem so frightening , and control -- especially of others -- so necessary .
The only way to alter that condition is to transform our society so that voters will feel empowered enough to take the risks , and tolerate the freedom that democracy requires .
That would be genuine change .
It 's a political problem with a political solution .
Until that solution begins to emerge , there is no way to take the conservative symbolic message of faith talk out of American politics .

ON THE roads , at sea and in the air , mankind has invented sensible rules to avoid accidents .
In space , something like a free - for - all prevails .
On a good day , spacefaring nations observe certain understandings , such as how to launch objects safely into orbit .
On a bad day , it is celestial road rage .
A year ago , the Americans fumed when China tested a missile by shooting up one of its own weather satellites .
One thing that made the test look anti-social was that it created the worst - ever cloud of man-made debris in the heavens .
Ever since , other satellites have had to be moved periodically to avoid the shrapnel .
And bumping into things is not just a matter of collecting scratches .
At orbital speeds , colliding with an object the size of a pebble can ruin the day of a multi-billion dollar spacecraft .
There was , however , a second reason for America 's anger over the Chinese test .
America is space 's pre-eminent military power .
Or , more exactly , given that America has held back from putting weapons in space , it has used space to preserve and extend the pre-eminent military power it enjoys on earth .
By using a missile to blow apart one of their own satellites , the Chinese showed that they could if they chose blow apart the spy and navigation satellites on which America 's armed forces ( and grateful drivers everywhere using GPS systems ) depend .
Indeed , the Chinese test may have been intended to send precisely this warning .
Given the dangers of a clash in space , and the degree to which the military and civilian uses of space have blurred together ( see article ) , why have the big powers so far failed to negotiate either arms - control agreements or simple rules of the road , as they have on earth ?
In the case of arms control , the explanation is that America is suspicious .
Russia and China have offered to negotiate a treaty banning space weapons .
The Americans are not sure whether that is feasible .
How , for example , do you define what is a weapon , since any flying object can be made into one simply by bashing it into someone else 's satellite ?
Besides , the Americans fear that as top space power , with ambitious plans for anti-missile systems still in the pipeline , they would end up losing from any new treaty , while Russia and China would have to give up less .
On January 23rd a conference on disarmament is due to reopen in Geneva , but on this point it is stuck .
America says it is ready to talk in general about space security , but only if others agree to negotiate a treaty to stop production of fissile material for nuclear weapons .
Thanks to the opposition of China and Pakistan , that may not happen any time soon .
America 's reluctance to sign any arms - control agreement that might jeopardise its national security is understandable .
But its refusal even to begin to talk about a weapons ban in space has been unduly rigid .
Once negotiations started , some of its doubts about the possibility of a useful and verifiable treaty might be dispelled .
Besides , it is not at all clear that America itself would lose from the existence of such an agreement .
Since the Americans have invested most in space , it is they who could suffer more if war or accident were to fill space with clouds of debris and kill or blind their satellites .
At least write a spaceway code
In the meantime , the big spacefaring countries ought to consider negotiating some less formal rules of the road .
These would seek to stop dangerous driving , maintain safe distances and , most importantly , avoid harm to each other 's satellites .
If they co-operated on surveillance of space , such countries could also do a much better job of monitoring space debris .
America would still have the fanciest spacecraft , and could reserve its judgment on arms control .
But in heaven as it is on earth , the more eyes on the road , the safer for all .
As an extension to the JSR - 666 specification , the expert group would like to suggest the following enhancement to the Java Language Specification :
Problem :
When checking preconditions in Java code , it is very common to check whether some method argument is null , and throw an exception if it is .
There are two equally valid exceptions that may be used in this case : IllegalArgumentException and NullPointerException .
The decision to use one over the other is often the cause of holy wars , and can consume a great deal of productivity on internal mailing - lists and blogs .
Solution :
As such , we recommend the introduction of a new exception type :
throw new SchrödingerException <NullPointerException , IllegalArgumentException >( " Value should not be null . " ) ;
( The umlaut is required , in accordance with previous discussion )
SchrödingerException instances will be of indeterminate type until they are first accessed in such a way as their type must be explicitly decided one way or another .
At that point , the exception will " collapse " into one or other of the provided exception types .
It is impossible to determine if any exception is a SchrödingerException , as any attempt to examine or test its type will cause the exception identity to collapse to one of the supplied " stable " classes .
It is also impossible to influence the final type of a SchrödingerException through external interference , including reflection , JVM instrumentation or byte - code enhancement , as any too - close examination of the exception will cause it to collapse prematurely .
( Further JSR - 666 specifications : here , here , here )
The purpose of this project is to encode an image to a sound that can be viewed with a spectrogram .
For some time I have known that musical artists have encoded pictures into their music .
Most notable of these is artists is Aphex Twin .
Luckily I had a copy of Windolicker and a great visualization program Sonic Visualiser .
After looking at the images I decided it would be cool to try and encode my own images .
I saw a few programs available , but decided it would be a better challenge to write my own program from scratch using Perl .
Spectrograms
A spectrogram is a graph representing the intensity or a frequency with relation to time .
Normally the frequencies are along the Y axis , with the time on the X axis .
The intensity of the frequency is represented by the brightness of the color .
The frequency and color can use either a linear scale or a logarithmic scale .
Below is an spectrogram of a few piano chords .
The audio file used can be found on Wikipedia here .
Image encoding
The idea I had to encode the image was to simply create a sine wave at a corresponding frequency to represent the Y axis , a corresponding time to represent the X axis and a corresponding amplitude to represent the pixel color intensity .
Creating Sound
The first step to encoding an image was to learn how audio formats work .
At first I tried writing a script that plays a frequency to the ‘/ dev/dsp ’ ( Which is the sound card on Linux ) .
When writing straight to / dev/ dsp you are limited by a sample rate of 8000hz and a sample size of 8 bits .
Below simple Perl script that plays a concert A 440hz .
To execute run ‘./ sin.pl > / dev/dsp ’ .
#!/usr/bin/perl
use Math :: Trig ;
use strict ;

The DSP defaults do not offer much fidelity I needed at least the fidelity of an audio CD , which is 16 bits at 44.1 khz .
I did some of searching on CPAN to find a library that allowed me write wave files .
Most of the audio libraries had a too much overhead for what I wanted to do .
Instead I looked up the file format for a ‘. wav ’ and coded my own library .
This library is limited to only producing a 16 bit 44.1 khz mono wave .

# Get the reference to the data array my ( $ audioData ) = @_ ; # This is the default sample rate
my $ samplerate = 44100 ;
my $ bits = 16 ;
my $ samples = $ #{$audioData} + 1 ;
my $ channels = 1 ; # Do Calculations for data wave headers
my $ byterate = $ samplerate * $ channels * $ bits / 8 ;
my $ blockalign = $ channels * $ bits / 8 ;
my $ filesize = $ samples * ( $ bits / 8 ) * $ channels + 36 ; #RIFF Chunk ;
my $riff = pack ( ‘ a4Va4‘,‘RIFF ‘ , $ filesize , ‘WAVE ‘ ) ; # Format Chunk

my $ data ;
for ( my $ i=0 ; $i< $samples ;$i++ ) { $ data .= pack ( ‘v‘ , $audioData - > [ $ i ] ) ;
} # Return a byte string of the wave
return $ riff .

Reading a Bitmap
Luckily I found a simple bitmap reader on CPAN called Image : : BMP .
This is a nice lightweight library that dose not depend on any external libraries or compiled code .
Using this library I was able to easily load and read the bitmap data .
Encoding the Image
The first pass of my program disregarded the color data and only produced a frequency for the Y axis if the color intensity was less that half the sum of all colors .
Below is an example .
Note : I converted the WAV to an MP3 to conserve bandwidth , at 320 k bps not much data is lost .
Audio File : ohmpie.mp3
I was really shocked to fist see the image !
The only tweaking I needed to do was to use a linear scale for the frequency .
Also if I selected too high an amplitude for the sin wave , clipping occurred in areas with too much black .
For image above I used an amplitude of about 1000 on a scale of 0 to 32768 .
The next step was to add amplitude scaling to match the color intensity .
For this I summed all the color channels for a given pixel and scaled it to represent the max amplitude ‘( R + G + B ) / 768 * max_amplitude ’.
Below is a picture of me after using the scaling .
Audio File : evan.mp3
By selecting a color scheme that goes from black to white and using a linear scale for the volume I get a very good black and white image .
To prevent clipping on very dark images I added an inverse option that will invert the color producing a negative image .
Audo File : evanInv.mp3
You can reverse the color scheme to go from white to black to produce the regular image

Below you can view and / or download the full code to this program .
Currently performance is not optimized .
So do n’t write me telling me its slow .
I currently have a few idea to speed it up .
Also for best results use a small image around 100 px tall .

WHERE WAS THE BEST PLACE to invest in 2007 ?
If you had picked emerging markets a year ago , you 'd have been rewarded with a 33.55 % return , by Morgan Stanley Capital International Indices ' reckoning .
And if you were keeping score in dollars , which after all is what really counts to most Barron 's Online readers , you netted 39.78 % .
( Thanks to Bianco Research for gathering these data . )
But that paled next to 2007 's top bourse : The Zimbabwe Stock Exchange , which gained 322,111 % .
Jot that down if you 're looking to win a bar bet .
Yet that gain is far less spectacular than it seems .
Inflation was estimated by the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe at 24,059 % last year , so the real gains in stock prices were far less than the nominal numbers indicate .
And that inflation estimate is just that .
With goods disappearing from store shelves in the hyperinflation , Zimbabwe 's Central Statistical Office stopped provided inflation data in September because it had no prices to go on .
Independent economists estimate inflation is running at 50,000 % to 100,000 % , according to local press reports .
That would compare with the 32,400 % inflation rate in Weinmar Germany in 1923 .
Yet it is not only inhabitants of madman Mugabe 's hell on earth who suffer from this money illusion .
Americans similarly delude themselves that they are realizing gains when prices rise in terms of devalued dollars .
For instance , the New York press Wednesday trumpeted continued gains in the local property market .
" Apartment Prices in Manhattan Defy National Real Estate Slide , " the New York Times asserted .
The average price of a Manhattan apartment rose to $ 1.4 million in the fourth quarter , up 17.6 % from a year earlier , according to broker Prudential Douglas Elliman .
But those gains are illusory as the stock market 's in Zimbabwe .
Reports the New York Sun , even as the dollar price of Gotham flats has soared , the value of an average Manhattan apartment has plunged nearly 39 % over the past six years in terms of real money -- that is , gold .
In other words , it is n't that the apartments are gaining value so much as the dollar is losing value .
The decline in the real value of Manhattan real estate is attracting buyers from abroad who see what their $ 1.47 euros and $ 1.99 pounds can buy in the Big Apple .
Brokers report foreigners have been big buyers of new luxury units , such as the former Plaza Hotel , which has been converted to apartments , and on Central Park West .
But it is n't just Manhattan real estate prices that have been distorted by the dollar 's decline relative to gold .
The ascent in crude oil to the $ 100 a barrel level has captured the media 's fascination , as if that round number had more significance than $ 98 or $ 99 .
But is oil actually rising ?
Long - time gold bug James
Turk writes on goldmoney.com that , in terms of gold , crude oil prices have been relatively stable since 2000 , even as they have more than tripled in dollar terms and more than doubled when measured in euros .
So , is crude gaining value or are paper currencies losing value ?
Finally , there 's the stock market .
Since last July , the Dow Jones Industrial Average has plunged 28 % in gold terms -- a bear market by any definition .
While the DJIA is off about 7 % from its peak around 14,000 , it 's down four times as much in real money .
In gold terms , the Dow has fallen to the value of about 15.25 ounces of gold from 21.25 ounces in July 2007 .
But since July 1999 , when it took 44 ounces of gold to " buy " the Dow near the peak of the dot - com bubble , the Blue Chip Average has lost almost two - thirds of its value in terms of gold .
At the other end of that extreme , when gold hit its previous record of $ 850 an ounce in January 1980 , it only took a single ounce of the metal to buy the Dow at 834 , with change to spare .
At that time , gold was overvalued and stocks were undervalued .
Now , the situation is different .
Prices of things such as crude oil , Manhattan real estate and , until recently , U.S. common stocks have been rising in direct proportion to the loss of paper currencies ' value in gold .
In Zimbabwe , it 's well recognized that the rise in stock prices represents a flight to an asset that appreciates in direct proportion to the loss in the purchasing power of the currency .
Americans should learn from Zimbabweans .

Families are fleeing to the UK from Germany to escape a law introduced by Hitler that could lead to their children being taken into care if educated at home .
One father , who arrived in Britain with his wife and five children last month , has told The Observer that his family had no choice after being warned that their children would be taken into foster care unless they enrolled them at local schools .
Another , who fled in October , said he believed the 70 - year - old law was creating hundreds of refugees and forcing families into hiding to protect their children .
Home - schooling has been illegal in Germany since it was outlawed in 1938 .
Hitler wanted the Nazi state to have complete control of young minds .
Today there are rare exemptions , such as for children suffering serious illnesses or psychological problems .
Legal attempts through the courts – including the European Court of Human Rights – have so far failed to overturn the ban .
Klaus Landahl , 41 , who moved in January from the Black Forest in Germany to the Isle of Wight with his wife , Kathrin , 39 , said they had no option but to leave their home , friends and belongings in order to educate their five children , aged between three and 12 , legally and without fear .
‘ It feels like persecution , ’ he said .
‘ We had to get to safety to protect our family .
We can never go back .
If we do , our children will be removed , as the German government says they are the property of the state now . ’

While this discovery is familiar to readers of my blog , what might be a surprise is what this heralds for our society politically and economically .
It is n't socialism , or even communism , as I had feared .
It 's feudalism .
It 's not 2007 .
It 's 1066 .
Taking Iraq and President Bush as starting points , and examining the defense mechanisms we use to cope with both , yields the unsurprising conclusion that we are a society of narcissists .
It 's sometimes easier to evaluate one 's personality , and thus make predictions about it , by examining the defense mechanisms the person uses .
In difficult situations , specific people will use a small set of specific defenses over and over ; so much so that we often describe people exclusively by that defense , e.g. " she 's passive aggressive . "
But I do know something about our collective response to the Iraq war , to the Bush presidency , and to our times , and it says a lot about our cultural psychology .
And it helps predict the future .
Splitting
Splitting -- reducing the other person to a binary abstraction of all good or all bad , is a primitive , or regressive , defense mechanism used when the emotional level and complexity is greater than a person 's capacity to interpret it .
For example , once your boyfriend cheats on you , he becomes a jerk , completely .
Even things he had done that were good -- like give money to the poor -- are reinterpreted in this light ( " he only did that to get people to like him . " )
Who splits ?
Someone with a lot of unfocused rage and frustration , i.e. the " primitive " emotions .
Currently , our social psyche has three main targets of splitting : President Bush , terrorists , and liberals .
Depending on your political bent , two of those are often conflated .
Splitting says : Bush is all bad , period .
Nothing he does is good , and if it is good , it is from some malicious of selfish motivation , or an accident related to his incompetence to even be self - serving .
Similarly on the other side , liberals are weak , corruptible , treasonous .
Splitting is always polar ; once something is declared " all bad , " an opposite is necessarily declared all good .
Importantly , this is n't a comparison between the two -- he is bad , but she is better ; it 's perceived to be two independent , unconnected , assessments , even though to anyone else looking from the outside , they are so obviously linked .
So hatred of , say , liberals is thought to be independent of your preference for Bush , but in reality it is only because you hate liberals that you like Bush .
The hate comes first .
And this splitting makes it nearly impossible to acknowledge any of Bush 's faults .
It is a fair guess that many people voted for either Bush or Kerry not because they liked their candidate , but because they hated the other candidate .
This is the important part : that made them think that they liked their own candidate objectively .
Not , " Kerry is better than Bush , " but " Kerry is a great candidate . "
Period .
That 's the illusion of splitting .
( Further evidence of the relatedness of splitting : once it 's gone , it 's gone .
Anyone voting for Kerry in 2008 ? )
But splitting is rarely about the target , it 's a convenient heuristic to get the subject out of having to accept the complexity and totality of the other , and of their own emotions about their environment .
In short , when things get heavy , it 's easier to just label black and white and work from there .
Splitting is the reaction to intense anger and frustration in those people who discover themselves to be powerless .
Inherent in the act of splitting is apathy .
You do n't try to find a solution to the problem person , the split is the solution .
It allows you not to have to deal with the other , because you 've decided that the other is irredeemable .
Our apathy is everywhere .
There 's a war on , and , except for the TV news , you 'd never know it .
No one talks about it ( except in brief , obvious , " knowing " soundbites , cribbed from the Daily Show . )
No one protests .
The emotional focus is on Bush , not on a solution to the war , or anything else .
Here 's an example :
If , in the midst of no -liquids - on - airplanes Orange Alert , Cho was able to kill 30 students at Virginia Tech using two Glocks , how many students could a band of better armed jihadists kill ?
A quick back - of - the - envelope calculation provides a reasonable estimate : all of them .
We 're not ready , but , more importantly , we are not trying to be ready .
Not because we do n't think it could happen , in fact we 're all pretty sure it is going to happen -- but because our entire emotional energy is diverted to the " all bad " other , be it Bush , liberals , or terrorists .
" Terrorists -- but I thought you just said ...? "
Yes , because that 's what splitting is , emotion directed at an abstraction of someone .
We may hate " terrorists , " just not those 6 terrorists right there .
Real terrorists pass under our noses without even a sneer .
Can anyone name one , just one , of the NJ terrorists alleged to have been planning an attack on Ft. Dix ?
We 're too busy hating terrorists .
The problem was n't that people thought Saddam helped the 9/11 hijackers ; the problem is that no one can name any of the 9/11 hijackers .
That would require work , emotional commitment , an understanding of the complexity of the Other .
Much easier to say , " Saddam is evil ... "
Bush is fascist and stupid , and that 's it .
Case closed .
Now who wants pizza ?
Projection ( scapegoating ) and some Displacement :
Placing all the blame on Bush gets us out of the hard work of introspection : why did they attack us in the first place ?
What do we do when Bush leaves ?
What should we do now ?
Blaming Bush for being an incompetent anti-Muslim warmonger purposely avoids the question of why 50 % of the country was in favor of the invasion of Iraq .
And some of the dissenters were against it only because they thought the costs were too high .
Bush did n't attack Iraq : we all did .
Right or wrong , we have been headed for a military clash with the Middle East for at least 34 years .
And we are on schedule to have another in two or three years .
Are we going to ask why that is , or are we going to look to CNN for an analysis of the Gulf of Tonkin ?
Scapegoating also legitimizes apathy -- we can start 2009 fresh .
" Sorry world -- it was n't us , it was Bush . "
The trouble is , only our allies believe this .
The scapegoating is really a defense ; those beliefs and emotions we attribute to that " cowboy Bush " are really our own .
Ask our enemies , who are certain that it 's America that 's the problem , not just Bush , because our enemies have a larger historical view .
Last time Iran challenged us was Carter .
Was he a Halliburton warmonger ?
Did China / Korea prefer Truman ?
Putin wants Reagan back ?
There is n't really an easier way to say this : that cavalier , simplistic attitude towards history ; myopic beliefs which bypass logic or reason , supported only by intuition and faith ; and a hatred of others who have a radically different perspective on humanity -- that 's not Bush , that 's us .
I 'm not even saying this perspective does n't have some merit ; but know thyself , yo .
Most of our enemies share a common social philosophy that , at its core , is psychic : do n't trust any country where women are regularly more powerful than men ; where individuals are more important than a collective ; and where personal beliefs and freedoms trump historical identity .
Because that means that its men are weak , its individuals are selfish , and they can not be trusted to act in the long term interests of their own people .
Rather than responding seriously to this insane worldview , with equal fervor -- and it's so easy to do it -- the country has instead chosen to release this press statement : " Bush lied . "
Denial :
Since it 's all Bush 's fault , there is n't actually any underlying problem to deal with .
A football analogy is perfect : once you know your team is n't going to the Superbowl , the mindset and the focus changes to next season 's draft , even while the current season is still on .
No more sadness , no more heartache .
Focus on the future frees you from the pain of the present ( though you pay lip service to it with inanities ( " if the Colts are going to make it next year , they 're going to have to run the ball and put some points on the board . " ) )
Meanwhile , you 're still losing this season .
We simply hold our collective breath and wait for 2008 , when the " problem " ( Bush ) will go away .
Trouble is , the rest of the world is n't waiting , and the real problem is n't going away , it 's going to get much worse .
One might make the argument that the only reason we have n't been attacked again is that everyone " knows " Bush is " insane " and would invade them .
Whatever .
Point is , we are in denial about much larger political problems than George Bush .
I 'm only using terrorism as a convenient example , though larger political realities are in play .
Chavez , Hu Jintao , Putin -- they 're not reacting to Bush , they are preparing for his departure .
" If only Al Gore had won ... "
Then what ?
Here 's an example I fear no one will understand .
The Iranians took 15 British soldiers hostage .
I do n't know what constitutes an act of war , but I figure this is pretty much it .
The soldiers surrendered without a fight ( ironically , so as not to start an international incident ) , and then pretended to go along with the Iranians .
They did the song and dance " we are bad , we are imperialists , Ahmadinejad is good , we 're sorry , thanks for being so nice to us " and were eventually released .
So I 'm sure those soldiers were thinking , " look , I know who I am , I know I 'm not a coward , I 'm not helping the Iranians , but I have to do whatever is necessary to get out of this mess . "
What they are saying is that they can declare who they are , and what they do has no impact on it .
" I am a hero , regardless of how I act . "
That 's the narcissist fallacy .
Whatever they may think about themselves , the fact is that they did help the Iranians , and they are not heroes .
But I can see that it is ego protective , I can see why they might take this perspective .
There are few things in life worse than being taken hostage by the Iranians , so I understand why they would choose this type of self - deception , why they would turn to narcissism for defense .
Bottom line is , I guess you can't fault them for playing along .
But here 's the thing : when they returned home to Britain , they were heralded as heroes by other people .
Including the British government .
Based on what ?
They did n't actually do anything ; heroism is n't simply living through a bad experience .
Well , of course : based on the fact that they are heroes who had to pretend to be something else .
That 's the narcissist 's tautology : you are what you say you are because you said you are .
What makes it an example of our collective narcissism is that we agree -- we want it to be true that they , and we , can declare an identity .
This is further evidenced by the British public 's outrage -- not that they were being called heroes , but that they were allowed to sell their stories to the media .
Not that they received false honor -- who cares about that nowadays ?-- but that they received legitimate money .
Here 's the part Americans can't get : why would Iran put them on TV when everyone is going to know it was forced ?
Unless you are saying that the Iranians , and only the Iranians , are so completely delusional that they actually believe the servicemen were thankful and apologetic , then this show had to appeal to some broader audience .
Other people had to believe this was the real thing .
Is it possible -- and I 'm just asking here -- that we are the only ones who do n't believe these statements were meaningful ?
In other words , is it possible that our enemies judge us by our actions , regardless of intent -- and if you support Ahmadenijad on TV , then that counts -- while we retreat into the narcissists ' hideout of identity - as - declared , where any actions can be disavowed as " not who we are ? "
Reaction Formation : Sorry , Everybody ; We 're Closed
Reaction formation is an ego defense against id ; when you want something that violates your identity , you shift violently to the opposite .
The secretly gay man who is loudly anti-gay .
It 's " going overboard . "
Have the interventionist Bush years taught us that we need to be more involved with the world , and work with our allies and enemies to reach a common ground ?
No : it 's that everyone else is nuts , and the less direct contact we have with them , the better .
I find it fascinating that the key lament against Bush is not ideological , but " realist . "
You might think that women 's rights , civil wars , and pending genocides might be the pet issues of the Left , but increasingly Americans -- right and left -- feel that many people are simply not worth saving .
That certain people are n't ready for democracy .
Women 's rights , while ideal , can only come after " they " ( it 's always they ) make some necessary preliminary steps .
And that , no matter what , it 's never worth a ground assault if they do n't really want us involved .
Not even on principle .
Genocide in Darfur ?
Forget about sending troops to Darfur -- we do n't even want to talk about Darfur .
Any of the candidates mention Darfur ?
It 's only used as a comparator : since we have n't / should n't send troops to Darfur where things are worse , we should n't have sent them to Iraq .
Isolationism is the easy defense because we can pretend no one hates us .
Good luck with that .
No More Foreign Adventures
What are the political ramifications of this defensive posture ?
Here 's an example : what happens if we are ever attacked again ?
It puts the nuclear option higher on the list of responses .
Maybe not at the top , sure , but no way will we tolerate the costs of invading another country , no matter how well planned .
The nuclear weapons are no longer the last resort .
Think about this .
Count Up Your Defenses : We 're Narcissists
The primary sustenance of narcissism is control .
Why did the gods punish Prometheus ?
It was n't just stealing fire : " I gave humans the illusion they were n't doomed . "
You think you 're in control of your destiny , because you can smoke cigarettes .
Well , you 're not .
Narcissism is identification without identity .
It 's making something up and then fighting to the death to maintain it .
It 's " the zeal of a convert . "
It 's not really you , but boy oh boy do n't let anyone tell you that .
You 'll sacrifice anything -- happiness , money , comfort -- in order to maintain control , to get people to think you are who you say you are .
All that matters is people see you how you want to be seen -- even if you 're really something else .
There are three ways to protect an empty identity : violence , power , and money .
Enter Feudalism
Lord , vassal and fief .
The lord owns the capital ; the vassal gets to use it , and profit from it , but he does n't actually own it -- the " it " being the fief .
In return for the profits , the vassal agrees to fight for the lord .
How does a man get his woman to act the way he wants , dress the way he wants , be the way he wants -- so that he can be seen the way he wants ?
He allows her to live in his world and profit from the splendor of it in exchange for her allegiance and deference .
What if his world actually sucks ?
Then he just beats her .
What do we want , now ?
Identity - products .
Things which signal to others who we want to be .
IPod , Aeropostale , blogs .
" This is me . "
We want brands .
Coke vs. Pepsi may not be relevant , but you can start a civil war by saying " Apple sucks , Microsoft is way better . "
You do n't realize it , but blindly identifying yourself with externalities negates your significance in the world .
You 're not a person , you 're a block .
I do n't know you , but I know if you own a Mac , you voted for Kerry .
Guess what ?
That means that Apple carries a lot of power with Kerry .
But you do n't , not once you fell into this branded trap .
The joke is that Halliburton controls the government .
What saves this from actually being true is that Halliburton is a public company -- anyone can buy into it .
Even if they did control the government , you control them -- it nets out .
And if you do n't like the way they do business ( or if you do , ) the shareholders , or at least the biggest shareholders , can do something about it .
But if Halliburton were not public , then all that power would be concentrated in the owners .
You could work for Halliburton and profit that way , but you do n't share any of the power .
But now things are different .
Not since the 1980s , and before that never , has there been this much M&A activity , share buybacks and privatization .
While this boosts share prices in the short term , as privateers bid up the price in a takeover , there 's a huge downstream cost : the company is no longer public .
You do n't get to profit from it unless you work for it .
Each privatized company , or the private equity firm who owns it , becomes a little lord .
You want money ?
They demand your service .
It is the opposite of owning a stock , where you demand their service .
It 's more than just a concentration of wealth among the few .
It is also a concentration of control , and , more importantly , risk .
You may not be able to profit from it , but if something goes bad , for sure you 'll be asked to pay for it .
If you think Halliburton is unaccountable to the public now , imagine when it goes private .
And it will go private .
Furthermore , as these companies become ( more ) multinational -- as they derive less of their profits from the fertile soil of the U.S. economy , they will be less beholden to its government .
In fact , they will have more control over the government .
I think it 's stupendous that there is an individual campaign contributions limit of $ 2000 , equalizing the effect among rich and poor .
But this actually promotes feudalism : instead of rich donors buying some access to a future official , several rich donors get together to form a PAC to influence your vote .
That gets them much more power than they had as individuals .
In effect , they become the lord , and the candidate the vassal .
And your $ 2000 vote is next to worthless .
I wo n't be the last to make this universally horrifying observation : if Hillary Clinton wins the 2008 election , then an entire generation of people -- 24 years -- will have been ruled by either a Bush or a Clinton .
Why do we keep picking them ?
Because they 're the best ?
No -- because they 're a brand .
That saves us from thinking .
And , conveniently , it gives us a scapegoat : the system is stacked against us , for them .
Feudal .
Remember , the defining emotion in narcissism is rage , frustration .
Collective narcissism comes from collective rage , frustration .
So Marx was wrong ( yes , again . )
Feudalism does n't precede capitalism , it follows inevitably , logically , after capitalism -- if something , anything -- goes wrong .
In capitalism , not everyone succeeds , but everyone feels like they could .
In a working capitalist model , class divisions would be fluid , people could go up and down based on their intelligence or work ethic .
The mail boy could become the CEO .
But if the classes become fixed , such that a mail boy could never become CEO -- only other CEOs can become CEO -- you get , well , feudalism .
When that happens -- when your future is limited , the tendency is to withdraw , get control over your local environment ( family , friends , blogs , etc ) and create an identity where you do have value above mail boy , even though in reality you are the mail boy .
You get angry , frustrated , resentful -- at " them , " the people who have more power than you .
Here 's an example .
On Thursday 5/10 I was listening to NPR , and the NPR interviewer said , oil companies are making huge profits , should n't they have to eat into those profits to lower the price ?
And the interviewee responded that he'd prefer the prices to be higher , or even there to be a tax , which would result in less gas consumed , which would be better for the environment , etc .
And the NPR interviewer responded something like , and I 'm quoting from memory , " so if you need to hit them [ oil companies ] in the pocket , reduced demand would be another way of doing it . "
Wow .
WOW .
The psychological pivot point for her was n't lower prices for the consumer , but hurting the oil companies .
That 's where her head was at .
And she 's a reporter !
You see that anger , resentment , that powerlessness , disenfranchisement not in working capitalism , but in feudalism .
There 's a hint of feudalism in the air already ; universal healthcare , better , broader social security -- this is the lord taking responsibility for the economic well being of its people , in exchange for " service . "
It 's not socialism because there is n't a redistribution of wealth -- the wealth and power are actually more concentrated -- it 's a lease of wealth .
We are much more interested in how we will brand ourselves than in what we will do .
We 'll sell out our votes , our safety , our liberties and general freedoms in exchange for a safe , mostly hands - off environment where we are free to pretend to be someone .
Yes to isolationism .
Yes to expediency , yes to individualism .
Just give me a little space .
And do n't tell me what I can and can't wear .
My clothes are who I am .
It 's not a clash of ideas , USSR vs. US ; it 's more visceral , personal .
People hate us for us , we hate Bush for Bush , there 's plenty of hate all around , so we retreat inside ourselves and our denial .
We 're leveraging the future for short term control of our micro-environments , selling ourselves in exchange for a 25 year lease .
We want to be renters , not owners , so we do n't have to fix the toilet .

Ultra-Orthodox Jews protest in Jerusalem
Shlomo Benizri , of the ultra-Orthodox Jewish Shas Party , said the tremors had been caused by lawmaking that gave " legitimacy to sodomy " .
Israel decriminalised homosexuality in 1988 and has since passed several laws recognising gay rights .
Two earthquakes shook the region last week and a further four struck in November and December .
Adoption
Mr Benizri made his comments while addressing a committee of the Israeli parliament , or Knesset , about the country 's readiness for earthquakes .
He called on lawmakers to stop " passing legislation on how to encourage homosexual activity in the state of Israel , which anyway brings about earthquakes " .
Israeli court rulings in recent years have granted inheritance rights to gay couples and recognised same - sex marriages performed abroad .
Last week , Israel 's attorney general ruled same - sex couples could adopt .

The two countries also signed a deal to develop peaceful nuclear energy during a visit by President Nicolas Sarkozy .

The Emirates ' WAM news agency said that an agreement would " boost relations between the two friendly countries through military cooperation " .
Further details about the agreement were not immediately available .
Correspondents say the base will give France new ability to project its forces into a strategic oil - producing region .
The Gulf lives with chronic tension between the six Sunni Arab - led states on the Arabian peninsula , all strong US allies , on the one hand and America 's arch - foe Iran , which is Shia Muslim .

CBS confirms 2006 Raw Story scoop : Plame 's job was to keep nukes from Iran Muriel Kane and Dave Edwards
Published : Saturday October 20 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This CBS News has confirmed , in advance of a 60 Minutes interview with outed CIA agent Valerie Plame to be run this Sunday , that Plame " was involved in operations to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons . "
" Our mission was to make sure that the bad guys , basically , did not get nuclear weapons , " Plame told 60 Minutes .
Plame also indicated that her outing in 2003 had caused grave damage to CIA operations , saying , " All the intelligence services in the world were running my name through their databases " to see where she had gone and who she had met with .
RAW STORY first revealed Plame 's Iran mission and the damage done to CIA operations by her outing in a February 13 , 2006 story by Raw investigative editor Larisa Alexandrovna , titled " Outed CIA officer was working on Iran , intelligence sources say . "
In that article , Alexandrovna wrote : According to current and former intelligence officials , Plame Wilson , who worked on the clandestine side of the CIA in the Directorate of Operations as a non-official cover ( NOC ) officer , was part of an operation tracking distribution and acquisition of weapons of mass destruction technology to and from Iran .
Speaking under strict confidentiality , intelligence officials revealed heretofore unreported elements of Plame 's work .
Their accounts suggest that Plame 's outing was more serious than has previously been reported and carries grave implications for U.S. national security and its ability to monitor Iran 's burgeoning nuclear program .
...
Intelligence sources would not identify the specifics of Plame 's work .
They did , however , tell RAW STORY that her outing resulted in " severe " damage to her team and significantly hampered the CIA 's ability to monitor nuclear proliferation .
...
Three intelligence officers confirmed that other CIA non-official cover officers were compromised , but did not indicate the number of people operating under non-official cover that were affected or the way in which these individuals were impaired .
None of the sources would say whether there were American or foreign casualties as a result of the leak .
A few months following Alexandrovna 's groundbreaking revelations , MSNBC 's David Shuster reported that he had also been told by his own sources of Plame 's involvement in an Iran operation and the damage done by her outing .
CBS states further that Plame " was involved in one highly classified mission to deliver fake nuclear weapons blueprints to Tehran .
It was called Operation Merlin , and it was first revealed in a book by investigative reporter James Risen . "
Risen 's book , State of War : The Secret History of the CIA and the Bush Administration , was published in October 2006 , eight months after Alexandrovna 's initial reporting .
Risen discussed Project Merlin in the book but did not mention that Plame had been part of it .
Reached on Saturday morning , Alexandrovna said she had known of Project Merlin when she wrote her 2006 article but was not allowed to discuss the operation , as per her agreement with sources , just the country involved .
" I cannot confirm or deny that Plame was connected with Project Merlin , only that I was aware of it , " Alexandrovna told Raw .
The following video is from CBS 's Evening News , broadcast on October 19 , 2007 .

Atheist sees image of Big Bang in piece of toast
For Immediate Release : Miracle Toast ?
Breaking news : Trump Policy Book
( ACPA - London ) Excitement is growing in the Northern England town of Huddersfield following news that local atheist Donald Chapman saw an image of the Big - Bang in a piece of toast .
In an exclusive interview with " The Huddersfield Express " Chapman , 36 , explained that he was sitting down to eat breakfast when an unusual toast pattern caught his eye .
" I was just about to spread the butter when I noticed a small hole in the middle of the bread surrounded by a burnt black ring , " said Chapman .
" Then the direction and splatter pattern of the crumbs caught my eye - they were flowing outward from the center of the black hole and their shades were changing as distance from the center grew .
A perfect match to the non-linear patterns that followed the Big - Bang .
It 's the beginning of the world - right there in my breakfast ! "
Ever since news of the discovery made national headlines , local hoteliers have been overwhelmed by an influx of atheists from all over the country who have flocked to Huddersfield to catch a glimpse of the scientific relic .
" I have always been an Atheist and to see my unbelief validated on a piece of toast is truly astounding , " exclaimed one guest at the Huddersfield Arms hotel .
To the surprise of many , the UK Atheist Association has asked its members to ignore the story despite its potential to inspire less faith .
" Given what the religious believe already , this is an easy sell , " complained one disgruntled activist who said he was going to Huddersfield anyway noting that " Seeing is not believing . "

This movie practically shaped my teenage years .

Stop thinking Prague police and start thinking Sony Playstation ! ”
45 . Rambo
Hey , another movie about an unstable Vietnam war vet who goes crazy !

Best line in the movie : “ No. * I * am your father . ”
52 . Fast And The Furious
An undercover cop , a gang of thieves , fast cars and loose women is a combination for greatness .

At all .

A former footballing legend goes to prison and has to train up a team of con ’s to play football against the prison guards .
The genre has been done before with The Longest Yard , but this film is about proper football which instantly makes it better than any Yank movie .
Best parts for me are Jason Statham as the psycho goalie , and Danny Dyer as the idiot who gets picked on constantly !
Best line in the movie : Bob : “ He must be ambidextrous , Bob . ” Bob : “ I do n’t know about that , Bob .
But he certainly can use both feet . ”
60 . Gone In 60 Seconds
There is n’t much more manly ( and completely illegal , kids ) than stealing cars .
Now if you ever get into the position to steal a car while getting friendly with Angelina Jolie – I ’d advise you to take your opportunity !
Best line in the movie : “ Having sex or boosting cars …
Um , oo !
Uh .
How about having sex WHILE boosting cars ? ”
61 . Barb Wire ( the opening sequence only )
This movie is on the list for one reason and one reason only ( okay , you got me , there are two big reasons ) .
Pamela Anderson ’s breasts .
Watch the opening sequence with intensity and then watch something else .
The film is terrible .
Her breasts are not .
Best line in the movie : “ Do n’t call me babe . ”
62 . Road House
Awesome movie starring Swayze as a bouncer hired to sort out a rough bar .
Things get heated with the local bad guy and you can guess the rest .
The kicker for me was when Swayze ripped a guys throat out .
Literally .
Best line in the movie : “ I want you to be nice until it ’s time to not be nice . ”
63 . Cocktail
In a nutshell , this film is about Tom Cruise flinging bottles of vodka and stuff up in the air and catching it .
Do n’t try it at home though , it ’s not as easy as it looks .
After getting through $ 200 worth of Smirnoff bottles , I should know !
Best line in the movie : “ You wait till you ’ve given them crabs .
Then you ’ll really know hatred . ”

A rom-zom - com from the inspired mind of Simon Pegg .
This is a story of a man who decided to change his life by winning back his ex , sorting out his relationship with his mum and step - dad and trying to deal with a community of living dead zombies !
Best line in the movie : “ Who died and made you fucking king of the zombies ? “

His hands ca n’t hit what his eyes ca n’t see . ”
69 .
Hackers
Another movie for the geeks out there !
Jonny Lee Miller makes being a hacker quite cool .
Remember all those e-mail addresses and screen names back when this movie came out ?
Zero Cool and Crash Override etc .
This movie is worth it for the simple fact that Angelina Jolie whips her kit off !
Best line in the movie : “ God gave men brains larger than dogs ’ so they would n’t hump women ’s legs at cocktail parties . ”

Best line in the movie : “ I ’m just a cook . ”
73 . Old School
Luke Wilson , Vince Vaughn and Will Ferrell are three middle - aged men looking to recapture their youth by starting their own fraternity .
As the movie strapline says ; all the fun of college , none of the education .
Best line in the movie : “ You tell anyone about this and I ’ll fucking kill you .
I ’m kidding , I ’m kidding , we ’ll have him home by midnight . ”
74 . Unforgiven
A retired gunslinger from the Old West takes on one last job when a bounty is put on a gang of cowboys who murdered a prostitute .
An amazing portrayal of the fine line between being a hero and being a villain .
The fact this film won 4 Oscars proves it ’s worth the watch !
Best line in the movie : “ It ’s a hell of a thing , killing a man .
Take away all he ’s got and all he ’s ever gonna have . ”
75 . Young Guns

Good and evil swap faces in this flick with both Travolta and Cage delivering sterling performances .
Keep your eyes peeled for a young Dominique Swain before she ..err.. matured !
Best line in the movie : “ Well , I ’ve gotta go .
I ’ve got a government job to abuse , and a lonely wife to fuck . ”
81 . Death Sentence

Best line in the movie : “ Look at you .
You look like one of us .
Look what I made you become . ”
82 . Broken Arrow

This time he ’s stealing nuclear warheads from the US Military and Christian Slater is the only bloke that can stop him !
Best line in the movie : “ I say god - damn what a rush ! ”
83 . Batman Begins
This is a much darker portrayal of Batman and how Bruce Wayne came to find his alter - ego .
Christian Bale is an awesome actor and plays the role fantastically .

Best line in the movie : “ It ’s not who I am underneath , but what I * do* that defines me . ”
84 . Payback

Luckily , he survives and plots his payback against the two for betraying him .

Seventy grand .
That ’s what they took from me .
And that ’s what I was going to get back . ”
85 . American Psycho
I love this movie !
Patrick Bateman is an investment banker with some seriously psychopathic problems !
Every line in the movie is quoteworthy and I ’d go as far as to say this is in my top 5 movies of all time !
Best line in the movie : “ There is an idea of a Patrick Bateman ; some kind of abstraction .
But there is no real me : only an entity , something illusory .
And though I can hide my cold gaze , and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping yours and maybe you can even sense our lifestyles are probably comparable …
I simply am not there . ”
86 . 300
A small Spartan army of 300 men led by King Leonidas leave to fight the Persians at Thermopylae in 480 B.C.
Awesome fight scenes and effects and the King is played so well by Gerard Butler than men the world over wanted to look as butch and manly as he does ( then he went and ruined it all by doing P.S. I Love You ) !
Best line in the movie : “ Spartans !
Ready your breakfast and eat hearty …
For tonight , we dine in hell !
87 . Sin City
A film with an all - star cast that explores the dark and miserable town Basin City and tells the story of three different people , all caught up in the violent corruption of the city .
When a film is based on the graphic novels of Frank Miller , you know it ’s going to be good .
The highlight for me is Jessica Alba writhing up and down a pole .
The film is really great too , though !
Best line in the movie : “ I love hitmen .
No matter what you do to them , you do n’t feel bad . ”
88 . Lucky Number Slevin
A slick gangster flick about a chap called Slevin who gets mistaken for his friend who owes money to two powerful crime bosses .
Unlucky , I hear you cry !
He must pay his friends debt and with many twists and turns along the way , it ’s one hell of a movie .

Really manly stuff , I ’m sure you ’ll agree !
Best line in the movie : “ Just listen .
With your mind , your heart , your whole being . ”
90 . The Wedding Crashers
I ’ve always wanted to crash a wedding and live it up like Vince and Owen !
Somehow , I do n’t think it would work in real life .
Nevertheless , this movie is great and there is some fabulous gratuitous boobage at the beginning to get the party started !
Best line in the movie : “ Janice , I apologize to you if I do n’t seem real eager to jump into a forced awkward intimate situation that people like to call dating .
I do n’t like the feeling .
You ’re sitting there , you ’re wondering do I have food on my face , am I eating , am I talking too much , are they talking enough , am I interested I ’m not really interested , should I play like I ’m interested but I ’m not that interested but I think she might be interested but do I want to be interested but now she ’s not interested ?
So all of the sudden I ’m getting , I ’m starting to get interested …
And when am I supposed to kiss her ?
Do I have to wait for the door cause then it ’s awkward , it ’s like well goodnight .
Do you do like that ass - out hug ?
Where you like , you hug each other like this and your ass sticks out cause you ’re trying not to get too close or do you just go right in and kiss them on the lips or do n’t kiss them at all ?
It ’s very difficult trying to read the situation .
And all the while you ’re just really wondering are we gonna get hopped up enough to make some bad decisions ?
Perhaps play a little game called “ just the tip ” .
Just for a second , just to see how it feels .
Or , ouch , ouch you ’re on my hair . ”
91 . Black Hawk Down
A group of elite U.S. soldiers drop into Somalia to capture two top lieutenants of a renegade warlord and find themselves engaging in battle with a large force of heavily - armed Somalis .
This is a war film at it ’s best , gents !
Best line in the movie : “ Nobody asks to be a hero , it just sometimes turns out that way . ”
92 . Shanghai Knights
Bit of an odd one , this movie .
Sometimes we men just need to laugh and have some wholesome entertainment .
Jackie Chan gives us the action , and Owen Wilson gives us the laughs .
It ’s a perfect combination .
Best line in the movie : “ Easy fellas , you lost one war this way , do n’t make the same mistake twice . “
93 . Enemy At The Gates
Any guy who has ever played Call Of Duty will have heard about the Battle of Stalingrad .
In this flick , legendary sniper Vassili Zaitsev plays a game of cat and mouse with a German sniper during said Battle of Stalingrad .

I do n’t stand a chance against this man . ”

Explosions , disguises and double crossing ensues before we find out who was behind the whole damn thing !
Best line in the movie : “ Kittridge , you ’ve never seen me very upset . ”
95 . Hostel
Okay , okay .
So it was n’t the best movie I ever saw , however it is quite gory and any guy thinking of traveling the world for any length of time should watch this film before they book into that hostel in Slovakia !
Best line in the movie : “ I hope bestiality is legal in Amsterdam , because that girl ’s a fuckin’ hog . ”
96 . Lock , Stock and Two Smoking Barrels

Come up with a plan to nick the money from their next door neighbours : a gang of hardcase drug dealers .
Best line in the movie : “ We grow copious amounts of ganja here , and you ’re carrying a wasted girl and a bag of fertilizer .
You do n’t look like your average horti- fucking - culturalist . ”
97 . Transporter
His job is to deliver the package ; no questions asked .
Curiousity killed the cat , as they say , and so he opened ( and subsequently had sex with ) the package .
The naughty boy .
Best line in the movie : “ You ’re always complaining , except when we make love .
Then you say nothing . “
98 . Crank
Another adrenaline fulled action - fest starring Jason Statham .
This time he ’s a drug dealer by the name of Chev who has been injected with a poison that will kill him if his heart rate drops .
Sex , drugs , violence and electric shock treatment are the only things keeping him alive long enough to find out who ’s behind it and seek his revenge before the poison kills him .
It ’s a bloke movie !
He also has sex with Amy Smart right in the middle of the street .
Something I ’m sure a lot of guys would love to do !
Best line in the movie : “ Yea , yeah , you ’re gonna rape my grandmother , then you ’re gonna do her in , blah , blah , fucking blah ! ”
99 .
Blow
Johnny Depp stars in a true story about the drug dealer George Jung who established the American cocaine market in the 70’s .
Best line in the movie : “ Danbury was n’t a prison , it was a crime school .

100 . The Money Train
Wesley Snipes and Woody Harrelson team up in a plot to rob a train carrying a great deal of money to pay off Woody ’s gambling debts with some very bad people !
Look out for Jennifer Lopez getting all naked and sweaty too !
Best line in the movie : John : “ No , you ai n’t gonna hit him . ”
Charlie : “ Why not ? ” John : “ Because I ’m gonna hit him ! ”
And finally , in at number 101 as a bonus extra to the list , in tribute to the late Heath Ledger :
101 . A Knight ’s Tale
We ’ve all dreamt about being a knight like Sir Lancelot , have n’t we ?
In this movie , after his master dies , Heath creates a new identity for himself as a knight ( and falls in love with a pretty tasty female too ) .
It ’s not your typical bloke movie , but it ’s entertaining and they get to knock people off a horse with a giant pole – which looks like a hell of a lot of fun to do !
Best line in the movie : “ Better a silly girl with a flower than a silly boy with a horse and a stick . “
Phew !!
That ’s a big list of testosterone packed cinematic goodness !
Now I know I ’ve probably missed off some hugely guy related movies from this list so feel free to drop a note in the comments on anything you think I ’ve missed and I ’ll update the article to include it .
Also , if you disagree with any of these movies then let me know in the comments .
In the meantime , enjoy the list and your journey to rediscovering your manliness !
EVERETT , Wash . --
On Tuesday , Boeing Co. will give Wall Street a progress report on its 787 Dreamliner , as it scrambles to overcome a six - month delay in producing the new jet .
A look inside the project reveals that the mess stems from one of its main selling points to investors -- global outsourcing .
When the Chicago aerospace giant set out four years ago to build the fuel - sipping jet , it figured the chief risk lay in perfecting a process to build much of the plane from carbon - fiber plastic instead of aluminum .
Boeing focused so hard on getting the science right that it did n't grasp the significance of another big change :
The 787 is the first jet in Boeing 's 91 - year history designed largely by other companies .
To lower the $ 10 billion or so it would cost to develop the plane solo , Boeing authorized a team of parts suppliers to design and build major sections of the craft , which it planned to snap together at its Seattle - area factory .
But outsourcing so much responsibility has turned out to be far more difficult than anticipated .
The supplier problems ranged from language barriers to snafus that erupted when some contractors themselves outsourced chunks of work .
An Italian company struggled for months to gain approval to build a fuselage factory on the site of an ancient olive grove .
The first Dreamliner to show up at Boeing 's factory was missing tens of thousands of parts , Boeing said .
Today , the Dreamliner is at least six months late , and the goal of delivering 109 planes by the end of 2009 is threatened .
Rather than being well into flight tests , Boeing is rushing to get the first planes airborne while it helps suppliers around the world bring their factories up to speed .
89 % Yes , between the secret spying , the deceptions leading to war and more , there is plenty to justify putting him on trial .
4.1 % No , like any president , he has made a few missteps , but nothing approaching “ high crimes and misdemeanors . ”
5 % No , the man has done absolutely nothing wrong .
Impeachment would just be a political lynching .
Update :
Okay , try not to let your mind get blown by the possible time - space paradox we 're about to illustrate , but MSI 's supposedly introducing a new ECOlution motherboard at CeBIT with an " air powered cooler " that operates on the Stirling Engine Theory to transform the thermal output of its chipset into the kinetic energy necessary to power that same chipset 's fan .
Of course , as the fan cools the heatsink it deprives itself of energy , supposedly the piston affixed to the crankshaft pulls back down , giving it another potential surge when its heat rebuilds .
Supposedly it works at 70 % efficiency , so we 'll just let the thermodynamics geeks in the audience mull over the possibility and audacity of it all -- they certainly seem to have given up on Steorn at this point .

Britney Spears Released from Hospital Accompanied by Dr. Phil
After a tumultuous morning on the 7th floor of Cedars Sinai Hospital in whichreportedly threw a fit , screamed at staff and pulled out her IV demanding to be released , she was escorted out of the facility via an underground tunnel by Dr. Phil .
Dr. Phil had been talking with Britney and her family members this morning .
The show is taping a Britney Spears special on Monday , to be aired on Wednesday , and has requested video of Britney from TMZ .
No word yet on whether Britney will be on the set of the Dr. Phil Show on Monday .
Speculation is that Britney suffers from bipolar disorder , something I have been saying to family and friends for months when conversation about Bitten and Bound inevitably turns to Britney Spears .
Britney is the topic of the majority of posts we have done on the site since we began in July .
The hospital could only hold Britney for a maximum of 72 hours against her will , and was required to release her if it was determined she was no longer a danger to herself of others .
I truly hope Britney receives the care she needs , for her sake and for the sake of her children .
This page features a wealth of information on historical gold prices as well as gold price charts .
If you are considering an investment in gold , you may want to take a look at the metal ’s price history .
The chart at the top of the page allows you to view historical gold prices going back over 40 years .
You can view these gold prices in varying currencies as well , seeing how it has performed over a long period of time .
Depending on the currencies being used , you may find a better long term value .
For example , because gold is typically denominated in U.S. Dollars , if the dollar is weaker then someone buying gold in yen or euros may find gold to be relatively less expensive .
On the other hand , a stronger dollar may make gold relatively more expensive in other currencies due to exchange rates .
You can also easily examine historical gold prices on a much smaller time horizon from 10 minutes to three days to 30 days to 60 days and up .
The timeframe you decide to look at may depend on your investment objectives .
If you are simply looking to buy and sell gold as a swing trader , you may focus on the hourly or six hour charts .
If you are looking to invest in gold for the long - term , you may be better off using longer timeframes such as weekly , monthly or yearly .
Why Look at Historical Gold Prices ?
Looking at historical gold prices may potentially provide information that may assist in buying or selling decisions .
Looking at the big picture , gold trended higher for many years before making all - time highs in 2011 of nearly $ 2000 per ounce .
Gold has since been moving lower , but could have possibly found a bottom in 2016 .
Although it remains to be seen , gold ’s declines from the 2011 highs could simply prove to be a pullback within an even longer - term uptrend .
Examining historical gold prices can potentially be useful in trying to identify potential areas of price support to buy at .
For example , if gold has pulled back to $ 1200 per ounce on numerous occasions but is met with heavy buying interest each time , then the $ 1200 area could be considered a level of support and could potentially be a good area to try to buy at .
In addition to viewing historical gold price charts in U.S. Dollars , you can also view historical gold prices in numerous alternative currencies such as British Pounds , Euros or Swiss Francs .
You can even view a historical inflation - adjusted gold price chart using the 1980 CPI formula .
For easy reference , this page also contains a simple table that provides gold ’s price change and percentage change using a single day , 30 day , six month , one year , five year and 16 year timeframes .
What has Driven Changes in the Gold Price ?
Over the past several decades , the price of gold has been influenced by many different factors .
Gold ’s price history has seen some significant ups and downs , and dramatic changes in price may be fueled by such issues as central bank buying , inflation , geopolitics , monetary policy equity markets and more .
One of the biggest drivers of gold is currency values .
Because gold is denominated in dollars , the greenback can have a significant impact on the price of gold .
A weaker dollar makes gold relatively less expensive for foreign buyers , and thus may lift prices .
On the other hand , a stronger dollar makes gold relatively more expensive for foreign buyers , thus possibly depressing prices .
Fiat , or paper currencies , have a tendency to lose value over time .
If this continues to be the case , gold could potentially continue in an uptrend as investors look to it for its perceived safety and its potential as a hedge against declining currency values .
Gold has long been considered a reliable store of wealth and value , and that reputation is not likely to change any time soon .
Although past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results , gold ’s price history can potentially provide clues as to where it could be headed .
Looking at past price data , for example , may help with spotting uptrends or downtrends .
Investors may also potentially spot tradable patterns within the price data that can potentially lead to solid buying or selling opportunities .
After seeing a recent in - house promotional brochure , I ’d like to issue a brief request on behalf of my fellow researchers .
This is addressed to all professional photographers : please , no more colored spotlights .
I know that you see this as a deficiency , but scientists do not work with purple radiance coming from the walls behind them .
Not if we can help it , we do n’t , and if we notice that sort of thing going on , we head for the exits .
In the same manner , our instruments do not , regrettably , emit orange glows that light our faces up from beneath , not for the most part , and if they start doing that we generally do n’t bend closer so as to emphasize the thoughtful contours of our faces .
When we hold up Erlenmeyer flasks to eye level to see the future of research in them , which we try not to do too often because we usually do n’t want to know , rarely is this accompanied by an eerie red light coming from the general direction of our pockets .
It ’s a bad sign when that happens , actually .
I know that your photos have lots more zing and pop the way you do them .
And I ’m sorry , for you and for the art department , that our labs are all well lit ( with boring old fluorescent lights , yet ) , and that we all wear plain white lab coats ( which tend to take over the picture ) , and that our instrument housings are mostly beige and blue and white .
It would be a lot easier on you guys if these things were n’t so .
But that ’s how it is .
And when you get right down to it , you ’re actually doing us a disservice by trying to pretend that there ’s all sorts of dramatic stuff going on , that discoveries are happening every single minute of the day and that they ’re accompanied by dawn - of - a - new - era lighting and sound effects .
We ’d rather that people did n’t get those ideas , because the really big discoveries are n’t like that at all .
It does n’t make for much of a cover shot , but if one of us ever does manage to change the world , it ’ll start with a puzzled glance at a computer screen , or a raised eyebrow while looking at a piece of paper .
Instead of getting noisier , everything will get a lot quieter .
And if there are any purple spotlights to be seen , we wo n’t even notice them .
. .
Update : A follow - up post is here , written after several comments by photographers came in .
