Scientists believe that your brain has a built - in " negativity . "
In other words , as we evolved over millions of years , dodging sticks and chasing carrots , it was a lot more important to notice , react to , and remember sticks than it was for carrots .
That 's because - in the tough environments in which our ancestors lived - if they missed out on a carrot , they usually had a shot at another one later on .
But if they failed to avoid a stick - a predator , a natural hazard , or from others of their species - WHAM , no more chances to pass on their .
The negativity bias shows up in lots of ways .
For example , studies have found that :
• In a relationship , it typically takes five good interactions to make up for a single bad one .
• People will work much harder to avoid losing $ 100 than they will work to gain the same amount of money .
• Painful experiences are much more memorable than pleasurable ones .
In your own mind , what do you usually think about at the end of the day ?
The fifty things that went right , or the one that went wrong ?
Like the guy who cut you off in traffic , what you wish you had said differently to a co-worker , or the one thing on your To Do list that did n't get done . . .
In effect , the brain is like Velcro for negative experiences , but Teflon for positive ones .
That shades " implicit " - your underlying expectations , beliefs , action strategies , and mood - in an increasingly negative direction .
And that 's just not fair , since probably most of the facts in your life are positive or neutral .
Every day , lots of good things happen , such as a lovely sunset , someone is nice to you , you finish a batch of emails , or you learn something new .
And lots of other good things are ongoing aspects of your world ( e. . , your children are healthy , life is peaceful in your corner of the planet ) or yourself ( e.g. , personal qualities like determination , sincerity , fairness , kindness ) .
Besides the sheer injustice of it , acquiring a big pile of negative experiences in implicit memory banks naturally makes a person more , irritable , and blue .
Plus it makes it harder to be patient and giving toward others .
In evolution , Mother Nature only cares about passing on genes - by any means necessary .
She does n't care if we happen to suffer along the way - from subtle worries to intense feelings of sorrow , worthlessness , or anger - or create suffering for others .
The result : a brain that is tilted against lasting contentment and fulfillment .
But you do n't have to accept this bias !
By tilting toward the good - " good " in the practical sense of that which brings more to oneself and more helpfulness to others - you merely level the playing field .
You 'll still see the tough parts of life .
In fact , you 'll become more able to change them or bear them if you tilt toward the good , since that will help put challenges in perspective , lift your energy and spirits , highlight useful resources , and fill up your own cup so you have more to offer to others .
And now , tilted toward absorbing the good , instead of positive experiences washing through you like water through a sieve , they 'll collect in implicit memory deep down in your brain .
In the famous saying , " neurons that fire together , wire together . "
The more you get your neurons firing about positive facts , the more they 'll be wiring up positive structures .
Taking in the good is a brain - science savvy and psychologically skillful way to improve how you feel , get things done , and treat others .
It is among the top five personal growth methods I know .
In addition to being good for adults , it 's great for children , helping them to become more , confident , and happy .
Here 's how to take in the good - in three simple steps .
1. Look for good facts , and turn them into good experiences .
Good facts include positive events - like the taste of good coffee or getting an unexpected compliment - and positive aspects of the world and yourself .
When you notice something good , let yourself feel good about it .
Try to do this at least a half dozen times a day .
There are lots of opportunities to notice good events , and you can always recognize good things about the world and yourself .
Each time takes just 30 seconds or so .
It 's private ; no one needs to know you are taking in the good .
You can do it on the fly in daily life , or at special times of reflection , like just before falling asleep ( when the brain is especially receptive to new learning ) .
Notice any reluctance to feeling good .
Such as thinking that you do n't deserve to , or that it 's selfish , vain , or even shameful to feel pleasure .
Or that if you feel good , you will lower your guard and let bad things happen .
Barriers to feeling good are common and understandable - but they get in the way of you taking in the resources you need to feel better , have more strength , and have more inside to give to others .
So acknowledge them to yourself , and then turn your back to the good news .
Keep opening up to it , breathing and relaxing , letting the good facts affect you .
It 's like sitting down to a meal : do n't just look at it - taste it !
2. Really enjoy the experience .
Most of the time , a good experience is pretty mild , and that 's fine .
But try to stay with it for 20 or 30 seconds in a row - instead of getting distracted by something else .
As you can , sense that it is filling your body , becoming a rich experience .
As Marc Lewis and other researchers have shown , the longer that something is held in awareness and the more emotionally stimulating it is , the more neurons that fire and thus wire together , and the stronger the trace in memory .
You are not craving or clinging to positive experiences , since that would ultimately lead to tension and disappointment .
Actually , you are doing the opposite : by taking them in and filling yourself up with them , you will increasingly feel less fragile or needy inside , and less dependent on external supplies ; your happiness and love will become more unconditional , based on an inner fullness rather than on whether the momentary facts in your life happen to be good ones .
3. Intend and sense that the good experience is sinking into you .
People do this in different ways .
Some feel it in their body like a warm glow spreading through their chest like the warmth of a cup of hot cocoa on a cold wintry day .
Others visualize things like a golden syrup sinking down inside , bringing good feelings and soothing old places of hurt , filling in old holes of loss or yearning ; a child might imagine a jewel going into a treasure chest in her heart .
And some might simply know conceptually , that while this good experience is held in awareness , its neurons are firing busily away , and gradually wiring together
***
Any single time you do this will make only a little difference .
But over time those little differences will add up , gradually weaving positive experiences into the fabric of your brain and your self .

Early last year , our very own Drew Phillips spotted the Frogman Rocket II doing its best to blend in among the other , less - outrageous creations at the Grand National Roadster Show .
At the time , he wondered what it must be like to throw a leg over a trike powered by a supercharged Hemi V8 with over 1,000 horsepower .
Now we know .

How The Global Oil Watchdog Failed Its Mission
By Lionel Badal
25 May , 2010
Countercurrents.org
Part I 
An inconvenient reality
12 years ago , the International Energy Agency ( IEA ) discovered that Peak Oil would threaten the prosperity and stability of our societies .
Yes , they knew it .
While some IEA officials tried to inform the world about this game - changing event , it appears that others had different priorities .
In 1998 , the IEA team working on the influential World Energy Outlook ( WEO ) made a detailed and authoritative assessment about the future of oil production .
The team was composed of the world 's finest energy experts , amongst whom Jean - Marie Bourdaire , coordinator of the study , Ken Wigley , Keith Miller and the man who would later become Chief - Economist of the IEA , Dr. Fatih Birol .
By using confidential databases and sophisticated expertise , they reached a dramatic conclusion : Peak Oil , the moment when global oil production starts its irreversible decline , would happen well before 2020 , around 2014 .
Although the IEA publicly claims to be free of any external meddling , the team was under intense pressure and scrutiny .
As recalled by the veteran geologist Dr. Colin Campbell , who advised the IEA on the 1998 WEO , at one point , Bourdaire had to stop calling him from his IEA office as the issue apparently became so sensitive that he could n't be seen in contact with him .
Formed in the aftermaths of the 1973 oil shock by wealthy countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ( OECD ) , the IEA , a self - proclaimed  global oil watchdog ( 1 ) , and its flagship report , the WEO , are considered to be the most authoritative source of information in the energy sector .
To put it in the words of the Agency :
 Governments and industry around the world have come to rely on the WEO to provide a consistent basis on which they can formulate policies and design business plans .  ( 2 )
Nevertheless , in 1998 , the most influential member of the Agency , the USA , did n't like at all what was coming from their study .
A structural problem with oil as identified by the IEA team would undeniably question the sustainability of the current economic model .
During the study , the IEA team realised the extent to which economic growth was correlated to the availability of abundant and cheap energy .
Hence , once oil production would stop to grow and tensions appear , economic growth would become far more difficult to sustain , if not impossible .
The IEA team was effectively walking on eggshells .
In order to soften the striking message , the IEA added that a balancing item called  Unidentified Unconventional Oil would suddenly appear and rise from nothing in 2010 to 19.1 mb/d in 2020 ( conveniently about enough to cancel the shortages ) .
The only problem was that unconventional oil resources were well known .
This balancing item was in reality a code for : shortages .
The balancing item never existed and never will .
A former member of the IEA team in charge of this WEO confirmed that to me .
Interestingly too , the Energy Information Administration ( EIA ) , the statistical branch of the US Department of Energy ( DOE ) , will use a similar subterfuge in 2009 , when it will talk of unidentified projects  filling the gap of declining production . ( 3 )
Fortunately , the story did not end there .
Campbell had been in contact with a British environmental expert , Dr. David Fleming , who was by chance a regular contributor to the magazine Prospect .
As such , when the 1998 WEO ( 4 ) was published , Campbell who was fully aware of the message it contained , explained this to Fleming .
On the 20th of April 1999 , Fleming wrote a prophetic article entitled ,  The next oil shock ?  ( 5 ) .
The article effectively said what the IEA team could not write in its report :
 The latest issue of the International Energy Agency 's annual publication , World Energy Outlook , is a case in point .
It has a story to tell which will profoundly affect the future of every man and woman on earth ...
The prospect of a one - way oil price shock early in the next decade changes the present economic and political agenda profoundly .
Assumptions of sustained economic growth and low unemployment will be blown out of the water
So why is the IEA not shouting about this ?
As the most influential policy body in the oil business , it is in a delicate position .
It can not just blurt it out .
It can not say :  We are looking at a big , permanent oil deficit , for which we can offer no solutions '
The IEA has revealed the situation in coded form . 
From its Paris HQ , the IEA had raised a powerful , and yet unwelcomed alarm .
A backlash was about to fall on the authors of the 1998 WEO .
Part II 
The shadow of the US
As revealed by Dr. Colin Campbell , when the article was published ,  the IEA evidently got into serious trouble  ( 6 ) .
So what happened behind the walls of the Agency ?
First of all , high - ranking elements of the US Administration got mad when they heard what a couple of European civil servants had done with the 1998 WEO .
Coded message or not , what was coming out of the Paris - based agency was unacceptable for them .
The kind of structural crisis pointed out in the 1998 WEO was to be buried and quickly .
Besides , it is important to know that the 1998 WEO went out only a couple of months after the 1998 International Energy Outlook ( IEO ) published this time by the US Energy Information Administration ( EIA ) .
Unlike the IEA , the EIA never bothered making oil production scenarios ; its studies have always consisted in modelling the demand , and then supposing that production would follow .
Rather simple , but utterly unreliable .
Putting that aside , in the 1998 IEO , the EIA reached cheerful conclusions and even declared that :
 Oil prices are expected to remain relatively low , and resources are not expected to constrain substantial increases in oil demand through 2020 ...
In 2020 , world oil consumption is projected to exceed 115 million barrels per day .  ( 7 )
That of course , turned out to be pure fantasy , but the EIA added :
 There is now widespread agreement that resources are not a key constraint in satisfying increases in world oil demand to 2020 . 
Well , to the great displeasure of the EIA , a few months later the IEA would say and demonstrate the complete opposite .
One can imagine how pleased the EIA and its host department , the DOE must have been .
A 2006 article on oil production forecasts and methodologies from Dr. Roger Bentley ( University of Reading ) and Professor Godfrey Boyle ( Open University ) similarly talked of political pressure of the USA and Canada  ( 8 ) after the publication of the 1998 WEO .
Motivated by what can only be described as incompetence and arrogance , elements of the US Administration then put extensive pressure on the IEA leadership .
What did they want ?
The coordinator of the 1998 WEO , Bourdaire , would have to leave the Agency .
Meanwhile , Wigley retired and Miller also left the IEA .
The IEA team who wrote the 1998 WEO was knocked down and its only survivor , Dr. Fatih Birol , who was now in control of the WEO , would learn a lot from these events .
Indeed , the 2000 WEO which he designed and managed suppressed any warning about a structural problem with oil :
 The ( 2000 ) Outlook views the world oil - resource base as adequate to meet demand over the projection period ...
One need expect no global  supply crunch '. 
The supply crunch did happen .
Despite rising demand , higher prices and massive investments , between 2005 and 2008 , and for the first time in history , conventional oil production ceased to grow ( 9 ) .
As expected by the 1998 IEA team , these tensions led to a severe oil price shock which weakened the foundations of an already fragile globalized economy ( 10 ) .
But how did the Agency manage to explain its spectacular turnaround in the 2000 WEO ?
By a lucky coincidence , in 2000 , the United States Geological Survey ( USGS ) , published an extremely optimistic  World Petroleum Assessment  which would be used by the IEA from 2000 to 2006 .
According to the former IEA official I met ,  the USGS announced gigantic reserves which were based on a completely rubbish methodology  .
In fact , soon after its publication , Jean Laherrère , the former Deputy - Exploration Manager of Total and a renowned petroleum consultant , made a detailed analysis of the USGS assessment and concluded that :
 The foregoing discussion demonstrates that the new USGS study has failed to respect the evidence of past discovery both in terms of amounts and rates
In short , the new USGS report is misleading .
It is also unrepresentative of the normal standards of this highly respected organization .  ( 11 )
Laherrère added ,  One is left to wonder if there is not a hidden agenda ( 12 ) behind the USGS numbers .
Ten years later , we now know that the real figures were 60 % lower than what the USGS then forecasted ( 13 ) .
Importantly , the anticorruption NGO , Global Witness ( GW ) , identified another disturbing fact with the IEA 's use of the 2000 USGS assessment .
In 2005 , senior geologists of the USGS published an update of the 2000 assessment in which they warned that real discoveries were far lower than what their original study expected .
But as discovered by GW , the Agency ignored this update even though it was published before the 2005 WEO .
GW will also reveal that , correspondence with the IEA confirmed the Agency was aware of a low actual discovery rate  but did nothing .
GW added :
 Given that one of the key function of the IEA is to provide governments with accurate information from which they can make economic plans , their misrepresentation of data in this way was intellectually dishonest ...
The Agency 's over - confidence , despite credible data , external analysis and underlying fundamentals all strongly suggesting a more precautionary approach , has had a disastrous global impact .  ( 14 )
Bentley and Boyle were also able to identify serious technical errors in the 2000 WEO . ( 15 )
Although the IEA told its member states in 2004 that oil prices were assumed to remain flat until 2010 , and then to begin to climb steadily to $ 29 in 2030  ( 16 ) , in the real world , prices started to rise dramatically .
As oil prices reached record levels year after year , the scenarios made by the Agency became increasingly absurd and difficult to defend .
As critics ( 17 ) started to question the reliability of IEA 's outlooks , the position of the Chief - Economist became critical .
As such , it was finally decided that the IEA would publish in its 2008 WEO a detailed field - by - field analysis of global oil production prospects .
In December 2008 , Birol admitted that previous WEOs were based on nothing more than a global assumption ( 18 ) , which , unsurprisingly , turned out to be far too optimistic and thus misleading .
In fact , a decade after the 1998 IEA team , the 2008 IEA global assessment reached a similarly bleak conclusion ( 19 ) .
And once again , it appears that elements of the US Administration ( 20 ) intervened in order to massage the pessimistic assessment made by the IEA .
The following quotes provide interesting insights into the US Administration 's awkward relationship towards Peak Oil :
 There is , I think , ample evidence , and some people in DOE have gone so far as to say it specifically , that people in the hierarchy of DOE , under both administrations , understood that there was a problem and suppressed work in the area
The peak oil story is definitely a bad news story .
There 's just no way to sugar - coat it ... ( 21 )
Dr. Robert Hirsch , lead author of a Peak Oil report ( 22 ) for the National Energy Technology Laboratory ( DOE )
( Steven Chu , US Secretary of Energy ) was my boss
He knows all about peak oil , but he can't talk about it .
If the government announced that peak oil was threatening our economy , Wall Street would crash .
He just ca n't say anything about it . " ( 23 )
David Fridley , Energy Scientist , Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory ( DOE )
Part III 
What they do n't want you to know
In previous parts , we looked at how the IEA was silenced when it raised a subtle alarm about the future of global oil production .
A crucial question remains , why does it matter ?
How could this event be so important ?
Well , as the most authoritative source of information , the IEA misled European governments and businesses by declaring until 2008 that oil prices would remain low .
They did n't .
By doing so , the Agency managed to make renewable energies look uncompetitive compared to oil .
As mentioned by the Swiss MP and member of the Swiss Parliamentary Energy Commission , Dr. Rudolf Rechsteiner , the IEA has effectively been delaying the change to a renewable world  ( 24 ) .
Remarkably , the so - called global oil watchdog acted more and more like a zealous oil industry lobby ( 25 ) .
Nevertheless , the IEA would pay a heavy price for this when the concurrent International Renewable Energy Agency ( IRENA ) was launched in January 2009 .
The reason why ?
Hans Jorgen Koch , the Danish deputy secretary in the ministry of energy and climate change , said that IRENA had only been formed because the IEA was not doing enough to address climate change and support renewables .
 For ten years the IEA has underestimated the competitiveness of renewable energy sources  he said ( 26 )
Now the key question : was the IEA simply incompetent or was it deliberately misleading its European member states ?
A 2004 article from the BBC provides an element of answer :
 In public , Mr Birol denied that supply would not be able to meet rising demand , especially from the buoyant economies in the USA , China and India .
But after his speech he seemed to change his tune ...
When BBC News Online followed up by asking if this giant increase in production was actually possible rather than simply a desire he refused to answer .
 You are from the press ?
This is not for you .
This is not for the press .' ( 27 )
Why would the Chief - Economist of the IEA hide crucial information from the press and the public ?
More worryingly , when the Guardian broke the story about the IEA whistleblower ( 28 ) in November 2009 , Campbell wrote an open - letter to Terry Macalister , Energy Editor of the newspaper .
He explained the events around the 1998 WEO and declared :
 I explained this ( the coded message of the 1998 WEO ) to a journalist ( David Fleming ) who contacted the element within the IEA which was pleased that this important hidden message should get out .  ( 29 )
Having read that with great interest , I immediately wanted to know who the element within the IEA could be .
To my surprise , Campbell told me that the element was Birol , who was n't yet the powerful Chief - Economist of the Agency .
In order to verify the information , I met Fleming on the 4 th of December 2009 in London .
Fleming , a highly respected environmentalist , confirmed the information .
He explained that when he published his article in 1999 , he sent an email to Birol asking if he would accept to comment on the article .
Birol called him and asked if he would accept to meet in a discreet manner .
At the request of Birol , they secretly met at the Oxford and Cambridge Club in London and had tea .
Fleming perfectly remembered that they entered a quiet room and when Birol sat , he apparently even looked over his shoulders to check that nobody could hear what he was about to say .
According to Fleming , Birol then told him ,  There are six people in the world who understand it  and it seems that he was referring to people like Campbell .
Fleming added that Birol made this confidence about his article ,  you are right .
He reportedly said that the unidentified unconventional oil was effectively a code and that OPEC was unlikely to ever fill the gap .
During the discussion , Birol explained that the IEA was constrained and even complained about the interference of the USA , or so remembered Fleming .
Fleming still had a pretty good opinion of Birol when we talked .
During their meeting , Birol was very perceptive and apparently even offered his help .
When I asked Fleming in which mood Birol was , and whether or not he seemed anxious or nervous , Fleming told me not at all .
He seemed to be witty  and on good form .
He even remembered a joke Birol made ,  this is a lovely club , but not a lively one , good joke recalled Fleming .
My question : why has the Chief - Economist of the IEA been publicly saying since 2000 that global oil production can increase until 2030 , as long as we invest , while in 1999 he reportedly , secretly , confirmed that global oil production would start to decline around 2014 ?
Was it because he saw what happened to his former boss when the later courageously tried to inform IEA 's member states about the seriousness of the situation ?
I 've contacted Birol 's assistant at the IEA and asked if he would comment on the meeting with Fleming ; my request has yet to be answered .
A report ( 30 ) commissioned by the US Department of Energy concluded that we would need 20 years to prepare for Peak Oil otherwise we would face unprecedented economic , social , and political costs .
12 crucial years have just been lost , how many more will we waste before we finally start to prepare for this unprecedented event ?
As I was able to say recently during my presentation on Peak Oil and the IEA at the European Commission , an independent and thorough enquiry into the actions of the Agency is urgently needed .
Furthermore , the creation of a truly independent and transparent European Energy Agency needs to be considered .
Time is running out .
Lionel Badal is a postgraduate student at King ’s College London ( Department of Geography ) and for over a year now , have been working on the issue of Peak Oil .
This is how Lionel describes his work so far " As I interviewed experts from both sides of the debate , my work quickly became more of an investigation within the oil industry .
On the 10th of November 2009 , the Guardian published a story about an IEA whistleblower that was mostly based on my research ( “ Key oil figures were distorted by US pressure , says whistleblower ” ) .
On the 22nd and 23rd of February 2010 , I was asked to make several presentations about the topic ( “ Peak Oil and the IEA ” ) at the German Parliament to MPs , journalists and scientists ( including a political advisor of BP ) .
The German newspaper Die Zeit wrote about it ( http://www.zeit.de/wirtschaft/2010-02/peak-oil-interview-badal) and more recently , The Ecologist published an article about my research , “ How a 22 - year - old student uncovered peak oil fraud ” ( http://www.theecologist.org/News/news_analysis/437079/

Last week , I discussed a series of evidences about how God is being omitted from American life , culture and politics .
This week , I will detail the No. 1 advocate for a godless society : our president .
First , even during his campaign for the presidency , Barack Obama sarcastically belittled America 's Judeo - Christian heritage and degraded its adherents with trite remarks typical of any atheistic antagonist : " Whatever we once were , we are no longer a Christian nation " ; " the dangers of sectarianism are greater than ever " ; " religion does n't allow for compromise " ; " the Sermon on the Mount ( is ) a passage that is so radical that it 's doubtful that our own Defense Department would survive its application " ; and " to base our policymaking on such commitments ( as moral absolutes ) would be a dangerous thing . "
( See the YouTube video " Barack Obama On The Importance Of A Secular Government . " )
Second , President Obama denied America 's rich Judeo - Christian heritage before the eyes and ears of other countries when he publicly declared in Turkey on April 6 , 2009 , " We do not consider ourselves a Christian nation . "
( Who are the " we " to whom he refers ?
Would our former presidents agree with his " we " ? )
Third , in countless speeches over the past year , he has sympathized with and supported pro-Islamic culture , theology and practice .
The New York Times recently published a multiple - page report on how the " White House quietly courts Muslims in ( the ) U.S. "
Fourth , Obama emphatically declared as president - elect that " only government " is our savior .
By advocating such , the federal government vies for divine omnipotence and deliverance , which America 's Founders understood to be the Creator 's roles .
It was only a matter of time before such wayward power sought to control even churches .
A clear example of this came out just this past month , through Obama 's faith - based initiative committee recommendations .
The federal government is seeking not only to minimize the language preachers use through politically correct hate - crime laws but also to alter the messages they preach , from saving souls to saving the earth .
Obama 's faith - based council specifically recommends " bringing the power of 370,000 houses of worship across the country to the fight of climate change by greening buildings and promoting environmental stewardship in their congregations . "
Lastly , President Obama has turned a blind eye and a deaf ear to anti-Judeo - Christian issues , such as the Army 's rescinding of Franklin Graham 's invitation to the Pentagon 's National Day of Prayer event , atheists ' lawsuits to remove the national motto ( " In God We Trust " ) from the walls of the new Capitol Visitor Center in Washington , D.C. , the building of a mosque right next to New York 's ground zero and the American Civil Liberties Union 's disposal of memorial crosses for veterans in the Mojave Desert and at Mount Soledad .
Ben Franklin could have been speaking before the president and Congress today when he gave these words at the Constitutional Convention : " In the beginning of the contest with Great Britain , when we were sensible of danger , we had daily prayer in this room for the divine protection .
Our prayers , sir , were heard , and they were graciously answered .
All of us who were engaged in the struggle must have observed frequent instances of a superintending providence in our favor .
To that kind providence we owe this happy opportunity of consulting in peace on the means of establishing our future national felicity .
And have we now forgotten that powerful friend ?
Or do we imagine that we no longer need his assistance ?
I have lived , sir , a long time , and the longer I live the more convincing proof I see of this truth , that God governs in the affairs of men .
And if a sparrow cannot fall to the ground without his notice , is it probable that an empire can rise without his aid ? "
These are three questions every Washington politician in particular needs to answer : " And have we now forgotten that powerful friend ?
Or do we imagine that we no longer need his assistance ?
And if a sparrow cannot fall to the ground without his notice , is it probable that an empire can rise ( again ) without his aid ? "
Speaking of aid , needing our patriot assistance right now is Rep. Randy Forbes , whose congressional address on America 's Judeo - Christian heritage has received more than 3 million views on YouTube .
Forbes , along with the members of the bipartisan Congressional Prayer Caucus , has reintroduced H. Res. 397 , " America 's Spiritual Heritage Resolution . "
The resolution would recognize our nation 's spiritual heritage milestones , reject current attempts to erase all religious history from public buildings and educational resources , and establish a week for Americans to remember and reflect on the spiritual principles upon which our nation was founded .
The resolution has gained bipartisan support , with 79 co-sponsors .
Has your representative sponsored or supported the resolution ?
If not , please contact that person today to ask that he / she does so .
If Psalm 33:12 says that " blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord , " how would the verse read for the nation who has given God the boot ?

Brain illness leaves woman unable to recognise anyone 's voice - except Sean Connery
For your ears only :
Due to a brain condition , a woman identified only as KH cannot recognise voices - even that of her daughter - but can pick out former James Bond Sean Connery
A successful businesswoman who is unable to recognise any voice but Sean Connery 's is helping scientists to understand how the brain works .
For as long as she can remember , the 62 - year - old woman has struggled to tell different voices apart , even those of close family members .
Unless she can see the face of a speaker , she has no idea who is talking , and as a result avoids using the telephone .
The only exception is the gentle Scottish burr of the former James Bond actor .
The woman , identified only as KH , is the first known case in the world of someone being born with ' phonagnosia ' , or inability to recognise voices .
The rare condition has been previously recorded but only in patients who have had a stroke or a head injury .
KH , a management consultant , had no idea what caused her problem until a few years ago when she read an article about face blindness , which means that people cannot recognise faces .
Realising that her condition might be similar , she contacted scientists at University College London .
Over the last few years they have conducted exhaustive tests .
They have found that her condition is more than a simple inability to remember voices because she even struggles to tell the difference between two voice recordings played one after the other .
She can distinguish between men's and women 's voices , but can not recognise her daughter's .
In the tests she was unable to identify the voices of Margaret Thatcher , Joanna Lumley , David Beckham , Dawn French , Chris Tarrant or Ann Widdecombe .
The only one she recognised was Sean Connery .
Scans revealed no brain damage , but researchers did spot that part of her brain known as the temporal voice area was less active on the right half of her brain .
The finding suggests that the right hemisphere may play a key role in voice recognition .
Professor Pascal Belin , a neuroscientist at Glasgow University and expert on phonagnosia , said : ' Identifying voices is surprisingly important , especially on the telephone .
' We can usually tell who someone is on the telephone from just a word , even if the line is bad .
But people with phonagnosia cannot do this .'

After a raucous hearing , a Manhattan community board backed a proposal on Tuesday evening to build a Muslim community center near the World Trade Center .
The 29 - to - 1 vote , with 10 abstentions , followed a four - hour back - and - forth between those who said the community center would be a monument to tolerance and those who believed it would be an affront to victims of the 2001 terrorist attacks .
The board ’s vote was advisory — it did not have the power to scrap plans for a center — but it was seen as an important barometer of community sentiment .
Middle school students and rabbis were among the more than 100 people who testified at the hearing , which was held a short distance from ground zero .
Some carried pictures of family members killed in the attacks ; others brandished signs reading “ Show respect for 9/11 .
No mosque ! ”
" Your mother 's dead , before long I 'll be dead , and you ... and your brother and your sister and all of her children , all of us dead , all of us .. rotting in the ground .
It 's the family name that lives on .
It 's all that lives on .
Not your personal glory , not your honor , but family . "

Earlier this month at the Dutch Rotterdam Zoo , an eleven year old male gorilla named Bokito escaped and ran rampant through the Zoo ’s food court , injuring a woman when he bit and dragged her some distance .
Now , health insurance company FBTO is distributing eye - contact disguising glasses that allow zoo visitors to stare all they like , a behavior that is threatening to most of the great apes .
A boon to the shy , the voyeuristic , and anyone who wants to look pensive or , frankly , a little weird , the glasses may also be useful to anyone who goes to zoos with sketching in mind .
From the blog of Dinotopia creator James Gurney :
If you want to draw portraits of great apes , you have to approach them in the proper way .
You ca n’t just march up to a great ape enclosure and start staring at them , or they ’ll get all shy and disgusted and turn their back on you , because staring is a threat to them …
I approached the glass with a submissive posture , looking down at the ground and backing up with my hand out .
The gorilla loved it .
He had never seen a human act like a polite ape before .
He came right up to the glass and posed for me while I did this half - hour portrait from just two feet away .
It was like sketching someone on a subway .
I tried to just glance at him discreetly out of the corner of my eye .
Hooray for unintended uses !
To print and assemble your own ridiculous eye - wear , look no further than this PDF file .

Correction : Bokito actually broke out in 2007 , not “ earlier this month . ”
Whoops .
Better take these glasses off so you can see that we ’re ashamed .
Have a tip we should know ?

Phoenix Suns forward Amare Stoudemire 's mother was arrested on Saturday in Scottsdale , Ariz. , for failing to have an ignition interlock device on her vehicle , according to a report in the Arizona Republic .
Carrie Mae Stoudemire , 54 , was stopped at 3:25 p.m. after her Lincoln Navigator was straddling two lanes and going 60 mph , according to the Scottsdale police report .
Her eyes were " watery and glassy , " according to the officer .
Carrie Stoudemire told the officer the Navigator was rented and she was unaware she needed to have an ignition interlock device on all of her vehicles .
She added that she was on her way to an alcohol class .
An ignition interlock device prevents a vehicle from being started if the driver 's blood alcohol content , which is collected by exhaling into the device , registers above a pre-set level .
Police said Carrie Stoudemire 's driver 's license says she must have the device on her vehicles until Oct. 30 .
After Carrie Stoudemire refused to participate in a field sobriety test , the officer handcuffed her and put her in the back seat of his patrol car .
According to the report , Amare Stoudemire and another man arrived at the scene a few minutes later .
Carrie Stoudemire began to yell " Amar'e ! " and asked for a lawyer .
Police said Carrie Stoudemire was charged with speeding , operating a vehicle without an ignition interlock device and failure to drive in a single lane .
She was booked into the Scottsdale jail and later released .
Carrie Stoudemire has been in and out of jail throughout Stoudemire 's life for charges ranging from drunken driving to drug possession to prostitution .
In 2006 , she was sentenced to three years in prison in Arizona for aggravated DUI following an accident .

To celebrate all of the win Episode V taught us , IGN would like to teach you a few things – 100 of 'em , actually – about the best Star Wars movie ever made .
We plugged C - 3P0 into the hyperdrive – because we could – and then went to work tracking down 100 factoids about the making of the movie , about the version of Empire that almost was and other geek - friendly factoids about toys and memorabilia linked to this sacred sequel .
With the help of Lucasfilm , The Star Wars Encyclopedia , IMDB.com , the original making - of journal , various Star Wars websites , the DVD commentary and our own IGN geek tank , we present to you 100 rounds of ammunition , for the next time you challenge that guy in line at Comic - Con to a geek - off .
This +wampa's+drunk+on+redrum .
The original first draft of Empire was written by Leigh Brackett , a prolific science - fiction author , in 1978 .
The plot of the movie ?
Just a bit different : " While Han Solo goes in search of his Father - In - Law , Ovan Marekal , who has political ties with Darth Vader Luke Skywalker heads to the Bog Planet where he meets a frog - like Jedi named Minch , who teaches him the ways of the force .
"
The film would have opened with Luke on the ice planet ( which was not called Hoth at the time ) , overlooking a massive ice ridge , fascinated with the scene like he was with Tatooine 's twin suns in Episode IV .
We know the permanent ice planet to be called Hoth .
But in the original script , Hoth was the name of the planet that houses Cloud City .
And yep , Cloud City is no longer called " Cloud City . "
Its name ?
Orbital City .
The Imperial Walker sequence and ensuing battle is not in this script .
In this version , the Empire does not attack the rebel base , ever .
Instead , Wampas attack and infiltrate our heroes ' icy compound .
In Lawrence Kasdan 's draft of the script , commissioned after Brackett's , the Wampas and the Empire attack the Rebel Base .
There are images of the Wampa attack filmed floating out there somewhere .
We hope and pray that footage of this sequence will be included on the Blu-ray release .
Once Luke is taken captive and turned into a frozen Wampa snack , the original draft deviates from the movie we all know and love .
How so ?
Gone is the Jabba - Han subplot and the bounty hunters , and in its place is Solo going after his stepfather , a man named Ovan Marekal .
Ovan is a huge political bigwig who 's carefully aligned himself with Darth Vader to protect the people of the galaxy .
The Rebels believe that if Han can get to him , he may be able to convince him to fight against Vader , giving the otherwise helpless Rebel Army a fighting chance .
Some of Ovan 's backstory would find its way into the character of Lando in the final film .
Lando Calrissian was originally named Baron Lando Kadar .
In the Brackett draft , when we meet Darth Vader , he 's just kinda chillin ' in a castle ( ?! ) on the planet of Ton Muund , a proto -Coruscant type city planet .
We also meet the Emperor here for the first time , and he 's wearing a golden robe ( cringe ! ) .
The Emperor tells him to go find Luke Skywalker , the man who destroyed the Death Star , because he believes he possesses the Force .
Yoda was originally a frog thing called Minch .
And Minch / Yoda 's home was the Bog Planet , and not the galaxy 's Everglades equivalent known as Dagobah .
When Minch / Yoda is explaining the ways of Jedi sword fighting , he calls on Obi-Wan , who appears , and then Obi-Wan and Minch / Yoda have a lightsaber battle .
Luke 's fight with Fake " Force cave " Vader is actually a fight with a Celestial Vader !
In the original story , the swamp and the cave disappear , and Luke and Vader lightsaber it out in deep space .
Vader even grabs a handful of stars to show how powerful the Dark Side can be .
( That scene was apparently sponsored by LSD . )
In this version , Chewbacca gets jealous of Han and Leia spending so much time together .
The Wookiee growls whenever the two are all Ross and Rachel with each other .
And to add insult to injury , Threepio makes fun of the walking carpet for it .
The Bog Planet - Skywalker Family Reunion ?
Yep , that 's in here .
Brackett wrote a scene where , before Luke leaves Swamptopia , Ben's Force ghost introduces Luke to his father – Anakin , not Vader , and not the Mustafar 'd version either .
Before Luke takes off for Cloud City , his father tells him that he has a sister and that the Dark Side is bad news ( no s@# ! ) .
Brackett wrote a scene where Solo , before going to Orbital / Cloud City , visits the planet 's surface and finds an ancient city occupied by Na'vi - like aliens called " Cloud People . " ( Sigh . )
These aliens are white - skinned , white - haired folk who travel by way of flying Manta Rays .
Our first insight into the Clone Wars – rather , their cloning process – would have been seen in this version of Empire .
Ya see , younglings , Lando was revealed to be a Clone Trooper , using his blood to make himself new versions of , er , himself … Luke uses the Cloud People to help him get to Orbital City .
Once there , he and Vader engage in an epic lightsaber duel .
Well , Luke sets his Midi-chlorians to " Badass " and unleashes the Force on Vader – Force tossing equipment off the walls at Vader and just kicking ass .
The fight 's big twist ?
Vader is letting Luke win .
The number one cause of death for Imperial officers named " Needa " tricks Luke into using his rage as a means to expose young Skywalker to the Dark Side .
The evil almost consumes Luke , as this movie proves to be a study focusing on how Luke resists the Dark Side 's temptations .
But what about getting his hand chopped off ?
Sadly ,
Luke retains his limb but does escape via the Falcon , just like in the final film .

Prime Minister Stephen Harper has named a Canadian Football League team owner who gave thousands to his 2004 leadership campaign as the latest Conservative senator .
David Braley , seen in 2002 , will sit as a Conservative senator .
Braley owns the B.C. Lions and the Toronto Argonauts .
( ( Kevin Frayer / Canadian Press ) )
David Braley , a Hamilton - area businessman and owner of the B.C. Lions and the Toronto Argonauts , will immediately replace Ontario Conservative Senator Wilbert Keon , who has reached the mandatory Senate retirement age of 75 , Harper announced Thursday .
In a release , the prime minister said Braley " has shown a commitment to both his community and his country through his involvement in sport and philanthropy . "
" I look forward to working with Mr. Braley and all of our senators as our government works towards a more democratic , accountable and effective Senate , " Harper said .
Braley is a well - known philanthropist who has given millions to numerous charities and hospitals , as well as his alma mater McMaster University .
Records unearthed by Liberal researchers show Braley personally donated $ 16,500 to Harper 's 2004 party leadership campaign , and his auto - parts company , Orlick Industries , donated another $ 30,000 .
That made him Harper 's single biggest supporter .
According to the leadership campaign records , Braley also gave Harper 's rivals Belinda Stronach and Tony Clement $ 30,000 and $ 10,000 , respectively .
Harper — who once said he would never appoint senators but instead wanted them elected — has now named 33 Conservatives to the 105 - seat upper House in the past 18 months .
Harper has typically waited for a number of Senate vacancies to open up before making a group appointment , but officials in the government say there is too much important legislation to be passed before the summer recess and every
Tory vote is needed .
The Conservatives hold a plurality of seats in the Senate , but not an absolute majority .
Born in Montreal and raised in Hamilton , Braley is currently director of the 2015 Pan-American Games and oversaw Toronto 's successful bid for the event .
He lives in Hamilton with his wife , Nancy Gordon .

Vandar Tokare was a male Jedi Master who was the head of the Jedi Enclave on Dantooine during the Mandalorian Wars and Jedi Civil War , holding a seat on both the Jedi High Council and the Council of the Jedi academy during this time span .
He was friends with fellow Council member Vrook Lamar , usually having the last word in their frequent disagreements , most notably on the choice to train Revan once again in the ways of the Jedi after his fall to the dark side of the Force .
One of the attendees of the Conclave on Katarr , Tokare was killed during an attack from the Sith Lord Darth Nihilus in which the entire Miraluka colony and many of the survivors of the First Jedi Purge were lost .
Biography
Tokare took Derrica Praji and another person as Jedi Padawans and trained them on Ossus .
In 4,225 BBY Tokare and his two apprentices traveled to the world Kaikielius , where they led Galactic Republic troops during the Kaikieli Reconquista , a campaign to retake Kaikielius from criminals .
For three months , Tokare led attacks on most criminal - infested cities and was eventually victorious .
Prior to the Mandalorian Wars , Vandar had a conversation with Vrook Lamar concerning the Jedi Exile .
She had yet to achieve the title of Jedi Knight , but a Master had already been assigned to her , and her talent with Force bonding had already begun to manifest itself .
Master Vrook had low views on anyone who followed Revan , but even before the war , he deemed the Exile a mediocre Jedi , and believed her talent was uncontrolled because of lust for power , and that it would eventually lead her to the dark side .
When he caught the Exile in a heated argument with his Padawan , Vrook first asked her Master to lecture her about discipline , without success , then he expected Master Vandar to step in , but he would n’t either .
Though respecting Lamar ’s wisdom , Tokare told him that it was not his concern , and he voiced a divergent opinion on the Exile , whom he saw as a natural leader with a unique strength .
This conversation was recorded by a protocol droid serving at the Jedi Enclave .
Years later , in 3,951 BBY , for the first time since she went to war , the Exile would return to Dantooine .
She met this droid in a battered state , its memory banks corrupted , but after indulging in some maintenance , she found a partially degraded holorecord of Vrook and Vandar speaking about her .
Mandalorian Wars
In the years leading up to the Mandalorian invasion of the Galactic Republic during the Mandalorian Wars , Master Vandar taught many pupils , and by 3,964 BBY he was the leading Master of the Jedi Enclave .
Zayne Carrick , who had been a student of his before being apprenticed to Lucien Draay , sought the help of Master Vandar in the wake of the Padawan Massacre of Taris , for which he had been framed .
The fugitive Padawan contacted him from The Last Resort and disclosed the details of what occurred in the Jedi Tower when his fellow students Shad Jelavan , Kamlin , Oojoh , and Gharn were all killed during their Knighting ceremony .
Distraught , Vandar asked him how could he have murdered those he grew up with .
Zayne tried to explain that he barely escaped the same fate , as he was chased by those he found standing among their corpses with their lightsabers drawn , their own teachers , Jedi Masters Feln , Q’Anilia , Raana Tey , Xamar , and Lucien himself .
But Vandar found hard to even contemplate that Lucien , who was the scion of an important family , both in the Republic and in the Jedi Order , could be responsible for such a thing .
Instead , he pondered aloud if Zayne himself may have committed the crime , and subconsciously erased it from his mind .
When Zayne called the Enclave , Vandar was in a meeting with fellow Council members Zhar Lestin , Vrook , and Bala Nisi .
He asked Zhar about any Jedi Consulars serving on Taris , and was surprised to hear that , save Lucien , all Jedi stationed there were Consulars , which was unusual .
Nevertheless , he told Zayne that if he turned himself in , one of those Jedi could probe his mind and help him find the truth .
Just as Zayne pointed out that those were the ones trying to kill him , the transmission got cut by Jarael , who struck Zayne from behind and knocked him unconscious .
The Council of Dantooine follows Carrick ’s arrival on Taris
A dependable Master
Within weeks since the murders , Zayne decided to turn himself in so as to relieve his new companions of the trouble he had brought upon them .
In the Council chamber of the Jedi Enclave , Vandar watched him on a news hologram as he was brought in chains to the Jedi Tower .
However , before he could be killed by Lucien , Zayne was rescued by Jarael , and escaped once again .
The Masters of Taris were then contacted by the Dantooine Jedi Enclave Council and recalled to Coruscant to explain themselves .
As they stood judgment before the High Council , a stern Vrook Lamar would reprimand the five for allowing the deaths of their students , and he would remind them of a recurrent counsel of Vandar ’s about being protectors as much as teachers .
Master Vandar insted regretted he did not listen to Vrook ’s counsel when he expressed disapproval of assigning students to them uneager teachers , feeling now that perhaps that reluctance was , in fact , wisdom .
When Raana
Tey hired the Moomo brothers to stalk Zayne ’s father , banker Arvan Carrick , Master Vandar welcomed his family to Dantooine for as long as they liked , and let Arvan work for the Jedi Enclave .
Dantooine not offering much in the way of financial opportunities , Master Vandar was surprised to hear of his request , which was really to let Zayne ’s mind be at peace with the well - being of his loved ones , while he did what he could to clear his name .
Arvan justified it with the fact that Zayne always spoke of Vandar as of someone he could trust , and that trust meant a lot in banking .
Chasing Shadows
At some point , Lucien Draay was offered a seat on the Jedi High Council as a result of the influence of his family and the manipulations of his former teacher , the shadow leader of the Jedi Covenant , Haazen .
Vrook and Vandar agreed to this , if only to keep a closer look on him and find the truth about the Padawan Massacre .
Tokare found his rise to power rather suspicious , and felt someone else was behind it , but he could not tell who or why .
Haazen was really safe from Vandar ’s grasp in the Living Force , as he relied on a Sith artifact known as the Yoke of Seeming to prevent Jedi from perceiving his intentions .
After the deaths of Feln and Raana Tey , Vandar received a transmission from Shel Jelavan , the sister of one of the victims .
He was informed by her of what took place on Jebble when Covenant Shadow Celeste Morne , a rogue Jedi under Lucien ’s orders , unleashed a powerful dark side artifact which caused the Rakghoul Plague ; and he agreed to meet Shel in a cantina on Coruscant , where he was to ask for “ Captain Malak . ”
The bank Arvan Carrick worked for was co-owned by the Draay Trus a corporation from which half the members of the Jedi High Council received funds for their charitable causes .
With his help , Master Vandar discovered that the true extent of their financial power and influence within the Jedi Order was indeed more than enough to make possible the creation of Jedi Shadows .
Though being very sceptical on this matter , Master Vrook accompanied him to the meeting , and when Vandar made the name of his contact , they found that Captain Malak was none other than Jedi Knight Alek Squinquargesimus , who had come to Coruscant with Shel on Zayne ’s behalf , even though an arrest warrant had been issued on Revanchists , by the Council , on Lucien ’s request .
Shel told the Masters what happened on Taris , when Raana Tey revealed that the head of the Jedi Covenant was Krynda Draay , a Sage Master , and one of the few remaining heroes of the Great Sith War .
However , even when Alek told them that Zayne was bringing a collection of Sith artifacts from a repository on Odryn as evidence to expose the Covenant and clear his name , Master Vrook said that it was not enough to bring the matter before the Council .
He and Vandar realized that if they were to accuse Krynda , the Order would be torn apart , as she had been training Jedi for thirty years after the war , without the supervision of the Council , and retained their allegiance .
When Zayne landed and gave the signal , they set off to meet him .
Just as Master Vandar came to the conclusion that one of the Masters of the Covenant needed to speak up , Xamar stepped forward , ready to confess .
After the events of Vindication , the Council offered to reinstate Zayne into the Order as a Jedi Knight .
But Zayne decided he ’d rather look out for people who fell beneath the Order ’s notice and declined the offer .
Jedi Civil War
During the Jedi Civil War that followed the Mandalorian Wars , Vandar oversaw the training of Revan after he was stripped of his memory by the Jedi Council .
He was also the one who assigned Revan and Bastila to hunt down the Star Maps that would lead to the Star Forge .
Having survived Darth Malak ‘s attack on Dantooine , Master Vandar participated in the Battle of Rakata Prime , acting as an adviser alongside Admiral Forn Dodonna .
After the battle , it was Vandar who proclaimed Revan to be truly redeemed , thus reinstating his former rank of Jedi Knight and also proclaiming him as the “ Prodigal Knight . ”
Master Vandar celebrates the destruction of the Star Forge .
Death
In 3,952 BBY Jedi Master Atris called a Jedi Conclave under the strict agreement of secrecy on the Mid Rim world of Katarr , where the few Jedi who escaped the First Jedi Purge hoped that in communion with the Force - sensitive Miraluka , they would be able to identify the elusive Sith threat that was ending them .
Vandar attended the meeting , not knowing that Atris had secretly leaked knowledge of the gathering in the hopes that the enemy would reveal themselves .
Ruled by his hunger , Darth Nihilus was drawn from the Unknown Regions and fed upon all life on the planet , making the Jedi all but extinct .
Vandar ’s death would be related to the Jedi Exile on Dantooine by his long - time friend Vrook , who had not gone to Katarr , and was still unaware of why or how he had died .
The Exile would learn later on how Atris had even felt what could happen , and still not warned the Jedi , choosing instead to stay safely away and watch .
Powers and abilities
Vandar Tokare was a master of the Ataru form of lightsaber combat , and owned two shotos .
Like most wielders of the Force , he could perform Mind tricks , but he also possessed many strong Force powers such as Sever Force and Force Suppression .
He was also capable of advanced applications of Telekinesis , like levitation , and could wield weapons effectively without his hands .
Aside from Basic , he could also speak Kreva and Draethos language .

German police force replaces sniffer dog with VULTURE named Sherlock to scent out dead bodies
Police sniffer dogs are facing fresh competition when it comes to tracking down dead bodies - from vultures .
Detectives in Germany hope one of the scavengers - called ' Sherlock ' - could be the first of many to help with investigations .
They want to harness Sherlock 's incredible sense of smell to locate corpses in remote areas .
A GPS tracking device is attached to his leg and off he goes .
Elementary : Bird trainer German Alonso shows off Sherlock , a Turkey vulture currently being trained to detect human remains , at Walsrode 's Bird Park last month
The Turkey Vulture is a scavenger and feeds almost exclusively on carrion .
It finds its meals using its keen vision and sense of smell , flying low enough to detect the gasses produced by the beginnings of the process of decay in dead animals .
' It was a colleague of mine who got the idea from watching a nature programme , ' policeman Rainer Herrmann said .
' If it works , time could be saved when looking for dead bodies because the birds can cover a much vaster area than sniffer dogs or humans . '
Birds generally rely mostly on sight to locate their supper .
But vultures like Sherlock have a keen sense of smell and are able to detect the scent of rotting flesh from 3,000 feet up in the air .
He can even find remains in woodland or in thick undergrowth .
Unlike sniffer dogs , who need regular breaks , Sherlock is indefatigable and can cover vast tracts of land .
He is being readied for his new mission at Walsrode south of Hamburg , the largest bird park in the world with 650 different species from all corners and every different habitat of the globe spread over 60 acres .
Nose for trouble : Sherlock can detect the scent of rotting flesh from 3,000 feet up
The bird , whose is more at home soaring over South America 's Andes or the Atacama Desert than northern Germany 's Lueneburg Heath , is being taught by trainer German Alonso to love the putrid smell of dead human flesh .
Every day Alonso puts pieces of meat in small cups , on top of a strip of cloth - provided by the police - that has been used to cover a corpse .
Sherlock 's mission is to locate these tasty morsels .
If time allows , Sherlock is persuaded to perform this feat as part of the park 's daily shows to its many visitors .
' Sherlock has become pretty well known in Germany .
He has been in lots of television programmes and newspaper articles , ' Alonso says .
' Sherlock now has a rough idea of what he has to do . '
But the project still has some way to go .
Alonso says that it wo n't become reality until there is a whole squadron of trained vultures with Sherlock in charge ready to take to the skies as a team .
' But it 's hard to get birds , particularly tame , young ones , ' he said .
Turkey Vultures like Sherlock , also known as Turkey Buzzards , are rare in captivity .
And they have to be tame in order to be trained so they have to be raised from chicks .
' What we need now to make progress is a group working together as a team , ' he said .
' If we had a trio , led by Sherlock , then we could attempt more ambitious stuff , ' he added .
Since the occupation of January 1994 , many have projected their hopes onto this ' exotic ' struggle against ' neo- liberalism ' .
We examine the nature of the Zapatista uprising by moving beyond the bluster of the EZLN communiqués , on which so many base their analysis .
Not proletarian , yet not entirely peasant , the Zapatistas ' political ideas are riven with contradictions .
We reject the academics ' argument of Zapatismo's centrality as the new revolutionary subject , just as we reject the assertions of the ' ultra - left ' that because the Zapatistas do not have a communist programme they are simply complicit with capital .
We see the Zapatistas as a moment in the struggle to replace the reified community of capital with the real human community .
Their battle for land against the rancheros and latifundistas reminds us of capital 's ( permanent ) transitions rather than its apparent permanence .
We have not previously felt moved to comment on the Zapatista uprising , not because we have had no interest , but because we distrusted the way in which so many were quick to project their hopes onto this ' exotic ' struggle .
Everyone from anarchists to Marxist - Leninists , indigenous people 's freaks to social democrats , primitivists to ' Third World ' developmentalists - all seemed able to see what they wanted in the struggle in Chiapas .
Subcommandante Marcos , the shrewd EZLN ( Ejercito Zapatista de Nacional Liberacion ) spokesman , maximised the attractiveness and impact of the Zapatistas on progressive opinion by maintaining a conscious ambiguity around their politics .
For us , however , his demagogic appeals to ' liberty !
justice ! democracy !' were something with which we had little affinity .
It was apparent that making sense of the uprising would require an understanding of what the Indians were doing on the ground , distinct both from the way their spokespeople chose to portray the struggle , and from the way in which this representation was taken up to fulfil the needs of political actors in very different situations .
Two currents have attempted to go beyond the cheerleading for the Zapatistas to provide a more theoretical grasp of this movement .
' Autonomist Marxism ' , now largely based in academia , has embraced the Chiapas revolt , seeing it as central to a new recomposition of the world working class .
On the other hand a much more critical response can be found in a number of ' ultra left ' [ 1 ] inspired articles .
As both tendencies favour autonomous class struggle and oppose traditional leftist ideas , why such different conclusions on the rebellion ?
On one level we can see it as a matter of a different theoretical approach .
While the autonomists focus on the movement of struggle , thinking in terms of a generalisation of Zapatismo , the ' ultra left ' look more to the content of Zapatista politics - their programme - the limits of which they identify in the democratic and nationalist framework into which the Indians ' struggle has been projected .
[ 2 ]
At the same time , while the autonomists wish to move with the mood of solidarity and inspiration the uprising has created , the ' ultra left ' are disturbed by the way that identification with the EZLN is functioning , which has similarities to the role of anti-imperialist and Third Worldist ideology in the past .
Support for existing struggle can become an ideological identification which represses criticism .
However , criticism of struggle does not have to lead to an ideological turn against it .
Our interest in the struggle in Mexico is how it expresses the universal movement towards the supersession of the capitalist mode of production .
One needs to avoid acting as judge of every manifestation of this universal movement , dismissing those manifestations which do n't measure up , while at the same time avoiding uncritical prostration before such expressions .
The real movement must always be open , self - critical , prepared to identify limits to its present practice , and to overcome them .
Here it is understood that communism ' is not an ideal to which reality must accommodate itself . '
Our task is to understand , and to be consciously part of something which already truly exists - the real movement that seeks to abolish the existing conditions .
Introduction : The Mexican context
In past issues of Aufheben we have examined the retreat by the international bourgeoisie from the use of social democracy as a form of mediating class struggle , and asked whether it may reappear from future class struggle .
So far we have focused our attention on Europe and North America .
The retreat from social democracy is not confined to these areas , however .
Class struggle in Mexico has been distorted for decades by a particularly durable strain of social democracy , personified by the Partido Revolucionario Institucional , the Party of the Institutional Revolution ( PRI ) .
Social democracy is everywhere in retreat in Mexico .
But the recent nine - month strike by students of the Autonomous University of Mexico ( UNAM ) over tuition fees and the electricity workers ' successful campaign against privatisation of the power grid are both indications of a new climate of resistance to the waves of economic rationalisation .
Marching together in Mexico City demanding the release of political prisoners , they have formulated the beginnings of an alternative to so - called ' neoliberalism ' [ 3 ] - an alternative , it must be said , that as yet appears unable to move beyond the crushing weight of social democracy that is the heritage of the Mexican working class .
If anything in the recent history of class struggle in this gigantic country is able to look practically beyond social democracy , to the possibility of the constitution of human community over the reified community of capital , it is the struggle of the Zapatista Indians of Chiapas .
A brief chronology [ 4 ]
The Zapatistas first came to the attention of Mexico , and the world , when they occupied the Chiapan towns of San Cristobal de las Casas , Las Margaritas , Altamirano and Ocosingo on January 1st 1994 , the day the North American Free Trade Agreement ( NAFTA ) was due to begin operation .
After destroying civil records and reading out their proclamation of revolt from the balcony of the Town Hall , the EZLN laid siege to the nearby military base of Rancho Nuevo , capturing weapons and releasing prisoners from the region 's jails .
The Mexican army responded savagely .
The Zapatista army was dislodged relatively easily from the towns ( although there was quite a fight in Ocosingo ) and air force bombers followed the retreating indigenous soldiers back into the highlands , Los Altos .
January 10th saw a half - million strong demonstration for peace in Mexico City .
Within days the President , Carlos Salinas , unnerved by the sympathetic attention the Indians were receiving and the jitters of the stock market , which had lost 6.2 % of its value since the uprising had begun , called a halt to the bombings and summary executions .
February and March saw peace negotiations take place in San Cristobal , at which time the popular image of the rebel Indian dressed in black , wearing a ski-mask and toting a gun became an archetype .
This period also saw the beginning of the Mexican media 's love affair with Subcommandante Marcos , the apparent spokesman of the EZLN .
Despite visible headway , the differences between the ladino ( European blood ) politicians and the indigenous peasant were irreconcilable .
The PRI wished to limit the negotiations , and therefore the uprising itself , to the status of a ' local difficulty . '
The Indians wanted to intervene politically on a much broader scale .
Once the negotiations had ended , the EZLN representatives took the proposals back to the village assemblies of the Zapatista heartlands where , after three months of discussion , they were massively rejected .
A return to war , however , was little more than suicide .
To overcome this bind , the Zapatistas decided to call a National Democratic Convention ( CND ) in their jungle base of the Lacandon .
Coming weeks before the Presidential election , which is held every six years in Mexico , the CND would be an opportunity to bring all the anti-PRI elements of ' civil society ' together to discuss strategy .
But if the Convention was a success in terms of the numbers attending , and therefore a timely morale - booster for the besieged Indians , nothing concrete came of it .
Defined only by their hatred of the PRI , these disparate groups could agree on nothing : the inspiration they took from the struggle of the Indians did not translate into a common political project .
[ 5 ]
With the routine re-election of the PRI candidate , Ernesto Zedillo , later that month , the EZLN went into crisis and stayed quiet at the national level for a number of months .
Throughout 1994 - 95 though , the Indians of eastern Chiapas were seizing more and more land ( over 1,500 properties representing more than 90,000 hectares were taken in the period up to June 1995 ) , evicting landowners and organising their new villages into autonomous municipalities .
Protected from the violence of the landowner 's private armies , the Guardias Blancas ( White Guards ) and other assorted goons by the implied threat of EZLN guns , these municipalities , of which there are currently thirty - two , were growing ever larger and threatened to encroach upon the vital oil fields of north - east Chiapas .
Meanwhile the army tightened its cordon , building new roads and bases .
December 1994 saw the EZLN break through the blockade and surround the Mexican army , before disappearing into the countryside .
In Mexico City , investment flooded out of the stock market after Zedillo was forced to devalue the peso dramatically , an action as traditional for the PRI as their routine polling victories .
In February 1995 the army launched a new offensive with much destruction of villages and crops .
Demonstrations were immediate in Mexico City .
Now the slogan was not ' Peace in Chiapas ' but ' We are all Zapatistas ' .
Once again the army quickly called off their bludgeoning .
Later that year new peace talks began in the Zapatista town of San Andres Larrainzar .
The PRI would discuss only indigenous issues , and refused to countenance any Zapatista criticism of Mexico 's new neoliberal economics .
Although an Accord on Indigenous Rights and Cultures was signed , which the Zapatistas still view as a great victory , the PRI has since refused to implement it anywhere .
This Accord was intended to be the first of five , but it was by now clear that the PRI were using the peace talks to buy time in which to further militarise eastern Chiapas .
The EZLN cancelled the discussions .
July 1996 , with the peace process still ostensibly going forward , saw the ' First Intercontinental Gathering for Humanity and against Neoliberalism ' ( Encuentro ) .
Four thousand delegates from many different countries attended this inaugural conference in the Lacandon jungle .
Two have been held since , in Spain and Brazil .
Summer ' 96 also saw the appearance of a new guerilla group , the Ejercito Popular Revolucionario ( EPR ) which attacked the army in its home state of Guerrero .
The EZLN refused to develop links with the EPR , accusing them of reproducing a particular type of vanguard model of armed struggle which is sometimes called foquismo in Latin America .
The last couple of years has , however , seen a split in the EPR , from which the EPR - I ( EPR - Indigenous ) has emerged .
This group has based itself on the Zapatista model and some links have been developed with the EZLN .
However , recently the structure of the EPR - I has been affected by the capture and imprisonment of some of its leaders by the state .
Unable to reach any accommodation with the PRI yet unable to restart their war , the EZLN continue to find themselves at an impasse .
The creation of the FZLN ( Frente Zapatista de Nacional Liberacion ) during 1996 was an attempt to provide a political forum outside Chiapas for ' civil society ' .
Set up by the Zapatistas , they themselves have refused to join , claiming that they might dominate proceedings .
Subsequently the FZLN has been riven by the ideological ambitions of the Mexico City left , and is commonly considered a failure .
Since then the Zapatistas have fallen back upon nationwide publicity drives .
These have the dual role of keeping their struggle and the militarisation of eastern Chiapas in the public eye , while simultaneously building solidarity networks as they reach out across Mexico .
September 1997 saw 1,111 Zapatistas , one from each autonomous village , march from Chiapas to Mexico City , picking up supporters along the way .
March 1999 saw La Consulta : 5000 male and female Zapatistas visited every municipality in Mexico in order to hold a ballot on indigenous rights and the military build - up in Chiapas .
Despite the blockade , the Mexican army is unable to break the power of the autonomous municipalities .
This is partly because the measures needed to achieve this would result in eastern Chiapas becoming a charnel house , and the PRI has been unwilling to court that sort of international attention .
The army for their part are reluctant .
The generals know their troops come largely from Mexico 's urban slums and have no real quarrel with the Zapatistas .
A prolonged and vicious attack could quickly bring insubordination and mutiny into the picture .
Indeed , according to one officer who has since fled to the US , around a hundred Mexican soldiers deserted in the opening weeks of the Chiapas war .
Instead , the army have taken to training paramilitaries , for which they afterwards claim no responsibility .
The group Mascara Rojo ( Red Mask ) carried out the Acteal massacre of December 1997 , the single worst atrocity yet in this struggle , in which 45 EZLN sympathisers , including women and children , were gunned down .
Naturally the PRI then use such moments to justify sending yet more troops into the area - in order to ' control the paramilitaries ' .
Even so , the army has occasionally been let off the leash : April to June 1998 saw attacks on the autonomous municipalities of Flores Magon , Tierra y Libertad and San Juan de Libertad .
As a result of these and other incursions , the number of refugees in Chiapas is now over 20,000 .
1999 saw better prospects .
In September hundreds of UNAM strikers travelled to Chiapas for meetings with the EZ .
Desperate to stop the two sides meeting , the army and police pulled out all the stops on the dirt roads leading to the autonomous communities , though a few got through .
The UNAM occupation in Mexico City was smashed by an enormous dawn raid in February 2000 and hundreds of students incarcerated on ludicrous terrorism charges .
The UNAM strike , the largest student movement since 1968 , could have all sorts of effects on Mexico 's class struggle .
No doubt some students will be recuperated by the state but further contestation seems inevitable for many .
The independent electricity workers union has also sent delegations to eastern Chiapas .
In their fight against privatisation of the electricity grid they have formed a National Forum which has been joined by over two hundred independent union sections and other social organisations .
The electristas appear to have won their battle , though the threat has been lifted partly because privatisation remains unpopular and 2000 is an election year .
Rationalisation in the electricity industry could easily be resurrected by the bourgeoisie in 2001 or 2002 .
The soil in which these struggles are rooted is still fertile .
As the Zapatista supporters in San Cristobal say ' Nobody in Mexico knows what will happen next . '
The present article is an attempt to analyse the nature of the Zapatista uprising by moving beyond the bluster of the EZLN communiques , on which so many base their analysis of the EZLN .
First however , we must examine the roots of the modern state - the Mexican Revolution .
Part 1 : The Roots of the Modern State
The Revolution is the touchstone of Mexican politics .
The period saw the Mexican state begin its transformation from an oligarchical - landowners ' government to the one - party corporatist model which survived for so long .
The Revolution is also crucial to understanding the peculiar social base from which the Mexican state is constructed , with its formal recuperation of worker and peasant organisations , and its need to regularly embark upon sprees of revolutionary rhetoric .
The revolution was driven forward by the peasants ' attack on the latifundias , or large estates , the dominant mode of accumulation in Mexico at the time .
Despite subsequent industrialization , the latifundias have persisted - even grown - and have remained a locus of class struggle ever since , most recently in Chiapas .
To grasp the importance of land struggles in Mexico we need to understand how the latifundias operate , and how they plug into the cycles of national accumulation . [ 6 ]
The latifundias
The Porfiriato , the administration of Porfirio Diaz , ruled Mexico from 1876 to 1910 .
Its social base was the latifundistas , the large landowners , and it was their class interests that were transmitted through the government .
The rapid industrialisation that Mexico was undergoing at the turn of the twentieth century was confined to tiny areas of the country , and the industrial bourgeoisie as a class were too weak to make much political headway in the Porfiriato .
The large estates originated from the fallout of the Reform War , which had ended in 1867 .
The victorious Liberal wing of the oligarchy intended to create a limited system of small landholdings that would be constructed mainly from confiscated Church property and the expropriated communal land of Indians .
But almost as soon as these smallholdings came into existence they were aggressively acquired by a new breed of landowner ( the latifundista ) , the smallholder generally being unable to exist solely on his land .
These smallholders became either poorly - paid day - labourers ( i.e. seasonally employed ) or debt - peons , little more than slaves .
In the southern and central areas of Mexico , the latifundistas further expanded their property by violently evicting peasants ( campesinos ) from their ejidos ( communal production units ) .
This process produced continual class conflict in the countryside .
The expansion of the latifundia property - form penetrated the countryside only to the extent that the local populace could be suppressed .
Faced with widespread resistance , the landowners organised the Guardias Blancas ( White Guards , usually campesinos - turned - bandit , in turn recruited back to the Side of Order ) .
The fact that these brutal paramilitary groups have been a constant part of rural life ever since indicates that the peasants have never admitted defeat in the land war , and the landowners know it .
The latifundias , which were usually centred on a lavish , European - style hacienda , were the wellspring of surplus extraction in the economy .
Sugar , coffee , cotton , India rubber : exported abroad , as well as serving the needs of the internal market , these were the sources of wealth for the landowning classes .
And if the international trade cycle contracted , the latifundia could easily withdraw into limited , or even subsistence , production .
The cost of the reproduction of labour fell always on the villages outside the property and never on the hacienda .
While the elasticity of this form of accumulation accounts for its longevity , it was in many ways backward .
The commodification of labour - power and money relations had spread to an extent throughout the agricultural sector , but were by no means universal .
On many haciendas the landowners paid their workers in produce , or forced them to purchase from an employer 's shop .
Via this payment in kind campesinos usually ended up in debt , which tended to rise at a greater rate than the peasant was able to pay it off .
As a result of this dependency , the campesino became a peon , tied forever to the hacienda .
The fact that debts were passed on from father to son only helped to preserve this distorted form of value extraction .
If a campesino attempted to escape , the Guardias Blancas would follow .
Zapatismo and the Ayala Plan
By 1911 , revolt was breaking out in the north and centre of Mexico , triggered by the corruption of the Porfiriato and the violence of the landowners .
In the countryside , the peasant uprising took the form of land seizures .
It is the scale of the attack on the latifundias that is the defining characteristic of the Mexican Revolution .
With the absence of fully - developed wage - relations , exploitation was more immediate : the campesinos were able to personally identify their class enemies and exact violent revenge .
The Zapatista movement was the highpoint of these years .
The campesinos of Morelos and Puebla constructed not only a revolutionary army , they also produced , in the Ayala Plan , a coherent political programme that asserted their needs against those of capital .
The Ayala Plan spelled out in detail the Zapatista programme of land redistribution : broadly , expropriation of private land for public utility , dispossessed individuals and communities , with a guarantee of protection for small landholdings .
The Plan was both a codification of what was already happening and a fillip to further land takeovers .
Landlords , Mexican and foreign , were fleeing in their thousands .
With the landowners chased out of Morelos , the Zapatistas attempted to place limits on the future possibility of petty - bourgeois accumulation .
One example is the proposal for agricultural banks , a confused attempt , but an attempt nevertheless , to temper the power of money in favour of social needs .
Of course , had the land redistribution project been allowed to thrive with the continuation of money relations as a whole , a new generation of landowners would eventually have developed from the ranks of the revolutionary peasants .
In the Ayala Plan we find a communist tendency towards communal land ; at the same time a very uncommunist tolerance of small farmers , perfectly in keeping with what Teodor Shanin calls the ' different world ' of the peasantry , [ 7 ] and which we shall examine later .
The end of the Morelos Commune
If the Zapatistas had , at least in the short term , resolved the contradiction of their class position by favouring the communal over the incipient bourgeois , in shared land rather than private property , they were unable to resolve a further contradiction , and one which led ultimately to the smashing of their stronghold , the Morelos Commune , by the reconstituted power of the state .
While the revolutionary campesino was ( almost literally ) everywhere , they were unable as a class to move beyond their localist perspective .
The Ayala Plan was the most sophisticated attempt to intervene on a national level - yet it talked about the land and nothing else .
Unlike the revolutionary proletariat , separated forever from the means of production , they did not see the need to transcend their class , and with it all classes .
The revolutionary working class needs to talk about everything in its attempts to generalise its struggles ; the peasantry believes it needs only to talk about the land .
The campesinos of this period had struggled around their needs , had largely succeeded , and now found themselves unable to develop further .
The revolutionary peasants who in December 1914 occupied Mexico City were undoubtedly one of the highest expressions of class struggle in the world at that time .
The workers of Europe were drowning in their own blood and the Russian Revolution was still three years away .
By contrast , the whole of Mexico was at the peasants ' feet .
The national power of the bourgeoisie was smashed and its survivors had retreated to the eastern port of Veracruz .
Yet it was at precisely this moment that the traditional peasant deference , which is rooted in the contradictory nature of peasant existence and the cultural baggage that accompanies it , asserted itself .
Refusing a political solution from within themselves , and trusting that military strength alone would prevail , they inadvertently left the door open to a weak but reconstituting state power .
This inability to find a wider social perspective is at least something the present day Zapatistas , with all their limitations , have been obliged to overcome , while many of their campesino brothers and sisters in the west of Chiapas are still unable to make the jump from atomised deference to communal organisation .
The preamble to the Ayala Plan had ruled out any compromises with the bourgeois leader Madero and other ' dictatorial associates . '
Yet the Zapatistas were chronically unable to see beyond their own backyard .
This blindness to the threat of the state was the highest contradiction of the exemplary peasant movement of the Mexican Revolution .
The working class
Individually , many miners , railwaymen and textile workers joined the peasant Northern Division , which had entered into a de facto alliance with the Zapatista Southern Liberation Army .
As a class , however , and despite a huge strike wave in 1906 , they remained quiet until 1915 .
The peasant armies which had occupied Mexico City had failed to inspire working class support , or indeed relate to them in any way .
As a result , in exchange for union concessions from the revolutionary bourgeoisie , the reformist federation of unions , the Casa del Obrera Mundial ( COM ) agreed to form ' Red Battalions ' to fight the Northern Division and the Zapatisatas .
Although this decision did not go unopposed - the electricians ' union refused to abide by the pact - the Red Battalions fought alongside what were known as the Constitutionalist armies throughout 1915 .
Yet only a year later the working class was paying the price for this complicity .
The new bourgeoisie , having beaten off the threat from the peasants , no longer needed the unions .
COM headquarters was stormed by troops and unionists across the country arrested .
The following year , 1916 , the first general strike in Mexican history was crushed .
Despite this , however , the power of the organised working class remained formidable .
The 1917 Constitution
Just like the Revolution , the 1917 Constitution is a vital touchstone in Mexican life , a document that came into existence as a result of prolonged struggle , and is still held in high regard today by many sections of the working class and peasantry .
The bourgeoisie clearly intended the new set of state rules to be a signal that the years of chaos and civil war were over and a new cycle of accumulation could begin .
Knowing the erosion of the gains of the Revolution would only be tolerated to a degree by the peasants and the working class , the new bourgeoisie institutionalised itself as the revolutionary party - state , marginalising competing currents within its own class by mobilising popular opinion .
It is the evolution of this party - state that accounts for the lack of parliamentary democracy in Mexico , and explains the concentration of power in the hands of one man , the President .
Despite many knocks this specific formation of the bourgeoisie has survived - just - the twentieth century .
In the advanced capitalist countries , the illusion of alternatives through democracy is at the centre of the reproduction and expansion of the capitalist mode of production .
Democracy mediates between competing interests within the ruling class , while at the same time countering tendencies towards corruption in the relation between state and capital .
In Mexico , there is a hole where this mediation might exist - a hole that is instead plugged by the extraordinary way in which workers ' and peasants ' organisations have been formally co-opted by the state .
Part 2 : The Changing Face of the Institutional Revolution
Radical social democracy to the rescue
It was not until 1931 that labour 's representatives were fully incorporated into the state .
This acceptance of the working class as the working class , as a potentially antagonistic class who must be brought into the fold to neutralise their revolutionary impulses , is the basis of the social democracy the Mexican bourgeoisie utilised for decades .
( As late as 1988 , President Salinas could still trumpet the ' indestructible pact between the Revolutionary government and the working class . ')
With its proximity to , and integration with , US capital , Mexico was profoundly affected by the Wall Street Crash .
By 1934 the bourgeoisie had comprehensively failed to restore stable class relations for the accumulation of capital .
Exacerbated by the Depression and the militant recomposition of both the peasantry and the proletariat , revolutionary change from below was once more on the agenda .
If American capital - in - general was now reluctantly going along with the New Deal , the solution to the crisis in Mexico had to be far more radical .
Most individual Mexican capitals recognised the objectively higher level of class struggle .
The nightmare of 1914 haunted them more than ever .
As such the Mexican ruling class 's radical solution to the crisis opened up the possibility of fostering a movement that would not go home when it was told to , that could develop in its own direction and rupture forever the fabric of bourgeois society .
This radicalised form of social democracy came through the conduit of Lazaro Cardenas , President from 1934 - 40 .
His first and most important task was to sign a pact with the new CGOCM ( Confederation of Workers and Peasants ) .
By 1935 half of all Mexico 's organised workers were in CGOCM and strikes were going through the roof .
Cardenas immediately recognised the right to strike , poured money into CGOCM patronage and shifted the sympathy of the state 's labour relations boards away from the employer and towards the working class as represented by the unions .
In 1936 CGOCM was renamed the CTM ( Confederation of Mexican Workers ) and recognised as the official national labour movement .
The highpoint of the radical social democratic project came in 1938 , with Cardenas 's nationalisation of the largely US - owned oil industry .
Cardenas manipulated the enthusiasm for this measure to generate a spirit of ' national unity ' , which he then used to crush the insurgent workers ' movement .
It was not only the cities the radical party - state had to attend to in order to prevent social revolution breaking out .
The countryside had ignited and sustained the Revolution , and could do so again .
Cardenas 's solution was a massive redistribution of land the like of which social democracy in Mexico has not been compelled to repeat .
Naturally only the worst land was parcelled out - the property and interests of the hacendados left intact .
While the Cardenas reforms appeared impressive , they not only preserved social relations in the rural areas , they bolstered and expanded commodity relations by creating a new class of small landowners .
For the vast majority a small patch was unsustainable and seasonal wage - labour unavoidable .
The ultimate result of the land reforms was marginalisation for the many , a new network of small competitive farming for some , and the consolidation of the lumbering latifundias .
In fact Cardenas had mobilised the working class in part to discipline those recalcitrant sections of the bourgeoisie who needed to be saved from themselves .
After 1940 the bourgeoisie as a whole accepted the necessity of state intervention .
Even more crucially , any revolutionary movement from below could be mediated through the now - reliable CTM or the new CNC ( National Campesino Confederation ) .
As part of the party - state , these organisations could deliver certain concessions , defuse proletarian and peasant anger through nationalist channels and turn a blind eye to repression if it was needed .
The state had solved the crisis it had been mired in since the fall of the Porfiriato , and it has followed the same model until very recently : one party guaranteeing social democracy ( peace between the officially - recognised antagonistic classes ) .
Unlike the west , it has not needed the shield of formal bourgeois democracy to do so .
The Economy after 1940
The American Fordist model of accumulation , whereby increased productivity pays for higher wages , which in turn boosts demand , could not be followed in Mexico .
The native bourgeoisie was too weak to innovate and had always relied on America for heavy industrial investment .
The agricultural sector still lagged far behind that of America .
While US capital may not consciously have wanted to keep Mexico underdeveloped , it saw it generally as fit only for natural resource and labour - power exploitation .
Mexico did , though , industrialise rapidly after 1940 .
The model was state - led capitalism with its own Mexican peculiarities .
Investment in infrastructure was the province of the state .
Petroleum , rail and communications sectors were all under state control , and the state generally carried out economic development which the private sector thought too risky .
The resources of the state were augmented by huge foreign investment .
Mexico has always been a natural first stop for America 's foreign - bound surplus value ; now it flooded over the border as a result of the post - war boom .
By the 1960s , Mexico had been enjoying its economic ' miracle ' for some time .
GDP had risen on average 6 - 7 % annually .
Profit flowed into state coffers , paying for an unofficial welfare state of sorts .
However social inequality was reaching new extremes .
By 1969 the proportion of national income going to the poorest half of the population was only 15 % .
In rural areas , as agricultural mechanisation increased and productive land was concentrated , the number of un - or underemployed was going up .
Some , seeking to refuse proletarianisation , moved away from the agricultural heartlands and attempted to chip out a living from barely cultivatable land - this being the option many Chiapan Indians took ; many moved to the cities to join the reserve army and effectively kept factory and workshop wages down ; some became migrant workers following the harvests through Morelos , Oaxaca , San Luis Potosi and Veracruz .
Still others crossed the border into the US . [ 8 ]
In the towns and cities even the organised industrial proletariat suffered from low wages .
While they were relatively well off compared to those in small workshops or the unemployed , struggling to survive in any way that they could , their wages were a fraction of their US counterparts ' .
Their union organisation militated for higher wages , yet this was offset by the absolute corruption of the charros ( union bureaucrats ) , who would often swipe their members ' dues .
More than anything being in a strong union meant a guarantee of a job , a buttress against unemployment .
However , for the ' pillars of society ' , those sections of the population incorporated into the party - state , the costs of the reproduction of labour were paid , after a fashion - by the ' PRI welfare state ' .
It is difficult to quantify , but the far - reaching web of the PRI guaranteedan existence for those sections of society it needed to perpetuate itself .
Whether it be official ( wage rises ) or unofficial ( backhanders , protection or the elimination of a rival ) , it all had to be paid for .
The corruption of the PRI welfare state has certainly retarded the efficiency of Mexican industry , prompting many members of the bourgeoisie to defect to the PAN ( National Action Party ) , the pro-business Catholic party set up in the 1930s to oppose the Cardenist reforms .
The 1959 Movements
1958 - 59 saw a sustained offensive by the proletariat over both wage levels and the control of union charros . [ 9 ]
It is difficult to know to what extent working class self - activity was mediated ; certainly the railwaymen's , electricians ' and teachers ' strikes were led by the Communist Party , and all the ideological drag of Stalinism was present .
Dissident Marxist leaders were also prominent , but presumably their beliefs were variations on a theme .
However , the fact that the Communist Party was proscribed from 1946 to 1977 meant that following them led to an immediate challenge to the law of the land : the 1959 movements led frequently to violent confrontation with the state .
Capital also reacted to 1959 .
Wary of the working class 's proven power over the railways , much investment now shifted into air freight and automobile production to begin a new round of accumulation - and struggle .
Mexico's ' 68
By the late 60s the inability of the PRI to reform and democratise itself was apparent to many sections of society , and was a major contributing factor to the student revolt of 1968 .
These students were bent on giving cardiac therapy to the cadaver of the Revolution - determined to rejuvenate the egalitarianism of the 1917 Constitution .
The movement , in its concentrated phase of July - October became radicalised through its many violent confrontations with the state .
Their numbers were swollen by pissed - off proletarians angry at the spectacle and expenditure of the imminent Olympic Games .
Ten days before the Games were due to open , around five hundred students were killed and 2,500 wounded in the Tlatelolco massacre .
The army attack , which has been marked every year since by demonstrations , finally blew the lid off the PRI 's claims to revolutionary legitimacy .
It also damaged the party - state in more concrete ways : traditionally unconcerned about using clubs and bullets against workers and peasants , the PRI now found itself shooting down middle class students - its the natural constituency for reproduction .
Many students , though , were brought back ' within budget ' after a time in prison .
Those who had moved beyond a critique of the PRI to a wider critique of capitalism were forced out of Mexico City to towns and cities that carried less personal risk .
For those being actively pursued by the state , this meant disappearing into Mexico 's vast hinterlands .
There is a direct lineage from the Tlateloloco massacre to the many guerilla groups that appeared in the rural margins in the early 1970s .
Tainted by the militarist ideology of Che or Mao , these were all smashed with the help of the CIA by 1975 .
The early 1970s - economic crisis
And there was a new problem .
The economic boom stemming from the industrialisation process and the PRI employment protection racket , which had partly offset the traditional role of the reserve army , meant the nationalised industries were severely overmanned and inefficient , and run by an entrenched working class accustomed to relatively high wages .
They say that when America sneezes , Mexico catches a cold .
Now mired in its own crisis of accumulation , America in the early 1970s was taking Mexico down with it .
As capital increasingly freed itself from national boundaries , transforming itself into highly mobile finance capital , investment flooded away from the industrial heartlands of both North America and Mexico to the Pacific Rim economies .
The recession gave the bourgeoisie less scope for conceding the above - inflation wage rises that had headed off trouble in the past .
As a result the negotiating position of the charros was considerably weakened .
With the ideals - and repression - of the student movement fresh , the working class , particularly from 1973 , began a series of strikes , go - slows and demonstrations .
Just like 1959 , their demands were over wages and the removal of corrupt union leaders : a struggle for autonomy that raised the possibility of going beyond the trade union form as such .
The movement organised new unions outside the CTM and formed currents of resistance within it . [ 10 ]
The fact that the workers had often to physically fight the charros and their goons , who sometimes used the tools of disappearance and assassination , meant that the CTM could easily and visibly be identified as the enemy .
While few workers seem to have used this as an opportunity from which to develop a critique of wage - labour , there can be no doubt that the mid ' 70s strike movement increased both the self - confidence of the Mexican working class , and the sense of their being an antagonistic class , the opposition to , and negation of , the bourgeoisie .
The movement reached its height in 1976 .
The radical electricians ' union , who had brought together new unions , urban squatter groups , and peasant organisations to form the ' National Front of Labour , Peasant and Popular Insurgency ' , now called a national strike .
The administration responded by sending the army to occupy every electrical installation in Mexico .
This was only the most visible of the many acts of repression which pushed the new labour militancy into defeat .
The state also responded with massive social spending .
Foreign investment , however , was flooding out of Mexico .
Moreover , state expenditure on unproductive industries staffed by rebellious workers was never going to solve the crisis of accumulation .
Then an unexpected and propitious discovery gave the bourgeoisie room to manoeuvre - oil .
Oil boom - and bust
As a result of the oil boom , the economy was growing at around 8 % by the end of the 1970s .
Not only had the discovery of new petroleum deposits pulled Mexico out of the recession that had begun in 1973 , the growth and concomitant wage rises had served to head off the snowballing class struggle .
The oil still in the ground off the Yucatan peninsula and in Chiapas was used as collateral for huge loans from abroad .
Western banks , stuffed with surplus petrodollars as a result of the OPEC oil price hike eagerly lent out these vast sums to Mexico and many other ' Third World ' nations .
The loans were used to cover both the trade and the budget deficits .
The bourgeoisie assumed the price of oil would continue to rise , as it had done since 1973 : the extent of their loans was predicated on future oil revenue .
However , the price of oil dropped sharply after 1979 .
Coupled with rising interest rates that pushed the external debt ever higher , Mexico in 1982 was unable to keep to its scheduled repayments .
By then , the nation owed $ 92.4 billion , the third largest international debt after the US and Brazil .
In August of that year , Mexico triggered the international debt crisis by declaring a moratorium on its repayments .
In so doing it brought the international banking system to the edge of collapse .
Western banks were soon refusing loans of any kind to the whole of Latin America which was consequently plunged into a decade - long recession .
In a desperate attempt to stem the haemorrhaging of capital , the then - President Lopez Portillo in almost his final act nationalised the banks .
In so doing he followed firmly in the tradition of PRI economic nationalists who blame foreign , and especially US , capital of bleeding their country dry .
In fact the bank nationalisation was the last time the economic nationalist card was be played with any real content .
The Lost Decade
1982 -1992 is sometimes called the Lost Decade in Mexico .
The story is a familiar one : having to go to the IMF for money to keep the economy afloat , the PRI found themselves obliged to roll the state back from the arena of capital .
This meant bringing the budget deficit under control , removing state subsidies to industry and agriculture , and lowering wages in order to stem the runaway inflation which had been fuelled by the oil mirage .
State enterprises were privatised by the fistful , usually offloaded at below market value to PRI cronies .
And 1986 saw Mexico finally joining GATT after years of protectionism : many companies went bankrupt as a result .
In December 1987 the Economic Solidarity Pact was signed by representatives of government , the unions and business .
( Many of these union leaders had come to prominence through the struggles of the 1970s ) .
Restraint in wage demands and price controls on consumer goods was agreed .
The Pact was nothing less than an attempt to preserve the social fabric so that restructuring could go ahead unfettered .
But its very existence raised the possibility of its being wrecked by a new proletarian offensive .
Unfortunately the terrain of struggle had changed .
While the struggle for autonomy in the 1970s had ended at the time of the oil boom , capital was now in a much less expansive position .
If the crisis of accumulation was to be solved restructuring was essential .
The offensive anti-charro struggles of the working class now became purely defensive and economic .
As plants were closed or privatised , workers made redundant or had their wages lowered , the struggle oriented itself around sectional bread - and - butter issues , which engendered fragmentation .
Better - paid CTM workers were still relatively protected , and the 1970s generation of charros were consequently in a much more credible position to mediate struggle .
And if the situation became desperate , there was always the allure of the US border for the desperate proletarian .
Two moments from the 1980s indicate , however , that overt class antagonism had not vanished from the Mexican landscape .
The first is to be found in the weeks following the devastation caused by the 1985 Mexico City earthquake .
With the government paralysed , the residents of Mexico City 's barrios formed themselves , initially , into rescue and medical teams , and shortly thereafter into community groups .
These groups both rebuilt houses and prevented the incursions of landlords , many of whom wished to use the earthquake as an excuse to evict their tenants and rebuild the neighbourhoods with middle class housing at middle class prices .
From these autonomous working class formations came a network of self - help groups , groups that make up part of what the Zapatistas call ' civil society ' . [ 11 ]
A more dissipated , but nevertheless important response to the austerity programme was the Presidential election of 1988 .
Cuauhtemoc Cardenas , a renegade PRI politician , stood against the PRI - and ' won ' .
Soon afterwards he formed the PRD , now the ' official ' left opposition in Mexico .
The PRD is very much old school PRI : for state intervention , increased welfare , a measure of land redistribution , against GATT and NAFTA .
Prior to 1988 , the PRI had only to manage electoral fraud on a gubernatorial level .
The Cardenas challenge was so unexpected and so overwhelming that the party - state panicked and fixed the results in the crudest possible manner .
Mexico City was immediately alive with anti-PRI demonstrations .
The TV screens showing the polling percentages had simply gone blank for hours , and mountains of votes marked for Cardenas were found piled on the Distrito Federal 's rubbish tips or floating down Mexico 's waterways .
Elections in Mexico often carry such a heavy coercive element that they can be a world away from the pure bourgeois individuality of elections in the West .
PRIistas are usually present in gangs around the ballot boxes , and refusal to vote the right way could mean losing a job , having your child barred from school or simply being given a beaten .
Thus a refusal to vote PRI is not taken lightly , and is much more likely to occur after discussions and agreement with friends and neighbours .
This need to come together collectively immediately and paradoxically raises the possibility of a world beyond democracy .
The Tequila Effect and Beyond
With cheap American commodities just over the border , Mexico is adept at sucking in goods from abroad , leading to periodic crises in the balance of payments which have usually been solved by devaluing the peso .
The peso was overvalued in 1994 - but everyone assumed the PRI had sufficient foreign currency reserves to protect it .
In fact these reserves had fallen from $ 33bn in February to only $ 2.5 bn in December , money which had been used to cover the yawning balance of payments deficit .
Such a dramatic erosion also shows just how quickly the relatively protected Mexican market was opened up by NAFTA .
On the 20th of December , the new Zedillo administration announced a one - off devaluation of 15 % .
Panicked foreign investors scrambled to get out of both pesos and Mexico .
The PRI used the last of its foreign currency reserves to bolster the peso , but two days later it was forced to float the currency on the markets , where it dropped 40 % against the dollar .
With the dollar such an important factor in Mexico - companies and the government generally having their loans denominated in dollars - the devaluation now meant the debt burden in the economy had risen massively .
International debt default seemed once again to be on the cards .
And what was being called the Tequila Effect could spread - for Latin America , only recently recovered from the years of international finance isolation that had resulted from the 1982 default , this would be nothing short of catastrophic .
Despite the isolationists in Washington , a $ 50 bn rescue package was put together by the US and IMF , specifically to service short - term debt .
In March 1995 the PRI announced an austerity programme that included a 10 % cut in government spending , increased VAT , fuel and electricity price rises and imposed credit restraints .
Meanwhile , with interest rates soaring at 120 % , many businesses and mortgage - owners were unable to keep up their repayments , despite a new government subsidy for the middle class .
Seven banks collapsed and needed rescuing by the government .
The true cost of this bailout only became apparent in 1999 - $ 93bn , nearly 20 % of GDP !
This debt , which is accruing 18 % yearly interest , and which the PRI has hidden from public accounts , falls due in 2003 .
Unless it is restructured soon , the Mexican capitalist class may find themselves in trouble yet again .
The response of the working class to this austerity package was determined by the depth of the recession that followed .
Unlike 1987 , the CTM refused to sign an economic pact with the government and business .
Consequently there was no official policy of wage restraint during this crucial time .
But the refusal to endorse austerity was hardly in response to a militant working class movement within the CTM tent .
Rather it was because , their social base undermined by privatisation , the CTM now found itself in much stiffer competition with independent unions and was compelled to posture a little more credibly .
Neither , however , were the independent unions arenas of militant anti-austerity .
Shocked by the scale of the 1995 recession - one million out of work , another four million working less than fifteen hours a week - the working class was unable to move beyond the fragmentation wrought by the economy and which the trade union form accepts .
Furthermore , the PRIs targeted anti-poverty programme PRONASOL , which had come into being as a result of the 1988 election shock , offset some of the very worst effects of the recession .
Some fantasise that the devaluation was a punitive measure directed at the working class lest they become overly - inspired by the Chiapas rebellion ; others that Zedillo deliberately elected to expose the economy to crisis and therefore force a period of capitalist restructuring .
Neither position is tenable : by December 1994 the Zapatistas ' initial impact had evaporated and the uprising was militarily contained - indeed the PRI had secured a new incumbent in the Presidential Palace .
And the depth of the recession , which the PRI could not have forseen , is surely proof that they never intended to engineer more than an simple adjustment in the balance of payments .
Rather what we see is a crisis of confidence in the Mexican bourgeoisies ' ability to manage accumulation on the part of global finance capital .
There is no doubt , however , that the recession has vigorously restructured sectors of the Mexican economy .
The competitive edge that the devaluation gave to Mexican exports has been sustained .
Oil , once such a key export , now accounts for only 10 % of the country 's export base .
It is this export - led recovery that the capitalist class see as the fruit of the restructuring that has been taking place since the late 1980s , and which superficially appears to be as a result of NAFTA .
For the working class , real wages have still not reached their pre-devaluation levels .
More wage cuts and job insecurity is on the way as the privatisation bandwagon judders on and the old social contract is further destroyed .
The swift economic recovery from 1995 showed how successfully the PRI had reinvented itself as a party of neoliberal economics .
They did not attempted to spend their way out of trouble , as they have done in the past .
Instead they inflicted the harshest of free market medicines on the population .
By stealing their policies , the PRI seemingly marginalised the PAN .
Two related contradictions now beset the PRI however .
The first was that with the opening up of Mexico to trade liberalisation , and the subsequent deluge of American commodities , the PRI could no longer bang the ideological drum of economic nationalism with any coherence .
This may not have been a problem : the Mexican bourgeoisie have decades of practice at appearing to be masters of their own fate while having huge sections of their economy subordinated to the interests of American capital .
The second contradiction was more serious .
By so dramatically reducing the size of the state sector , the party - state inevitably curtailed its own ability to dispense patronage and do favours . [ 12 ]
The question for the PRI became : how successful could it be at maintaining its traditional network of influence and power , a network born out of a corrupt and state - led economy , in the face of the new competitiveness the free market demanded .
With the PRI unable to solve this problem , a problem which undermined their own social base , Mexico could open up to all sorts of possibilities .
Part 3 : A Commune in Chiapas ?
Traditional accumulation and social structure
With its mountainous highlands and jungles , Chiapas can feel more a part of Central America than Mexico .
The Distrito Federal of Mexico City , even San Cristobal , can seem a million miles away : unconnected and unimportant .
Until the 1970s capital accumulation followed a stable and relatively backward model , necessitated by the geographical inaccessibility and remoteness of this state , and made viable by the rich lands .
The Revolution barely reached Chiapas , and the latifundias were never broken up , although an echo can be heard in the contemporaneous slave revolts in the logging camps of the Lacandon . [ 13 ]
Similarly the Cardenas reforms had little effect in the 1930s .
Some land was redistributed , but it was all of poor quality , ' so steep the campesinos had to tie themselves to trees to plough , while the rancheros continued to hold great swathes in the rolling valleys . ' [ 14 ]
The pattern of accumulation was , and to a large extent still is , based on expansive land holdings rather than developing the forces of production per se .
Coffee , bananas and other tropical fruit are grown for export ; cattle - raising is another source of profit for the rural Chiapan bourgeoisie .
Crop - growing requires only seasonal labour - power , and cattle - rearing generally requires very little at all .
Accumulation in these dominant industries has come not from improving productivity ( though agricultural techniques have obviously improved over the years ) , rather it has come from extending the land available on which to grow or graze cattle .
Chiapan landowners have , as a result , a reputation for being among the most violent in Mexico .
Their business has literally been that of forcing people off fertile land .
Because the landowners are mestizo ( mixed blood ) or ladino and those they are expropriating are invariably indigenous , the rural bourgeoisie are deeply racist - an important point to bear in mind when discussing the validity of some Zapatista ideas .
Through this violent racism , the hacendados and latifundistas have been able to utterly dominate those Indians that have been allowed to remain as wage labourers or debt - peons .
Whether this is by forcing employees to buy from the hacienda shop , raping their wives or daughters , or executing natives who try to organise , racism has buttressed the power of the landowner and served to nail the price of labour - power to the floor : it has greased the circuits of accumulation for decades .
Backward Chiapan capital does not even have to worry about the costs of the reproduction of labour , as these have always been borne by the family unit in the impoverished local village .
Depending on their size ( large - scale agribusiness or medium - sized commercial growers ) the landowner 's capital may flow to the cities to be invested , often in speculative ventures .
A large part of their profits also goes on conspicuous consumption , the flaunting of which further reinforces the rural hierarchy .
Their paying off of local caciques is perfectly in character for this underdeveloped form of accumulation .
Caciques are rather like charros in that they can deliver some of the basic demands of the campesino and mediate his needs .
They are usually older men who are involved in local commercial activities and have a reputation as fixers , usually with some access to local state funds .
Many are PRIistas , most are corrupt and violent and all believe they ' serve the people ' .
In fact they serve to demobilise and suppress rural struggle and are invaluable to the landowners .
Caciquismo itself has often been a focus for struggle , with predictably unsuccessful results .
The migratory flow of land refugees in Chiapas has been eastwards , as coffee growers expanded their plantations in the fertile Soconusco region of the state .
In 1954 the landless , particularly Chol Indians , began arriving in the Lacandon .
The trickle soon became a flood : Indians from Oaxaca made homeless by government dams , from Veracruz , evicted by Guardias Blancas , mestizo farmers from Guerrero and Michoacan .
Much like the US border , the Lacandon was becoming a safety valve for the poverty and dispossession agricapitalist expansion was creating .
The party - state saw this , recognised its value , and granted a number of land titles through government decree in 1957 and 1961 .
But the stampede into the Lacandon and consequent deforestation meant there was not enough land to go around , and what there was quickly became sterile .
Those who had reckoned on avoiding proletarianisation by refusing to go to the cities now found they had to survive by selling their labour - power wherever they could and eking out some sort of existence on a tiny patch of barren land .
1970s - eviction and resistance in the Lacandon
By the early ' 70s , with the migration to the Lacandon unstemmed and living conditions becoming unbearable , revolt was in the air .
In 1972 President Echeverria sought to ease the pressure cooker by officially redistributing land , believing this would also create a new class of Indian latifundistas .
645,000 hectares were to be given to sixty - six Indian heads - of - family ; [ 15 ] the rest ordered to leave .
There was immediate resistance to the evictions - and an influx of young activists into the region , Los Altos in particular .
Many were students who had turned to Guevarist or Maoist ideology after their exile from Mexico City in 1968 , now espousing an all - out guerilla war for which they were little prepared .
An example was the Maoist group Linea Proletaria who sent brigades from Torreon and Monterrey after being invited to Chiapas by local liberation theology priests such as Bishop Samuel Ruiz .
With this mish - mash of Leninist activity , it is difficult to discover the autonomous content of the struggle against eviction from the Lacandon . [ 16 ]
To muddy the water still further , it is plain that the vanguardists and the liberation theologists were not in competition for the hearts and minds of the campesinos , as some have suggested .
Liberation theology , which we shall look at in more detail below , had a high Marxist component in the mid-1970s : some priests refused sacraments to those who opposed Linea Proletaria ; in turn the Maoists raised the banner of the indigenous church .
Consequently the self - activity of the campesinos had to pass through two layers of mediation - or one of highly - integrated opposites - before it could assert itself in any way .
The land pressure was increased yet further in 1978 when Lopez Portillo announced the creation of the Montes Azul Biosphere - 38,000 hectares in the heart of the Lacandon .
Forty communities and ejidos were removed from this UN - protected ecosystem .
The frequent land occupations by campesino groups , sometimes led by the CIOAC ( Independent Central of Agricultural Workers and Campesinos , Communist Party dominated and still influential today ) , were usually met with military expulsion .
In 1980 the army massacred fifty Tojolabal Indians who had occupied a finca ( large farm ) forty miles from Comitan .
This was the pattern for the ' 80s : the army and the police combining with the Guardias Blancas to suppress land takeovers and murder peasant leaders .
New patterns of accumulation
If the 1970s saw an upsurge in class struggle , it also saw the arrival of new national and international patterns of accumulation .
The farmers and ranchers nowadays sit more or less uncomfortably with the new industries that wish to exploit Chiapas 's abundant natural wealth , and which are often diametrically opposed to their interests .
New dams were built in this period to provide electricity for petrochemical plants in Tabasco and Veracruz : Chiapas is Mexico 's largest producer of hydroelectricity , though half of its homes have no power .
Dam construction has provided sporadic employment for some parts of the indigenous population , while others have had to abandon their villages to rising flood waters .
Further dam construction is planned , much of it targeted at the Zapatista stronghold of Las Canadas ( the Canyons ) , a region of Los Altos .
The importance of hydroelectricity pales in comparison with the discovery of oil , however .
The deposits in the north - east of the state are part of the Gulf of Mexico field that produces 81 % of Mexico 's crude export .
But new deposits have also been found in the east , just north of the Guatemalan border ( the so - called Ocosingo field ) , bang in the middle of Zapatista territory .
Most of this new oil is not yet being pumped , but exploratory wells have been drilled both by PEMEX , the national oil company , and international oil interests .
This sort of hit - and - miss drilling requires a lot of land ; consequently the latifundistas and rancheros come into conflict with the international capital that views them as backward .
A less developed industry , but potentially of great importance to the region , is biotechnology .
Chiapas 's diverse ecosystems are a paradise for those seeking to launch a new round of accumulation based on patented genetic technology .
Already several companies have begun bio-prospecting in the state .
But this is an exploitation that will be based on the preservation of the jungles , rather than their destruction .
We can see a new pattern of accumulation developing in Chiapas .
Previously a backwater of non-innovatory local capital , the region has now acquired a strategic importance to sections of both national and international capital .
However , the contradiction is not so much between new modes of accumulation and old , although tensions certainly exist , as some have argued : [ 17 ] a farmer may need to grab more land to keep his agribusiness growing , but he would surely be more than happy to hand over a drilling concession for a generous fee .
Rather the contradiction is between a local and international capital that is compelled to make ever more of Chiapas barren in order to accumulate and international capital in the form of biotech multinationals who need to preserve the ecosystem . [ 18 ]
Oil is predictably winning and the natural resources of Chiapas are being slowly eroded .
What is important is that for the local rancheros and latifundistas ( who need only relatively small amounts of labour - power ) , for the oil companies and biotech corporations , the indigenous population of eastern Chiapas is now , almost absolutely , surplus to requirements .
Those who were displaced from the west now discover it would be better not to have existed at all .
This absolute neglect is reflected in the levels of alcoholism in many Indian communities , and the malnutrition and high infant mortality in the eastern highlands .
The Mexican obsession with death , a cultural inheritance from ancient times and which was given new themes and images by the introduction of grim Catholic culture , has been renewed by the Zapatistas ' frequent references to mortality .
The sparks of rebellion
The specific causes of the armed uprising of the Chiapan Indians are easy enough to trace .
While the indigenous population had been excluded from the PRI welfare state , aside from a layer of PRIista caciques , they had benefited from the subsidies that had traditionally supported Mexican agriculture .
From 1988 , these subsidies and protections were reduced , dismantled or abolished by the new neoliberal PRI .
So , for example , 1989 saw the abolition of INMECAFE , the state agency designed to purchase and set coffee prices , a crucial crop for the Indian ejidos .
Floated on the world market , the price of coffee fell like a stone . [ 19 ]
Wider structural changes also occurred in the name of opening Mexico up to the free market .
1992 saw the infamous amendment of Article 27 of the Constitution .
Previously sacred truths were being questioned by the PRI : the amended Article now permitted the sale of communal lands to anyone who wanted to buy from anyone who could be persuaded ( or forced ) to sell .
The countryside had been opened up to competition , strengthening the hand of the finca - owners and international capital .
On top of this , NAFTA , which Salinas saw as his crowning achievement , would soon come into play .
How would the Indians ' small corn or coffee crops compete with modern US agribusiness ?
The answer was that they would n't .
In tandem with these factors which pointed to further immiseration , the campesinos of eastern Chiapas had not experienced a reduction in the state - sponsored repression that had been directed against them .
The sigh of relief that had accompanied the end of General Castellanos 's murderous governorship of the state ( 1982 - 88 ) quickly became a groan when his successor , Patrocinio Gonzalez began jailing peasant leaders and bumping off journalists
The Guardias Blancas were roaming the countryside with impunity and the new forestry police were shooting at anyone they caught chopping down trees .
Under these extreme circumstances , traditional independent peasant organisations such as CIOAC and the Association of Regional Independent Campesinos ( ARIC ) , which had been set up by Maoists in the ' 70s were unable to hold their members .
The stable cyclical world of the Indian village was being consumed by crisis .
Colombus Day , October 1992 saw ten thousand indigenous marching through the streets of San Cristobal .
Later they tore down the statue of local conquistadore Diego de Mazariegos .
Many in the demonstration were already Zapatistas .
The Indians of Los Altos , Las Canadas and La Selva were flooding into the ranks of the EZLN .
But where had the EZ come from ?
And who exactly was organising it ?
Formation of the EZLN [ 20 ]
The egalitarian nature of indigenous communal life has been widely overstated .
Desperate to dispel the dead weight of Leninism , many have talked up the importance of Indian tradition .
Isolated , impoverished , long distorted by caciques , by corrupt PRIistas , hotbeds of patriarchy and alcohol - fuelled domestic violence , the indigenous communal life is considerably less than perfect .
But there is a moment of truth : communal ejidos are the norm , important decisions are chewed over for hours on end by everyone , plays and poetry keep the history of resistance alive .
What is new about the Zapatista communities is the energetic manner in which they have become political and overcome some of the worst aspects of village tradition .
Importantly this has enabled the Zapatistas to move beyond the crippling localism that has been characteristic of other peasant struggles .
As we have already explained , one mediation the campesinos have gone through ( and still go through ) enroute to becoming Zapatistas , is the influence of the Catholic church and liberation theology in particular .
Whether critical or celebratory , accounts of the Zapatistas have generally neglected this reactionary influence on the development of the class struggle in Chiapas .
The extent to which the autonomous communities are infected with religious sentiment is not always appreciated .
Every village has a church , usually the most skilfully constructed building in the community , and which is sometimes the only place for miles that has electricity , while the Zapatistas themselves invariably live in ill - lit shacks .
There is a high interpenetration of religion and politics : the lay catechist who preaches is often the local EZLN rep , and Masses have a tendency to dissolve into long political meetings - or the other way around .
It would be fair to say that while liberation theology has contributed to the combativity of the Chiapan Indians it has also played its part in retarding the theoretical efforts of the Zapatista struggle .
The phenomenon has been present in Chiapas in a concentrated form since at least 1974 , when Samuel Ruiz ( the ' Red Bishop ' , a figure much hated by the latifundistas and rancheros ) organised a ' Congress of Indian Peoples ' in San Cristobal .
Shocked into action by the anger displayed at the Congress , Ruiz not only stepped up the church 's militant crusading in the villages , he also , as we have seen , invited Maoist cadre into the area .
The mid- to late - 1970s witnessed a period of co-operation between the party of the church and the church of the party .
In fact the 1970s saw the highpoint of Catholicism 's flirtation with Marxism .
Confronted with military dictatorships across almost the whole of Latin America , many Catholics believed , for example that : ' The class struggle is a fact and neutrality in the question is not possible ' or ' To participate in the class struggle ... leads to a classless society without owners or dispossessed , without oppressor and oppressed . '[ 21 ]
Liberation theology even had its own Che - the body of Camillo Torres , Colombian priest - turned - guerilla fighter .
The contradictions abound : believing in a classless society , catechists are unable to break with a church whose very essence is hierarchy and authority .
( In its turn Rome is keen to keep them on side - in an excommunicated liberation theology it perceives the possibility of its own dissolution . )
By continually encouraging the revolt of ' the poor ' in the city and the country , yet unable to break through the miasma of Catholicism , the liberation theologists actively impede the development of the conscious category of proletariat , whose realisation and self - abolition is the only real solution to the impoverishment of their flock .
By the mid-1980s , with swathes of Latin America undergoing a transition to democracy , notably in Brazil , the highpoint of radical liberation theology was over .
The Sandinista defeat in 1990 and the end of the civil war in El Salvador further moderated the influence of Marxism .
In Chiapas , however , with the situation in the highlands deteriorating , the liberation theologists wielded greater infuence than ever before .
As Jacques Camatte says , ' Religion allows a human demonstration against capital because God is a human product ( i.e. something that appears to exist outside the prevailing mode of production ) .
Thanks to him , man can still save his being from the evil embrace of capital . '[ 22 ]
When Marcos says ' We want liberation - but not the theology ' , we should not be fooled .
The Zapatistas are as devout a lot as one is ever likely to meet .
However , it was not just that the Church was acting as a political force - it was also acting as a conduit for Mexican leftists who could not otherwise gain access to the Indians of Chiapas .
Ruiz found these leftists useful in the organising work he had committed his diocese to .
In the 1970s , the arrangement was that the priests would handle pastoral work while the Maoists handled the political organising .
This backfired on him badly in 1980 when Linea Proletaria mounted a coup and replaced the catechist leaders in the key peasant unions .
It took two years for Ruiz and his priests to regain the initiative .
He turned to another group of leftists to help him - but unbeknown to him this group was an advance party of the Che Guevara - inspired Fuerzas de Nacional Liberacion ( Forces of National Liberation , FLN ) .
By the time Linea Proletaria was leaving Chiapas in 1983 , the FLN , taking advantage of its successes in organising with the Church , was upping its activity significantly .
The FLN High Command had secretly visited the canyons , with a view to developing an army which they already had a name for - the EZLN .
With them came a young captain , Marcos .
From 1991 the FLN made real progress in recruiting beyond its core cadre of Indian militants .
While they had may have followed the foco model of the Cuba experience , which emphasises the military struggle over the social , they recognised the need to participate in grassroots organisations - a lesson they may have learnt from the innovative left - Maoist aspects of Linea Proletaria .
However , they had avoided falling into a tendency that Linea Proletaria had succumbed to : drifting away from militant land occupations and battles with employers and towards co-operation with PRI agencies over credit lines , marketing facilities and productivity increases .
The importance of differentiating between these strategies became more pronounced as the massive anti-poverty programme PRONASOL rolled into Chiapas in the early 1990s .
With it rolled some of the old Linea Proletaria cadre , now part of Salinas 's retinue .
An alliance between the PRONASOL government workers and the Church , now long aware of the FLNs commitment to armed struggle , aimed to divert the Indians ' anger into avenues of government recuperation .
But with the economic situation for the Indians now so desperate , the FLN was able to outflank this move by creating a new militant body , the ANCIEZ , the Emiliano Zapata Independent National Peasant Alliance , an embryonic Zapatista army under whose banner the militant Indians began the work of reorganising their communities .
They even managed to get some PRONASOL funds on the sly for weapons .
All these elements - the FLN , the priests , the communal Indian traditions , each with their own internal contradictions , were lenses through which the coming - into - being of the EZLN was focused .
The necessary first step of this militant reorganisation was the suppression within the communities of anti-Zapatista elements , usually caciques out to enrich themselves or PRIistas who could act as levers of coercion or as spies .
This process must have developed in quite different ways according to the prevailing conditions .
In some places there was a blanket conversion to Zapatismo and the villagers could afford to be relatively open , at least with each other , about their organisation .
Individual PRIistas would be easy to isolate and exclude .
Other villages might have an even mix of Zapatistas and PRIistas , or complete PRI dominance .
In the latter case many rebellious campesinos were simply forced out and constructed a community elsewhere .
Even today when large chunks of Chiapas are controlled by the EZLN , one can often find a Zapatista village next to a PRI village , with all the suspicion and antagonism that that implies .
The PRI web is torn but far from brushed away : the fear of informers means that on the margins of EZLN territory , clandestinity is still very much the name of the game .
The expulsion where possible of PRIistas opened up a space for the Zapatistas , a space where a process of rebuilding could begin .
Simultaneous to the clandestine reconstitution of the villages the insurgent army began to coalesce in the highlands around 1992 - 93 .
Until September 1993 , Marcos and the Indian cadres were following orders from the High Command of the FLN in Mexico City , though he has since made every effort to hide it .
In that month , realizing the FLN units in other Mexican states were barely existent , let alone able to lead an armed revolution , he refused their request to send finances out of Chiapas .
It seems to be at this time that the ideological break with the FLN occurred , though it was not fully confirmed until the failure of the January 1994 uprising .
The Clandestine Committee for Indigenous Revolution ( CCRI ) which had been created in January 1993 and which was made up of veteran Indian cadre now pushed for war .
However , on this one crucial point , the village assemblies found consensus impossible .
According to Womack : ' [ The ] assemblies groaned for consensus for the armed way , but it would not come ...
In the Zapatista canyons the majority ruled ... where communities voted for war , the EZLN tolerated no dissent or pacifism : the minorities had to leave . '[ 23 ]
From its FLN origins , then , we know that the army itself could be a sufficient form for the hierarchical organisation of the struggle .
A political cadre could operate within the army to transmit the line of the organisation and its leadership to both combatants and non-combatants .
Leninism , as a ' hierarchic organisation of ideology ' ( Debord ) , does not require an obvious party form ; it is enough that a cadre of militants exist with a leadership - perhaps a hidden leadership - giving them political direction .
We know that the FLN grew in Chiapas by recruiting and training an Indian cadre who then played a key role in the Zapatista decision to go to war .
But this was not a vanguard ' parachuted in from the outside ' .
Apart from Marcos , and possibly a few others , it was composed of Indians who joined because it seemed to meet their needs .
Specifically , it unified Indians of different languages and allowed them to act collectively against their exploiters .
But if the EZLN has at its origin the hierarchy and mediation that is inherent in the Che Guevara version of Leninism , there is no doubt that the political certainties that accompanied this model were destroyed following the failure of January 1994 .
The rupture that took place between September 1993 and February 1994 meant the EZLN and the cadre form was thrown into crisis .
On the one hand the EZLN had clearly failed in their attempt to launch a credible military offensive , and had become besieged and isolated .
Yet on the other hand , the outpouring of public support for the Zapatistas must have caused the CCRI - GC ( General Command ) and the Indian cadres to re-examine their ideas .
Out of this crisis came a commitment to a vague form of left reformism , utilising ideas such as civil society .
Desperate to survive , the EZLN has usually pitched for the lowest , and least controversial , common denominator in its organising efforts and communiques - anti-PRI .
However , the other long - term effect of the uprising and its failure has been a high level of confusion and disorientation .
Periodically the organisation has been able to unite around certain initiatives , such as the Encuentros .
Yet given the extremely difficult conditions they live under , the Zapatistas have displayed a tremendous level of courage and initiative .
It is the self - activity of the Indians , above all else , that defines this struggle .
Zapatista organisation
The scale of the uprising is the first thing that strikes the visitor to eastern Chiapas .
There are over 1,100 rebel communities , each with 300- 400 people , usually young .
These villages , some of which have been built since 1994 , are federated into thirty - two autonomous municipalities .
The civil decision - making process is fluid : local decisions are made locally , important policy or project decisions made on a wider , but not always municipal , level .
Municipally , delegates from each village come together in the assembly halls that are almost as common as churches .
These meetings are extremely long - winded by European standards , sometimes going on for two or three days until something like consensus is reached .
This ability to reach consensus is aided by the vitality of the traditional decision - making process and which recognises the pressing demands of life under siege .
The remoteness of the Indians ' lives from regular wage labour , and the communal nature of farming which in any case is labour - intensive only seasonally , enables the Zapatistas to carve out large portions of time for meetings and organising .
The civil level is completed by the five Aguascalientes which are dotted around Zapatista territory .
Named after the original Aguascalientes ( where the CND was held ) which was destroyed by the Mexican army in 1995 , in turn named after the Aguascalientes Military Convention of 1914 , these cultural centres are a conglomeration of schoolhouses , assembly halls , metalworking shops , sleeping quarters , storage huts , etc .
It is to the Aguascalientes that the Zapatistas come for their most important political meetings , dances , and endless basketball tournaments .
They have also been used at various times as EZLN barracks .
The EZLN encampments , being obvious targets , are away from the communities , hidden from the constant overflight of army helicopters or air force bombers .
The local EZLN detachments send representatives to the various CCRIs , which in turn sends delegates to the CCRI General Command , which consists of around 70 - 80 members , and is based in the Lacandon area surrounding the Aguascalientes of La Realidad .
The hierarchy that exists in the EZ is almost certainly part of the legacy the FLN has left the Indians .
Commandante , Subcommandante , Major , Captain : the chain of command appears to reproduce that of the state 's armed wing perfectly .
Naturally , there will have been tendencies within the CCRI - GC that both ossify and loosen command , but a relaxation could be more likely in recent years as the EZLN has been militarily quiet since its initial flurry of activity .
With the indigenous war on hold , work in the communities has taken precedence , and the damage militarisation can do to a social movement reduced .
The EZ , however , is still the arena where the young wish to prove themselves .
Since 1994 a new generation of combatientes ( EZ soldiers ) has come of age , and it would be interesting to know how many have made it into the CCRI - GC - or whether they now dominate it .
Unfortunately this information is not available to us .
One further aspect that differentiates the EZ from an army of the state , aside from its relatively informal command structure , is the apparent absence of both punishment and insubordination .
Joining up is not compulsory , though all seventeen year - old men and women are encouraged to participate .
Many seem to want to join the militias earlier .
The Zapatista army has after all come ultimately from the material needs and insurrectionary desire of the Chiapan Indians .
As such becoming a combatiente is seen to be not only in an Indian 's self interest , it is also an escape from agricultural drudgery and early marriage into a world of excitement and possibility .
The EZ may not appear as a burden to the young , rather to join it could be to embark upon a process of individual and communal self - expression .
If we wish to believe Marcos , and some may not , it is also a space for limited , but hitherto unthinkable , sexual experimentation , free from the judgmental gaze of the village elders .
The relationship of the EZLN to the autonomous communities after 1994 appears to be characterised by the slogans : ' Commanding obeying ' and ' Everything for everyone , nothing for ourselves ' .
The former is really nothing more than an indigenous take on the practice of recallable delegates .
As such it follows firmly in the traditions of soviets and workers ' councils - though of course it is double - edged : if the commanders obey , they also command .
The latter slogan is an assurance that that the EZLN , or the CCRI - GC , will not enrich itself at the expense of the communities , nor will it transform itself into a new layer of caciquismo .
The villages are not the bases of support for the guerrilla army , as was the case in neighbouring Guatemala , rather the EZLN appears to be the base of support for the self - organised village .
Because there are not nearly enough resources to go around , any material enrichment on the part of the EZ , or sections of the EZ , would instantly raise suspicions of PRI influence .
But in fact the Zapatista army is not saying ' we will take only that share to which we are entitled ' , they are saying 'we will take less than our share . '
In impoverished eastern Chiapas this amounts to a little more than posturing .
The same obsession with death we noted earlier also leads into a language of sacrifice .
The dialectic of ' commanding obeying ' can best be seen at work in the devising and implementation of the various Revolutionary Laws of the EZLN .
The Laws themselves are mired in leftist bourgeois language - ' The Rights and Obligations of the Peoples in Struggle ' , ' The Rights and Obligations of the Revolutionary Armed Forces ' - and often in reformist content , such as the Revolutionary Agrarian Law , which we shall look at later .
Once again we see the influence of the structures of Marxism - Leninism .
But they represent also a sophisticated attempt by the campesinos to begin solving their own problems .
The army , being everywhere , was the only body that could implement their new world with any degree of consistency . [ 24 ]
The Laws , devised after endless debate and discussion , in themselves ( i.e. aside from their content ) are an attempt by the Indians to endow their struggle with a sense of permanence , a way of saying 'we are not going back . '
Naturally they are mediations , but they are at least mediations which have enabled the Zapatista struggle to move beyond visceral class antagonism into self - organisation - a coherence not seen in the Mexican countryside since the days of the Ayala Plan .
Any description of Zapatista organisation must include an account of the effect of the uprising on the status of indigenous women .
Before Zapatismo the conditions women lived in were dreadful : sexual abuse was rife through rape or early forced marriage , domestic violence was high , giving birth to large families ruined a woman 's body and gave them a heavy responsibility for social reproduction through household chores .
Moreover they were expected to reduce their food intake so that the husband and children could eat sufficiently , though even this was unable to staunch the high rates of infant mortality .
In short they were virtual slaves in their own villages .
The uprising has not liberated them , as it has not liberated any other Indian , from a world of want .
What it has done is given them an opportunity to break beyond the atomisation of the village to form a developing unity based on the rich variety of their needs .
The space for women 's organisation has not opened up because of the rebellion , instead the women 's demands have been imposed on the men in a collective and conscious attempt to expand the sphere of their own autonomy .
This has only added to diversity of Zapatismo .
Some have argued that ' women 's integration into military structures remains the surest way to defuse the subversive potential of their choice to break with the past . '[ 25 ]
We would disagree .
The women see their subversive potential not as women , but as Zapatista women .
That entails expanding their autonomy both within the village ( for example , in co-ops of various kinds ) and embarking on a project of solidarity with the men in the army .
They are both against and with the men ; primarily they are for themselves , a project which they see as being realised in the organic and relatively informal structures of the EZLN .
And in response to the state 's militarisation of Chiapas they have expressed themselves through simultaneously taking up arms and developing their own quasi-military structures .
Armed with staffs that are almost as tall as themselves , they have trained themselves to fight police incursions into their municipalities , often with babies on their backs .
All this is done with high efficiency and usually masked up , faces covered with the red palliacates that are a Zapatista emblem .
Aside from taking up arms , perhaps the single most subversive act they have undertaken is the banning of alcohol , which is used by the Chiapan landowners and ranchers as an out - and - out weapon of social control .
Alcohol sales on tick tend to cause unpayable debt through the employer 's shop , and the community in its alienation and powerlessness turns in on itself through domestic violence .
The effect in Indian communities has been devastating , similar to that experienced on the reservations of North America .
With the landowners gone , the indigenous women immediately enforced a ban that is universal in Zapatista territory .
Many villages have a tiny one - person jail or secure hut where the occasional drunkard returning from Ocosingo or Altamirano can be imprisoned for a night or so .
The ban , developed from the immediate concerns of the women , also forced the men into a new respect which in turn opened the way for further self - defined projects - for example organising women 's marches against state militarisation in the tourist town of San Cristobal .
The women 's situation is not developing all one way .
Pregnant combatientes must return to their villages where they may be subject to isolation , although the father of the child must accompany her ; those who have never left will almost always be illiterate , unable to speak any Spanish , and continue to bear the burden of childcare .
In many villages women are still excluded from meetings .
Nevertheless the tendency is towards free determination as part of the developing social whole , towards rebelde mujeres ( rebel women ) rather than subservient ones .
Lastly , the military situation in Chiapas demands a brief mention .
The federated Zapatista areas are surrounded and interpenetrated with hundreds of army checkpoints and bases .
The militarisation is immense : 70,000 troops , one third of the entire Mexican army , armed with the best weapons American anti-narco money can buy .
PRI - and landowner - sponsored paramilitaries , of which there are seven different varieties roam the countryside , ratcheting up the tension .
This patchwork of conflict is further confused by the waves of refugees that have occasionally been created by army occupations of Zapatista municipalities , or those with EZ sympathies who have been expelled from PRI villages .
In Chiapas the armed wing of capital is everywhere visible .
Having described the basic outline of the Zapatista set - up , we shall now turn to the ideas of the uprising .
In attempting to move beyond the cheerleading or the hostility this social movement has prompted , we shall deal with , in turn , the ideas of the ' ultra - left ' and the academic autonomists .
The ' ultra - left ' tend to see the Zapatista as a desperate guerrilla fighter manipulated by hidden leaders ; the academics see the Indian reasserting his or her labour against predatory global capital .
These views of Zapatismo as a simple , monolithic body can result in the suppression of contradiction .
But the uprising is a living , evolving thing , within and against capital , and as such is riven with contradiction .
Before we go any further we must examine the specific class character of the rebel Indian , from where some of these contradictions arise .
The class position of the Zapatista Indian
The class position of the Zapatista Indian is , as we shall argue , more peasant than proletarian .
Before substantiating this point , we must step back briefly and derive an understanding of the nature and function of the peasantry .
Traditional Marxism explains the peasantry with the same analytical tools it uses to explain class polarisation in urban societies .
It is perfectly suited to the rapid movement and social change that takes place in cities during industrialisation , but it can lead some to a simplistic idea of class relations in the countryside , where many pre-capitalist forms survive and where stability rather than change can be the defining ethos .
Just as capitalism in the cities bases itself on constantly revolutionising the means of production , some orthodox Marxists see in the countryside a mirrored process whereby greater numbers of peasants are excluded from the land , while a much smaller number manage to transform themselves into professional farmers with larger landholdings .
With this programmatic approach it is easy to believe in the possibility of stirring up class war within the village itself .
Thus for Lenin it was simply a matter of encouraging the poor peasants to rebel against the rich peasants .
These poor peasants , increasingly separated from the means of production , would discover their natural allies in the proletariat , while the affluent peasants with access to land and market networks would side with the bourgeoisie .
The urban formula of class struggle was simply transposed onto the countryside .
There is , of course , truth in this analysis .
Capitalism , to the extent to which it can penetrate , and thereby alter , traditional peasant society , does create class polarisation .
But the Soviet experience of War Communism , NEP and particularly collectivisation , shows not an increasingly class - ridden and socially volatile peasant community ; instead it shows the high level of internal stability and resistance to outside influence : not so much an example of poor peasant and political commissar vs. rich peasant , as rich and poor peasant vs. political commissar .
The problem with the orthodoxy is that it overestimates the ability of capital to break down traditional peasant structures .
The process of agricultural revolution may have happened in western Europe and north America , but in many parts of the world , such as Mexico , the peasant village has remained stubbornly impervious to capitalist development .
So while agribusiness is characterised by wage - labour and new farming techniques , peasant production has at its heart unspecialised production for consumption , family labour , an absence of accounting , etc .
In place of the relentless drive for profit , peasant life is one of isolation and immutability where births , marriages and the seasons hold more importance than crop yield or rational business planning .
The political implications of this conservative stability are twofold .
The first is that peasant uprisings are almost always a reaction to an external crisis which threatens the peace of the village , rather than as a result of internal class antagonisms .
The many crises in the history of the Mexican campesino has meant this class has been an especially combative one : the sudden arrival of primitive accumulation ( the Conquest ) , the genocide by sword and disease , the rule from Spain , the violent expansion of the latifundias under the Porfiriato are all examples .
The second implication is that within the peasant uprising the binding aspect of tradition enables small private farmers and those with communal landholdings ( though the difference is not always clear cut : one can merge into the other at different times of the year or at times of family change ) to live happily together in revolt - the Ayala Plan is a case in point .
The principal point of attack which the orthodoxy identifies is often the most resistant to change .
What , then , is the nature of the class position of the Zapatista Indian today ?
We described earlier the uneven development of capitalism in Chiapas .
The Indians have experience of wage - labour that might include : working on ranches , seasonal work on a finca ( where an employer 's shop system might operate , or debt - peonage be dominant ) , or fully - integrated wage - labour on dam construction , or at the oil operations of the north - east .
All this work is either seasonal or temporary - when it is over the campesino must return to the village to scratch out a living from the soil .
For men , just about the only form of permanent work is being employed by the repressive arms of the PRI or the landowners .
For the women , handicrafts ( including Zapatista dolls ) to sell in the markets of San Cristobal or outside Mayan ruins is a possible form of income .
This is a strictly peasant activity : their stall is a patch of ground and the level of poverty offsets any petty - bourgeois trade content this activity might contain .
Overall the Indian women have never been integrated into the wage - labour system , though they may have some contact with the commodity economy , and the men have only been partly and temporarily integrated .
They represent a section of the population which capital has not fully proletarianised because it has no need of their labour - power .
In fact , as we mentioned earlier , it would be better for capital if these people did not exist at all .
Neither has their limited contact with the wages system been a definitive experience for the Chiapanecos .
On the contrary they have retreated further into the margins of Mexican geography in their attempt to preserve their traditional communities .
Their productive lives are determined by the land and the consumption needs of their family and village ; their social lives by the traditions of the village ; their thinking is generally social rather than economic - they are part of the ' different world ' of the peasant .
They have been unable to avoid wage - labour altogether - its influence has been important to the Zapatistas ' ability to look beyond their immediate locality .
But the overall class position of the Zapatista , his or her culture and beliefs , is that of the peasant .
We could perhaps best define this class location as that of a semi-proletarian peasantry .
Indeed one could argue that the uprising itself has , with its obsession for Mayan tradition , reinforced the peasant aspect over the proletarian .
It is only with this category of semi-proletarian peasant that we can understand the contradictions at the heart of the individual Zapatista and the practice of the EZLN itself .
Guerrilla fighter or Mayan Indian ?
Communal farmer or politico ?
Both and neither .
The ' ultra - left ' groups , mistaking the Zapatistas for proles , condemn them for falling into the traps of twentieth century working class insurrection .
The academics also mistake them for fully - integrated wage - slaves , and therefore representative of a new recomposition of labour against ' neoliberalism ' .
But the Chiapan Indians are not central to the expansion of capital ; they are extremely marginal to it .
Consequently they are not in an advantageous position to develop a critique of capital .
Their only possibility is to reassert human community over a system that would rather see them dead .
The ' ultra - left ' [ 26 ]
Mao and Marcos
Sylvie Deneuve and Charles Reeve 's article ' Behind the Balaclavas of south - east Mexico ' is without doubt the most hostile reaction to the Indian uprising in Chiapas .
Reacting against the romanticisation of the Zapatistas , they wish to assert the proletarian aspects of the struggle over the more important peasant and Indian aspects which we have already examined .
They perceive in the rebellion and the forms it has taken nothing more than one further example of deadening Leninism grafting its structures onto autonomous class struggle .
Oscillating between contempt for the Indians ' traditional subservience and an ungrounded belief in their immanent ability to launch into an unmediated orbit of pure revolution , Deneuve and Reeve give a schematic account of how they believe the class struggle in Chiapas has developed and been derailed .
For them , the strong base assemblies of the Zapatista municipalities merely serve to protect those leaders who ' must never be seen ' : ' the Zapatista army is ... only one part of The Organisation - it is its visible part . '
They account for the lack of an obvious Party line and the absen
Italy , Metternich said , was " only a geographical expression " , but 150 years ago the greatest revolutionary the peninsula ever produced set about proving him wrong .
In the most dramatic episode in the long story of Italy 's unification , Giuseppe Garibaldi , set sail from Genoa with two small steamers crammed with red-shirted comrades from northern Italy .
They were known as the Mille , " the thousand " , and they sailed south to conquer Sicily .
In less than a month , and against all odds , they had seized Palermo .
Soon Garibaldi was master of Sicily and had crossed over to the mainland to continue the rout .
This event has long been regarded as a crucial moment in the creation of the Italian nation , celebrated in romantic paintings and public monuments .
The anniversary this week was the starting gun for a whole year of celebrations as Italy looks back on its short but tumultuous history as an independent nation .
Organisers promise four major exhibitions and " an extraordinary programme of culture , sport and entertainment " .
The central exhibition , in Turin , examines Italy 's independent history .
The only problem is that , despite the exhortations of the head of state , President Giorgio Napolitano , and lectures from on high by the establishment media , Italians appear conflicted about even marking the anniversary .
The Northern League 's founder and leader , Umberto Bossi , called the celebrations " useless things . "
The party 's newspaper demanded rhetorically , " The unity of Italy – what 's there to celebrate ? " and described the birth of the unitary state as " contrary to nature and history . "
Another senior figure , Robert Cota , went so far as to describe Garibaldi as " a criminal who sowed death and destruction " .
The League began life as a coven of extremists in the prosperous north , inveighing against " Big Thief Rome " and demanding secession from the supposedly blood - sucking south .
Silvio Berlusconi brought League members into his first government in 1994 , and though they pulled the plug on that fragile administration , today they are his strongest coalition allies .
They may have backtracked on their secession demands but they never tire of reminding people that the unity of the nation should not be taken for granted while they are around .
President Napolitano was on the defensive when he travelled to Genoa this week to honour the Thousand .
" To celebrate the unity of Italy is not a waste of time or money , " he declared .
He urged Italians to show " a stronger sense of Italy and of being Italian " .
And he defended Garibaldi , long regarded as the national hero but recently , as he put it , " incomprehensibly the object of gross denigration by new detractors " .
" Let us incite ourselves , " he said , " to have a bit more national pride . "
The President 's problem is that , a century and a half after the founders of the unified state set about , as they put it , " making Italians , " the work is still only half done .
In Garibaldi's day , all the peoples of the peninsula spoke the dialect of their own region , so when the red shirts turned up on the shores of Sicily , they were regarded as scarcely less foreign than the British naval sailors who backed them up .

FOX NEWS , GOP THINK AMERICANS DON’T PAY ENOUGH TAXES ….
The AP has a piece today with a headline that reads , “ Nearly half of US households escape fed income tax . ”
Here ’s the lede :
Tax Day is a dreaded deadline for millions , but for nearly half of U.S. households it ’s simply somebody else ’s problem .
About 47 percent will pay no federal income taxes at all for 2009 .
Either their incomes were too low , or they qualified for enough credits , deductions and exemptions to eliminate their liability .
This has some on the right complaining — about the policy , not the story .
As Steve M. noted , “ So , after a year or so of telling us they ’re ‘ taxed enough already , ’ wingnuts are now going to start complaining that taxes are too low ?
Apparently . ”
Drudge is telling readers today , “ Rob Thy Neighbor : Half of Households Pay No Fed Income Tax . ”
Fox Nation ’s headline reads , “ Fair ?
Half the Country Does n’t Pay Income Tax . ”
Rick Santorum told Fox News viewers last night , “ [ W ] hen you reach the point where people feel like they do n’t have to pay anything and they ’re getting money out of the Treasury for nothing , then there ’s no end to the amount of government that people want . ”
Glenn Beck is also outraged that more Americans are n’t paying more in federal taxes .
Since this is apparently the conservative complaint of the day , let ’s note that it ’s true that many middle - and lower - class families have seen their tax burden shrink thanks to tax credits approved in the Democratic stimulus package from last year .
But those breaks are n’t permanent , and just as importantly , it ’s not as if middle - and lower - class families are free from taxes altogether .
As Monica Potts noted , these same families that have been given a break on their federal income taxes still pay other taxes , “ like the sales tax , state taxes , and the Social Security and Medicare / Medicaid taxes . ”
This “ rob thy neighbor ” nonsense is ridiculous .
But these details aside , why is it , exactly , that Republicans and their allies would be complaining about Americans paying too little in taxes ?
As Eric Boehlert asked , “ From a purely philosophical perspective , would n’t a study claiming that nearly half of U.S. households escape paying a federal income tax be good news for a political movement — as well as its chief media enabler — that rallies for lower taxes ?
Am I missing something here , or is Fox News ’ hypocrisy slip just showing again ? ”

Margaret is an attractive woman , mid-thirtyish , possessed of all the happier contradictions of 21st - century noblesse .
She ’s elegant yet unpretentious ; driven but in a laid - back sort of way .
You would recognize her surname .
Her husband , she says , laughing , “ is one of those vilified bankers . ”
She is a career woman herself , expert in the field of marketing with a wealth of international experience , proficient in several languages , speaking mainly French to her young son .
Her family ’s apartment is in the East Eighties .
It is large , immaculate , and well appointed .
Margaret , barefoot , wiggles her toes as she sits beneath a Richard Serra .
Works by other notable modernists hang elsewhere .
Margaret and her family moved here from Tribeca last fall .
The place was just what they wanted — newly renovated and much closer to their 4 - year - old son ’s school .
But within a few weeks , Margaret ’s son ( let ’s call him James ) woke up with welts on his chest .
Margaret was n’t alarmed ; she figured it was a rash or virus , the kind of thing kids get every day .
But when the welts lingered , then more showed up — on James ’s back and arms and legs — Margaret took him to the pediatrician .
The doctor initially regarded the marks as an atypical form of chicken pox .
In the following weeks , however , after James ’s welts became infected and began appearing in still more places , Margaret took him to a pediatric dermatologist .
That doctor diagnosed the problem as mosquito bites , and recommended the family “ bomb ” the apartment .
Not long after , Margaret and her husband began noticing that they , too , had bites .
That ’s when Margaret inspected her son ’s bed .
“ I saw these minuscule black creatures , ” she says .
“ I ’m squeamish , but I reached out and squashed one .
It was filled with my son ’s blood .
And they were all over .
I turned the headboard around and saw all the eggs .
At which point I screamed . ”
Margaret did some Internet research , then called an entomologist .
When the bug expert conveyed his conclusion to Margaret , she was horrified , disgusted , and not a little concerned for her family .
And although she is no snob , Margaret could n’t repress an uncomfortable thought : that people who live in multimillion - dollar apartments in the tonier precincts of the Upper East Side are just not supposed to have bedbugs .
The recent citywide resurgence of bedbugs has been well documented .
In 2004 , the Health Department tallied 537 complaints and 82 actual violations .
Last year , those numbers ballooned to 10,985 complaints and 4,084 violations ( given that the problem is thought to be significantly underreported , the notion that there are n’t far more cases is daylight madness ) .
What is less well known is that , contrary to the popular stereotype , bedbugs are n’t found only in lower - income neighborhoods .
Margaret , in fact , is part of a mostly silent community of wealthy Upper East Siders suffering from the scourge .
Like all bedbug victims , she and her neighbors are appalled and revolted .
At the same time , they face issues that are , well , uniquely their own .
Not that anyone ever brags about having bedbugs , but because of the creatures ’ low - rent reputation , well - to - do bedbug sufferers tend to be especially reluctant to let on that they have a problem ( hence Margaret ’s unwillingness to reveal her real name ; she does n’t want to become known , in her phrase , as “ Queen of the Bedbugs ” ) .
That wealthy bedbug victims tend to own their homes — expensive homes that might end up far less expensive were a bedbug infestation to become public knowledge — also promotes heightened discretion .
Exterminators who service the neighborhood trawl around in unmarked vans and are sworn not to divulge their clients ’ identities .
Co-op boards and building superintendents engage in strict denials .
High - priced specialists are enlisted to quietly rid Dior couture gowns , Porthault linens , and Aubusson silk rugs of their insect invaders .
For those who appreciate irony , and perhaps a touch of Schadenfreude , there is this : Long - held ideas about bedbugs and poverty aside , wealthy people may in some ways be more prone to infestation .
Bedbugs are equal - opportunity pests .
As Margaret tells her tale of woe , James is clambering around the apartment , making lots of kid - type noise .
He has a friend from upstairs to help .
The two have taken to banging a tray in the kitchen , and it sounds like they ’re destroying the place , as a nanny looks on helplessly .
Identifying the problem was just the start of Margaret ’s troubles .
When she was n’t crying or searching the apartment at 4 a.m. with a flashlight in hand , she was reading books about how to help get James to sleep .
The boy , once a solid sleeper , now frequently came into his parents ’ room , afraid of being bitten .
“ He ’d want to sleep with us , but I ’m pretty strict about that , ” Margaret says , suddenly not smiling .
“ In hindsight I feel terrible .
I was sending him back into the war zone , back into the room where he was being devoured .
Even when we went to the country house , he was still having nightmares . ”
The bites were unsightly and itchy , and Margaret began to worry for her family ’s health .
Although bedbugs do n’t spread serious diseases , she did n’t know that at the time .

Margaret decided she needed professionals to smite the insect army .
She called an exterminator recommended by her building ’s management company , but the crew dispatched to her apartment ended up scalding the silk - velvet fabric of a gorgeous sofa the family had purchased for their new home .
When Margaret called the president of the exterminating company to complain , the man rather rudely played the class card , she says , suggesting that it was probably “ the fault of one of [ her ] cleaning ladies . ”
“ They simply did n’t know what they were getting into , ” Margaret says .
“ I heard them calling in to their bosses and saying that they ’d had no idea how big this apartment would be and that they were going to be late for their next appointment . ”
The biting continued .
Margaret learned that bedbugs tend to bite in threes — either in a line or , often , in a revolting triangle .
In exterminator jargon , this pattern is known as “ breakfast , lunch , and dinner . ”
One night , the parasites supped on Margaret ’s husband straight across his forehead .
As night follows day , the family was going to have to move ; a full - on assault was the only sure remedy .
They began to prepare for a two - month stay at their weekend home .
On moving day , no one went half - measures .
Everything had to go .
Margaret recalls a “ special company wearing what looked like hazmat suits . ”
The men removed everything that could n’t be dry - cleaned — rugs , books , luggage , paintings , shoes , toys , computers , even radios .
Only simple , hard - surfaced items , like china and silverware ( which even bedbugs ca n’t burrow into ) , remained in the apartment .
Margaret ’s family took just a limited amount of clothing — all of it , of course , meticulously steam - cleaned .
For a time , her husband had to stay behind .
“ You need a human in the apartment to draw the bugs out , ” she says .
“ They ’re attracted by the carbon of someone exhaling . ”
Debugging an apartment , even thoroughly , only works if the neighbors ’ apartments are bug - free — otherwise the creatures can migrate and reinfest the place .
The process can drive bugs into neighboring apartments , too .
( To their credit , Margaret and her husband alerted everyone in the building to what was going on . )
Margaret says she “ felt a strange mixture of being exhausted , defeated , and paranoid that all of this was n’t going to work . ”
The family had already spent about $ 30,000 on dry- cleaning alone and upward of $ 70,000 on the entire experience .
Bedbugs have been shimmying around in our sheets since ancient times .
Aristotle mentioned them ;
Pliny the Elder thought they had medical value ( they do not ) .
Like any other force that stalks by night , Cimex lectularius are known by many names : the mahogany flat ; the heavy dragoon ; the crimson rambler ; the Nachtkrabbler ; and , most simply of all , the redcoat .
They subsist on blood — human , but also ( depending on where in the world they hunt ) birds , cats , bats , and other small animals .
They prefer to dine at night , sometimes dropping onto their victims from the ceiling , if need be , before having their five - or ten - minute “ blood meal . ”
When the bedbugs come for you , they inject you with two tubes : one that supplies your skin with an anticoagulant and an anesthetic so that you do n’t react to what ’s going on , and another to draw the blood meal .
Often the welts seen on victims — like those suffered by young James — are an allergic reaction to the anesthetic .
Because a female can lay 500 eggs in a lifetime , it ’s axiomatic among exterminators that the definition of an infestation is a single pregnant female .
A bedbug ’s life span varies according to feeding habits — they can stay dormant for eighteen months but prefer to eat every five or ten days .
Given the right conditions , they can live up to two years .
In the first of their six stages of life , bedbugs are almost transparent , which disgusts everyone who has ever found a newborn , but as they molt and engorge themselves , they become bloodreddish , which disgusts people even more .
A household can easily be infested with tens of thousands at a time .
Bedbugs are fiendishly hearty .
Dogs are helpful but by no means foolproof at sniffing them out .
Chemicals that work against cockroaches are only partially effective .
Standard - issue foggers just make things worse : Bedbugs love to nestle in fabric and wood ( plush headboards , for instance , make an ideal home ) , and the mist will make them scatter .
Given their reproduction rates , killing some of them is tantamount to killing none of them .
Predictably enough , the citywide bedbug phenomenon has spawned a wave of exterminator chicanery .
Internet predators sell bogus remedies to desperate , discretion - minded souls .
Any schnook with a mutt can train it to bark , then call his cousin Larry to “ exterminate ” the “ bugs ” that the dog “ found . ”
That scam is now widely regarded as a growth industry .
Following World War II and the advent of DDT , bedbugs were contained if not virtually eliminated .
For a time , the pests were almost quaint .
A generation of dermatologists could barely recognize the bites ; they ’d never been schooled in anything so antique .
Exterminators , too , had rarely trained for such an eventuality .
But DDT was eventually banned , and besides , the bugs had begun to adapt to it , and now bedbugs are back in force .
Man plans ; bedbugs laugh .
Jeff Eisenberg was the man who finally brought the hammer down on Margaret ’s problem .
To her , he was wartime chocolate .
Eisenberg , who owns a firm called Pest Away , does a lot of work on the Upper East Side .
The neighborhood , he says , is teeming with bedbugs .
Eisenberg knows that city statistics indicate otherwise .
In 2004 , there was one violation reported to the community board that covers the Upper East Side .
One .
In fiscal year 2009 , there were thirteen .
Those numbers are a joke , Eisenberg says .
The uncomfortable truth , noted by Eisenberg and confirmed to me anonymously by a city Housing Department official , is that only renters call 311 to report bedbugs , mainly to create a paper trail they can use to pressure their landlords into fixing the problem .
But if you own a brownstone or a co-op , or even if you ’re just reasonably well off , you tend to handle the problem yourself — and thus go uncounted by the city .
“ Believe me , most people on the Upper East Side do n’t call 311 , ” Eisenberg says .
“ [ Margaret ] did n’t .
She called exterminators . ”
Pest Away , Eisenberg says , receives between 50 and 75 calls about bedbugs from the Upper East Side every week — and that ’s just one firm .
His clients include movie directors , hospitals , white - shoe law firms , high - end schools , and “ titans of Wall Street I ca n’t name to you or they ’d crush me . ”
Eisenberg likes to tell a story about a grand building on East 94th Street .
Having received a complaint , he went to the relevant apartment , where he and the super knocked on the owner ’s door .
The man was wearing a baseball cap , Eisenberg says , and a bedbug actually crossed the top of it .
“ I was thinking , ‘ What , am I on Candid Camera ? ’
A minute later , another one crossed over the hat .
I asked if I could look inside it — and they were crawling all over .
I thought , ‘ There can not just be bedbugs inside one cap . ’
We got into the apartment , and the walls were moving .
Before we could treat it , we had to vacuum for two weeks , just to bring the population down . ”
Another Eisenberg tale involves “ a very , very high - end building on East 92nd .
Very well known .
A super called me and said , ‘ We ’ve got some bedbugs on a glue board . ’
But that did n’t sound right to me .
Bedbugs tend to avoid glue boards , so if that was the case , the whole building was probably infested .
Lo and behold , the place was loaded .
It turned out there was a guy living there who only left every five weeks to see a doctor .
Once , he went downstairs to pay the rent and two bedbugs fell off his arm as he passed the envelope .
Four staff members were standing right there and saw the whole thing , and two and a half minutes later , I get a call …
That ’s one way they spread : hitchhiking .
You get a hundred guys like that walking around the city like Pigpen — to a movie theater , wherever — and that ’s how it goes .
I ’d say that every third or fourth building up there has a guy like that . ”
In still another Upper East Side building , Eisenberg says , a woman with 400 or so first - edition books refused to admit that she had a bedbug problem .
Her apartment turned out to be so infested that the walls , floors , and ceilings had to be removed to get rid of the 100,000 or so bugs that were living there ( the building eventually sued her ) .
The Upper East Side bedbug plague has even made it to prime time .
Just about anyone you meet in the uptown bedbug community knows about “ the bedbug episode ” of 30 Rock .
In it , Alec Baldwin ’s character , an Upper East Side resident if ever there was one , has an infestation and is eventually seen lumbering in a subway car , pouring out his soul to the hoi polloi by announcing , “ My name is Jack Donaghy , and I have bedbugs ! ” at which point a homeless man sitting nearby subtly inches away from him .
What makes the Upper East Side an enticing home ?
To a certain extent , it ’s no more or less inviting than any other neighborhood .
The whole city is in the midst of a bedbug epidemic ; it ’s just that Upper East Siders have kept their troubles disproportionately under wraps .
Some of Eisenberg ’s clients even experience a kind of personal denial .
The first thing people tell him is that they ca n’t have bedbugs — that it ’s got to be something else .
“ They tell me how clean they are , how many times a day they shower , how many cleaning ladies they have , ” he says .
( Margaret made a point of telling me that , if anything , she has always been “ a little OCD ” about cleanliness , and has her sheets cleaned and ironed three times a week . )
“ The stigma is , ‘ You ’re dirty , you ’re poor .
God knows where you ’ve been . ’ ” But bedbugs have nothing to do with dirt , Eisenberg says .
“ They only want the blood meal . ”
Sooner or later , the same clients who insisted they did n’t have a bedbug problem call Eisenberg back , asking for help .
To cater to his clients ’ privacy concerns , Eisenberg often operates incognito .
“ We go after - hours and pull up in unmarked vans .
The guys put on leather jackets , to look like plumbers or regular guys , and sneak into the buildings .
They change into their suits up in the apartment . ”
Because co-op boards and management companies often take pains to deny that their buildings have bedbug issues , the word bedbugs is now a regular feature in Upper East Side real - estate contracts .
Insisting that there ’s not a problem — that bedbugs only happen to other people — may actually contribute to the problem .
The longer you avoid the issue , the more the bugs proliferate .
The number of large , multi-unit apartment buildings is another factor , Eisenberg says — it ’s easy for the bugs to hop from one apartment to the next .
He also says travel may make well - heeled families uniquely susceptible to infestation , as families jet around the globe and carry back bloodthirsty hitchhikers .
Catherine and her family live in the East Seventies ( like Margaret , Catherine does n’t want her real name used ) .
Her family ’s problem started about two years ago .
“ I noticed some marks on my arm , ” she says .
“ Then we went to the Caribbean , and when we got there , I noticed bites on my baby ’s face . ”
When the family got back home , Catherine noticed dark dots on her baby ’s bed .
Her pediatrician recognized the bites right away .
“ Do you want the real nitty - gritty disgustingness ? ” she asks , referring to her daughter ’s bed .
“ The dark dots were the bugs going to the bathroom .
It was excrement .
You could also see drops of blood .
When you move , the bugs think you ’ll discover them — so they spit out the blood and run . ”
Catherine says she has personally spoken ( discreetly , of course ) “ to at least fifteen people up here who have this problem . ”
Most are understanding , she says , but “ one friend stopped letting her kids come over here .
And she did n’t want my child over there , either . ”
To a certain extent , Catherine is sympathetic .
Bedbugs , she knows , freak people out .
After discovering her own infestation , Catherine could n’t sleep and imagined she was being bitten all the time : “ A friend of mine was laughing about it because I was scratching all the time and jittery .
I looked like a drug addict . ”
Catherine approached her building ’s exterminator , but after finding bugs only in her and her husband ’s bedroom , he insisted there was no further problem .
But eventually she found a bedbug in her daughter ’s room , then rechecked her baby ’s crib .
“ I moved it , and there were a bunch , ” she adds .
“ That ’s when I called in the big guns . ”
Catherine speaks of Bliss Pest Protection Services as one might speak of a therapist who saved her life .
As it happens , Steve Altarescu , the man who runs Bliss , has a master ’s degree in counseling .
He ’s needed the full complement of his skills lately .
“ We ’ve been doing this since 1882 , ” he says .
“ In five years , we ’ve gone from hearing nothing about bedbugs to getting five or ten calls a day . ”
Bliss uses bug - sniffing dogs to seek out where bedbugs may be lurking , and when the dogs got near Catherine ’s husband ’s snow clothes , they went mad .
Shortly before the family had gone to the Caribbean , they had gone on a ski trip .
The bugs had apparently traveled back with them from Aspen .
Catherine called both of the hotels they had stayed at , but , no surprise , the establishments ’ representatives claimed they ’d had no complaints .
( In the world of bedbugs , everybody denies everything . )
“ I am not going to sue you , ” she assured them .
“ I ’m not even going to follow up .
But you ’d better have those rooms checked . ”
Catherine and her husband do n’t take luggage anywhere near the bedroom when they return from a trip anymore .
“ We vacuum it , ” she says , “ the moment we get back . ”
There is life after bedbugs .
Margaret ’s world is now much restored .
On a recent afternoon , James ran around after his bath , happily wrapped in a towel , entirely bite - free .
He is beginning to forget .
Early on , Margaret started the process of desensitizing James to the fear of bugs .
“ I had him watching animated movies like Antz and A Bug ’s Life , ” she says .
“ Anything that treats bugs in a friendly way .
Maybe we ’ll go to a farm and let him actually catch bugs . ”
No one says the nighttime rhyme that starts with “ Good night , sleep tight ” to him anymore .
James ’s room is now pristine .
Most of his toys and books were destroyed and replaced .
“ Everything here was sent for intensive cleaning , ” Margaret says .
“ This is the scene of the crime . ”
His bed is still there — with new bedding , of course .
“ The old headboard , ” Margaret says sharply , “ was sent out to be burned . ”
Margaret still constantly checks pillowcases and James ’s skin .
She also has an exterminator in every three months to lay powder into the apartment ’s cracks and crevices .
And what if none of that works ?
I ask her .
What if she and her family faced another infestation ?
“ If that happened again ? ” she asks .
She takes less than two blinks to reply .
“ If that happened again , I would move . ”

Germany 's Parliament voted today to approve a $ 185 billion contribution to $ 1 trillion bailout plan designed to calm the debt crisis sweeping through euro - zone states .
Many analysts doubt that the emergency fund will help troubled countries like Greece avoid defaulting on their debt .
But the fund could buy time for Greece to manage an " orderly restructuring , " whereby it would agree to pay current boldholders a certain fraction of the promised loans .
( Read an explainer of the Greek debt crisis here ) .
The bailout is horribly unpopular in Germany .
But that 's a little ironic , because it 's ultimately designed to save not only Greece and Portugal , but also the entire European Union .
It 's essentially a bailout for the euro .
And no European country benefits from the euro 's regime more than Germany .
The common take on Europe 's mess is that Greece 's debt crisis might be Europe 's problem , but surely it 's Greece 's fault .
The EU did n't force Greek tax evaders to be evasive .
It did n't force the government to regularly spend 50 % of GDP while it collected a little more than a third of domestic product in taxes .
The country got drunk on its own red ink .
It made its own hangover , right ?
Well , Steven Pearlstein spins things differently .
The problem is n't just the profligate peripheral states like Portugal , Italy and Greece .
The problem is at the heart of Europe , both metaphorically and geographically speaking .
The problem is Germany .

The Big Shot promised to pay back , and pay off .
The one - loss grace period is over .
The Devils can’t wait any longer to start scoring or this could be their last home game of the season .
Fail to square their series with the Flyers tonight and they will head to Philly with the 0 - 2 disease that has killed 262 teams , leaving only 40 survivors .
Against that urgency , The Big Shot , Ilya Kovalchuk , uttered big words for someone who never has won a playoff game .
Kovalchuk was on the wrong end of the first turning point of this first - round series , eight minutes into Wednesday ’s opener .
The Devils had Kovalchuk , exactly whom they would want , in the slot , exactly where they would want him , poised to give them the opening lead with his laser - speed shot .
And Brian Boucher , the third - string goaltender who had n’t won a playoff game in nine years , reached up with his mitt and essentially said “ Look , ma , look what I found . ”
“ That was his highlight film .
They ’re going to see some of mine , ” Kovalchuk grimly told The Post .
So instead of taking the early lead , the Devils were shaking their early heads .
The tone was set and the Devils did n’t dent Boucher until 2:43 remained in the third , long after the Flyers had done enough for their 2 - 1 victory .
“ After that save , he was a lot more confident , you could see it .
He handled the puck more .
But then when we scored , he was n’t quite so sure any more , ” Kovalchuk said .
The Devils outshot Philly 24 - 14 in the opener , and they say the recipe for winning tonight is simple .
“ Just score goals , ” said Travis Zajac , the lone Devil to do so Wednesday .
“ We ’re playing well enough defensively .
“ It ’s not enough to get chances .
We have to score . ”
They also are going to have shake the tacit knowledge that they already have started the slide toward a third straight first - round exit .
“ In the playoffs , you have to plant a doubt in the opposition , ” Martin Brodeur said .
“ They ’re flying high , they ’ve beaten us 6 of 7 [ this season ] .
“ What we have to create is the thought that it ’s not going to be an easy series . ”
The Devils already have learned that .
And coach Jacques Lemaire did n’t make it any easier on his Devils by failing to start and stick with the best combinations he had found during the regular season .
There ’s an undercurrent around this team that has to do with Lemaire ’s use of personnel .
For example , in 10 minutes on their scoreless power play , Paul Martin played 7:49 , Andy Greene 1:45 ; Kovalchuk 7:38 , Zach Parise 6:14 and Zajac 6:08 .
Patrik Elias , the franchise ’s all - time regular season and playoff scorer , and nowhere over - the - hill , had only 4:12 of extra man duty , and Jamie Langenbrunner less yet at 3:47 , close to Dainius Zubrus ’ 3:44 and Brian Rolston ’s 3:39 , and David Clarkson ’s 3:21 .
Rule No. 1 in the coaching manual is do n’t mess things up .
And often , the difference between genius moves and overcoaching is simply a bounce off a skate .
But right now , the Devils could use a little less attempt at genius , and a little more of sticking with what worked best this season , not the latest brainstorm .

Television Series Heroes Cancelled
NBC cancelled the one time ratings hit Heroes after four seasons .
The cited reasons for the cancellation are the high cost and the low ratings .
The show had a large set of followers during the first season averaging 14 million viewers in the United States .
A new superhero drama , The Cape , is reported to be the replacement for the series .
At the end of season four , cheerleader Claire Bennet revealed to the world the existence of ordinary people with superhuman abilities .
It is possible that the network will end the story with either a mini-series or a movie .
The network will be filling in new drama shows to its primetime line - up especially since the ruckus it found itself in after the failed primetime experiment of The Jay Leno Show .
These new shows include The Event , a show that is similar to the series 24 , Undercovers by JJ Abrams , Outsourced , Love Bites , Outlaw and Chase by Jerry Bruckheimer .

Description text and video produced by Manly Media :
A photo Journalist describes his experience following the black block as they rampage through the streets of Toronto during the G20 Summit .
20,000 police and security officials and a $ 1 billion security budget were not enough to stop 75 - 100 black block anarchists from smashing windows and torching police cars during a 1.5 hour rampage .
The Black Block were able to rampage through the street for 24 blocks until they reached the ' official protest zone ' where they quickly changed clothes dispersed through the crowd of peaceful protesters and then left the site .
The police were fully aware of the rampage and watched the black block from a distance at a number of locations .
It was n't until they had dispersed into a crowd of peaceful protesters who thought that they were in a sanctioned area that the police took action beating innocent people with batons and spraying them with pepper spray .
Why was this allowed to happen ?
Police abandoned police cars at Bay and King when they did n't need to , why ?
Was this allowed to happen so the Harper government could justify an outrageous security bill when there was no credible terrorist threat ( according to CSIS ) ?
Who led this group of vandals ?
Were they infiltrated by government paid provocateurs as was the case in Montebello where police with masks and rocks attacked their own riot squad ?
If corporate and union officials want to pour money into election campaigns , they would have to disclose who they are -- and perhaps appear in an ad -- under legislation introduced in Congress on Thursday .
The bill is a response to a controversial U.S. Supreme Court decision allowing unlimited corporate and interest group spending on elections .
In Citizens United vs. the Federal Elections Commission , the court in January struck down most federal limits on corporate spending as a violation of free speech .
Sen. Charles E. Schumer ( D - N.Y. ) , in an announcement at the steps of the Supreme Court , said the measure would “ shine a light on the flood of spending unleashed by the Citizens United decision . ”
He hopes to win passage of the bill by July 4 , in time for any flow of corporate money into the 2010 midterm congressional elections .
Schumer said “ a good number ” of Republicans “ are very favorably disposed to the legislation , ” but none appeared with him .
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R - Ky . ) called Schumer ’s announcement “ beyond suspicious , ” and charged that the bill is “ about election advantage , plain and simple . ”
Two Republicans cosponsor the House version of the bill , which would require the chief executive or head of an organization that is the primary financial sponsor of a televised political ad to take responsibility for it by appearing on camera .
Corporations , unions and advocacy groups would be required to create traceable campaign accounts and disclose -- via the Web and corporate filing statements -- the source of donations exceeding $ 1,000 .
The bill also would ban expenditures by government contractors and any domestic corporation if at least 20 % of its stock was owned by foreign nationals , or if foreign nationals played a dominant role in the corporation ’s leadership .
Companies that received federal bailout funds would be barred from making expenditures until they repaid those funds .
Republican Reps. Michael N. Castle of Delaware and Walter B. Jones of North Carolina joined Democratic Rep. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland in introducing the House version of the bill .
“ I do n’t see why this issue is a partisan one that should divide us , ” Castle said .
“ This is a serious attempt to have disclosure . ”
But Richard L. Hasen , a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles who specializes in election law , said the bill faces political and legal hurdles :
It must pass a heavily divided Senate in the midst of an election year , and it would probably face a Supreme Court challenge .
“ It is unclear whether this Supreme Court , which has shown a lot of hostility to campaign finance regulation , would be willing to uphold this , ” Hasen said .
William J. McGinley , a Republican lawyer , said the bill was “ carefully tailored to protect the Democratic majority in Congress and their soft - money allies , the unions . ”
President Obama praised the measure .
“ I welcome the introduction of this strong bipartisan legislation to control the flood of special - interest money into America ’s elections , ” he said .
Democrats have been concerned that the Citizens United ruling could give the GOP an unfair advantage , because major corporations tend to support Republicans .
The GOP counters that Democrats enjoy the favor of powerful labor unions , also big political spenders .
Schumer said the bill would “ stop the funneling of big money from shadow groups in order to fund ads that are virtually anonymous , ” a reference to organizations such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce .
Chamber President and Chief Executive Thomas Donohue called the bill “ a thinly veiled attempt to hijack the political playing field ÃÂ on the eve of midterm elections . ”
Republicans have hopes of retaking control of Congress in November .

The 46 - year - old - who will soon be seen playing John Lennon in BBC Four biopic Lennon Naked - said if he had remained in the job he would 've had to " blind myself to certain things I thought were wrong " .
But Eccleston told the Radio Times that , despite his misgivings , the show broke the mould and " I 'm very proud of it " .
The actor took on the role in 2004 when writer Russell T Davies gave Doctor Who a massive overhaul .
But despite widespread critical acclaim , the ninth Doctor moved on after his first series .
Explaining why he left , Eccleston said : " I was open - minded but I decided after my experience on the first series that I did n't want to do any more .
" I did n't enjoy the environment and the culture that we , the cast and crew , had to work in .
" I was n't comfortable .
I thought ' If I stay in this job , I 'm going to have to blind myself to certain things that I thought were wrong . '
And I think it 's more important to be your own man than be successful , so I left .
" But the most important thing is that I did it , not that I left .
I really feel that , because it kind of broke the mould and it helped to reinvent it .
I 'm very proud of it . "
Eccleston said he felt the BBC handled speculation about his departure " very badly " and rebutted suggestions that he was tired and scared of being typecast .
He said : " They handled it very badly but they issued an apology and I dropped it . "

Texas Governor Rick Perry , who is totally a nice guy who we definitely do n't want to insult , at all , carries a .380 Ruger with him when he jogs , because he is afraid of snakes .
On Tuesday , he killed a coyote .
It is totally insane to carry a handgun with hollow - point bullets while jogging , right ?
Unless you need to dispatch a coyote .
Perry ( R ) told the Associated Press on Tuesday that he needed just one shot from the laser - sighted pistol he sometimes carries while jogging to take down a coyote that menaced his puppy during a February run near Austin .
Perry said he carries his .380 Ruger — loaded with hollow - point bullets — when jogging on trails because he is afraid of snakes .
But when a coyote came out of the brush toward his daughter 's Labrador retriever , Perry charged .
Thank god for the right to bear arms !
Perry even had a fun action movie - style catchphrase :
" Do n't attack my dog , or you might get shot . . . if you 're a coyote , " he said Tuesday .
I have been to Texas and I am still not convinced it is a real place .

CENSORED IN 1978 :
AMERICA’S SECRET POLICE NETWORK
J. Edgar Hoover knew that power lies between the manila covers of a personal dossier and he used that knowledge to build and maintain his empire for almost half a century .
The FBI , the CIA and virtually every other agency given the authority to spy to defend us from foreign or domestic enemies , have sooner or later used their power to threaten our liberties .
In contrast to the CIA and FBI , the Law Enforcement Intelligence Unit ( LEIU ) is a little known organization ; in fact , almost no one has ever heard of it .
But its power is considerable and its potential threat to our freedom is enormous .
The LEIU links the intelligence squads of almost every major police force in the United States and Canada .
Although its members are sworn police officers who work for state and city governments , it is a private club , not answerable to voters , taxpayers , or elected officials .
It cuts across the vertical lines of authority of local government , for its members hold certain allegiances to the LEIU that cannot be countermanded by a mayor , county manager , or even a state governor .
Ex-members of the LEIU admit to illegal wiretapping , breaking and entering , and spying on people to gather information for their files .
Sources for this story included the San Francisco Chronicle , 11/25/78 , and Penthouse Magazine , December 1976 .
It was the # 6 censored story of 1978 .

Hi Everyone ,
In this post I will be discussing , perhaps the most important thing to get right in your internet marketing , which is writing copy for a website , and in particular writing product reviews .
You would be amazed out how many more sales you can make if you just pay attention to how you write your copy .
I find that a lot of people focus heavily on traffic generation , which is important , but they lack any clue about copy writing for niche sites , and end up making no money because of it .
Below I will explain what works for me .
When I am researching a product that I know nothing about , the first thing I do is type into Google the exact keyword phrase I want to target for a particular page on my site .
Then I open the top 3 - 5 pages in the Google results .
The phrase is often a buyer keyword , such as “ buy product ” “ product review ” etc …
The reason I read the top 5 websites in Google for my phrase , is to find out what other people are writing in their copy , and I often note down common phrases that I see .
My theory is that if Google are ranking these sites for this phrase , then I need to have similar words and phrases on my page .
Once I have a good idea of the common words and phrases and also have a better understanding about the topic , I will then type into Google : “ keyword prhase + forum ” .
What I am now doing is looking for what people are saying about this product on forums .
I want real feedback , the good and the bad !
The reason I like to go to forums and have a look around , is that I can find out what the biggest issues are that people are facing , and what they really think about the product I am considering promoting .
If I find all the reviews on forums to be terrible , I will not promote the product .
So now that I have done my research on the topic and keyword phrase , I now want to put together my own product review .
The key things that I do when writing product reviews , is I try to avoid repeating things that the product sales letter has said .
Remember that if a person is searching on a review keyword , then they have already had a sales pitch and are on the search for some feedback about the product .
However I write things in a subtle way , where I am still pushing the reader towards to product , but I am not doing it so obviously .
Often I see affiliate sites that just ram the product down the readers throat , and say it ’s the best thing ever .
Or even worse are these fictitious stories , where they say they have tried the product and worked like a miracle ( not my style ) .
So what I do is include details about the product that are not as easy to find , and describe the benefits of the features I am describing .
For example I might say this :
“ Product XYZ yeast cure claims they can get rid of your yeast infection quickly with out using any nasty chemicals to do so , which is a bonus . ”
I will also say things that I gathered from my research of user feedback on forums , and say : “ From the extensive personal research I did into product XYZ , I found that most users claimed that it did actually make them feel more energetic and overall the product was very well received ”
You could take it further and say things like : “ The product seems to work great for most people , a few people , but not many , claimed the product took 8 weeks to work and not 6 like the company claim , but still that is decent ”
When writing product reviews I will also mention reasons why you would want to use a product that does this in the first place .
So if I stick with Yeast Cure , I would mention all the benefits of clearing yeast infections , so people are more encouraged to get going and start a it immediately , which should , if the rest of the copy is done well , mean they will grab the product you are reviewing .
When I finish the product review , it ’s important to have a call to action , but again do not make this a sales pitch .
What I do is write in a suggesting manner , for example : “ If you are looking for a quality yeast infection product , I think product XYZ is a good choice , as the user feedback is very positive , and what ’s more the company offer a money back guarantee anyway , which is what reputable companies do . ”
So there you have it , writing product reviews is n’t hard to do , but you need to make sure you think it through and put yourself in the seat of the potential customer and write what they want to read , not just another sales pitch !
All the best
Matt
Excellent news : Jon Pipitone has finished his MSc project on the software quality of climate models , and it makes fascinating reading .
I quote his abstract here :
A climate model is an executable theory of the climate ; the model encapsulates climatological theories in software so that they can be simulated and their implications investigated .
Thus , in order to trust a climate model one must trust that the software it is built from is built correctly .
Our study explores the nature of software quality in the context of climate modelling .
We performed an analysis of the reported and statically discoverable defects in several versions of leading global climate models by collecting defect data from bug tracking systems , version control repository comments , and from static analysis of the source code .
We found that the climate models all have very low defect densities compared to well - known , similarly sized open - source projects .
As well , we present a classification of static code faults and find that many of them appear to be a result of design decisions to allow for flexible configurations of the model .
We discuss the implications of our findings for the assessment of climate model software trustworthiness .
The idea for the project came from an initial back - of - the - envelope calculation we did of the Met Office Hadley ’s Centre ’s Unified Model , in which we estimated the number of defects per thousand lines of code ( a common measure of defect density in software engineering ) to be extremely low – of the order of 0.03 defects / KLoC .
By comparison , the shuttle flight software , reputedly the most expensive software per line of code ever built , clocked in at 0.1 defects / KLoC ; most of the software industry does worse than this .
This initial result was startling , because the climate scientists who build this software do n’t follow any of the software processes commonly prescribed in the software literature .
Indeed , when you talk to them , many climate modelers are a little apologetic about this , and have a strong sense they ought to be doing more rigorous job with their software engineering .
However , as we documented in our paper , climate modeling centres such as the UK Met Office do have a excellent software processes , that they have developed over many years to suit their needs .
I ’ve come to the conclusion that it has to be very different from mainstream software engineering processes because the context is so very different .
Well , obviously we were skeptical ( scientists are always skeptical , especially when results seem to contradict established theory ) .
So Jon set about investigating this more thoroughly for his MSc project .
He tackled the question in three ways : ( 1 ) measuring defect density by using bug repositories , version history and change logs to quantify bug fixes ; ( 2 ) assessing the software directly using static analysis tools and ( 3 ) interviewing climate modelers to understand how they approach software development and bug fixing in particular .
I think there are two key results of Jon ’s work :
The initial results on defect density bear up .
Although not quite as startlingly low as my back of the envelope calculation , Jon ’s assessment of three major GCMs indicate they all fall in the range commonly regarded as good quality software by industry standards .
There are a whole bunch of reasons why result # 1 may well be meaningless , because the metrics for measuring software quality do n’t really apply well to large scale scientific simulation models .
You ’ll have to read Jon ’s thesis to get all the details , but it will be well worth it .
The conclusion ?
More research needed .
It opens up plenty of questions for a PhD project ….

Bisphenol A , commonly known as BPA , may be among the world ’s most vilified chemicals .
The compound , used in manufacturing polycarbonate plastic and epoxy resins , is found in plastic goggles , face shields , and helmets ; baby bottles ; protective coatings inside metal food containers ; and composites and sealants used in dentistry .
As animal studies began to show links between the chemical and breast and prostate cancer , early - onset puberty , and polycystic ovary syndrome , consumer groups pressured manufacturers of reusable plastic containers , like Nalgene , to remove BPA from their products .
Warnings went out to avoid microwaving plasticware or putting it in the dishwasher .
On May 6th , the President ’s Cancer Panel issued a report deploring the rising number of carcinogens released into the environment — including BPA — and calling for much more stringent regulation and wider awareness of their dangers .
The panel advised President Obama “ to use the power of your office to remove the carcinogens and other toxins from our food , water , and air that needlessly increase health care costs , cripple our Nation ’s productivity , and devastate American lives . ”
Dr. LaSalle Leffall , Jr. , the chairman of the panel , said in a statement , “ The increasing number of known or suspected environmental carcinogens compels us to action , even though we may currently lack irrefutable proof of harm . ”
Environmental hazards may cause lasting harm to children .

The narrative seems to follow a familiar path .
In the nineteen - sixties , several animal studies suggested that cyclamates , a class of artificial sweetener , caused chromosomal abnormalities and cancer .
Some three - quarters of Americans were estimated to consume the sweeteners .
In 1969 , cyclamates were banned .
Later research found that there was little evidence that these substances caused cancer in humans .
In the nineteen - eighties , studies suggesting a cancer risk from Alar , a chemical used to regulate the color and ripening of apples , caused a minor panic among parents and a media uproar .
In that case , the cancer risk was shown to have been overstated , but still present , and the substance remains classified a “ probable human carcinogen . ”
Lead , too , was for years thought to be safe in small doses , until further study demonstrated that , particularly for children , even slight exposure could result in intellectual delays , hearing loss , and hyperactivity .
There is an inherent uncertainty in determining which substances are safe and which are not , and when their risks outweigh their benefits .
Toxicity studies are difficult , because BPA and other , similar chemicals can have multiple effects on the body .
Moreover , we are exposed to scores of them in a lifetime , and their effects in combination or in sequence might be very different from what they would be in isolation .
In traditional toxicology , a single chemical is tested in one cell or animal to assess its harmful effects .
In studying environmental hazards , one needs to test mixtures of many chemicals , across ranges of doses , at different points in time , and at different ages , from conception to childhood to old age .
Given so many variables , it is difficult to determine how harmful these chemicals might be , or if they are harmful at all , or what anyone can do to avoid their effects .
In the case of BPA and other chemicals of its sort , though , their increasing prevalence and a number of human studies that associate them with developmental issues have become too worrisome to ignore .
The challenge now is to decide a course of action before there is any certainty about what is truly dangerous and what is not .
In 1980 , Frederica Perera , a professor at Columbia ’s Mailman School of Public Health and a highly regarded investigator of the effects of environmental hazards , was studying how certain chemicals in cigarette smoke might cause cancer .
Dissatisfied with the research at the time , which measured toxic substances outside the body and then made inferences about their effects , she began using sophisticated molecular techniques to measure compounds called polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons , or PAH — which are plentiful in tobacco smoke — in the body .
Perera found that after entering the lungs the compounds pass into the bloodstream and damage blood cells , binding to their DNA .
She hoped to compare the damaged blood cells from smokers with healthy cells , and decided to seek out those she imagined would be uncontaminated by foreign substances .
“ I thought that the most perfect pristine blood would come from the umbilical cord of a newborn , ” Perera said .
But when she analyzed her samples Perera discovered PAH attached to some of the DNA in blood taken from umbilical cords , too .
“ I was pretty shocked , ” she said .
“ I realized that we did not know very much about what was happening during this early stage of development . ”
Perera ’s finding that chemicals like PAH , which can also be a component of air pollution , are passed from mother to child during pregnancy has now been replicated for more than two hundred compounds .
These include PCBs , chemical coolants that were banned in the United States in 1979 but have persisted in the food chain ; BPA and phthalates , used to make plastics more pliable , which leach out of containers and mix with their contents ; pesticides used on crops and on insects in the home ; and some flame retardants , which are often applied to upholstery , curtains , and other household items .
Fetuses and newborns lack functional enzymes in the liver and other organs that break down such chemicals , and animal studies in the past several decades have shown that these chemicals can disrupt hormones and brain development .
Some scientists believe that they may promote chronic diseases seen in adulthood such as diabetes , atherosclerosis , and cancer .
There is some evidence that they may have what are called epigenetic effects as well , altering gene expression in cells , including those which give rise to eggs and sperm , and allowing toxic effects to be passed on to future generations .
In 1998 , Perera initiated a program at Columbia to investigate short - and long - term effects of environmental chemicals on children , and she now oversees one of the largest and longest - standing studies of a cohort of mothers and newborns in the United States .
More than seven hundred mother - child pairs have been recruited from Washington Heights , Harlem , and the South Bronx ; Perera is also studying pregnant women in Kraków , Poland , and two cities in China , and , since September 11 , 2001 , a group of three hundred and twenty - nine mothers and newborns from the downtown hospitals near the World Trade Center .
In all , some two thousand mother - child pairs have been studied , many for at least a decade .
This March , I visited Columbia ’s Center for Children ’s Environmental Health , where Perera is the director , and met with a woman I ’ll call Renee Martin in an office overlooking the George Washington Bridge .
Martin was born in Harlem , attended a community college in Queens , and then moved to 155th Street and Broadway , where she is raising her five children .
She entered the study eleven years ago , when she was pregnant with her first child .
“ I was asthmatic growing up , ” Martin said .
“ And I was concerned about triggers of asthma in the environment .
So when they asked me to be in the study I thought it would be a good way to get information that might tell me something about my own health and the health of my child . ”
She showed me a small black backpack containing a metal box with a long plastic tube .
During her pregnancy , Martin would drape the tube over her shoulder , close to her chin , and a vacuum inside the device would suck in a sample of air .
A filter trapped particles and vapors of ambient chemicals , like pesticides , phthalates , and PAH .
“ I walked around pregnant with this hose next to my mouth , but , living in New York , people hardly notice , ” she said with a laugh .
The Columbia team also developed a comprehensive profile of Martin ’s potential proximity to chemicals , including an environmental map that charted her apartment ’s distance from gas stations , dry cleaners , fast - food restaurants , supermarkets , and major roadways .
They took urine samples and , at delivery , blood samples from her and from the umbilical cord , along with samples from the placenta .
Nearly a hundred per cent of the mothers in the study were found to have BPA and phthalates in their urine .
Urine and blood samples are taken as the babies grow older , as well as samples of their exhaled breath .
“ We have a treasure trove of biological material , ” Perera said .
The researchers track the children ’s weight and sexual development , and assess I.Q. , visual spatial ability , attention , memory , and behavior .
Brain imaging , using an M.R.I. , is performed on selected children .
Martin was still breast - feeding her two - year - old daughter .
“ I bottle - fed my first child , ” she told me .
“ But when you learn what can come out of plastic bottles and all the benefits of breast - feeding — my other children were nursed . ”
The Columbia group regularly convenes the families to hear results and discuss ways to reduce their exposure to potential environmental hazards .
At one meeting , Martin found out that some widely used pesticides could result in impaired learning and behavior .
“ I told the landlord to stop spraying in the apartment ” to combat a roach infestation , she said .
On the advice of the Columbia researchers , Martin asked him to seal the cracks in the walls that were allowing cockroaches to enter , and Martin ’s family meticulously swept up crumbs .
This approach has now become the New York City Department of Health ’s official recommendation for pest control .
“ You do n’t need to be out in the country and have compost , ” Martin said .
“ This has made me into an urban environmentalist . ”
In 2001 , using data from animal studies , the E.P.A. banned the sale of the pesticide chlorpyrifos ( sold under the name Dursban ) for residential and indoor use .
Many agricultural uses are still permitted , and farming communities continue to be exposed to the insecticide .
Residues on food may affect those who live in urban areas as well .
In 2004 , the Columbia group published results in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives showing that significant exposure during the prenatal period to chlorpyrifos was associated with an average hundred - and - fifty - gram reduction in birth weight — about the same effect as if the mother had smoked all through pregnancy .
Those most highly exposed to the insecticide were twice as likely to be born below the tenth percentile in size for gestational age .
The researchers found that children born after 2001 had much lower exposure levels — indicating that the ban was largely effective .
For those children who were exposed to the pesticide in the womb , the effects have seemed to persist .
The children with the greatest exposure were starting to fall off the developmental curve and displayed signs of attention - deficit problems by the time they were three .
By seven , they showed significant deficits in working memory , which is strongly tied to problem - solving , I.Q. , and reading comprehension .
Another study , published this month in Pediatrics , using a random cross-section of American children , showed that an elevated level of a particular pesticide residue nearly doubled the likelihood that a child would have A.D.H.D .
“ The size of this deficit is educationally meaningful in the early preschool years , ” Virginia Rauh , the leader of Columbia ’s research , said .
“ Such a decline can push whole groups of children into the developmentally delayed category . ”
First used in Germany , in the nineteen - thirties , bisphenol A has a chemical structure similar to that of estrogen , but was considered too weak to be developed into a contraceptive pill .
Recent animal studies have shown that , even at very low levels , BPA can cause changes that may lead to cancer in the prostate gland and in breast tissue .
It is also linked to disruption in brain chemistry and , in female rodents , accelerated puberty .
Japanese scientists found that high levels of BPA were associated with polycystic ovary syndrome , a leading cause of impaired fertility .
Phthalates are also ubiquitous in cosmetics , shampoos , and other personal - care products .
They may have effects on older children and adults as well as on neonates .
A study at Massachusetts General Hospital found an association of high levels of certain phthalates with lower sperm concentrations and impaired sperm motility ; young girls in Puerto Rico who had developed breasts prematurely were more likely to have high levels of phthalates in their blood .
Immigrant children in Belgium who exhibited precocious puberty also showed greater exposure to the pesticide DDT , which has estrogenlike effects and has been banned in the U.S. , but is still used in Africa to help control malaria .
Long - term studies have provided the most compelling evidence that chemicals once considered safe may cause health problems in communities with consistent exposure over many years .
Researchers from SUNY Albany , including Lawrence Schell , a biomedical anthropologist , have worked over the past two decades with Native Americans on the Mohawk reservation that borders the St. Lawrence River , once a major shipping thoroughfare , just east of Massena , New York .
General Motors built a foundry nearby that made automobile parts , Alcoa had two manufacturing plants for aluminum , and the area was contaminated with PCBs , which were used in the three plants .
Several Mohawk girls experienced signs of early puberty , which coincided with higher levels of PCBs in their blood .
The Albany researchers also observed that increased levels of PCBs correlated with altered levels of thyroid hormone and lower long - term memory functioning .
Similar results have been found in an area of Slovakia near heavy industry .
“ Folks have complained about reproductive problems , ” Schell said , of the residents of the Mohawk reservation .
“ They talked a lot about rheumatoid arthritis , about lupus , about polycystic ovary syndrome .
And , you know , you hear these things and you wonder how much of it is just a heightened sensitivity , but , when you see elevated antibodies that are often a sign of autoimmune disease of one kind or another , it could be the beginning of discovering a biological basis for their complaints about these diseases . ”
Beginning in 2003 , Antonia Calafat , a chemist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , and Russ Hauser , of the Harvard School of Public Health , set out to evaluate the exposure of premature infants to certain environmental contaminants .
The researchers hypothesized that infants treated in the most intensive ways — intravenous feedings and delivery of oxygen by respirators — would receive the most exposure , since chemicals like phthalates and BPA can leach from plastic tubing .
They studied forty - one infants from two Boston - area intensive - care units for BPA .
Calafat told me , “ We saw ten times the amounts of BPA in the neonates that we are seeing in the general population . ”
In several children , the levels of BPA were more than a hundred times as high as in healthy Americans .
“ He ’s actually my co-counsel , but you may scratch his head . ”

Calafat , who came to the United States from Spain on a Fulbright scholarship , developed highly accurate tests to detect BPA , phthalates , and other compounds in body fluids like blood and urine .
This advance , she explained , “ means that you are not simply doing an exposure assessment based on the concentration of the chemicals in the food or in the air or in the soil .
You are actually measuring the concentrations in the body . ”
With this technology , she can study each individual as if he or she were a single ecosystem .
Her studies at the Centers for Disease Control show that 92.6 per cent of Americans aged six and older have detectable levels of BPA in their bodies ; the levels in children between six and eleven years of age are twice as high as those in older Americans .
Critics such as Elizabeth Whelan , of the American Council on Science and Health , a consumer - education group in New York ( Whelan says that about a third of its two - million - dollar annual budget comes from industry ) , think that the case against BPA and phthalates has more in common with those against cyclamates and Alar than with the one against lead .
“ The fears are irrational , ” she said .
“ People fear what they ca n’t see and do n’t understand .
Some environmental activists emotionally manipulate parents , making them feel that the ones they love the most , their children , are in danger . ”
Whelan argues that the public should focus on proven health issues , such as the dangers of cigarettes and obesity and the need for bicycle helmets and other protective equipment .
As for chemicals in plastics , Whelan says , “ What the country needs is a national psychiatrist . ”
To illustrate what Whelan says is a misguided focus on manufactured chemicals , her organization has constructed a dinner menu “ filled with natural foods , and you can find a carcinogen or an endocrine - disrupting chemical in every course ” — for instance , tofu and soy products are filled with plant - based estrogens that could affect hormonal balance .
“ Just because you find something in the urine does n’t mean that it ’s a hazard , ” Whelan says .
“ Our understanding of risks and benefits is distorted .
BPA helps protect food products from spoiling and causing botulism .
Flame retardants save lives , so we do n’t burn up on our couch . ”
Several studies also contradict the conclusion that these chemicals have deleterious effects .
The journal Toxicological Sciences recently featured a study from the E.P.A. scientist Earl Gray , a widely respected researcher , which indicated that BPA had no effect on puberty in rats .
A study of military conscripts in Sweden found no connection between phthalates and depressed sperm counts , and a recent survey of newborns in New York failed to turn up an increase in a male genital malformation which might be expected if the effects from BPA seen in rodents were comparable to effects in humans .
Richard Sharpe , a professor at the University of Edinburgh , and an internationally recognized pioneer on the effects of chemicals in the environment on endocrine disruption , recently wrote in Toxicological Sciences , “ Fundamental , repetitive work on bisphenol A has sucked in tens , probably hundreds of millions of dollars from government bodies and industry , which , at a time when research money is thin on the ground , looks increasingly like an investment with a nil return . ”
With epidemiological studies , like those at Columbia , in which scientists observe people as they live , without a control group , the real - life nature of the project can make it difficult to distinguish between correlation and causation .
Unknown factors in the environment or unreported habits might escape the notice of the researchers .
Moreover , even sophisticated statistical analysis can sometimes yield specious results .

Summary
Do immigrants take American jobs ?
It ’s a common refrain among those who want to tighten limits on legal immigration and deny a “ path to citizenship ” — which they call “ amnesty ” — to the millions of immigrants living in the U.S. illegally .
There ’s even a new Reclaim American Jobs Caucus in the House , with at least 41 members .
But most economists and other experts say there ’s little to support the claim .
Study after study has shown that immigrants grow the economy , expanding demand for goods and services that the foreign - born workers and their families consume , and thereby creating jobs .
There is even broad agreement among economists that while immigrants may push down wages for some , the overall effect is to increase average wages for American - born workers .
Analysis
Arizona ’s tough new law targeting illegal immigrants and the possibility of congressional action on immigration have brought a renewed focus to the issue .
Among lawmakers and others who seek stricter immigration limits and stronger enforcement , we ’ve noticed a common theme that may have particular resonance at a time when the unemployment rate remains stuck at close to 10 percent : that immigrants take American jobs .
But most who have studied the topic say it ’s not true .
We ’ll explain after we show you some of the arguments being made .
‘ Elevator ’ : Going Down ?
Exhibit A is an ad that ran in late April in Arizona .
It was sponsored by the Coalition for the Future American Worker , an organization that includes such groups as NumbersUSA and the Federation for American Immigration Reform , both of which seek to limit the number of people coming to the U.S. to live , legally or illegally .
The spot ’s narrator , lamenting the high number of unemployed Americans , says that “ with millions jobless , our government is still bringing in a million - and - a - half foreign workers a year to take American jobs . ”
Coalition for the Future American Worker Ad : “ Elevator ” Narrator : Another American has lost his job .
Another breadwinner going home with the bad news .
Nearly 15 million Americans are now out of work .
High - tech , construction and auto workers .
Engineers .
Yet with millions jobless , our government is still bringing in a million - and - a - half foreign workers a year to take American jobs .

Simple Math Caucus
Then there ’s the new group in the House of Representatives , the Reclaim American Jobs Caucus , which has at least 41 members .
Republican Reps. Lamar Smith of Texas , Sue Myrick of North Carolina , and Gary Miller of California announced its formation in a video in March , with Myrick saying : “ Right now , with unemployment hovering around 10 percent , we thought it was time to talk about the direct link between unemployment and illegal immigration . ”
Miller makes it all sound so easy : Eight million illegal immigrants working in the U.S. , 15 million unemployed American citizens and legal immigrants — we could cut the number of unemployed in half if we just booted out the illegal workers .
“ The numbers are simple , ” he says .
The numbers certainly would be simple , if they worked that way .
But they do n’t .
Reclaim American Jobs Caucus Video Smith : I ’m Congressman Lamar Smith , and I ’m joined today by my colleagues Gary Miller and Sue Myrick .
We co-chair the Reclaim American Jobs Caucus .
Myrick :
We formed the Reclaim American Jobs Caucus because right now , with unemployment hovering around 10 percent , we thought it was time to talk about the direct link between unemployment and illegal immigration .
Miller :
The numbers are simple .
At last estimate there were more than 8 million illegal immigrants in the U.S. labor force , and there are more than 15 million unemployed American citizens and legal immigrants .
In my home state of California , there are 2.2 million unemployed , but 1.8 million illegal immigrants in the labor force .
Myrick :
In my home state of North Carolina , there are almost half a million unemployed Americans , but 250,000 illegal immigrants in the labor force .
Smith : And in Texas there are 1 million unemployed , but 925,000 illegal immigrants in the labor force .
Miller :
And there are similar figures all across America .
That ’s just not right .
Smith :
If we were to just enforce the current immigration laws on the books , we would cut unemployment in half .
But the Obama administration is just not serious about immigration enforcement , and nowhere is that more apparent than in workplace enforcement .
In the last year administrative arrests have fallen 68 percent .
Those are deportation cases .
Criminal arrests are down 60 percent , criminal indictments have fallen 58 percent , and criminal convictions are down 63 percent .
Miller :
It does n’t stop there .
In one recent case the Obama administration first arrested , then released , several illegal immigrants , then drove them to work .
The administration is also once again pushing for amnesty for millions of illegal immigrants .
And open borders advocates are coming to Washington to rally for their cause .
It ’s an insult to every American and grim irony that as activists are flooding our nation ’s capital , asking for new rights and citizenship , millions of citizens and legal immigrants are out pounding the pavement looking for work anywhere .
Myrick : Dozens of our colleagues agree , and joined out caucus .
Together , we will promote policies to help citizens and legal immigrants reclaim the nearly 8 million jobs that illegal immigrants currently hold .
The Reclaim American Jobs Caucus will turn off the magnet that currently draws illegal immigration .
We will push for the use of the e-verify system that allows employers to validate the eligibility of new hires , support enforcement of workplace immigration laws , encourage attrition through enforcement and oppose policies like amnesty that encourage illegal immigration .
Smith : The Reclaim American Jobs Caucus will continue our efforts to get Americans back to work .
Millions are hurting , and it ’s time we moved them from jobless to jobs .
Arizona Redux
Exhibit C is from GOP Sen .
Jim DeMint of South Carolina , a leader in the tea party movement .
DeMint supports the new Arizona law , as do many tea partiers , and advocates its spread :
DeMint , May 6 : Every state will handle it differently .
… South Carolina has already passed laws to crack down on illegal immigrants .
Many other states are also under a lot of pressure because of high unemployment to not let illegal immigrants come and take jobs .
A Job for a Job
Exhibit A above , the CFAW ad , focuses on legal immigrants , those who have employment authorization documents or who are lawful permanent residents ( often known as green card holders ) .
According to a fact sheet posted by NumbersUSA to support the ad , the 1.5 million immigrants mentioned by the narrator is a combination of the two groups using 2007 figures .
( The coalition had to do some double - counting to get to that figure , but delving into the math would take us off - topic . )
The video from the congressional caucus and the statement from Sen.
DeMint refer specifically to illegal immigrants .
According to the Pew Hispanic Center , there were nearly 12 million undocumented immigrants in the U.S. in 2008 , with 8.3 million in the labor force .
About 5.4 percent of the nation ’s workforce , then , was composed of illegal immigrants .
But whether they ’re legal , as in the CFAW ad , or illegal , as in our two other examples , really does n’t matter for the purpose of answering our question :
The truth is that immigrants do n’t “ take American jobs , ” according to most economists and others who have studied the issue .
Immigrant workers “ create almost as many ” jobs as they occupy , “ and maybe more , ” said Madeleine Sumption , policy analyst at the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute , which is funded by a range of foundations , corporations and international organizations .
“ They often create the jobs they work in . ”
In addition , “ they buy things , and they make the economy bigger , ” she told us .
As she and a co-author wrote in a report last year for a group created by the British government :
Somerville and Sumption : [ T ] he impact of immigration [ on a nation ’s economy ] remains small , for several reasons .
Immigrants are not competitive in many types of jobs , and hence are not direct substitutes for natives .
Local employers increase demand for low - skilled labor in areas that receive low - skilled immigrant inflows .
Immigrants contribute to demand for goods and services that they consume , in turn increasing the demand for labor .
And immigrants contribute to labor market efficiency and long - term economic growth .
David Griswold , director of the Center for Trade Policy Studies at the libertarian Cato Institute , wrote in an article for Commentary magazine in December :
Griswold :
The addition of low - skilled immigrants expands the size of the overall economy , creating higher - wage openings for managers , craftsmen , accountants , and the like .
The net result is a greater financial reward and relatively more opportunities for those Americans who finish high school .
And a new study by economist Heidi Shierholz of the Economic Policy Institute — a liberal think tank that has been funded in part by U.S. labor unions — says that :
Shierholz :
In the ongoing debate on immigration , there is broad agreement among academic economists that it has a small but positive impact on the wages of native - born workers overall : although new immigrant workers add to the labor supply , they also consume goods and services , which creates more jobs …
Both Griswold and Shierholz acknowledge that some workers may be harmed by an influx of immigrant labor .
Griswold writes that “ low - skilled immigrants do exert mild downward pressure on the wages of the lowest - paid American workers , ” though the overall impact on jobs and the economy is positive .
Another economist , George Borjas , an advocate of clamping down on immigration , found that between 1980 and 2000 native - born Americans without a high school education saw their wages decline 7.4 percent because of immigrant labor .
Shierholz found that it ’s often other foreign - born workers — especially those who came to the U.S. several years earlier — who get the short end of the stick .
But American workers benefit , she writes :
Shierholz : A key result from this work is that the estimated effect of immigration from 1994 to 2007 was to raise the wages of U.S. - born workers , relative to foreign - born workers , by 0.4 % ( or $ 3.68 per week ) , and to lower the wages of foreign - born workers , relative to U.S. - born workers , by 4.6 % ( or $ 33.11 per week ) .
The consensus that immigrant workers expand the U.S. economy is broad , and crosses party lines .
In 2005 , the White House of Republican President George W. Bush remarked on the fact in one of its annual economic reports to Congress :
Economic Report of the President , Feb . 2005 : The foreign - born are associated with much of the employment growth in recent years .
Between 1996 and 2003 , when total employment grew by 11 million , 58 percent of the net increase was among foreign - born workers … .
[ E] mployment of natives as operators , fabricators , and laborers fell by 1.4 million between 1996 and 2002 , while employment in such occupations grew by 930,000 among the foreign - born .
This should not be taken as evidence that the foreign - born displace native workers ; rather , it reflects the fact that immigrants have made up all of the growth in the low - skilled workforce .
The people pictured in the elevator in CFAW ’s ad are n’t likely to be competing with immigrant labor for positions .
There may be other reasons for an overhaul of current immigration policy .
But the idea that foreign - born workers are stealing American jobs should be turned back at the border .

16 Vintage Soap Ads You Would Never See Today
Vintage cigarette ads have nothing on vintage soap ads .
Old soap ads are quite possibly the most racist / ridiculous advertisements ever .
Here in Britain we are constantly being told that we are hopeless at foreign languages .
Just last week there were reports that British companies are ignoring home - grown graduates for positions that require foreign language skills , and that European companies setting up in Britain have complained to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office about the lack of British graduates with strong language skills .
When employers talk about the strong foreign language skills of our European neighbours , what they mean are strong English language skills .
Of course , the German , French , Spanish and Dutch companies who complained to the FCO can find bilingual specialists in their own country – they have all learnt English from an early age .
English is the mandatory first foreign language in 13 of the EU 's member states , but children usually opt for it even in countries where it is not mandatory .
As a result , over 90 % of children in European Union countries ' schools learn English , and this figure is rising .
But what about us here in Britain when it comes to choosing which foreign language to teach first ?
Things are not so clear - cut for us .
Which is the best language to learn ?
Is Spanish more useful than French ?
Will teaching youngsters Mandarin Chinese improve their chances of finding a job in 10 years time ?
Who knows ?
Apart from Ireland , the United Kingdom is the only EU country where learning a language at school is not compulsory .
As a result , only 44 % of school pupils took a modern language GCSE in 2009 .
The figures are even more dire at A - level ; fewer than 5 % of all A - level entrants sat a language exam last year .
This explains why there is such a small pool of graduates able to speak a foreign language , and why foreign companies moving to Britain get frustrated .
The reasons for this state of affairs are complex , but they have little to do with British children having poor language skills .
The introduction of school league tables have been blamed for the drop in languages uptake , with headteachers steering pupils away from so - called " difficult " subjects ( which include modern languages ) towards subjects where they are likely to get higher grades , thus boosting the school 's league table position .
The new government announced on 7 June that it was abandoning the new primary curriculum recommended by the past government , which would have made learning a foreign language compulsory from year 3 .
British industry 's own attitude towards foreign languages is also thought to discourage school pupils from taking languages seriously ; the practice of not paying a salary premium to staff with language skills is one example .
We may be at the bottom of the EU list when it comes to numbers of pupils learning a foreign language , but we are top of the EU list when it comes to the range of languages on offer in our schools .
Nineteen European Union languages in total are taught somewhere in England and Wales , and that does n't include Mandarin , Japanese , Arabic , Russian or Urdu , which are not EU languages but which are taught in many British schools .
France is in second place , with 16 languages on offer , but countries usually lauded for their language skills , such as Germany , the Netherlands and Norway are near the bottom with between five and eight languages on offer in their schools .
Why ?
Because they 're too busy devoting all their efforts to English .
This diversity in language tuition available in Britain continues after school in the adult and continuing - education sectors .
It 's easier to learn a minority language in Britain than almost anywhere else .
It 's certainly easier to learn several disparate minority languages .
City Lit in London offers 18 languages , including Catalan , Czech and Cornish .
At Cardiff Centre for Lifelong Learning you can learn Polish , Turkish , Croatian and a dozen other foreign languages .
You can sign up for Brazilian Portuguese in Birmingham , Danish in St Helens or Hungarian in Waltham Forest .
In language classes like these you will find people who had no interest in languages at school , but then they met a Polish girlfriend , or bought a holiday home in Italy , or fell in love with Russian literature or are learning for a myriad of other reasons .
Their success at language learning ( and sometimes at learning very difficult languages ) may not bump up the GCSE and A - level rates , but it puts paid to the idea that Britons " do n't do languages " .
For more than a year , the United States has gone through a contentious and divisive debate over health reform , but in the past fortnight these divisions turned genuinely nasty .
In the wake of vilification , threats and vandalism , some leaders within the Republican Party and the activist Tea Party movement have stepped forward to condemn the violence and harassment .
But the problem is that the seeds of this dangerous and volatile reaction to health care 's passage were sown months ago .
However they might try to defuse the situation now , it seems that this aggression against the government was , to some extent , stoked by the message conservative leaders used in fighting Barack Obama 's push for health reform .
The ugliness began in the days leading up to the votes on health care legislation , when anti-reform protesters yelled racist and homophobic slurs at Democratic lawmakers and one Democratic Congressman was allegedly spat on .
Democratic Party politicians have received death threats and had their offices vandalised .
In the most dangerous act of hostility so far , the brother of Virginia Representative Tom Perriello had the propane gas line to his house cut after Tea Party activists posted his address online and encouraged people to " drop by , " in the mistaken belief it was the Congressman 's home .
These acts are n't orchestrated or organised , but at this point they are far from isolated - which means that it is important to consider where the increase in violent and threatening behaviour might come from .
It 's easy to dismiss these as the acts of disturbed people who have channelled their anger at the health reform legislation into unacceptable responses .
But what type of person might be prone to such extreme reactions to the passage of a law , and what factors might make someone more likely to do so ?
I suspect that a plausible answer to those questions comes from the evidence about right - wing authoritarianism , and from the approach American conservative leaders have taken to motivating authoritarian followers .
Our understanding of authoritarian followers stems from the work of Dr Bob Altemeyer at the University of Manitoba in Canada , although his findings have been replicated and extended by researchers around the world .
Altemeyer found that people high in authoritarianism display three tendencies : to submit to the people they see as legitimate authorities in society ( authoritarian submission ) , to believe that everyone should follow the customs and traditions of society ( conventionalism ) , and to be aggressive toward anyone defined as an opponent or transgressor by the authorities ( authoritarian aggression ) .
Not all conservatives are authoritarians , and authoritarianism is not exclusive to conservative politics .
But in recent years the Republican Party has taken a direction that increasingly appeals to an authoritarian base .
With their emphasis on a single set of dominant values , both neoconservatism and the religious right seem consistent with the way authoritarians view the world .
Former Nixon lawyer John Dean 's book , Conservatives Without Conscience , drew on Altemeyer 's work to highlight the rise of authoritarian control in the Republican Party .
Since the 2008 election , the Democratic Party has controlled the White House and both houses of Congress .
How has the conservative movement retained and motivated the authoritarian followers in their base ?
By attacking not just the appropriateness of Obama 's policies but the legitimacy of his government .
At the furthest extreme has been the " birther " movement , which claims Obama was born in Kenya and is ineligible to be President .
But as early as the Presidential campaign Obama has been targeted by accusations that imply his rise to power has been illegitimate , such as the attempts to paint him as " palling around with terrorists " and being aided by voter registration fraud , or that he cannot represent America 's values because of his mixed heritage and the idea that he might be a Muslim .
His approach to government and policy has been repeatedly likened to Hitler , Marxism , fascism , and almost any other ideology or regime that has a negative connotation in the United States .
In a nation of 300 million , it 's almost inevitable that conspiracy theories and extreme views are going to exist about any leader .
What matters is that these attacks on Obama 's legitimacy have n't just come from the fringe of the conservative movement - they have been put forward , endorsed and encouraged by conservative leaders .
High - rating personalities on the media outlets most trusted by conservatives , such as FOX News ' Glenn Beck and Sean Hannity and talk radio host Rush Limbaugh , have stated and fostered views that Obama is a socialist or a fascist , that his policies are unconstitutional and undermine American sovereignty , and that his actions are similar to Hitler's .
And Republican politicians have aligned themselves with these messages .
A few examples among many :
When asked last December about the " birther " movement 's questions about Barack Obama 's birth certificate , Sarah Palin said , " I think the public rightfully is still making it an issue .
I do n't have a problem with that . "
At a Tea Party rally last April , Texas 's Governor Rick Perry skirted very close to advocating secession .
Several Republican Representatives , including John Linder and Paul Broun of Georgia and Steve King of Iowa , have compared Obama 's government to Hitler 's Germany .
It 's hardly surprising then that many conservatives do n't just dispute Obama 's policies , but feel his Presidency endangers America 's integrity .
Exactly how many is hard to estimate - several polls have tried , most recently a Harris poll and before that a Research2000 poll .
Each has had its flaws and likely overestimates the true numbers , but it seems safe to conclude that some conservatives believe Obama is not a native - born citizen , stole the election with ACORN 's help , is a socialist and / or fascist , and is a Muslim who does n't share their values .
For the authoritarian followers who have heeded this message , submission to authority might well give way to aggression against what are seen as illegitimate attempts at control .
What 's more , research has shown that a perceived threat enhances the effects of authoritarianism - which means that when leaders describe the passage of health reform as " Armageddon " that will " ruin our country " , as House Minority Leader John Boehner did , we might expect that the tension and aggression will be heightened .
Australian politics might have its share of character attacks and appeals to emotion , but the conflict of ideas remains an important part of our discourse .
Our debate over emissions trading was divisive , both within and across party lines , but it was largely based on principles and policies and certainly did not see widespread aggression or threats .
In this election year , we can expect that the debate will remain civil and focused on the issues .
Given the current tensions in America and their roots in the way authoritarian followers are exploited , we can consider ourselves a lucky country in that regard .

NEW YORK —
After hours of contentious public comment , a New York City community board voted late Tuesday to support a plan to build a mosque and cultural center near ground zero .
"
It 's a seed of peace , " board member Rob Townley said .
" We believe that this is a significant step in the Muslim community to counteract the hate and fanaticism in the minority of the community .
" The vote was 29 - to - 1 in favor of the plan , with 10 abstentions .
The move by the Manhattan Community Board 1 , while not necessary for the building 's owners to move forward with the project , is seen as key to obtaining residents ' support .
The organizations sponsoring the project say they 're trying to meet a growing need for prayer space in lower Manhattan , as well as provide a venue for the dissemination of mainstream Islam , to counter extremism .
"
The moderate Muslim voice has been squashed in America , " said Bruce Wallace , who said he lost a nephew in the Sept. 11 attacks .
" Here is a chance to allow moderate Muslims to teach people that not all Muslims are terrorists .
" Others at the meeting had a different view .
" We think it 's an insult , " said Pamela Gellar , executive director of Stop Islamization of America .
" It 's demeaning to non-Muslims to build a shrine dedicated to the very ideology that inspired 9/11 .
" The plan , which would include areas for interfaith activities and conferences and an arts center , has attracted political and social opposition .
Conservative tea party activist Mark Williams has called the proposed center a monument to the terror attacks .
And some Sept. 11 victims ' families say they 're angry it would be built so close to where their relatives died .
Manhattan Borough President Scott Stringer , who has been the target of disparaging remarks by Williams for supporting the plans , defended his position and denounced offensive speech directed at him or at Muslims .
" What I want people to do is to take a look at the totality of what they are proposing , " Stringer said .
" What we 're rejecting here is outright bigotry and hatred .
" Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said there were no security concerns about building a mosque in the area .
Stringer said he understood the sensitivities of the families of 9/11 victims .
" I do n't think anybody wants to do anything to disrespect those families .
They made the ultimate sacrifice , " he said .
" At the same time , we have to balance diversity and look for opportunities to bring different groups together .
" The American Society for Muslim Advancement and the Cordoba Initiative , the organizations sponsoring the project , have said that they bought the building in 2009 and planned to break ground later this year .
It could take up to three years to build the Cordoba House .
A Friday prayer service has been held at the building since September 2009 .
The explanatory video from the Department of Defense says something about how it 's only for trained Special Operations soldiers , and " you should never throw something over power lines , " but that is clearly just marketing hype , calculated to give the Bat Hook an air of exclusivity .
The video says it 's for use in jungles too , and everyone knows there are n't power lines overhead in jungles .

On May 3 , 2005 , in France , a man called an emergency hot line for missing and exploited children .
He frantically explained that he was a tourist passing through Orthez , near the western Pyrenees , and that at the train station he had encountered a fifteen - year - old boy who was alone , and terrified .
Another hot line received a similar call , and the boy eventually arrived , by himself , at a local government child - welfare office .
Slender and short , with pale skin and trembling hands , he wore a muffler around much of his face and had a baseball cap pulled over his eyes .
He had no money and carried little more than a cell phone and an I.D. , which said that his name was Francisco Hernandez Fernandez and that he was born on December 13 , 1989 , in Cáceres , Spain .
Initially , he barely spoke , but after some prodding he revealed that his parents and younger brother had been killed in a car accident .
The crash left him in a coma for several weeks and , upon recovering , he was sent to live with an uncle , who abused him .
Finally , he fled to France , where his mother had grown up .
Bourdin once wrote , “ When you fight monsters , be careful that . . . you do not become one . ”
Photograph by François - Marie Banier
French authorities placed Francisco at the St. Vincent de Paul shelter in the nearby city of Pau .
A state - run institution that housed about thirty - five boys and girls , most of whom had been either removed from dysfunctional families or abandoned , the shelter was in an old stone building with peeling white wooden shutters ; on the roof was a statue of St. Vincent protecting a child in the folds of his gown .
Francisco was given a single room , and he seemed relieved to be able to wash and change in private : his head and body , he explained , were covered in burns and scars from the car accident .
He was enrolled at the Collège Jean Monnet , a local secondary school that had four hundred or so students , mostly from tough neighborhoods , and that had a reputation for violence .
Although students were forbidden to wear hats , the principal at the time , Claire Chadourne , made an exception for Francisco , who said that he feared being teased about his scars .
Like many of the social workers and teachers who dealt with Francisco , Chadourne , who had been an educator for more than thirty years , felt protective toward him .
With his baggy pants and his cell phone dangling from a cord around his neck , he looked like a typical teen - ager , but he seemed deeply traumatized .
He never changed his clothes in front of the other students in gym class , and resisted being subjected to a medical exam .
He spoke softly , with his head bowed , and recoiled if anyone tried to touch him .
Gradually , Francisco began hanging out with other kids at recess and participating in class .
Since he had enrolled so late in the school year , his literature teacher asked another student , Rafael Pessoa De Almeida , to help him with his coursework .
Before long , Francisco was helping Rafael .
“ This guy can learn like lightning , ” Rafael recalls thinking .
One day after school , Rafael asked Francisco if he wanted to go ice - skating , and the two became friends , playing video games and sharing school gossip .
Rafael sometimes picked on his younger brother , and Francisco , recalling that he used to mistreat his own sibling , advised , “ Make sure you love your brother and stay close . ”
At one point , Rafael borrowed Francisco ’s cell phone ; to his surprise , its address book and call log were protected by security codes .
When Rafael returned the phone , Francisco displayed a photograph on its screen of a young boy who looked just like Francisco .
“ That ’s my brother , ” he said .
Francisco was soon one of the most popular kids in school , dazzling classmates with his knowledge of music and arcane slang — he even knew American idioms — and moving effortlessly between rival cliques .
“ The students loved him , ” a teacher recalls .
“ He had this aura about him , this charisma . ”
During tryouts for a talent show , the music teacher asked Francisco if he was interested in performing .
He handed her a CD to play , then walked to the end of the room and tilted his hat flamboyantly , waiting for the music to start .
As Michael Jackson ’s song “ Unbreakable ” filled the room , Francisco started to dance like the pop star , twisting his limbs and lip - synching the words “ You ca n’t believe it , you ca n’t conceive it /
And you ca n’t touch me , ’ cause I ’m untouchable . ”
Everyone in the room watched in awe .
“ He did n’t just look like Michael Jackson , ” the music teacher subsequently recalled .
“ He was Michael Jackson . ”
Later , in computer class , Francisco showed Rafael an Internet image of a small reptile with a slithery tongue .
“ What is it ? ” Rafael asked .
“ A chameleon , ” Francisco replied .
On June 8th , an administrator rushed into the principal ’s office .
She said that she had been watching a television program the other night about one of the world ’s most infamous impostors : Frédéric Bourdin , a thirty - year - old Frenchman who serially impersonated children .
“ I swear to God , Bourdin looks exactly like Francisco Hernandez Fernandez , ” the administrator said .
Chadourne was incredulous : thirty would make Francisco older than some of her teachers .
She did a quick Internet search for “ Frédéric Bourdin . ”
Hundreds of news items came up about the “ king of impostors ” and the “ master of new identities , ” who , like Peter Pan , “ did n’t want to grow up . ”
A photograph of Bourdin closely resembled Francisco — there was the same formidable chin , the same gap between the front teeth .
Chadourne called the police .
“ Are you sure it ’s him ? ” an officer asked .
“ No , but I have this strange feeling . ”
When the police arrived , Chadourne sent the assistant principal to summon Francisco from class .
As Francisco entered Chadourne ’s office , the police seized him and thrust him against the wall , causing her to panic : what if he really was an abused orphan ?
Then , while handcuffing Bourdin , the police removed his baseball cap .
There were no scars on his head ; rather , he was going bald .
“ I want a lawyer , ” he said , his voice suddenly dropping to that of a man .
At police headquarters , he admitted that he was Frédéric Bourdin , and that in the past decade and a half he had invented scores of identities , in more than fifteen countries and five languages .
His aliases included Benjamin Kent , Jimmy Morins , Alex Dole , Sladjan Raskovic , Arnaud Orions , Giovanni Petrullo , and Michelangelo Martini .
News reports claimed that he had even impersonated a tiger tamer and a priest , but , in truth , he had nearly always played a similar character : an abused or abandoned child .
He was unusually adept at transforming his appearance — his facial hair , his weight , his walk , his mannerisms .
“ I can become whatever I want , ” he liked to say .
In 2004 , when he pretended to be a fourteen - year - old French boy in the town of Grenoble , a doctor who examined him at the request of authorities concluded that he was , indeed , a teen - ager .
A police captain in Pau noted , “ When he talked in Spanish , he became a Spaniard .
When he talked in English , he was an Englishman . ”
Chadourne said of him , “ Of course , he lied , but what an actor ! ”
Over the years , Bourdin had insinuated himself into youth shelters , orphanages , foster homes , junior high schools , and children ’s hospitals .
His trail of cons extended to , among other places , Spain , Germany , Belgium , England , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , Switzerland , Bosnia , Portugal , Austria , Slovakia , France , Sweden , Denmark , and America .
The U.S. State Department warned that he was an “ exceedingly clever ” man who posed as a desperate child in order to “ win sympathy , ” and a French prosecutor called him “ an incredible illusionist whose perversity is matched only by his intelligence . ”
Bourdin himself has said , “ I am a manipulator .
. . .
My job is to manipulate . ”

In Pau , the authorities launched an investigation to determine why a thirty - year - old man would pose as a teen - age orphan .
They found no evidence of sexual deviance or pedophilia ; they did not uncover any financial motive , either .
“ In my twenty - two years on the job , I ’ve never seen a case like it , ” Eric Maurel , the prosecutor , told me .
“ Usually people con for money .
His profit seems to have been purely emotional . ”
On his right forearm , police discovered a tattoo .
It said “ caméléon nantais ” — “ Chameleon from Nantes . ”
“ Mr. Grann , ” Bourdin said , politely extending his hand to me .
We were on a street in the center of Pau , where he had agreed to meet me one morning last fall .
For once , he seemed unmistakably an adult , with a faint five - o’ clock shadow .
He was dressed theatrically , in white pants , a white shirt , a checkered vest , white shoes , a blue satin bow tie , and a foppish hat .
Only the gap between his teeth evoked the memory of Francisco Hernandez Fernandez .
After his ruse in Pau had been exposed , Bourdin moved to a village in the Pyrenees , twenty - five miles away .
“ I wanted to escape from all the glare , ” he said .
As had often been the case with Bourdin ’s deceptions , the authorities were not sure how to punish him .
Psychiatrists determined that he was sane .
( “ Is he a psychopath ? ” one doctor testified .
“ Absolutely not . ” )
No statute seemed to fit his crime .
Ultimately , he was charged with obtaining and using a fake I.D. , and received a six - month suspended sentence .
A local reporter , Xavier Sota , told me that since then Bourdin had periodically appeared in Pau , always in a different guise .
Sometimes he had a mustache or a beard .
Sometimes his hair was tightly cropped ; at other times , it was straggly .
Sometimes he dressed like a rapper , and on other occasions like a businessman .
“ It was as if he were trying to find a new character to inhabit , ” Sota said .
Bourdin and I sat down on a bench near the train station , as a light rain began to fall .
A car paused by the curb in front of us , with a couple inside .
They rolled down the window , peered out , and said to each other , “ Le Caméléon . ”
“ I am quite famous in France these days , ” Bourdin said .
“ Too famous . ”
“ We ’d like you to leave out the poorer , sickness , and death parts — they ’re a little dark . ”

As we spoke , his large brown eyes flitted across me , seemingly taking me in .
One of his police interrogators called him a “ human recorder . ”
To my surprise , Bourdin knew where I had worked , where I was born , the name of my wife , even what my sister and brother did for a living .
“ I like to know whom I ’m meeting , ” he said .
Aware of how easy it is to deceive others , he was paranoid of being a mark .
“ I do n’t trust anybody , ” he said .
For a person who described himself as a “ professional liar , ” he seemed oddly fastidious about the facts of his own life .
“ I do n’t want you to make me into somebody I ’m not , ” he said .
“ The story is good enough without embellishment . ”
I knew that Bourdin had grown up in and around Nantes , and I asked him about his tattoo .
Why would someone who tried to erase his identity leave a trace of one ?
He rubbed his arm where the words were imprinted on his skin .
Then he said , “ I will tell you the truth behind all my lies . ”
Before he was Benjamin Kent or Michelangelo Martini — before he was the child of an English judge or an Italian diplomat — he was Frédéric Pierre Bourdin , the illegitimate son of Ghislaine Bourdin , who was eighteen and poor when she gave birth to him , in a suburb of Paris , on June 13 , 1974 .
On government forms , Frédéric ’s father is often listed as “ X , ” meaning that his identity was unknown .
But Ghislaine , during an interview at her small house , in a rural area in western France , told me that “ X ” was a twenty - five - year - old Algerian immigrant named Kaci , whom she had met at a margarine factory where they both worked .
( She says that she can no longer remember his last name . )
After she became pregnant , she discovered that Kaci was already married , and so she left her job and did not tell him that she was carrying his child .
Ghislaine raised Frédéric until he was two and a half —
“ He was like any other child , totally normal , ” she says — at which time child services intervened at the behest of her parents .
A relative says of Ghislaine , “ She liked to drink and dance and stay out at night .
She did n’t want anything to do with that child . ”
Ghislaine insists that she had obtained another factory job and was perfectly competent , but the judge placed Frédéric in her parents ’ custody .
Years later , Ghislaine wrote Frédéric a letter , telling him , “ You are my son and they stole you from me at the age of two .
They did everything to separate us from each other and we have become two strangers . ”
Frédéric says that his mother had a dire need for attention and , on the rare occasions that he saw her , she would feign being deathly ill and make him run to get help .
“ To see me frightened gave her pleasure , ” he says .
Though Ghislaine denies this , she acknowledges that she once attempted suicide and her son had to rush to find assistance .
When Frédéric was five , he moved with his grandparents to Mouchamps , a hamlet southeast of Nantes .
Frédéric — part Algerian and fatherless , and dressed in secondhand clothes from Catholic charities — was a village outcast , and in school he began to tell fabulous stories about himself .
He said that his father was never around because he was a “ British secret agent . ”
One of his elementary - school teachers , Yvon Bourgueil , describes Bourdin as a precocious and captivating child , who had an extraordinary imagination and visual sense , drawing wild , beautiful comic strips .
“ He had this way of making you connect to him , ” Bourgueil recalls .
He also noticed signs of mental distress .
At one point , Frédéric told his grandparents that he had been molested by a neighbor , though nobody in the tightly knit village investigated the allegation .
In one of his comic strips , Frédéric depicted himself drowning in a river .
He increasingly misbehaved , acting out in class and stealing from neighbors .
At twelve , he was sent to live at Les Grézillières , a private facility for juveniles , in Nantes .
There , his “ little dramas , ” as one of his teachers called them , became more fanciful .
Bourdin often pretended to be an amnesiac , intentionally getting lost in the streets .
In 1990 , after he turned sixteen , Frédéric was forced to move to another youth home , and he soon ran away .
He hitchhiked to Paris , where , scared and hungry , he invented his first fake character : he approached a police officer and told him that he was a lost British teen named Jimmy Sale .
“ I dreamed they would send me to England , where I always imagined life was more beautiful , ” he recalls .
When the police discovered that he spoke almost no English , he admitted his deceit and was returned to the youth home .
But he had devised what he calls his “ technique , ” and in this fashion he began to wander across Europe , moving in and out of orphanages and foster homes , searching for the “ perfect shelter . ”
In 1991 , he was found in a train station in Langres , France , pretending to be sick , and was placed in a children ’s hospital in Saint - Dizier .
According to his medical report , no one knew “ who he was or where he came from . ”
Answering questions only in writing , he indicated that his name was Frédéric Cassis — a play on his real father ’s first name , Kaci .
Frédéric ’s doctor , Jean - Paul Milanese , wrote in a letter to a child - welfare judge , “ We find ourselves confronted with a young runaway teen , mute , having broken with his former life . ”
The Turkey - Brazil - Iran deal : Can Washington take ‘ yes ’ for an answer ?
The Brazilian - Turkish diplomatic breakthrough with Iran has taken Washington by surprise .
Clearly , the geopolitical center of gravity has shifted — five years of EU - led negotiations led nowhere while the new emerging powers Brazil and Turkey only needed a few months to produce a breakthrough .
Now , the West needs to pull off some political acrobatics to avoid being on the diplomatic defensive .
Before Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva ’s trip to Iran this weekend , few among the permanent members of the U.N. Security Council were optimistic about his chances of success .
Russian President Dmitry Medvedev was charitable when he put Lula ’s odds at 30 percent .
U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton reportedly called her Brazilian counterpart to discourage Brazil from undertaking the diplomatic mission .
And few in Washington seemed to have been prepared for a diplomatic breakthrough .
But against all odds , Turkey and Brazil seem to have succeeded in resolving the most critical obstacle in the Iranian nuclear standoff : the issue of trust .
Both through the modalities of the new deal as well as by virtue of what they are , Turkey and Brazil have succeeded in filling the trust gap .
For the Iranians — beyond their political paralysis of last year — the issue of trust was the primary flaw of the October 2009 proposal .
As the Iranians saw it , the deal would have required that Iran place disproportionate trust in the Western powers by agreeing to give up its low - enriched uranium stockpile in one shipment , only to receive fuel rods for Iran ’s research reactor nine to 12 months later .
This would have required a significant leap of faith on their behalf .
Iran ’s relations with most permanent Security Council states ( P5 ) are fraught with tension and mistrust .
This includes its relations with Russia .
European powers ’ past support for Saddam Hussein — including providing him with high - tech weaponry and components for chemical weapons — has not been forgotten in Tehran , particularly not by those in President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad ’s circles .
Iran ’s relations with Turkey and Brazil are different , however .
Although tensions and rivalry with Turkey have historic roots , relations have improved significantly under Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan ’s government .
Although some skepticism remains , Iran has nevertheless noted Turkey ’s increased independence from — and at times , defiance of — the United States .
In particular , Turkey ’s position on the Iraq war as well as its campaign to prevent a new round of U.N. Security Council sanctions on Iran must have impressed Tehran .
Moreover , unlike with the P5 states , Iran does not only have some trust in Turkey , but it also senses that it has some leverage over its Western neighbor .
In 2009 , Iranian - Turkish trade stood at around $ 11 billion , with Iran providing a significant portion of Turkey ’s gas needs .
The combination of trust and leverage seems to have been critical in getting the Iranians to agree to put their stockpiles in Turkish territory .
In Brazil , Iran has found an unlikely but much needed ally .
Brazil is a rising global power , with a legitimate claim for a permanent seat in the Security Council .
It ’s a state with a long history of sympathizing and identifying with the Iranian position on nuclear matters .
If the reprocessing takes place in Brazil , as opposed to Russia , it would be a political victory for Iran to have it occur in an emerging power that for long has endorsed Iran ’s right to enrichment and that itself achieved recognition of its enrichment right in spite of international pressure .
While Iran has been suspicious of European and U.S. maneuvers and proposals , out of a fear that the West ’s ultimate objective is to eliminate Iran ’s enrichment program , that suspicion is unlikely to arise in a Brazilian - sponsored deal due to Brazil ’s own nuclear program and self - interest in ensuring that Iran ’s nuclear rights are n’t inhibited and turned into a legally binding precedent .
In fact , the Turkish - Brazilian - Iranian agreement explicitly endorses Iran ’s right to enrichment , a position the United Stats has refused to officially accept .
Beyond economic interests , international prestige , and the opportunity for Brazil and Turkey to become indispensable global actors , it should not be forgotten than both states have viewed war and confrontation as the likely alternative to their diplomacy .
In particular , there has been a fear that the current Security Council draft resolution , while not providing an explicit justification for military action , would nevertheless provide regional states outside the Security Council with a legal basis to take military action against Iran ’s nuclear facilities .
Washington ’s reaction has thus far been muted .
Although details of the agreement remain unknown , two potential points of objection have emerged .
First , the amount of low - enriched uranium ( LEU ) that will be shipped to Turkey , 1,200 kilograms , constituted approximately 75 percent of Iran ’s stockpile back in October .
Although that percentage has shrunk , it will still leave Iran with less LEU than it would need for a bomb .
Still , even though Washington insisted that the deal from October remains on the table and that it is nonnegotiable , it might be the United States itself that ends up seeking to renegotiate the terms .
Second , Iran has expanded its enrichment activities and is currently enriching uranium to 19.75 percent .
The United States insists that this activity must be suspended .
In spite of these potential sticking points , it is important to note that both Brazilian and Turkish decision - makers have intimate knowledge of the U.S. position .
The United States ’ red lines are crystal clear to both .
And even though both have shown significant independence from the United States , it is unlikely that they would announce a deal with Iran that would n’t meet U.S. requirements .
Rather , the Obama administration ’s problem with domestic actors may be a greater challenge .
Both the House and the Senate have prepared broad sanctions bills , which they intend to send to the president in the next few days .
Even if the deal meets U.S. security requirements , Congress may still push forward its extraterritorial sanctions bill , citing other concerns with Iranian behavior .
With the November elections only months away , President Obama may face some stiff opposition from Congress , even over a deal that meets America ’s red lines on the nuclear issue .

A vocal dwarf activist for issues ranging from gay and disabled rights to transportation was struck and killed by a taxi as he left a meeting on the Lower East Side , authorities said yesterday .
Harry Wieder , 57 , walked with crutches from a meeting of Community Board 3 Tuesday evening at PS 20 , then crossed Essex Street in the middle of the block and was hit by a yellow cab , fellow board members said .
Wieder was rushed to Bellevue Hospital , where he was pronounced dead .
The diminutive crusader got his start as an activist in the early 1980s when he came out as gay and got involved in the rights group ACT UP .
Wieder became a fixture at community - board meetings , rallies and hearings and was well - known on the city ’s political scene .
Healthcare stocks dropped Friday as Wall Street feared more bad news ahead for the nation ’s large insurance companies after giant insurer WellPoint Inc. abruptly canceled a massive rate increase in California .
Investors worried that Indianapolis - based WellPoint ’s decision to abandon plans for rate hikes as high as 39 % amid pressure from state officials could be a sign of things to come elsewhere .
“ People are thinking , if this is happening in California , it might start happening in other states , ” said Steven Shubitz , a healthcare analyst with Edward Jones in St. Louis .
“ If that happens , profit growth could be seriously impacted . ”
WellPoint unit Anthem Blue Cross withdrew rate increases for many of its 800,000 California customers with individual policies Thursday after a state consultant found it had overstated future medical costs used to justify the higher premiums .
State officials said Anthem ’s rate application was filled with methodological errors that pushed up rates .
On Friday , shares of WellPoint , the nation ’s largest health insurer as measured by membership , tumbled nearly 9 % to $ 53.80 .
The losses came two days after the company reported a 51 % increase in first - quarter earnings .
WellPoint ’s poor performance on the final day of April followed a pullback on Wall Street as the Dow Jones industrial average fell 158 points .
All major indexes dropped more than 1 % .
UnitedHealth Group , the nation ’s largest insurance company by revenue , and insurer Humana each dropped 3 % .
Insurers Aetna and Cigna were both down 5 % .
Analysts said uncertainty over the effect of the nation ’s new healthcare law has left investors jittery .
The new law will impose billions of dollars of new taxes on insurance companies .
It will guarantee insurance for millions of uncovered Americans and bar insurers from rejecting anyone because of medical conditions .
Insurers will have spend at least 80 % of their premium revenues on healthcare for plans that cover individuals and small business , and 85 % for policies with large employers .
The effect of the new law remains uncertain because federal officials have yet to determine which expenses will factor into the formulas .
Insurers say they can’t project potential costs until the details are nailed down .
“ It ’s unclear how much more they are going to have to spend because we do n’t know the definition of medical spending , ” said Sarah James , a health services analyst with Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles .
“ Uncertainty around the reform issue is weighing on stock prices . ”
In its earnings report Wednesday , WellPoint said that it spends 82 % of its revenue on medical claims .
The company ’s subsidiaries have more than 33 million customers in 14 states .
In California , insurers now are required to devote only 70 % of revenue to claims .
Anthem said that all of the insurance plans submitted in its rate - hike application met the threshold .
But the state ’s outside actuarial consultant said , however , that one of the Anthem plans was at 67 % after correcting errors in the insurer ’s flawed methodology .
Anthem said it would file new rates this month that would satisfy the federal spending requirements .
An Anthem spokeswoman said Friday the company could not assess the effect of the new regulations on its bottom line .
“ It is premature to estimate the impact new medical loss ratios will have on premiums , having only yesterday announced plans to refile our individual rates , ” said Peggy Hinz .

DOSE :
T+ 0:00 26 mg oral 2C - I ( powder / crystals ) T+ 3:30 smoked Cannabis ( plant material )
BODY WEIGHT : 150 lb
Substance : 2C - IDose : 26 mg ingested orally ( Mixed into orange juice ) Weight : 150lbs ( ~68kg ) Mindset : Normal .
There are no serious problems in my life right now to worry about .
I had a typical day .
I 've been wanting to trip again , but not a really hard trip .
Having used 2C - I 3 times in the past , I felt it would be an enjoyable hallucinogenic experience without too much concern about a bad experience .
Setting : My apartment on a Friday night .
I am typing the experience as I go .
I will edit the entries later to fix errors and elaborate .
7:30 pm ( t - 0:00 ) I orally ingest 26mg 2C - I .
My roommate wants a lighter trip , so he takes 20 mg . 8:00 pm ( t+ 0:30 ) I notice a slight nausea and tightness in upper chest .
My sinuses seem a bit mucosal and stuffy , but they have been getting worse for the last two days , anyway .
I think I might be developing a cold or allergies , as I 've been sneezing a bit as well .
8:20 pm ( t+ 0:50 ) I notice some mild visual morphing beginning .
Patterns are beginning to waver , as if slowly breaking out of their confinement .
I could use some weed to help this ' tense ' feeling 2c - i always seems to give me .
Slight color enhancement has become noticeable as well .
8:30 pm ( t+ 1:00 ) My roommate and I are taking a walk to the ATM about 2 blocks away near the grocery store behind our apartment complex to get weed money , since our source is supposed to call us later .
8:50 pm ( t+ 1:20 ) That was an interesting journey .
We ran into an old high school friend , and I think she could tell we were not in our usual states of mind .
We were n't completely tripping , but surely we appeared unusual .
I tried to casually say , ' Hey ' and leave it at that .
I hope I did n't just come off as rude , but I have n't seen or spoken to this girl in 3 years , and we were more like acquaintances than real friends .
We walked around the shopping center just to kill some time while the 2C - I continues kicking in .
We 're back at the apartment now , and the visuals are enhancing , still .
Colors are definitely more distinguished , but still not as much patterning as I remember .
It 's still kind of early as far as 2C - I onset goes , and with the right music , I think I 'll be set .
On a side note , that walk did get my system going , so now I 'm a bit sweaty and warm .
I think I 'll drink some orange juice .
I also notice a nice body buzz setting in .
My nose is too stuffy to breathe through , so I 've been breathing through my mouth ( this countinued through the trip , deep breaths felt very nice and helped me maintain a more relaxed trip despite the usual speedy tension feeling I tend to get on 2C - I.9:00 pm ( t+ 1:30 ) I took the time to notice that the closed eye visuals are pretty involving , now .
Listening to the Chemical Brothers has really helped bring me up a bit .
I 'm definitely a ++ at this point .
9:15 pm ( t+ 1:45 ) I'm noticing the usual phenethylamine ' itches ' and ' buzzes ' are making themselves present , once again .
It is difficult to drink my orange juice .
The liquid itself is actually very smooth and refreshing , though .
I am turning on some Aphex Twin ' Selected Ambient Works ' to guide the ride , so to speak .
9:40 pm ( t+ 2:10 ) Damn !!
It felt like an hour and a half went by with some interesting hallucinations .
I imagined there was a staircase ( in our 3 room apartment , haha ) , and with the lights out , the cd player looked like a futuristic helper robot .
The visuals are great if I can let myself get immersed in the music , but this CD seems a bit too dissonant and hollow for me to really sink into .
I begin looking for some classical music , as I have never gotten to hear classical music while tripping , and I think it would be much richer and warmer that the electronic music I usually listen to .
One of my favorite things about 2C - I is the way it alters my perception of music .
It 's tough to explain in words , but it 's like the music becomes a story , and every single note and sound is an element of that story , a character or setting or object or event or even a color .
I guess many hallucinogens do similar things , but with 2C - I , I am able to be a bit more clear - headed and form a seemingly rational landscape ( or soundscape , I guess ) even with music I 've never heard before .
I suppose words cannot fully describe a psychedelic experience .
10:20 pm ( t+ 2:50 ) Damn !!
( again , I know ) I'm definitely noticing more time dilation , but with some AMAZING closed eye visuals .
Classical music is amazing .
It feels so huge .
Bigger than huge .
It 's like a meeting of so many levels , but with their own distinct flares and tempos that all coincide to form an entire entity .
Words can't describe it .
I saw an infinite ' cathedral . '
It was n't a church , per se , but it had a very sacred feeling to it .
There were enlightened minds from all times , even from times that have not and will not exist , all gathered together .
In my mind , I felt as if there were beings there that existed in some different reality , or at least some far away planet .
Imagine cities of people singing , cities of people playing the violin , and each individual is represented by his or her own distinct sound .
Now imagine whole civilizations just playing one type of instrument , while another civilization plays another .
Colors , fractals , and infinite landscapes fill my mind as Mozart , Bach , and Beethoven fill my ears .
I come to the conclusion that these composers were beyond geniuses .
I begin to wonder if they ever tripped , which I seriously doubt , and what they would see if they did .
During that time , I was definitely at a +++.
Enough typing , I 'm going back to the experience .
10:25 pm ( t+ 2:55 ) Sadly , the experience must be put on hold .
Our pot supplier just called , and now we have to figure out where he is and how to get there using the ' ultra - sophisticated ' bus system .
The problem is , map reading is more than difficult in this mindset .
Ultimately , I figure out that he is only about three - quarters of a mile down the road , so we set off walking pick up an eighth .
It 's been SO dry around here , this is the first weed we 've been able to buy in about 4 days .
11:00 ( t+ 3:30 ) We are back from our purchase .
During the walk , I felt an almost MDMA - like body buzz , especially with deep breathing .
I had to focus a bit on where we were going and on our surroundings .
I noticed a slight drop in visuals as a result .
The whole event sort of changed the mindset of the trip .
We decide to watch some DVDs rather than listen to more music .
It seems like the complex and detailed closed eye hallucinations that music brings me take some sort of mental effort to maintain , especially with all the vivid colors and moving / morphing shapes and patterns .
I notice definite open eye patterning remains , but this seems to occur without any effort , as if the patterns were always there .
For example , the rug in our main room is plain blue , but I see a definite , non-changing pattern in it .
Even when seen from my periphery , the rug has that same distinct , almost oriental , pattern .
1:20 am ( t+ 5:50 ) We basically chilled and watched DVDs until now , as we were notably stoned , but still tripping rather well .
We watched about an hour and a half of Aqua Teen Hunger force episodes .
My roommate and I note the hilarity of this poor guy , named Carl , trying to make a semi-normal living next door to a giant milkshake , a giant box of fries , and a giant ball of meat , and how his life is completely ruined by them in almost every episode .
The 2C - I definitely made watching these shows a lot funnier , and allowed us to see interesting patterns in the characters ' behavior and their relationships .
I do n't think I 've laughed so hard in a long time .
During the time between 11 pm and 1:20 am , we smoked 3 joints of some mid-grade weed .
The weed tasted a little weird , but not unpleasant .
During this time , the ' phenethylamine tingles , ' as I like to call them , became a bit more noticeable .
This seems to be on par with prior experiences I 've had .
As the trip begins to slowly wear down , my body gets little prickly sensations like a mix between an itch and a buzz , especially on my face , my arms , and the roof of my mouth .
Around the same time , I noticed very electronic sounds .
My roommate did too , and they were definitely not from the neighbors ' apartment .
These sounds were only noticeable when it was quiet and I remember thinking they sounded almost like a psychic communication in some sort of digital code .
Almost like some higher being is constantly communicating some message just waiting for an advanced enough species to be able to receive it and decipher it with their mind .
I wish I could replicate the sounds , as they are pretty interesting to me , and would probably be an interesting musical element .
I am getting a little tired but am still noticeably tripping , and my roommate is ready for bed .
He did have a bit less , so perhaps he is not tripping as much as I still am .
I 'll probably listen to something relaxing and try to sleep .----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Most of the report was typed while I was experiencing the trip , but today I went back and added a few things to some entries that I felt like I did n't fully explain while tripping .
Plus , my typing was a little sketchy .
I ended up lying in bed until around 2:30 to 2:45 am ( t+ 7:00 - give or take ) , around which time I drifted to sleep .
I spent that last hour and a half doing some introspection about my life .
I 've realized I have much more growing up to do .
I tend to be poor at things like organization and planning , and I made a few resolutions about things I need to do to get my life in order so that I can be happier and live healthier .
I also realized that I 'm a really introverted person in a LOT of aspects .
I feel unemotional or apathetic to a lot of people , and I began to wonder why .
I think perhaps I might be a little too self - centered sometimes .
I also feel like I 'm a bit controlling sometimes .
My friends always seem to ask my opinion on things , for some reason , and I think I 've sort of taken advantage of that .
Also , I was the oldest child in my home for nearly 10 years ( after my older sister moved out ) , so perhaps I 've just become too accustomed to being the one in charge .
I wish sometimes my friends would step up and make decisions , rather than expect me to be the responsible one all the time .
When I 'm tripping , this responsibility feels almost like manipulation .
I do n't want to spend my life alone , so I need to make an effort to connect with people and not just see them as obstacles in my path .
That 's always been hard for me , but I think I can work on it just by being more communicative with other students and with professors .
That is the first step at least .
I also made some discoveries about my self - control ( or lack thereof ) in many areas .
This is just one more way I need to grow up .
Also , stretching felt really good while lying in bed , and I must have stretched for about 30 minutes while thinking .
One thing that did annoy me during this time was a very remarkable forgetfulness .
I would come to some realization about myself or life and then immediately forget it as some new though came to the surface .
It took a lot of focusing and effort to remember some things that I had just thought 5 seconds earlier .
I suspect the weed had something to do with it , and today I notice no lasting forgetfulness like what I experienced while lying in bed .
My roommate noted that his muscles feel a bit sore today .
My back feels a little tired , not sore , but like the muscles have been exercised - a bit odd .
All in all , it was an enjoyable trip .
I realized there are some aberrations in my psyche and my life that I must resolve before I can enjoy a more in - depth hallucinogen again .
The closed eye visuals were fantastic , especially with classical music .
Open eye visuals were decent , especially if I focused on them enough .
It seems like 2C - I can produce really great visuals , but the mental energy required to generate and maintain these visuals seems to have my mind drained by the end of the trip .
This is a bit different than 2C - E for me , as 2C - E visuals seem to force themselves to be seen , which still leads to mental exhaustion by the end .
I think I 've gotten familiar enough with 2C - I to where I feel almost clear - headed at times .
There were moments early on when visuals would manifest , then slowly disappear , only to re-emerge a few seconds later .
I think I got a pretty good all around experience , as well .
There was a musical hallucination - laden period , an explorative period of walking , a hilarious session of Aqua Teen hunger Force and smoking joints , and some good introspection and self - awareness at the end .
I really enjoy 2C - I for the way it takes me to an extra level of perception while not being too overbearing on my mind and psyche .
I still feel a little bit out of it , even after a nice 8 ½ hour sleep , but I have nothing to do today except clean up the apartment , which some weed will definitely help with .
With the help of the Democrats and the unions
New Jersey Governor presses attack on public employees and education
By Sandy English
14 May 2010
New Jersey Governor Chris Christie this week announced a package of 33 bills that attack the most basic rights of public employees .
A main feature of his proposals is an amendment to the New Jersey Constitution that puts a 2.5 percent cap on local property tax increases , which will make it nearly impossible to give teachers and other employees of local municipalities decent pay raises or in many cases any pay raises at all , particularly in light of deep cuts in state funding .
Other elements of Christie ’s proposed package include permitting communities to opt out of the state ’s civil service system via a petition of 15 percent of local voters .
This would give local communities the power to furlough workers without regard to seniority .
Another of Christie ’s bills would abolish adjustments for cost - of - living in state pensions , increase employee contributions to health care and pensions , and raise the retirement age from 62 years to 65 years .
Christie ’s plan will also make employees contribute toward their health care after retirement , and will eliminate all state - run health plans and the pension plan for new hires .
In state - run colleges and universities , faculty would now have to undergo a probationary period before hiring , and individual institutions , instead of the state ’s Office of Employee Relations , would bargain with unions .
Leaders of the New Jersey Democratic Party , which controls the state legislature and whose support is needed to pass these bills , have already voiced their agreement with the plan :
“ We ’re going to work with him , ” State Senate President Stephen Sweeney said .
“ We ’re going to provide him with a tool kit , as he says , for these communities . ”
In addition to this attack on the rights of public workers , in the last two weeks the Christie administration has proposed new laws aimed at further degrading public education in the state .
This follows the rejection last month by New Jersey voters of 58 percent of local school budgets , after Christie campaigned for this on the grounds that teachers had refused to accept wage freezes .
Between $ 820 million and $ 1 billion is now scheduled to be eliminated from school spending in New Jersey , destroying thousands of teaching jobs and closing down school programs .
On May 5 , the state ’s Education Commissioner , Bret Schundler , announced in a speech in a conference in Princeton a proposal aimed at winning a $ 400 million grant from President Obama ’s Race to the Top program , the plan by the White House and the federal Department of Education to grant federal funds to states that are most active in implementing plans for charter schools and other attacks on public education .
Schundler targeted tenure and teacher pay as particular obstacles .
According to the new plan , teachers would now have to wait five , rather than three , years before being granted tenure .
Significantly , tenure would be now tied to “ student performance ” on test scores .
Layoffs would also be tied to performance , and would no longer be made by seniority .
Legislation along these lines is scheduled to be introduced by May 17 , in time to meet the deadline for application for Race to the Top funds on June 1 .
Schundler ’s scheme also seeks to create a statewide bonus pool using money from the Race to the Top funds .
Individual teachers would be awarded pay directly , or schools could use it to support staff or programs .
At a subsequent press conference , Governor Christie emphasized the bipartisan nature of this attack on education : “ This is an incredibly special moment in American history when you have a Republican governor in New Jersey agreeing with a Democratic president on how to get reform ” in education .
In a related development , Christie said that he plans to expand the number of charter schools in New Jersey , and that he supports a bill now in the state legislature that will grant thousands of public scholarships for private or parochial schools .
The bill , called the “ Opportunity Scholarship Act , ” is sponsored by state Senators Thomas Kean , Jr. , a Republican , and Raymond Lesniak , a Democrat .
New Jersey ’s public education advocacy group , the Education Law Center , noted that the bill is a boondoggle for corporate tax relief .
“ Over five years , the bill allows corporations to contribute $ 360 million for private school vouchers and receive a 100 % deduction from their state taxes .
The result : a loss of $ 360 million in revenue to the state treasury , revenue that is no longer available to support public education .
The bill also diverts $ 360 million in public funds to private and religious schools , with no requirement that these schools meet state education quality and performance standards . ”
The ELC also observed that the legislation is not designed to help students in failing schools , since a district that might otherwise be wealthy , with successful private or parochial schools , would only have to have a single failing school in it to qualify for the program .
For example , according to the ELC , “ even though Cherry Hill has one ‘ chronically failing school ’ serving only 37 students — or 0.3 % of the district ’s enrollment — all of the district ’s students are eligible for a voucher under this legislation . ”
The bipartisan support for charter schools and other types of private education go hand in hand with the attacks on teachers ’ seniority rights , pensions and jobs .
Every wing of the political establishment promotes this assault .
Among the most enthusiastic proponents of privatization of education in the state is Democratic Newark Mayor Cory Booker , who was reelected to office on Tuesday and is often touted as a possible candidate for statewide or federal office .
Newark is New Jersey ’s largest city , with a population of about 280,000 and one of the lowest standards of living in the state , with a pre-recession poverty rate of 24 percent .
A recent article in the Wall Street Journal noted the close cooperation between Booker and Christie on educational policy in the state :
“ Gov. Christie , a Republican , is likely to help the Democratic Mr. Booker make strides in education .
The mayor said he ’s already had conversations with the governor about getting more involvement in the oversight of the city ’s schools , and thus accelerating his plans to improve the schools .
He said he and the governor have been talking about ‘ creating a national model for education reform , ’ and that Newark is on pace to increase the number of students going to charter schools to up to 25 % over the next five years . ”
In New Jersey and elsewhere the unions have willingly surrendered to the cuts , wage freezes and other attacks .
One of the two teachers unions in New Jersey voiced open support for the plan announced by Education Commissioner Schundler .
Joseph Del Grosso , the president of the Newark Teachers Union ( NTU ) , said , “ We support merit pay in the broadest context .
In the sense that there should be a way for a school or teacher to show that they have been successful . ”
The NTU represents 5,600 teachers and is affiliated with the American Federation of Teachers .
The majority of New Jersey ’s teachers belong to the New Jersey Education Association ( NJEA ) , which is affiliated with the National Education Association .
The NJEA has also played a deceitful role in implementing Christie ’s cuts and supporting the privatization of education .
A day after condemning the Board of Education ’s proposal for merit pay , for instance , NJEA leaders met with Schundler to collaborate on the state ’s application for Race to the Top funds .
Nj.com reported NJEA President Barbara Keshishian as saying that the “ NJEA requested the meeting in order to present ideas for the state ’s application .
We are hopeful that this could lead to a broadly supported and successful application . ”
Thousands of New Jersey teachers now expect to lose their jobs and will be searching for work in the worst labor market since the Great Depression .
Christie ’s campaign to make teachers and other public employees pay for the crisis is part of an unprecedented onslaught on these sections of the working class in virtually every section of the US .
The tri-state area of New York , New Jersey and Connecticut has become a major focus of this attack .
As the New York Times reported on May 12 , 44 out of 69 Connecticut school districts are freezing teachers ’ pay , and in many suburban New York school districts teachers are being told to reopen contracts in order to give up scheduled pay increases .
At least 123 school districts in the New York City region itself , including 67 in New York , 20 in Connecticut and 34 in New Jersey , have successfully demanded concessions from their teachers .
The attacks on teachers are based on a cynical attempt to use the alleged welfare of schoolchildren in order to whip up a demagogic attack on supposedly overpaid sections of the working class .
The real purpose is to undermine public education , pit one section of workers against another , and divert attention from the actual causes of the social crisis .
The teachers are among the first targets of this reactionary campaign , but it will quickly be expanded against every other section of working people .
New Jersey is being touted as an example , a test case for what can be achieved through demagogic attacks on teachers .
Both Democrats and Republicans can see , however , that despite the collaboration of the unions , this will not be an easy task .
The student demonstrations that took place on April 27 and in the following days , when tens of thousands of high school students , organized by a group on the social networking Facebook site and through text - messaging , walked out of school to protest teacher layoffs and cuts in school programs , show that the deepening attacks on workers and youth will inevitably provoke new struggles .
The New Jersey student walkouts were a harbinger of bigger battles to come .
Can this thing be eaten at all ?
Big news all over the place today about a huge scientific achievement led by Dr. J. Craig Venter , some 15 years and tens of millions of dollars in the making .
A live press conference is taking place now , as I type this blog post ( screengrab above ) , and you can watch the video online .
" We 've briefed the White House … " Venter says , as I click publish … followed by an audience question about bioterrorism concerns .
This is big stuff .
Snip from Edge.org announcement :
On May 20th , J. Craig Venter and his team at J.C Venter Institute announced the creation of a cell controlled by a synthetic genome in a paper published in SCIENCE .
As science historian George Dyson points out , " from the point of view of technology , a code generated within a digital computer is now self - replicating as the genome of a line of living cells .
From the point of view of biology , a code generated by a living organism has been translated into a digital representation for replication , editing , and transmission to other cells . "
This new development is all about operating on a large scale .
" Reading the genetic code of a wide range of species , " the paper says , " has increased exponentially from these early studies .
Our ability to rapidly digitize genomic information has increased by more than eight orders of magnitude over the past 25 years " This is a big scaling up in our technological abilities .
Physicist Freeman Dyson , commenting on the paper , notes that " the sequencing and synthesizing DNA give us all the tools we need to create new forms of life " .
But it remains to be seen how it will serve in practice .
One question is whether or not a DNA sequence alone enough to generate a living creature .
One way of reading of the paper suggests this does n't seem to be the case because of the use of old microplasma cells into which the DNA was inserted — that this is not about " creating " life " because , the new life requires an existing living recipient cell .
If this is the case , what is the chance of producing something de novo ?
The paper might appear to be about a somewhat banal technological feat .
The new techniques build on existing capabilities .
What else is being added , what is qualitatively new ?
While it is correct to say that the individual cell was not created , a new line of cells ( dare one say species ? ) was generated .
This is new life that is self - propagating , i.e. " the cells with only the synthetic genome are self replicating and capable of logarithmic growth . "
In an electrifying first , Stanford scientists have plugged in to algae cells and harnessed a tiny electric current .
They found it at the very source of energy production -- photosynthesis , a plant 's method of converting sunlight to chemical energy .
It may be a first step toward generating " high efficiency " bioelectricity that does n't give off carbon dioxide as a byproduct , the researchers say .
" We believe we are the first to extract electrons out of living plant cells , " said WonHyoung Ryu , the lead author of the paper published in the March issue of Nano Letters .
Ryu conducted the experiments while he was a research associate for mechanical engineering professor Fritz Prinz .
The Stanford research team developed a unique , ultra - sharp nanoelectrode made of gold , specially designed for probing inside cells .
They gently pushed it through the algal cell membranes , which sealed around it , and the cell stayed alive .
From the photosynthesizing cells , the electrode collected electrons that had been energized by light and the researchers generated a tiny electric current .
" We 're still in the scientific stages of the research , " said Ryu .
" We were dealing with single cells to prove we can harvest the electrons . "
Plants use photosynthesis to convert light energy to chemical energy , which is stored in the bonds of sugars they use for food .
The process takes place in chloroplasts , the cellular powerhouses that make sugars and give leaves and algae their green color .
In the chloroplasts , water is split into oxygen , protons and electrons .
Sunlight penetrates the chloroplast and zaps the electrons to a high energy level , and a protein promptly grabs them .
The electrons are passed down a series of proteins , which successively capture more and more of the electrons ' energy to synthesize sugars until all the electron 's energy is spent .
In this experiment , the researchers intercepted the electrons just after they had been excited by light and were at their highest energy levels .
They placed the gold electrodes in the chloroplasts of algae cells , and siphoned off the electrons to generate the tiny electrical current .
The result , the researchers say , is electricity production that does n't release carbon into the atmosphere .
The only byproducts of photosynthesis are protons and oxygen .
" This is potentially one of the cleanest energy sources for energy generation , " Ryu said .
" But the question is , is it economically feasible ? "
Ryu said they were able to draw from each cell just one picoampere , an amount of electricity so tiny that they would need a trillion cells photosynthesizing for one hour just to equal the amount of energy stored in a AA battery .
In addition , the cells die after an hour .
Ryu said tiny leaks in the membrane around the electrode could be killing the cells , or they may be dying because they 're losing out on energy they would normally use for their own life processes .
One of the next steps would be to tweak the design of the electrode to extend the life of the cell , Ryu said .
Harvesting electrons this way would be more efficient than burning biofuels , as most plants that are burned for fuel ultimately store only about 3 to 6 percent of available solar energy , Ryu said .
His process bypasses the need for combustion , which only harnesses a portion of a plant 's stored energy .
Electron harvesting in this study was about 20 percent efficient .
Ryu said it could theoretically reach 100 percent efficiency one day .
( Photovoltaic solar cells are currently about 20 - 40 - percent efficient . )
Possible next steps would be to use a plant with larger chloroplasts for a larger collecting area , and a bigger electrode that could capture more electrons .
With a longer - lived plant and better collecting ability , they could scale up the process , Ryu said .
Ryu is now a professor at Yonsei University in Seoul , South Korea .
Other authors of the paper are Prinz , the senior author , ; Seoung - Jai Bai , Tibor Fabian , Rainer J. Fasching , Joong Sun Park , and Zubin Huang , all researchers in the Rapid Protoyping Laboratory at Stanford University ; and Jeffrey Moseley and Arthur Grossman , both researchers in the Department of Plant Biology at the Carnegie Institution and Department of Biological Sciences .

Creativity is akin to insanity , say scientists who have been studying how the mind works .
Brain scans reveal striking similarities in the thought pathways of highly creative people and those with schizophrenia .
Both groups lack important receptors used to filter and direct thought .
It could be this uninhibited processing that allows creative people to " think outside the box " , say experts from Sweden 's Karolinska Institute .
In some people , it leads to mental illness .
But rather than a clear division , experts suspect a continuum , with some people having psychotic traits but few negative symptoms .
Art and suffering
Some of the world 's leading artists , writers and theorists have also had mental illnesses - the Dutch painter Vincent van Gogh and American mathematician John Nash ( portrayed by Russell Crowe in the film A Beautiful Mind ) to name just two .
Creativity is known to be associated with an increased risk of depression , schizophrenia and bipolar disorder .

The thalamus channels thoughts
Similarly , people who have mental illness in their family have a higher chance of being creative .
Associate Professor Fredrik Ullen believes his findings could help explain why .
He looked at the brain 's dopamine ( D2 ) receptor genes which experts believe govern divergent thought .
He found highly creative people who did well on tests of divergent thought had a lower than expected density of D2 receptors in the thalamus - as do people with schizophrenia .
The thalamus serves as a relay centre , filtering information before it reaches areas of the cortex , which is responsible , amongst other things , for cognition and reasoning .
" Fewer D2 receptors in the thalamus probably means a lower degree of signal filtering , and thus a higher flow of information from the thalamus , " said Professor Ullen .
Creative people , like those with psychotic illnesses , tend to see the world differently to most .
It 's like looking at a shattered mirror Mark Millard , UK psychologist
He believes it is this barrage of uncensored information that ignites the creative spark .
This would explain how highly creative people manage to see unusual connections in problem - solving situations that other people miss .
Schizophrenics share this same ability to make novel associations .
But in schizophrenia , it results in bizarre and disturbing thoughts .
UK psychologist and member of the British Psychological Society Mark Millard said the overlap with mental illness might explain the motivation and determination creative people share .
" Creativity is uncomfortable .
It is their dissatisfaction with the present that drives them on to make changes .
" Creative people , like those with psychotic illnesses , tend to see the world differently to most .
It 's like looking at a shattered mirror .
They see the world in a fractured way .
" There is no sense of conventional limitations and you can see this in their work .
Take Salvador Dali , for example .
He certainly saw the world differently and behaved in a way that some people perceived as very odd . "

He said businesses have already recognised and capitalised on this knowledge .
Some companies have " skunk works " - secure , secret laboratories for their highly creative staff where they can freely experiment without disrupting the daily business .
Chartered psychologist Gary Fitzgibbon says an ability to " suspend disbelief " is one way of looking at creativity .
" When you suspend disbelief you are prepared to believe anything and this opens up the scope for seeing more possibilities .
" Creativity is certainly about not being constrained by rules or accepting the restrictions that society places on us .
Of course the more people break the rules , the more likely they are to be perceived as ' mentally ill ' . "
He works as an executive coach helping people to be more creative in their problem solving behaviour and thinking styles .
" The result is typically a significant rise in their well being , so as opposed to creativity being associated with mental illness it becomes associated with good mental health . "
OMAHA , Neb. ( MarketWatch ) -- Warren Buffett said Saturday that he 's bearish about the ability of all currencies to hold their value over time because of massive deficits being run up by governments in the wake of the global financial crisis .
The Berkshire Hathaway Inc. BRK.A , +1.30 % BRK.B , +1.18 % chairman also warned shareholders attending the company 's annual meeting that the Greek debt crisis will produce " high drama " and said it 's unclear how it ultimately will be resolved .
The financial crisis was stemmed by massive monetary and fiscal intervention in developed economies like the U.S. and the U.K .
That 's shifted a private - sector debt mountain on to governments , increasing concern about sovereign risks .
One concern is that governments will print lots of new money to pay debts , undermining the value of currencies and triggering a damaging bout of inflation .
" Events in the world over the last few years make me more bearish on all currencies in terms of holding their value over time , " Buffett said .
If countries could run deficits of 10 % of GDP and do it for a long time " the world would have been doing this for a long time already , " Buffett said .
" It ca n't be kept up . "
" How the world weans itself off huge deficit financing is going to be difficult to watch , " he added .
Still , Buffett noted that as long as the U.S. borrows in U.S. dollars , there 's " no possibility of default . "
" You do n't default when you can print your own currency , " he added .
Sovereign debt concerns have hit Greece hardest so far because the country has one of the biggest budget deficits and debt loads of any country in Europe 's single - currency zone .
The country was also found to have understated its deficit twice , shaking investor confidence .
Greek bond yields have soared and the country 's debt rating has been slashed to junk status .
This has made it almost impossible for the country to refinance some of its debt mountain at realistic interest rates .
Greece is reportedly promising 23 to 24 billion euros of austerity measures , such as a three - year pay freeze for public - sector workers .
In return , European leaders are preparing a bailout that could be as large as 120 billion euros over three years .
Earlier in the week , doubts about Germany 's commitment to helping Greece triggered a surge in sovereign bond yields that cut all but the most creditworthy countries out of the market .
Buffett said Saturday that Europe 's monetary union has created a " really interesting situation . "
Greece is a sovereign country in terms of its own budget , " but they can't print their own currency , " he noted .
" You may be seeing a test case play out there .
A country not using its own currency and yet it is sovereign in terms of making its own promises to its citizens , " Buffett explained .
" I do n't know how this movie ends , " he warned .
" I try not to go to movies like that . "
As if eastern Congo had not already suffered enough , seven years ago Nature dealt it a stunning blow .
The volcano whose blue - green bulk looms above the dusty , lakeside city of Goma , Mount Nyiragongo , erupted , sending a smoking river of lava several hundred yards wide through the center of town and sizzling into the waters of Lake Kivu .
More than 10,000 homes were engulfed .
Parts of the city , which is packed with displaced people , are still covered by a layer of purplish rock up to twelve feet thick .
Far greater destruction has come from more than a decade of a bewilderingly complex civil war in which millions have died .
First , neighboring Uganda and Rwanda supported a rebel force under Laurent Kabila that overthrew longtime dictator Mobutu Sese Seko in 1997 .
Soon after , Kabila fell out with his backers , and later Uganda and Rwanda fell out with each other .
Before long , they and five other nearby nations had troops on Congo ’s soil , in alliance either with the shaky national government in Kinshasa or with a mushrooming number of rival ethnic warlords , particularly here in the mineral - rich east .
Those foreign soldiers are almost all gone now , but some fighting between the government and remaining rebel groups continues .
For two weeks in June , I had the chance to observe the war ’s effects , with the best of possible traveling companions : Anneke Van Woudenberg , senior researcher for Human Rights Watch , whose reports have been an authoritative source of information on the country for years .
No one has been harder hit than Congo ’s women , for almost all the warring factions have used rape as a calculated method of sowing terror .
An hour and a half southwest of Goma on bone - jolting roads stand several low buildings of planks and adobe ; small bleating goats wander about and a cooking fire burns on one dirt floor .
There is no electricity .
A sign reads Maison d’Écoute ( Listening House ) .
The office of the forty - two - year - old director , whom I will call Rebecca Kamate , extends from the side of one of the buildings ; its other three walls are of thin green tarpaulin with a UNICEF emblem , through which daylight filters .
The floor is gravel .
Kamate pulls out a hand - written ledger to show to Anneke , her colleague Ida Sawyer , and me .
Ruled columns spread across the page : date , name , age of the victim , and details — almost all are gang rapes , by three to five armed men .
Since the center started , it has registered 5,973 cases of rape .
The ages of the victims just since January range from two to sixty - five .
On the ledger ’s most recent page , the perpetrators listed include three different armed rebel groups — plus the Congolese national army .
“ What pushed me into this work , ” says Kamate , speaking softly in …
A little over a month ago we released the Linux port of Osmos , promising statistics on our sales and downloads .
We wanted to find out – from a financial perspective , for our studio – “ is it worth porting games to Linux ? ”
The short , simple answer … is “ yes . ”
Did we get rich off it ?
No .
But the time we invested was repaid , with room for margin of error , and possibly with a little extra at the end .
Allow me to break it down :
Costs
It took Dave six weeks to do the port , including time spent testing across multiple flavours of Linux , and running the beta from start to end .
Personally , I ’m really impressed with what a solid job he did , and how quickly he did it .
I doubt an experienced Linux programmer could have done it much faster , especially since Dave was already intimately familiar with the codebase .
In fact , it ’s hard to imagine porting any game to Linux much more quickly .
( Excluding games built in Flash and engines that already support it of course . )
The code was engineered to be cross-platform from the start , built on libraries like OpenGL , OpenAL , libogg / libvorbis , freetype , etc .
In addition , Aaron had already done a great job on the Mac port , ironing out any remaining gcc / abstraction details .
All this to say that Osmos was primed and ready for Linux - porting , and all work done on that front was specific to Linux .
We spent an additional week or two on miscellaneous tasks , including some additions to our e-commerce / delivery system , support , community , PR time , etc .
So … let ’s call it an even 2 man - months across the board for our studio .
A big question is , what ’s a man - month worth ?
All I can say is , if your answer is the industry consulting standard of $ 10 k / month — you ’ve way overbid , and put the Linux port of Osmos into the financial - loss category .
However , as independent developers with a passion for what we do , our goals and desires are considerably lower than that ( i.e. less than half ) .
Revenue
Unfortunately , this is n’t so simple for us to measure .
We ’re selling Osmos under a pay - once - for - all - platforms philosophy — for $ 10 you get the Windows , Mac and Linux versions .
So the numbers are fuzzy .
What we can determine though , is how many times each person downloaded each version .
We can also look at our sales graph over time , where there is a clear and obvious spike associated with the release on each platform .
Sales per day .
( Pardon the ugly graph .
Also note that the regions are very roughly drawn , and do not reflect exactly how numbers were estimated . )
On first glance , one very cool stat emerges : our best sales day ever ( by 29 % ) was right after the Linux release , similar to what 2dboy experienced with World of Goo .
That said , the spike is also somewhat narrower than what it was for the Windows or Mac releases .
In any case , if we measure the area above the “ background noise ” for the Linux release ( based on the previous month ’s sales ) , this gives us a conservative lower bound on sales .
I say lower bound for several reasons .
1 ) As many Linux folk have pointed out , some purchased Osmos prior to the Linux release in support of our studio and on the promise that we would deliver the port .
2 ) There may still be some Linux mini-spikes to come , and future “ background noise ” will of course include Linux customers .
That said , based solely on these numbers , Linux accounts for roughly 15 % of our sales to date .
We can also determine an upper bound based on client downloads .
Here we see that 21 % of all our customers have at least clicked on the Linux download link .
You may notice that the percentages add up to more than 100 ; this is because customers can download on multiple platforms .
In any case , it ’s safe to call this an optimistic upper bound , as I know for a fact that some customers click on every download link just to test it out .
Also , it ’s impossible to know if some of those people would have made the purchase based solely on the Linux version .
So as a bottom line , Linux accounts for between 15 % and 21 % of our sales , with the “ real ” number being somewhere in between .
Profit
When we say “ yes , it was worth porting Osmos to Linux ” , we ’re basing it on the lower bound .
If the reality is closer to the upper bound : that ’s “ gravy ” .
The tail : more gravy .
( Though it does cost us time and money to support and maintain the site ) .
It ’s also important to note that this analysis applies only to sales from the Hemisphere Games website .
The majority of Osmos sales come from portals — in particular , Steam .
( Steam ’s recent addition of Mac support has had a huge effect on our Mac numbers . )
If we were to include portals in this analysis , the percentages would look very different .
So in the bigger picture , the lack of a strong Linux portal makes it a much less “ competitive ” OS for commercial development .
Of course , if Steam or another successful digital distribution portal decides to support Linux , that ’d be major !
Like … extra gravy .
With stuffing .
Mmmmm … stuffing …
A few more stats …
As any Linux user or developer knows , there ’s more than one way to skin a distribution on Linux .
Dave created four different packages : .deb , .tar.gz , a 32 - bit .rpm , and a 64 - bit .rpm .
Here are download stats by distro .
So .deb is more in demand than all other packages combined , while the 32 - and 64 - bit flavours of .rpm are rather low .
A question I have for the Linux community is : could we have skipped the .rpm packages ?
That is – to be completely materialistic about it – how many sales would we have lost as a result ?
( Just curious … )
Another point of interest for us was referring web traffic , and we were surprised to see where much of it came from .
Here are the sites that generated the most traffic for the Linux port :
linux.org.ru linuxgames.com habrahabr.ru hup.hu planet.ubuntuusers.de linuxtoday.com happypenguin.org root.cz linuxlock.blogspot.com planet.ubuntu.com linuxfr.org linux - gamers.net linuxjuegos.com and a special mention goes out to Liam Dawe of gamingonlinux .
info , who helped spread the word to a number of those sites ! :)
While we expected / hoped to see traffic from sites like linuxgames and happypenguin , we were very surprised to see the amount of interest from Russia and Eastern Europe .
Apparently Linux gaming is alive and strong in that part of the world !
“ I am not a number — I ’m a free ( as in speech ) man ! ”
People are interested in numbers , and we ’ve provided them , but that ’s just one dimension of the story .
As independent developers , there are other more altruistic factors that are important to us .
Before I go on , I must admit that I ’m spoiled .
Dave did all the hard work on this port , and all I did was some website work : extending our digital delivery system , etc .
So I ’ve experienced nothing but the happy glow of the release , and from my perspective the Linux community has been awesome and generous .
We ’ve received a heap of positive and encouraging feedback , which is always nice to hear .
Support emails for Linux are night - and - day - different from Windows or Mac — they include the log , version numbers , stack info , troubleshooting schemes already attempted , etc .
Sometimes they even include the solution to the problem — just letting us know .
And Linux users are vocal — there have been some amazing people in the community that have helped spread the word .
We simply could not have done this ourselves ; we would n’t have known half the places to approach , and even if we had we would have come across as fish - out - of - water .
So once again , thank you .
That ’s it for now on sales .
We ’ll probably follow up with some additional stats on the Linux tail in a month or two ; but in the meantime , if you have any questions or comments , fire away !
Dublin , Ireland ‘s Primordial are nothing if they ’re not hard to classify .
The band , formed in 1987 , could have been called black metal in their earliest work , but have long since transcended such easy genre - tagging .
Because the lyrics of frontman Alan Averill come from a specifically Irish perspective and Ciáran MacUiliam ( he and bassist Pól “ Paul ” MacAmlaigh are the remaining founding members of the band ) has never been shy about incorporating Celtic influences , Primordial saw a major profile upgrade as part of the folk metal explosion in 2006 - 2008 .
In 2009 , they toured the US for the first time as part of PaganFest .
Like many Americans , my first exposure to the band was 2005 ’s The Gathering Wilderness , which was their fifth album overall but first for Metal Blade Records , who also released To the Nameless Dead in 2007 .
By my judgment ,
To the Nameless Dead was the best album that came out that year , and though it would be two more years before I was able to catch the band live , I was still thrilled to do so .
Likewise , now that Primordial have issued their first live DVD , All Empires Fall , I was equally excited to interview Alan Averill .
Averill is known for his opinions on a range of topics both music - related and not almost as much as his brash stage persona , and though All Empires Fall was the impetus for the conversation , there was more I wanted to get a sense of his feelings on social issues in his home country , where the Catholic church had at the time of our discussion just been in the news following more reports of sexual abuse by priests , and , by Averill ‘s account , society has more or less collapsed .
To quote Marty DiBergi , “ I got that .
I got more .
A lot more . ”
In the following Q&A , Alan Averill talks about the state of Ireland , his feelings on nationalism , economic hardships and rails against venues in the US for taking a percentage of merch sales from bands ( which I ’d never heard of before ) , through it all showing every ounce of the passion he carries with him into shows and onto albums .
Please enjoy the interview after the jump .
I was going to start off by asking you why the Dublin show for the DVD , but that seems so obvious that I ’ll ask instead if there was any other show you would have used ?
For practical reasons , obviously Dublin makes the most sense .
Because we were working with my cousin ’s small production company , doing it somewhere else would have meant bringing them .
We just really did n’t have the budget for that .
Thankfully , in the last couple of years , we ’ve been able to sell out that venue in Dublin , which we would n’t have been able to do five years ago , so we could trust in the fact there would be enough people there .
It could have been lots of different gigs I could think of .
Places it could have been .
It could have been in Athens .
It could have been Helsinki .
It could have been in Munich – well , maybe not Munich .
It could have been in lots of places , thankfully .
I ’m quite thankful to say that nine out of 10 shows we do have a strong level of intensity that I would have no problem putting them on the DVD .
But Dublin just made the most practical sense .
It ’s where we ’re from , and it was just nice to be able to put “ Live in Dublin ” on a DVD , because you never see that on anything .
That was a small part of it , that bit of pride to be able to say that .
I was fortunate enough to see you guys when you came through New York on PaganFest , and I remember you had said something about bringing your culture to the crowd .
Do you consider Primordial a kind of cultural ambassadorship ?
Yeah , sure .
It ’s art .
It ’s not entertainment .
Seeing a show can be entertaining — and I do n’t really care if that sounds pretentious or not — but to me , I view Primordial as a continuation of the great Irish artistic tradition , whether it ’s Brendan Behan , W.B. Yeats or Thin Lizzy .
There ’s something of the other in it , and the whole point of what we ’re doing – of course , it can still be a metal show – is to try and engage people and move them with what you create , which , let ’s be honest , I could n’t do if I was singing about zombies or fast cars or unicorns or something like this .
There was never any question that it had to have this cultural resonance and historical significance .
Especially for playing in America , where you have so much Irish diaspora spread throughout the country and so many people with Irish roots , playing something like “ The Coffin Ships ” was quite poignant , because this is where people came .
Well , not to L.A. , but to New Jersey or New York or whatever .
It was quite pertinent .
At the same time though , a Primordial show is still very much a performance .
Sure .
It ’s still blood and thunder heavy metal .
That ’s what we love ( laughs ) .
It ’s still the white - knuckle grinding proper heavy metal show .
If you do n’t want to engage with all those things , “ Empire Falls ” is still a classic metal song that a guy with an Iron Maiden t- shirt who never heard the band can go , “ Ah fuck , that ’s not bad .
I can get into that . ”
It ’s not alienating in that respect , but for those people who do want to scratch the surface or do engage with the band on another level , it ’s all there as well .
It ’s not difficult to penetrate , and it ’s not difficult to be swept up in the live thing .
It ’s inclusive , as opposed to exclusive .
I try and sort of bring people into the songs , into the show – however pretentious that sounds – but that ’s the point .
That ’s what being on stage is , is n’t it ?
I suppose the traditional black metal ethic would be to try and be alienated from your fans or whatever you want to say .
To try and move people with what you ’re doing .
There ’ll always be people who ’d rather stand at the merch stall and are waiting for whatever band afterwards , and that ’s no problem , but also there , you ’re trying to challenge people ’s preconceptions and trying to challenge people with something , and when they go home after the show , they go , “ Fuck , we saw a proper metal show tonight .
Not the usual lame shit . ”
Do you think that ethic is part of what ’s allowed Primordial to transcend that black metal realm ?
I suppose traditionally most black metal bands did n’t have the touring and work ethic as the original death and thrash [ bands ] , because it was that little bit removed , and a lot of them were very poor live when they started .
I suppose in some respect we did come from black metal and the black metal ethic .
The concept of playing gigs to random people and drunkards in Anthrax shirts should have been potentially anathema to what the whole scene was , but there ’s also a certain amount of naivety and chest - beating bravado that went with the whole thing .
We very quickly realized that ’s not the way we wanted to do things with Primordial , even though the songs can be about very dark things , etc. , we wanted to try and engage people with them .
How do you develop a performance persona from that ?
It just developed over the years .
For me , it ’s a sort of Jekyll and Hyde thing .
It ’s the same person , of course , but I was always drawn to metal in the ‘ 80s like Venom , Manowar , Mercyful Fate , Bathory and Sabbat far more than the D.R.I.s of the world .
They just did n’t appeal to me .
I liked the larger - than - life theatricality of Celtic Frost , and that ’s what I always wanted to do with a band .
So there ’s no way I was going to shamble on stage in blue jeans and a Metallica shirt .
It just was n’t going to happen .
It also takes another form .
When you paint your face , you focus your energy for what you ’re gonna do , and it does take on a certain amount of ritualistic symbolism , and I subscribe to that kind of thing .
It mentally prepares you for what you ’re gonna do , and it makes it easier for me to immerse myself in the songs .
I would n’t call it playing a character , because it ’s still me , but it just happens to be what ’s on the inside .
In one of your blog entries on the Primordial website , you discuss nationalism , and I wanted to ask you if you think it ’s possible to be allied to a country but not necessarily a state .
Well , there ’s a very different distinction between a nation and a state .
The state is defined by a geographical boundary .
You can have a nation which has no state , which could be Kurds or Armenians .
A lot of things have happened in Ireland that have made me question my views on , at the very least , Irish nationalism .
We ’ve witnessed the almost instantaneous collapse of the economy and a lot of the social order that existed around it .
The church has been exposed as nothing but a pedophile ring .
The government who ’ve ruled the country more or less since the inception of the state have turned out to be charlatans , liars and thieves as well .
The property and banking sectors have collapsed .
Basically all the old institutions , from the health board to everything , have collapsed , and I think traditionally I would have been against the state but for the people .
Now I find myself being against the people as well .
The misdeeds of the state were perpetrated with the help of regular people , and I think the romantic idealism that existed in the late 19th Century / early 20th Century that surrounded the initial fight for , say , Irish freedom or whatever you want to call it , the establishment of that state never happened .
The systematic murdering of the intellectuals of the time who could have brought about perhaps a greater state never happened .
A lot of things have happened to change my views in the last while have altered my views of nationalism .
It ’s a recurring theme in Primordial .
The whole last album is connected to this theme .
It ’s not nationalistic , it ’s just viewing nationalism and how people relate to a piece of dirt they think is theirs .
I think it is possible to relate to a nation without recognizing the state .
It is possible to support a different view on political situations without being geographically or ethnically even part of it .
How do you see this change in ideology that you ’ve been undergoing playing into Primordial , which is such a lyrical vehicle for that kind of thinking ?
Traditionally , we always flew an Irish flag from the amps when we played and this , that and the other .
One of the songs on the newer album is questioning the ethics of that .
It ’s questioning what exactly is it that you ’re proud of this nation and state ?
It ’s about the unquestioned inheritance of the misdeeds and heroic deeds of your ancestry , when realistically you ’d probably not necessarily had anything to do with them .
It ’s questioning the nature of your flag , the nature of your nationalistic inheritance and that sort of thing in a different way to the last album .
I think it ’s important to come at things from different angles .
I never run out of things to write about , which is good ( laughs ) .
When are you going to be recording the new album ?
June .
June is what we ’re looking at .
We ’ll record in June , do a bit of mixing in the summer , then it ’ll be out end of September or October .
That ’s the plan .
Right now we ’ve got some songs that are 25 percent finished , some are 75 percent finished .
But it ’s getting there .
It ’s nearing that level of completion .
It ’s getting to that moment when in a couple of months it ’s going to be recorded .
Do you have a title yet or anything like that ?
My working title is Sacrifice , Revolution and Redemption , because they ’re the main themes of the album , ( laughs ) but it wo n’t be called that .
But they ’re the themes I ’m working on that .
“ Redemption ” is a good word for how the lyrics and the ideas are shaping up .
There ’s a lot of lyrics dealing with religion and dealing with perceived spirituality and that kind of stuff .
I know you mentioned the Catholic church before , and I ’m on the East Coast of the US and we had a similar kind of explosion of exposure of abuse a few years ago .
It ’s awful to read that in the news .
We have two huge reports , the Ryan and the Murphy Reports , that came in the last couple years , that basically expose the Catholic church in Ireland for a pedophile ring .
Nothing short of that .
And most of the problems throughout the rest of the developed world to do with Catholic pedophilia are Irish priests sent on missions , whether that ’s in Africa or America .
I think you ’ll find lots of Irish surnames with those priests that are arrested in Canada and America .
So we have to question why Ireland .
Why not Polish priests ?
Why not Italian priests ?
A certain amount of it is the intellectually retarded , backward nature of Ireland .
A lot of people are n’t happy with my views on these kinds of things because they do n’t like to hear you knocking your own country , but it ’s true .
Ireland never really had the industrial revolution like the rest of Europe , and it was essentially an intellectual backwater , which since the inception of the state , has allowed its brightest and cleverest to emigrate because it had absolutely nothing for them .
The people who could have potentially changed the makeup of Ireland were gone , leaving the country to the grubby hands of Fianna Fail , the ruling party , at the behest of the Catholic church .
And like I said before , I used to be for the people and against all these things , but now you realize that in small - town Ireland , while this was happening , everyone knew .
The baker .
The butcher .
The doctor .
The local this , the local that .
Everyone knew what was happening .
Now I find myself in the position that I ’m against everything ( laughs ) .
We ’re witnessing the absolute deconstruction of Irish society , which , standing on the outside of it , is very interesting , but it ’s also a little bit distressing for a lot of people .
It ’s a very strange to be a Irish person living in Ireland .
We ’re halfway down the spiral .
We have n’t reached the bottom yet .
There ’s more coming .
And it is some amount of it that will inspire the next Primordial album , but I do n’t want the usual Christian - baiting lyrics that are archetypal in heavy metal , that ’s not my style , so I ’m going to have to come at it from some different angle .
But everybody was in on it .
Whether it was the church , who took in kids promising them an education , a better life , then basically farmed them out to farmers to work as slave labor and often to death .
Ireland is like a failed African state , or the Ukraine in the 1920s .
Under Lenin , there ’s echoes of this stuff , collectivization .
There ’s a dark underbelly of Irish society that ’s been exposed to people now , and it ’s strange times .
Where do you see it going ?
It ’s only gonna get worse .
The country ’s fucked .
The people are depressed .
Sadly not aggressive enough and violent to go out in the streets and tear the place apart , which they have been doing in Athens , which I ’d really like to see .
Look , if the Simon Wiesenthal Center can pursue 80 - year - old Nazis like Demjanjuk and put them in prison and our government is debating whether priests should even resign for harboring pedophiles , it says a lot about Irish society .
Half these people should be strung up and should be in prison , and I think the general public are just so disillusioned with everything that they ’ve just basically been lied to by every state and institution .
Now that the recession has knocked us down to 27th most productive economy in the EU , everyone has to emigrate again .
So yeah , cheery stuff ( laughs ) .
Should make for a good album , if nothing else .
Yeah , well , you know , I ’m a bit outside of it all , all the time .
My upbringing is slightly different .
My background is different .
My attitudes are different , and so it affects me in a different way .
Having some distance now from To the Nameless Dead , what ’s your take on what that album accomplished ?
Not only in the sense of exposing the band to a wider audience , but creatively .
I ’m still really proud of it .
I think it still sounds great .
It ’s a good album .
It ’s very rare that a band gets to album number six and still has the fire and energy they had when they were 16 , 17 , 18 , and to me it still sounds full of life , which is really important .
It ’s the best production and overall aesthetic that I wanted .
At least with the book version , it is .
I do n’t know if you got many of them [ in the States ] .
It ’s just another step along the path .
It does n’t rehash what we did before , it makes a few different statements , but it sort of dropped like a bit of a bombshell , especially on the press in Europe , who ’d heard us before but never really clicked into the band , and all of a sudden we were number one in all the soundtracks in the magazines and all this kind of stuff , and they ’re like , “ Where the fuck did this band come from ? ” and this is album number six .
We do n’t really think about it though .
We just write songs , and we know when they ’re good enough , and I think people who like the band trust us .
But I ’m still proud of it .
It was obviously a very big step up for us .
Is there anything you want to try different or build on for the new one ?
I want it to sound even more like it was recorded in 1981 or 1982 than before ( laughs ) .
We really want to push for a bit rougher – somewhere between Motörhead , Overkill , Killers by Iron Maiden and Heaven and Hell would be perfect if we could get that .
If we could get Martin Birch out of retirement .
That ’s what we want .
And just to make another album that has no compromises and sounds full of energy and life .
That ’s all we can really ask for , and after that , it ’s up to everyone else .
It ’s up to the label and the press and the fans and this , that and the other .
We can only do the first bit .
Are there any plans to come back to the US to tour ?
Since we toured the US the last time , we ’ve been offered three or four tours , but it comes back to the recession and the whole thing in Ireland .
It ’s made the liberties we can perhaps take with work a couple years ago almost negligible now .
They ’re just not there .
It ’s almost impossible to find the same space in time to do .
It ’s made if very difficult .
And do n’t forget , touring [ there ] is like a hiding to nothing , because the dollar is so weak against the Euro .
When people go home and they have kids …
Like on that last tour , Moonsorrow were playing for nothing .
They were playing for $ 400 a night .
You play to 1,200 people in Montreal , and someone hands you $ 400 , which is the price of , what , 32 tickets ?
But there you go .
I do n’t think people realize that when they see the band that it ’s such a relative sacrifice that you make , especially when venues are taking 30 percent of your t- shirt sales and stuff .
Wait .
You had venues take a cut of your merch ?
Every venue takes between 20 and 30 percent of your merch and there ’s nothing you can do .
They have someone to stand there with a clicker , clicking the t- shirts they sell .
Nothing you can do about it , it ’s just become part of what touring America is .
If you add import tax , printing costs , 20 - 30 percent gone and how strong the Euro is against the dollar , if we do n’t sell a t - shirt for more than $ 15 , we are basically giving them away .
Seeing as we had one for $ 12 on that tour , we might as well just give them away to people outside .
Or sell them out the back of a van or something .
They wo n’t let you do that .
There ’s always going to be some stupid law that you ca n’t have an open vendor or something in the car park .
Believe me .
People come and they balk at the $ 25 entry price , and I understand that too , but I think people are probably a bit blind to the brutal economics of the situation .
Moonsorrow .
There ’s a band that sells 20,000 records , playing for free .
For nothing .
And some of those guys have kids , they have jobs .
There ’s a third kid coming for Primordial in July .
How do you justify going to America to play for a month and bring home , what , $ 150 a week ?
“ Here you go . ”
So it ’s a hard thing to do .
We are going to manage to do it before the end of the year , but I think unless you ’re one of the bands headlining at the top and still able to bring 500 people in the States , or if you live in Eastern Europe and your tour America , it might be easier .
In Ireland , where the cost of living is so high , it ’s difficult .
But I ’m not complaining ( laughs ) .
I ’m just stating the fact .
After all , we ’re still a metal band and part of being fuckin’ metal is just fuckin’ putting your nose to the grindstone and doing what you have to do .
I love being on tour .
I ’m not gonna bitch and complain and moan about it .
We put in 100 percent every time we play .
But there ’s certain facts surrounding it .
That stuff is a concern , definitely .
Especially this percentage thing .
I remember having an argument with somebody in Montreal and I was asking the merch girl , “ Can we fiddle this ? ” and there was a guy standing behind her and he was like , “ Nah man , it ’s the law . ”
“ Well , what law ? ”
And he goes , “ It ’s the law . ” “ Well , it might be your law , but it ’s not the law of the state .
Do you realize where all these bands are from ?
Do you realize how much they ’re getting paid , how much money they get to make , and you want 30 percent of it for nothing ? ”
He just went , “ It ’s the law . ”
It ’s not the fucking law .
I do n’t think the Canadian government is forcing these people , “ You have to take 30 percent of these bands ’ merch . ”
And they ’re trying to bring it in in Europe .
There ’s no such thing as a band union .
What you would need would be Slayer to stand up for all the little bands to stop it happening to them , but they ’re never gonna do that , are they ?
Those guys are probably being paid $ 40,000 a night to play anyway , so they make their money .
You would need the Children of Bodoms of this world to go , “ No , we ’re not playing your venues unless you take away your 30 percent ” or whatever , but realistically , that ’s never gonna happen .
I ’m sorry .
That ’s my little thing .
If it keeps artists and bands from being able to afford to tour , it ’s a big deal .
It does .
We broke even on that tour and made a little bit on that tour , but not much .
We probably made the equivalent of minimum wage to bring home , which is still stretching the boundaries of being justifiable to your family and stuff like that .
At the same time , there ’s bands who come over , who , they ’re in the hole from the moment they start .
Look at Rotting Christ .
The cost of their visas to come over and play in the US , and they ’re getting no fee , and they ’re in the van and they ’re driving themselves and this and the other , and they do it .
They ’ll suck it up and do it .
They ’ll do a 40 - date tour of America , and then come back to Europe and then come back to South America .
And people complain , “ Oh , the ticket was $ 15 , ” and “ Why was the hoodie $ 30 ? ” Now you know .

HFTs baby .
HFTs .
They just provide liquidity .
Some more details from Dow Jones on the latest mini daily flash crash .
Shares of Citigroup Inc. ( C ) fell as much as 17 % Tuesday before trading was halted in the stock for five minutes as a result of the new circuit - breaker pilot program .
The trading halt was only the second time that a single - stock circuit breaker has been hit since a pilot program started earlier this month .
It was the first to be triggered for a slide .
The first trading halt from the program was prompted by a surge in shares of the Washington Post Co. ( WPO ) on June 16 that was later deemed erroneous .
The halt in Citi 's stock was triggered at 1:03 p.m. EDT , according to NYSE Euronext spokesman Raymond Pellecchia Jr. Pellecchia said it remains unclear whether the trade in Citi was legitimate or erroneous .
After the five - minute pause , trading in Citi resumed with the stock down about 5.5 % .
The halt came after a single trade was placed for 8,820 Citi shares at $ 3.3174 , a 12.7 % drop from the previous trade , where Citigroup shares were priced at $ 3.8 .
The $ 3.3174 price represented a 17 % drop from Monday 's closing price .
Pellecchia said the $ 3.3174 quote appeared on the Alternative Display Facility run by FINRA .
The ADF is a facility for posting quotes , and reporting and comparing trades .
FINRA was n't immediately able to confirm where the trade occurred and whether it was erroneous .
The sharp drop in Citigroup caught much more attention than Washington Post 's June 16 surge , because it is much more widely held .
Citigroup 's market capitalization stands at around $ 109 billion , far greater than Washington Post 's market cap of just over
$ 3 billion .
" Obviously once the trade hit the tape , it set off alarm bells all over the place , " said Craig Peckham , equity trading strategist at Jefferies & Co .
Still , he added , " the pause in the market gave people time to digest what happened and the market impact appears to be relatively neutral . "
Earlier this month , the exchanges launched the initial circuit breakers tied to individual stocks within the S&P 500 as a safeguard against the type of rapid plunges the market experienced on May 6 .
The market - wide circuit breakers establish a five - minute trading halt if a stock moves by 10 % or more in the preceding five minutes .
VIEWPOINT
By Peter Brabeck - Letmanthe
Chairman , Nestle
Global water requirements ... will be 40 % greater than what can currently be sustainably supplied
Monday is World Water Day , but I suspect relatively few will have noticed .
While the world is rightly moving to address the challenges presented by climate change and depleting supplies of fossil fuels , the same awareness and consensus does not exist when it comes to addressing our usage of water .
Yet the harsh fact is that we will probably run out of water long before we run out of fuel .
We need to act fast , now .
Most people equate water consumption with what they use in their homes and places of work , but the challenge facing the globe goes much , much further than that .
The 2030 Water Resources Group , a collaboration between the private and social sectors to discover solutions to combat water scarcity , estimates that global water requirements will grow by over 50 % over the next 20 years .
Such levels of usage will be 40 % greater than what can currently be sustainably supplied .
Of course this global figure is an aggregation : at a more local level the situation is far worse .
For example , by 2030 one third of the global population , mainly concentrated in developing countries , will have only half the amount of naturally renewed water available they need .
More than tap Efficiency in water usage is not improving fast enough
What most consumers might not be aware of is that agriculture accounts for 70 % of global water usage today , and how the need to feed the growing population of the world will put an even greater strain on already scarce water resources .
And in recent years food and water supplies have also been significantly affected by the use of agricultural land and resources on the production of biofuels .
The 2030 Water Resources Group also predicts that industrial use of water will almost double by 2030 .
It currently accounts for 16 % of total usage - more than half of it for energy production - and this will grow to a projected 22 % by 2030 with China alone accounting for 40 % of the additional demand .
The challenge facing governments , businesses and - arguably - all of us , is how to close the gap in supply in a way that is both environmentally sustainable and economically viable .
At the moment we are coping by ' borrowing ' water supplies from non-replenishable aquifers or from water reserved for environmental needs , an approach which is clearly not a long - term solution .
Crop per drop Efficiency lies at the heart of debate , just as with climate change .
Yet while great strides have been made around carbon , the track record of water efficiency from both agriculture and industry does not inspire confidence : between 1990 and 2004 the annual rate of efficiency improvement in both sectors was approximately only 1 % .
Agricultural productivity has the potential therefore to play a fundamental role and increasing the " crop per drop " is vital , particularly in the developing world .
There are measures such as no-till farming , improved drainage and utilisation of the best seeds that may even have a positive return for farmers .
The water cost curve of the 2030 Water Resources Group shown in this document provides the tools for comprehensive , cost effective strategies .
Microfinance Within an overall strategy , the buyers of the farmers ' produce can also play their part by offering their suppliers training , technical assistance and even microfinance to help them improve water efficiency .
This is an approach we have taken at Nestle where , for example , we provide more than $ 30 m worth of micro-credit loans yearly to more than 600,000 farmers worldwide .
Water shortages are more pressing than climate change Just as microfinance can help farmers , policymakers , financiers and the private sector can do more to ensure that those willing to improve their water footprint at the macro level are given the opportunity - and capital - to do so .
Efficiency must also be a focus for industry and those responsible for planning and managing economic development .
Companies and governments are often quick to trumpet their energy efficiency achievements , but too few have taken the same approach with water .
The sooner governments , industry and consumers start to see the links between energy , food and water security , and how policies in one area affect another , the more likely it is that water scarcity will get the profile it deserves and that we start acting decisively to assure the sustainability of humankind 's most precious resource , water .

If you watch Fringe , you might have caught sight , in the last episode , of some alternate - universe versions of some iconic DC comics covers .
If you missed it , or do n't watch Fringe , worry not ... DC put them up on the DCU blog .
First - Red Lantern / Red Arrow is a reference to Green Lantern # 76 : Not much difference , although Reis modernized the costumes .
But both the original being referenced and the fact that it 's NOT that cover are pretty obvious , which , given it 's use as a quick visual reference is essential .
And anyone else think it 's a pity that Roy 's going back to Arsenal , since Red Lantern Red Arrow would be a great title to use in current continuity ?
>_>
Batman 75 is an interesting one .
Obviously it's the Death of Batman , and based on Superman 75 .
But it 's not based on the cover , itself :
No , it 's based on the armband that came with it , and the bag the whole deal was packaged in .
Which can be seen here , and is far more iconic , I think .
Next comes Crisis on Infinite Earths # 7 , based on .
.. Crisis on Infinite Earths # 7 .
The alternate - universe version might have been better - or at least more time - consistent - with Kara in the same 80s - tastic costume she was wearing at the time in the real world .
( Although , I do find it interesting that it's a mixture of her current one , and that one . )
The next two , the real covers are pinched from comics.org , thus the size .
Sorry .
Next up is Justice League # 1 .
Based on ... JL # 1.Jonah
Hex is an interesting replacement for Guy .
Like the Crisis cover , some of the more modern aspects - particularly the colouring - is a little jarring , and I kind of wish they 'd mixed up the membership , or costuming a bit more - have Dinah in her original costume , or her modern one ... have Mary Marvel instead of Billy ... that sort of thing .
Not too much to make it not recognizable at a glance , but enough to make it look a little more different at a quick look .
And The Man of Steel Returns , based , of course , on The Dark Knight Returns .
And this is done like I wish the JL cover had - it 's a MAJOR change , easily noticeable at a glance ( keeping the colour in his cape and S - shield help ) , but it also retains the elements that make the iconic reference obvious .

A recent article from Lothar presented a bad experience with fuses .
I would like to say that high voltage fuse remain a good solution , provided that they are used in a proper way .
Fuse - switch protection for MV / LV transformer is the most common solution , mainly because it is a cheap solution , compared to circuit breakers .
Of course high voltage fuse and circuit breaker do n’t have the same behaviour when faults occur .
The advantage of the fuse is that it operates very quickly on high magnitude faults , much faster than circuit breaker that always has to wait for the order of a relay .
When the fuse is used within a switch fuse combination , it has to comply with specific standards , for example IEC 62271-105 .
The selection of possible fuses to associate with a switch is generally done by the manufacturer of the switchgear .
That is why it is not recommended to try to use other types of fuses than those in the manufacturer list .
As many contributors wrote , in case of a fault , the first thing is to analyze what happened and clear the network from the problem .
After that , it is mandatory to replace all the fuses at the same time and not only the one that blew .
It also must be considered that fuses age over the years , because of heating in the switchgear , possible corrosion of connections , inrush currents , overloads …
So , it is wise to plan a replacement of the fuses before one is blowing without any real fault in the network or in the switchgear .
All this is work and time , but this is the way to ensure keeping the health of the installation , and as someone said , the cost is in any case less than the cost to replace a transformer !

Three Premier League players have taken the unprecedented step of writing to leading figures at English football 's three main governing bodies to urge them to make more funding available to support youth development schemes outside of the top four divisions .
Dave Kitson at Stoke City , Aston Villa 's Curtis Davies and the West Ham United midfielder Jack Collison have sent letters to the Premier League chief executive , Richard Scudamore , the Football League chairman , Greg Clarke , and Sir Trevor Brooking , the director of football development at the Football Association , asking them to review their approach to youth development programmes run by full - time non-league clubs , the majority of whom receive no financial help and are struggling to make ends meet .
A little more than two weeks ago Jez George , Cambridge United 's director of football , completed a 410 - mile walk to raise £ 60,000 to keep the club 's youth scheme going for another year .
This week Mansfield Town have asked parents if they would be willing to pay for their children to attend their centre of excellence to prevent it from folding while Wrexham are consider selling their 10th youngster to a Premier League club in the space of 12 months to cover the running costs of their set - up .
It paints a bleak picture of the realities of life in the Conference for former Football League clubs and funding is at the heart of the issue .
At present the 72 Football League clubs receive up to £ 180,000 a year from the Football League Trust towards youth development , with the FA and Premier League contributing £ 7.2 m and £ 5.4 m respectively .
The two clubs relegated into the Blue Square Premier have their grant cut in half and if they fail to win promotion within two years the financial tap is turned off completely .
At the same time they also lose the registration protection that prevents other clubs from poaching their best youngsters without paying compensation .
Kitson , Davies and Collison feel passionately about the subject because they have played for clubs affected by the current rules .
Kitson and Collison spent several years with Cambridge United , who were relegated to the then Conference in 2005 but continue to run a centre of excellence , while Davies started his career with Luton Town , whose funding from the Football League Trust will end next year if they fail to win promotion .
In their letters , which have been seen by the Guardian , the three players ask the FA , the Football League and the Premier League to " review the current system and examine what can be done to improve it " .
They also write that they " appreciate there has to be point when the funding the FA and Premier League provide for youth development is cut off , but it seems unfair that at present this is determined by the division the first - team play in , rather than the quality of the youth scheme " .
Kitson has gone as far as to say that he would like to meet with Scudamore , Clarke and Brooking to discuss the issue .
" I would be more than happy to represent this side of the table , " the striker told the Guardian .
" I have got no axe to grind or anything personal to gain .
I just think this is a real chance to do some good at a level of football which is often overlooked but has had tremendous success in bringing footballers through over a sustained period of time and to all levels of the footballing pyramid .
" We are not looking for an argument or any public recognition or ' look what I did ' .
We 're looking at it from a point of view that this is where we came from and that the funding problems may have escaped attention of the wider football world .
This is a chance to show that we keep English football in order at all levels .
No one tier is more important than any other .
Yes , one tier may produce more money than the others put together but football is not more important to the community of Manchester than it is to the community in Cambridge . "
A decade ago youth funding in the Conference would not have been an issue but an increase in the number of full - time clubs at that level has raised standards .
Although this has yet to be recognised in terms of securing funding , sources at the Football League , FA and Premier League insist that the subject is on the agenda as the three bodies move towards introducing an Independent Standards Organisation for the start of the 2011 - 12 season that would externally verify the quality of all youth set -ups .
The potential problem , however , would not be whether a number of Blue Square Premier clubs meet the criteria laid down but where the additional monies might come from .
George , who last month launched the Protect Football 's Future campaign together with five other former Football League clubs to raise awareness of their plight , has a couple of solutions .
" My argument is that either Football League clubs need to get a bit less so that some clubs in the Conference that qualify for the funding can get something or are we really saying that there is not half a million pounds spare in the Premier League coffers to spread between six to eight clubs ? "

At my first retreat with my heart teacher , Thich Nhat Hanh , I was struck by how many times
Thây talked about smiling and its importance to the practice he was teaching .
Of course , it was so wonderful to be in the presence of this living Bodhisattva , and his loving , compassionate monks , it was hard not to walk around grinning from ear to ear sometimes !
But ,
Thây , was actually talking about something more profound than just forcing a smile on the face or a kind of positive thinking .
And it took years of practice to see and begin to understand the depth of the teaching on smiling and how a smile can help release tension and anxiety .
If you read many of Thây ’s books , you ’ll find this smiling teaching come up again and again , and I think its way more than a “ frill ” or “ add - on ” to our “ serious ” meditative practice .
Taken in the deep way intended , mindful smiling — and mindful is the key — can be very transformative .
Here ’s a short teaching by Thây on how he views the smile as integral to practice :
I always say that a smile can be a practice , a kind of yoga practice .
Yoga of the mouth : you just smile even if you do n’t feel joy and you ’ll see after you smile that you ’ll feel differently .
Sometimes the mind takes the initiative and sometimes you have to allow the body to take the initiative .
Sometimes the spirit leads , and sometimes the body can lead .
This is why when you have joy , you naturally smile .
But sometimes you can allow the smile to go first .
You try to smile and suddenly you feel that you do n’t suffer that much any more .
So do n’t discriminate against the body .
The body also can be a leader , not only the spirit .
I propose that you try this when you wake up during the night .
It ’s totally dark .
Breath in and smile , and you ’ll see .
Smile to life .
You are alive , you smile .
This is not a diplomatic smile , because no one sees you smiling .
Yet the smile is a smile of enlightenment , of joy — the joy you feel of being alive .
So smiling is a practice , a yoga practice .
Do n’t say , “ I have no joy , why do I have to smile ? ”
Because when you have joy and you smile , that is not practice , that ’s very natural .
When you do n’t have joy and you smile , that is a real practice .
You know there are something like 300 muscles , small and big on your face .
Every time we get very angry or worried all these muscles are very tight .
When people look at you with that tension on your face , they do n’t see you like a flower .
People are afraid of you when all the muscles on your face are tense like that .
You look more like a bomb than a flower .
But if you know how to smile , in just one second , all these muscles are relaxed and your face looks like a flower again .
It ’s wonderful .
So we have to learn to smile and then we ’ll look presentable right away .
Look into the mirror and practice , and you ’ll see that the practice of the smile is very important .
It brings relaxation and you can let go .
You feel that you are released from the grip of the anger , of the despair .
Another wonderful teacher who emphasizes the importance of the smile is Bhante Vimalaramsi .
Bhante V , as he is affectionately known , teaches “ Tranquil Wisdom Insight Meditation , ” an approach to meditation that he shows to be much , much closer to the Buddha ’s original teaching on meditation in the Pali canon .
I consider him a kind of pioneer , or revolutionary , taking us back to our roots and helping us get closer to the heart of the Buddha ’s teachings .
As he says :
“ The act of calming the mind and relaxing the tightness in the head before coming back to the breath makes a huge difference between ‘ Concentration Meditation ’ and ‘ Tranquil Wisdom Insight Meditation . ’
A meditator who practices ‘ Concentration Meditation ’ over - focuses on the object of meditation and thus , they have the tendency to close or tighten the mind until there are no more distractions .
This practice leads to deep absorption of mind where hindrances are blocked .
On the other hand , ‘ Tranquil Wisdom Insight Meditation ’ has the tendency to open one ’s mind and to allow the mind to become calm naturally .
One does not suppress or force their mind to stay focused on the object of meditation .
Instead , the mind is always aware of what it is doing in the present moment .
Whenever any distraction arises , one lets go , opens , expands and relaxes the tightness in the head before coming back to the breath and calming the mind . ”
In teaching Tranquil Wisdom Insight Meditation , the smile is an important step of release in the process of maintaining open , calming mindfulness .
Here is a page from a wonderful 12 page short introduction to the process .
As you can see , in the cycle of establishing mindful , the smile is an essential step :
And here is what the “ smile ” step of the cycle involves :
You really will want the whole PDF , which you can download from the Dhammasukha website here :
Simple , Easy to Understand Mindfulness by Bhante Vimalaramsi
I always keep these wonderful , skillful diagrams close at hand when I ’m meditating .
And often , if I get bound up or find myself struggling with my meditation , I will stop and review the steps and then start up again .
The Dhammasukha Website , by the way , is an absolute treasure trove of skillful teachings , not only on Tranquil Wisdom Meditation , but on metta , or loving - kindness practice .
I highly recommend the skillful teachings of this truly great - hearted teacher , Bhante Vimalaramsi .
I think many will find in his teachings the “ heart ” that may have been missing from their meditation practice .
However hard our practice , or the challenges we face , may we all find our way back to the “ smile ” that is at the heart of the Buddha ’s teachings !

Apropos of our earlier post on precision guided indirect fire and the Army ’s decision to cut its buy of Excalibur precision 155 mm rounds , our own Christian Lowe checks in from his embed out near the Afghanistan - Pakistan border :
I spoke with an artillery forward observer with Angel Company , 3 - 187 , at FOB Sharana the other day who told me about the few times he ’s employed the Excalibur precision 155 round .
He said despite the infrequent use and the Army ’s apparent lack of enthusiasm for the weapon , it sure makes a heck of an impression on the Taliban – so much so that they ’ve derived a nickname for the round .
According to the artillery FO , radio traffic pulled from Taliban radio chatter indicates they call the Excalibur round “ The Finger of Death . ”
When the FO told me this , he extended his index finger and pointed in a long arc right into the palm of his hand – showing that when they fire one of these , it hits exactly where they aimed it and kills everyone there .
We ’re a little too far from the flagpole out here to slice and dice the internal debates in DC over this round .
But suffice it to say the bad guys around here would prefer that the “ Finger of Death ” not point at them .

I 'm working on a small project today .
Part of that project requires fetching syndication feeds and enqueueing further work if those feeds have new items .
That means detecting whether those feeds have new items , and it also means polling the sites with those feeds frequently .
These are simple , well - understood problems , with well - understood solutions .
I do n't want to poll sites more frequently than they allow , so I 'm happy to use LWP :: RobotUA to fetch the feeds , as it respects the robots .
txt protocol for well - behaved spiders .
I also want to skip processing if the feeds remain the same between fetches , so I want to use LWP :: UserAgent : : WithCache , which checks HTTP headers such as Last - Modified / If - Modified - Since and ETag / If - None - Match for modifications .
Unfortunately , both are subclasses of LWP :: UserAgent , and both expect to be at the same level of a complex inheritance hierarchy which forms all of LWP in Perl .
Here is the object lesson for people desigining software .
If you intend other people to reuse your software as components , such that you can't predict how other people will use it , remove as many unnecessarily hard - coded dependencies as possible .
If I were to redesign this part of LWP , I 'd make the caching behavior and the robots .
txt - respecting behavior into separate behaviors , perhaps runtime roles .
I 'd rewrite the LWP :: UserAgent constructor to use a plugin system , where instantiators could provide an optional ( and ordered ) list of behaviors with which to decorate the $ ua object .
Obviously the behavior I need is first to check the cached copy and then check the robots .
txt rules and then use normal HTTP access , but why hard - code these behaviors ?
There are plenty of mechanisms ( CLOS method modifiers , the Decorator pattern , dependency injection ) to work around this problem , but for now my solution is to subclass LWP :: UserAgent : : WithCache , override its constructor , and manually inherit from LWP :: RobotUA .
( For all of the faults of Java 's IO model , it handles this problem well .
Its defaults are awful , and it exposes too much complexity , but the Decorator pattern works effectively .
PerlIO works in a similar fashion with much better defaults .
This HTTP fetching problem is in the same category ; note how a similar model could handle proxying , compressed output , anonymizers , and filtering with ease . )
I was over at Man - At - Arms ' house and I found a Boyz II Men " On Bended Knee " CD near his stereo .
I said , " What 's this ? " and he said , " That 's not mine , it 's Teela 's , " and I said , " No , it is n't .
It has your name written on the cover , " so then he says , " Yeah , well , everyone had that , " and I said , " I do n't have it , " so he was all like " The ladies love it , " and I , being a witty He - Man , said " Girls do n't like Boyz II Men , fat old guy with mustaches and armor do ! "
Teela had been listening at the door and she ran away crying .
I guess it 's pretty embarrassing to have a dad who listens to lame - o music .
Buffalo goalie Ryan Miller 's stellar season has inspired The Jambrones ' hopeful tune that this might finally be the year for the Sabres .

Drop us a note .
I ’ve said this before , but it ’s a mixed bag for me that so many Christians treat gay people the way they do .
On one side , they ’re pushing gay people ( and many liberal allies ) away from their churches and faith .
And that ’s a plus .
On the down side , they hurt many gay people in the process .
And I wish that did n’t happen .
But times are changing and the likes of bigots like James Dobson and Rick Warren and Pat Robertson and all those anti-gay Christian leaders ( who secretly have gay sex ) are losing their power .
Gallup polled Americans on their “ perceived moral acceptability of gay / lesbian relations ” and the trend is in the right direction :
Acceptance of gay / lesbian relations are above 50 % for the first time .
Catholics , moderates , and independents showed the largest increases in support of gay relations :
Andrew Sullivan writes :
The religious grouping with the biggest increase in moral acceptance : Catholics , with a 16 point gain in tolerance since the hierarchy decided to demonize gays and banish them from the seminaries .
Keep it up , your Holiness .
And the issue of homosexuality isolates Republicans from Independents more than any other issue I ’ve seen : 61 percent of Independents and Democrats alike see gay relationships as morally acceptable ; only 35 percent of Republicans do .
And the moderates are changing twice as quickly as Republicans .
We ’re getting to a point where Republicans will find it increasingly difficult to demonize gay people in order to galvanize their base .
We ’re not there yet , but it ’s happening .
The more Christians push an anti-gay agenda , the faster intelligent younger Christians will move away from them ( and hopefully see the problem with religion in general ) .
It ’s pretty fun watching conservative Christians self - destruct because of their own homophobia .
Someone in Moscow is tearing a page out of the American playbook , and leaking secret documents to the press .
Nobody knows who handed over a 70 - page sweeping reappraisal of Russian foreign policy priorities , apparently generated by a committee inside Russia 's Foreign Ministry , to the Russian edition of Newsweek .
But everyone is talking about the confidential report , which calls on the Kremlin to abandon the prickly , go - it - alone approaches of the Vladimir Putin era and reach out for terms of closer cooperation with the developed world , particularly the US and the European Union .
" It sounds like someone with an American logic must have leaked this , because it 's absolutely not normal for it to happen in Russia , " says Yevgeny Bazhanov , vice rector of the official Diplomatic Academy , which trains Russian diplomats .
" Who knows what to make of it ? " he says .
" We do n't need a new foreign policy doctrine .
We already have one , and they do n't get changed every couple of years . "
Officials in the Foreign Ministry have confirmed the document 's authenticity to journalists , but no one will define its purpose or say what the Kremlin might have wanted it for .
Why was it made public ?
And no one seems to have the slightest idea who made it public , or why ?
Most analysts say the leak was probably deliberate , and a few suggest it may be a sign of a growing bureaucratic rift between the still powerful prime minister , Vladimir Putin , and the more liberal but significantly less popular President Dmitry Medvedev .
Mr. Medvedev 's ongoing problem is on full display in a public opinion poll released by the independent Levada Center in Moscow last week , which shows that halfway through his first term in office , just 22 percent of Russians think the president conducts his policies independently , while 66 percent believe he 's still under the thumb of Mr. Putin .
Experts suggest the leaked document is most likely an attempt to update Russia 's 2008 foreign policy doctrine to take account of Medvedev 's call to make economic and technological " modernization " the central theme of his presidency .
" It 's a review of Russia 's standing in the world as a result of the [ global economic ] crisis , " says Dmitry Trenin , director of the Moscow Carnegie Center .
" It 's a recognition that some of the hubris of the Putin era has to be moderated , and a recognition that Russia can't modernize on its own . "
In a preamble to the document , Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov calls for building " modernizing alliances " with countries that can help Russia to overcome its traditional technological backwardness and economic isolation .
" The greatest importance will be attached to ... strengthening of relations of mutual dependence with leading world powers based on mutual penetration of economy and culture , " he wrote .
Mr. Lavrov praised US President Barack Obama as a " potentially transformative " leader whose reset of relations with Moscow have markedly improved the tone of dialogue and led to some solid achievements , including the signing of a new strategic arms reduction treaty last month .
But he also worried that Mr. Obama 's popularity at home is sagging , and that could embolden US conservatives to undo the reset .
" The military , intelligence , and foreign policy establishments of the USA [ are seeking to ] return to the confrontational policies of the last administration , " Lavrov wrote .
Joining WTO , improving flow of investment
Some implications of a more West - oriented approach discussed in the document include joining the World Trade Organization and negotiating a visa - free regime between Russia and the European Union , to enable the flow of investments , ideas , and skilled labor .
It also seems to suggest downgrading Moscow 's relationships with less developed countries , and takes a very rare official swipe at China .
" We need to proceed from the assumption that we need to hold China to acting in concert with Russia in international forums , where they need our help more than we need theirs , " the document says , according to the Newsweek transcript .
" It 's pretty unusual to officially voice these kinds of sentiments about China , " says Mr. Trenin .
" But , in general , it makes sense to prioritize our relations with developed countries , because that 's where investments and innovations are going to come from . "
In another controversial passage , the document advocates a more aggressive economic strategy for dealing with crisis - hit countries of the post - Soviet region .
The idea would be to take advantage of their economic distress and " sharp fall of investment attractiveness " in their national assets to snap up industries in the Baltic states , oil and gas infrastructure in Ukraine and Belarus , and to merge Ukraine 's aviation industry with Russia's .
" What looks benign to Germans or Americans may not seem so to people in the Baltics or Ukraine , where they may fear being bought out by Russian capital , " says Trenin .
" But that 's capitalism .
It 's not about military takeover anymore , but about promoting Russia Inc. , " he says .
" In a way , it signifies that Russia is joining the club . "

Magnetic
Resonance is one of the ways to examine people through radioactive technology .
You can see internally from organs , bones and other things ; and also , unlike other radioactive technology tests , this is the only one who can emit 3D images .
So here we leave you some things to do before an MRI exam :
If You Have Any Condition Or Illness
In case of having any particular condition or disease , it is necessary you first communicate it to the doctor to know if you can or not take the exam .
Some of the essential things you need to notify first are if you ’re pregnant or have a pacemaker .
As well as if you are claustrophobic , have tattoos , some infusion device implanted in your body , artificial valve in heart , metal implants and prosthesis , kidney problems , bullet wounds , diabetes , allergies , and much more too .
Preparation
There is really no previous preparation to do before this exam , in addition to the typical ones that the doctor has warned you .
Use comfortable clothes , without jewels and take the list of the medicines that the doctor prescribed you .
Duration
Normally the exam lasts between 40 minutes and one hour .
During that time you should remain calm , without moving and comply with all medical indications .
Protection
The doctor will assign some earplugs because normally these types of machines emit very loud sounds .
You will have at hand an alarm button to advice the doctor any symptoms you ’re presenting .
In Case Of Children
Children are harder to control , especially in exams that last so long .
That ’s why in some hospitals they provide special glasses compatible with the MRI , so they can watch movies or videos .
In extreme cases , anesthesia will be applied .
This has been one of the best technological inventions of medicine because it can detect so many diseases and save so many lives in time .
In addition , it ’s a very strong and powerful magnetic field , which is why it ’s necessary to take serious precautions like these before using it .
Monogeneans are ectoparasites , meaning they live on the surface of their host ’s body ( as opposed to inside of it ) and feed mainly on mucus and other detritus .
To ensure they do not lose grip of their host , Monogeneans have very highly developed attachment appendages such as suction devices , pincers , hooks or spines .
Most species require only one host to complete their life cycle and they are mostly hermaphroditic .
Monogeneans are a type of Platyhelminthe ( flatworm ) and as such have only one “ opening ” where food is ingested and any waste is expelled .
OK , that ’s enough of a biology lesson .
If you are reading this then you probably know why you are here already .
To remove Mono from your shiny new desktop installation of Ubuntu 10.04 Lucid Lynx enter the following command ( after taking the usual precautions like backups of your data etc ) :
sudo apt - get purge libmono * libgdiplus cli-common libglitz - glx1 libglitz1
[ UPDATE : Many thanks to Directhex who pointed out my error regarding the need to remove libsqlite0 .
I ’ve removed it from the command above .
He also requested ( you can see in his comment below ) , that I mention that the mononono package is no longer particularly effective at preventing Mono from being installed .
Thanks for the prompt
Jo , I was going to but I just forgot . ]
This is almost the same one as used for the Karmic Koala release ( 9.10 ) , and for me the result of the above command was as follows :

After this operation , 49.8 MB disk space will be freed .
Do you want to continue [ Y / n ] ?
I chose to accept this and proceeded .
Of course YMMV so please check carefully before hitting that enter key .
The purge switch of this command removes any configuration files as well as the packages themselves .
Compared to Ubuntu 9.10 , in 10.04 there appears to be just one new Mono dependant application called gbrainy ( in the Games menu ) which is described thus : “ a platform to train memory , arithmetical and logical capabilities with many sorts of different exercises of different difficulty levels ” .
Unfortunately it appears as though the “ training ” objective of gbrainy might not be realised …
Over the last year or so , the BBC have carried out an experiment which examined “ brain trainer ” games .
Subsequent analysis of the data found that these brain trainers are an empty promise as reported here in The Guardian :
Practising brain - training games will improve your performance on brain - training games , but that effect will not transfer to other aspects of brain function .
They will not make you brainier , so you may as well just pootle around on the internet .
It seems that not much grey matter will be lost by removing the gbrainy package then 😉
The other applications expunged by removing Mono from the default Desktop installation are the same as last year : F - Spot and Tomboy .
For a very similar alternative to Tomboy try Gnote , and as I like task - related management too I also recommend the excellent GTG [ Getting Things Gnome ] application .
To install these two simply type : sudo apt - get install gnote gtg .
The alternative for F - Spot I usually use is a combination of gthumb and Gimp , the latter of which has been removed from the default Lucid desktop install to make space for other things .
Both of these applications can be easily installed by a simple sudo apt - get install gthumb gimp command .
However there is now a new kid on the block which looks quite exciting called shotwell .
Shotwell will be the default camera / image app in the forthcoming Fedora 13 distribution replacing gthumb ( as it has no dependencies on Mono in the default desktop installation ) .
It is also , I was pleased to discover , available in the main Lucid repository so can be installed using either the command line : sudo apt - get install shotwell or you can use the very easy and graphically attractive Ubuntu Software Centre ( as you can for the other applications listed above also ) .
This is how Fedora describe Shotwell in the preliminary release notes :
Shotwell is an open source photo organizer designed for the GNOME desktop environment and has replaced Gthumb by default in Fedora 13 .
It supports the following features : import photos from any digital camera supported by gPhoto
automatically organize events containing photos taken at the same time
use tags to organize your photo collection
edit non-destructively when altering photos , without ruining originals or using disk space for each copy
publish photos to Facebook , Flickr or Picasa
one - click auto - enhancement
rotate , mirror , and crop photos
reduce red-eye and adjust the exposure , saturation , tint , and temperature of your photos
edit any photo , even if it ’s not imported to the Shotwell library
I have n’t used Shotwell yet but it sounds like a good one to try out .
There you have it and hopefully that will be it for another 6 months on this subject .

French Cars
For some strange reason , for most of us people , France and the French are seldom associated with great cars .
Perhaps it is our image of them producing the best bread that overshadows their forte in creating great cars .
Or maybe it could be our own ignorance .
Either way , the fact remains that some of the sexiest and most coveted cars come from France .
The best brands of French cars are not too hard to find as they are in fact , global names .
Renault – Founded by the Renault brothers this French automaker post its alliance with Nissan has become the world ’s no .
4 largest automaker .
Peugeot – A product of the Peugeot family business , this company was founded as early as in 1810 .
Currently , it is the second largest car maker in Europe .

Venturi – Born under the name of Manufacture de Voitures de Sport , when translated it simply means manufacturer of sports cars .
The original company is known for making mid-engined sports cars such as the Venturi Atlantique .
However , it filed for bankruptcy in 2000 and after being bought , it is now located in Monaco producing only extremely limited electric vehicles .
A countdown of the top 15 French cars seems harsh business as all the cars that fit the bill are top cars in their own .
Hence , the following list is not ranked according to any particular order .
1. Renault Alpine
This is a break - away from the usual everyday cars that Renault is famed for producing .
The Alpine is a sports car that succeeded the Feugo and in all areas .
It is a rear engine coupe that got noticed post its success on the race tracks during the early ‘ 70s .
This is undoubtedly the biggest seller of the Renault production house .
The Clio has received both commercial and critical success and has been around as Europe ’s top selling car for 3 generations .
3. Renault R5 Turbo
This is quite simply a fun car .
An evolution of the R5 , it has 158 horsepower and 1.4 litre turbo making it a mid-engine , rear - drive which is indeed a step up from its muse .
4. Renault Sport Spider
This was the company ’s come - back in the late 1990 ’s after being missing from the American markets for about 20 years .
This mid-engine car is a perfect blend of great driving experience without being drowned in such comforts .
5. Renault Avantime
Called a ‘ glorious failure ’ , this car scores points on creativity where it could not score on profitability .
6. Bugatti Veyron 16.4
This car should easily make the list of best cars in the world .
The Veyron is one of those cars whose looks tell you exactly what it is capable of which include superb style , technology , performance and exclusivity .
Fast , expensive and powerful are some of the adjectives one can use for the Veyron .
And unquestionably , the Veyron is a legend in its own right .
7. Bugatti EB 110
Produced between 1991 and 1995 , the EB 110 can be called the great predecessor of the Veyron .
This car has everything in the extreme being built with a mid-mounted , quad - turbo V - 12 with up to 592 horsepower ; a 0 - 60 reaching speed in as little as 3.2 seconds ; and , a top speed of up to 216 mph .
8. Venturi Fetish
Aptly named the fetish considering the sensations this car gives you when driving this car is just plain hot and priced at $ 427,000 , it better be !
The French counterpart of the American Tesla , it is way costlier and with its low profile it is doubtable how many have actually been sold .
9. Citroen C4 Coupe
Though the C4 Coupe is really built to raze the roads , the tech - heavy interiors and the optional hybrid drivetrain configurations push it up into the list of best French cars .
An additional fact , this is the car that was famously raced and crashed in the Acropolis Rally 2009 by Sebastian Loeb .
10 . Citroen 2CV
The Citroen 2 CV is one car that is so famous in France that it has its own cult following .
Perhaps the slowest car and easily one of the least best looking , the 2CV makes up for all this in its character .
Approximately having about 12 car parts which include the engine and the wheels yet it makes up for one fun driving experience .
11 . Citroen DS
A creepy looking car , it has been appropriately called as resembling a “ slithering amoeba ” .
It is precisely this reason that makes this car so cool and of course , good handling and innovation play their parts as well .
12 . Peugeot 205 GTI
The Peugeot hot hatch though not so well known can absolutely be considered as fun as the more famous VW hot hatch .
The original 205 GTI which was built in the 1980s came with a 1.6 litre engine that thrived on revving and had great balance despite a front drive layout .
13 . Peugeot RCZ
A hybrid between the Audi TT and a Peugeot , this car is probably one of the best looking ‘ Pugs ’ in the car market .
The RCZ is the first car to use letters in its name than numbers .
14 . Peugeot 406 Coupe
One of the three body styles in the 406 range , the coupe had a curvaceous profile and is easily the most beautiful and graceful of the lot .
15 . Citroen Saxo
The Saxo makes it to the list simply this funky , urban car has been a savior for most students on a budget .
And though it is more than a decade old , it still looks cool enough to be in this millennium .
While this was the top 15 , there are a few others that deserve to be mentioned such as :
Nicole " Snooki " Polizzi , the pint - sized [ " Jersey Shore " ] ( http://www.mtv.com/shows/jersey_shore/series.jhtml " " Jersey Shore " " ) cast member and inventor of the friggin ' poof , might not be the most endlessly fascinating person on MTV 's disturbingly addictive reality show .
( That would be Mike " The Situation " Sorrentino . )
She is , however , the only member of the " Jersey Shore " cast to interview Phoenix on camera , which means she 's the one who got the scoop on whether or not there are guidos in France .
It turns out there kind of are !
Yes , someone at MTV had the utterly brilliant idea to put Snooki and a microphone out on the Grammy Awards red carpet .
That someone should get a raise .
Watch the results below , via the Daily Swarm .
I have to say :
It 's pretty impressive how the members of Phoenix manage to remain suave even in the company of this particular person .
In related news , " Jersey Shore " will return for a second season !
I guess my Congressman got all my letters .
And Snooki also met Judas Priest .
The creators of the Jeebu$™ fable are celebrating yet another scam .. as usually they where fiddling around in the graveyard for marketing purposes .. they supernaturally dug up some old priests grave , who had been in the grave for 30 years .. and what did they “ find ” , the poisonous tongue of the priest was still intact BANG they ran to the church and told the flock of sheep ..
The tongue was intact , the tongue was intact ; Magic is real , it ’s a sign from the master of the universe ; Come and worship the Skeletor idol ; Join us or burn . 😉

About 200,000 devoted pilgrims will pass by the skeletal remains of St. Anthony of Padua this week .
The saint ’s bones are on display until Saturday in a glass case in the chapel of his tomb in the Basilica of Saint Anthony in Padua , Italy , in honour of the anniversary of the transfer of his remains to his final resting place in the Chapel of the Relics in February 1350 .
The anniversary is known as the “ feast of the tongue . ”
St . Anthony , the patron saint of Padua , is known for his gifts as a preacher .
When his coffin was moved 30 years after his death , his tongue was discovered intact – a sign of his oratorical gifts .
The tongue was then kept in a separate reliquary .
The saint ’s remains were last displayed in 1981 , according to Neil MacCarthy , director of communications for the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Toronto .

Mediaite ’s good friends at Media Matters for America have been all over Dowdygate and provide the first response from Washington Post fashion writer Robin Givhan , who denies any sexism in accusing Elena Kagan of not being ladylike when she sits in a chair and for wearing dowdy frocks .
In an email to Joe Strupp , Givhan says she has n’t been paying attention to the complaining on the Internet about her critique of Kagan ’s clothes and manner , but that she does n’t consider what she said sexist .
“ As for being sexist … I do n’t think writing about a woman ’s appearance in the public sphere is inherently sexist .
And yes , I ’ve written about both Alito and Roberts .
How quickly people forget , ” the Pulitzer Prize - winner told Strupp .
Givhan ’s denial of sexism is n’t likely to stop the chatter , which even made it to the Senate today when Sen.
Amy Klobuchar ( D - Minn. ) took to Senate floor to criticize the attacks on Kagan ’s looks .
It was a picture of Kagan ’s conversation with Klobuchar that sparked Givhan to say that while Klobuchar sat like a lady , Kagan did not .
“ I have to say that I never thought I would be discussing this in this chamber , ” Klobuchar said in rehashing Dowdygate for the Senate , noting her role in the drama .
“ I do n’t think such an article was ever written about Chief Justice Roberts , ” Klobuchar added , trying to imagine a similar Givhan expose on who was crossing their legs in a hypothetical conversation between Roberts and Sec. Orrin Hatch ( R - Utah ) .
The critique of Kagan ’s style has rubbed many the wrong way , especially Supreme Court watchers and D.C. insiders .
Slate ’s Dahlia Lithwick , who covers the Supreme Court and once clerked for a federal judge , said at Slate ’s XXFactor blog that “ such a column would never , ever be written about a man , and we all know it . ”
Lithwick does n’t blame Givhan for creating the double - standard in “ that allows women about a millimeter of sartorial space in which to operate in public life , and I suppose you ca n’t fault her for playing to it — that ’s her job .
But it does n’t make the column any less depressing to read , or Post readers any less depressed by having to read it . ”
At the Capital Comment blog of Washingtonian magazine , Supreme Court litigator Maureen Mahoney of Latham & Watkins asked “ [ w ] hy would fashion - savvy be a relevant criterion for assessing a judicial nominee ’s qualifications ? ”
She added that Kagan “ should be applauded , not ridiculed ” for dressing like so many other Washington professional women .
While it ’s true that Givhan has skewered the clothes of Washington men , many commenters have noted that she is especially harsh when discussing women .
Whether it is Harriet Miers or Hillary Clinton , Givhan ’s critics have noted she ’s especially harsh when dealing with women and the critiques are much sharper than the treatment she gives men .
Givhan makes her living –and reputation –analyzing the style and behavior of Washington ’s elite and so she is going to be critical .
But while the thin -models of Milan and Bryant Park may be used to being objectified for how they walk and what they are wearing , it is something different when it is “ real people ” whose styles are being analyzed , especially when those styles are n’t integral to the woman ’s professional identity .
Have a tip we should know ?

( CNN ) --
If dating is a numbers game , then single ladies should consider this : A Pew Research Center report this year noted a surge in women between the ages of 30 and 44 making more money than their husbands .
Women made more money than men in 22 percent of married couples surveyed in 2007 , compared with 4 percent in 1970 .
While men make more money overall and hold more management positions , women are making greater gains .
" The supply of men has changed , " said D'Vera Cohn , senior writer at the Pew Research Center 's Social and Demographic Trends project .
" The pool of college educated men is n't growing as rapidly as it is for women . "
There is also a gender shift in the realm of education .
Women represent nearly 60 percent of students holding advanced degrees in areas such as medicine , law , business and graduate programs , the U.S. Census reported in April .
Researchers have found educational attainment to be a higher priority among couples than ever .
Popular online dating sites Match.com and eHarmony report that romances happen occasionally between educated , professional women and men who are less educated or have a lower salary .
Leah MacIsaac - Ruff , 45 , works 11 - hour - plus - days as a technology vice president at a Wall Street firm .
She has a college degree .
So does her husband , Doug , 43 , who walks dogs for a living .
MacIsaac - Ruff may be the breadwinner , but she finds her husband 's career choice refreshing .
" If I were to marry a type - A personality and we sat on our computers side by side in the evenings , I think I 'd die , " she says .
" I think I 'd be in a cold relationship .
The last thing I want is to go home to an investment banker . "
Despite their job disparities , the couple share enjoyment of the opera and theater .
When they attend her upscale corporate events , she is n't embarrassed when people ask about her husband 's profession .
Instead , people are intrigued by his dog - walking job .
" It does n't bother me one bit that she makes more money , " said her husband one morning as he was gearing up to walk 15 dogs .
" I could n't be more proud of what she 's done in the business world . "
The recession has shaken some traditional gender expectations , said several marriage and family experts .
About 4.7 million jobs were lost among men during the recession , according to April figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics .
Two million women lost their jobs , the report said , leaving more women to become sole supporters of their families .
Particularly among the millennial generation , people are less likely to have gripes with a woman who earns more and has more education , said Nicole Johnson , a spokeswoman for the National Association of Professional Women .
Her organization represents 150,000 women , with a majority working in a white - collar profession .
" At one point , the stereotype was a man might feel inferior to a woman who is at a higher point in her career than he is , " Johnson said .
" I think that 's dissipated a bit , where there are n't these built - in expectations of who should be above . "
Educated , professional women exposed to men working lower - paying jobs growing up are more likely to date them , said Amadu Jacky Kaba , a sociology professor at Seton Hall University in New Jersey .
" When they see a hard - working garbage collector or different kinds of lower - level jobs , then they trust them , " Kaba said .
Robin Coates , 45 , of Mobile , Alabama , found starting a relationship with her boyfriend , Sam , a 39 - year - old who installs floors , to be tricky .
Coates works as a creative director and has a college degree .
She , too , makes more money than her boyfriend , who dropped out of school in the eighth grade .
" Many years ago he said , ' I 'm not the guy for you .
You need to be dating a guy with a suit and tie , ' " she said .
Coates said they have dated for eight years and plan to get married soon .
Dating a man who makes less money or has n't attained as high a level of education can be difficult , said Whitney Casey , a dating expert at Match.com , the online dating site for singles .
She said the differences can work if the couple has similar goals and values .
" There are benefits , too , " she said .
" It can open your world and make you become a better - rounded person . "

Just over 1,800 unstamped packets  the number a heavy heroin user might go through in a year , the show notes  will be arranged in rows on a wall in an effort to make the idea of addiction seem less abstract .
Bags typically sell for about $ 10 , Ms. Vadnai said , and may contain anywhere from 30 milligrams of heroin up to a tenth of a gram .
Cards bearing facts about the health hazards of injection drug use will also be distributed at the show .
In addition , Ms. Vadnai , Mr. Mateu - Gelabert and their collaborators decided to give some of the show ’s proceeds to the Lower East Side Harm Reduction Center , a counseling and needle - exchange organization near the gallery .
The collective members said such an organization has more of an impact than groups that simply seek to get drug users to quit .
Heroin users donated some of the packets in the exhibition .
Social Art Collective members found others near drug distribution spots and areas where addicts congregate .
The artists found packets in the rugged streets of Bushwick and in Mott Haven in the Bronx , and in the gentrifying streets of the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn and the Lower East Side .
They picked up packets near the stately brownstones that surround Gramercy Park , and inside Tompkins Square Park , where the trade flourished in the 1980s and into the 90s and still exists .
The stamps that identify the heroin inside draw on a wide range of references .
There are names like White Fang , Time Bomb and Monster Power , which is decorated with an image of the grim reaper with a scythe .
There are allusions to religion ( Deadly Sin and the Last Temptation ) , crime ( Notorious and Outlaw ) and publishing ( Life , in white capitals against a red background , and Daily News , along with the old camera logo of that tabloid ) .
There is also a packet stamped with the words “ Tango and Cash , ” the name attached to a fentanyl - laced brand of heroin that infamously caused 12 fatal overdoses in one weekend in 1991 .
Just as the White House released a brief note saying the US delegation has walked out on Ahmedinejad 's speech at the UN , so Robert Gates was quoted by Reuters saying that " Iran is taking steps to challenge U.S. naval power in the Middle East . "
The defense secretary added : " Iran is combining ballistic and cruise missiles , anti-ship missiles , mines , and swarming speedboats in order to challenge our naval power in that region . "
What about weapons of mass destruction ?
Oh wait ...

The last thing this administration needs is a middle - east war which would send a gallon of gas to $ 5 , the stock market tumbling , and the clotheless Ponzi economy exposed , as even without paying one 's mortgage , if the price of a refill doubles , there are only so many iPads one can buy .
Editor 's note : Read a statement from Larry King at his CNN blog .
Also read the Top 25 Moments from " Larry King Live . "
Los Angeles , California ( CNN ) -- Larry King , the iconic TV interviewer , will step aside from hosting of his prime time CNN show later this year , he said Tuesday .
King , 76 , made the announcement with a short posting to his Twitter account , citing his desire to spend more time with his wife and young children .
" I want to share some personal news with you .
25 years ago , I sat across this table from New York Governor Mario Cuomo for the first broadcast of Larry King Live .
Now , decades later , I talked to the guys here at CNN and I told them I would like to end Larry King Live , the nightly show , this fall and CNN has graciously accepted , giving me more time for my wife and I to get to the kids ' little league games , " King wrote .
" I 'm incredibly proud that we recently made the Guinness Book of World Records for having the longest running show with the same host in the same time slot .
With this chapter closing I 'm looking forward to the future and what my next chapter will bring , but for now it 's time to hang up my nightly suspenders . "
" He will end his run with Larry King Live on his own terms , sometime this fall , " said Jon Klein , president of CNNUS .
" Larry is a beloved member of the CNN family and will continue to contribute to our air with periodic specials . "
During his Tuesday night show , King told guest Bill Maher " there 's a freedom " that came with his decision .
" I want to expand , " King told the comedian .
" I want to do other things that I have n't been able to do . "
The idea to step aside came to him after he completed his week - long 25th anniversary celebration , he said .
" I'm thinking to myself , I 've done 50,000 interviews , " he said .
" I 'm never going to top this . "
King said he would exit the host 's chair " maximum November . "
But , he told Maher , " Then I 'll be doing specials .
You 'll see me in other places . "
Asked whom he wants to replace him , King cited " American Idol " host Ryan Seacrest .
" He 's curious , he 's interesting , he 's likable , " King said .
" If he has a great interest in politics , I would recommend him .
But I 'm sure there 's a ton of people who could do it .
Come on .
It 's Q and A . "
" It 's not easy , " Maher responded .
" That 's the trick . "
In a telephone call to the program , former first lady Nancy Reagan told King , " I could n't let you do this without my calling you .
You did n't call me and ask my permission . "
King said he had made no plans about his future , but added , " I 'm looking forward -- I feel open to so many things .
Life will be better . "
ABC News Anchor Diane Sawyer chimed in : " I just want to say , Larry , what a monument of vitality you have built for all of us and I cannot wait to see your specials because everybody in the world wants to talk to you and to see you do them in a concentrated way -- when you choose to do them it 's going to be a thrill . "
King 's decision followed months of media speculation about his future as his ratings declined .
King was hosting a nationally syndicated overnight radio talk show when CNN founder Ted Turner persuaded him in 1985 to try his interviewing skills on cable TV .
" All I had to do was everything I 'd been doing since I was a kid , " he wrote in his best - selling 2009 autobiography , " My Remarkable Journey . "
His gentle but persistent interview style drew big - name guests , and " Larry King Live " became a place for major personalities to break news .
Billionaire Ross Perot used the show to announce he was running for president in 1992 .
And the show was the setting for the historic NAFTA debate between then - Vice President Al Gore and Perot in 1993 , a debate that for more than a decade was the highest - rated program in cable history .
King , who was initially based in Washington , became a mandatory stop for politicians .
Over his career , he conducted sit - down interviews with every U.S. president since Richard Nixon .
His program was sometimes a place of real - time diplomacy .
In 1995 , he hosted a program on the Middle East Peace process with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat , King Hussein of Jordan and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin .
His suspenders , large glasses and vintage desk microphone are as recognizable as the countless celebrities lined up to have an intimate chat with King while the world listened in .
And there have been a lot of guests , including Marlon Brando , Nelson Mandela , Mikhail Gorbachev , Paul McCartney , Bob Hope , Frank Sinatra , L. Ron Hubbard , Madonna and Martin Luther King , Jr .
After extensive coverage over many months of O.J. Simpson 's trial for murder , Simpson himself called the program the night he was acquitted .
King says that Nelson Mandela was the most extraordinary person he has met .
In his autobiography , King confessed that he never plans a question , that he likes to be surprised by the answers .
He says he asks his interview subjects to explain things .
" All I do is ask questions , " he wrote .
" Short , simple questions . "
Born in Brooklyn , Larry Zeiger moved to Miami , Florida , in 1957 .
He began his radio career that year with a new name , Larry King .
His first television job was hosting a local interview show in Miami in 1960 .
While some critics have called King a throwback , he embraced the online social networking tool Twitter .
He had 1,648,920 Twitter followers as of Tuesday .
On Monday , King used Twitter to respond to a fan 's question about the highlights of his career :
" Winning 2 Peabody Awards & an Emmy .
Perot - Gore Debate a show highlight , " King tweeted .
In addition to earning the Emmy and two Peabody Awards , he was inducted into the National Association of Broadcasters Hall of Fame in 1992 .
King also has an extensive film resume , having played himself in 20 movies .
King has suffered a decline in ratings .
His show , which was once on top , sometimes has come in fourth among cable talk shows during the 9 p.m. hour .
King faced highly publicized personal problems this year .
He and his eighth wife , Shawn Southwick - King , filed for divorce in April , but reconciled weeks later .
King has repeatedly talked about the importance of spending time with his children , including his two boys from his marriage with Southwick - King .
" I 'd love to see Chance and Cannon talk about how their Dad took them to play when they were kids , " he wrote in his autobiography .
After suffering a heart attack in 1987 , King underwent quintuple bypass heart surgery .
A year later , he created the Larry King Cardiac Foundation , which he said was to help those " not so lucky " to have medical insurance .
In 2009 , the foundation paid for 287 life - saving surgeries .
And through it all , the interviews continued .
" Only God failed to show up for a Larry King interview , " said Tom Johnson , who was CNN 's chairman for more than a decade , ending in 2001 .
" Larry has been my close friend since I joined CNN in 1990 , " Johnson said .
" We never had a single disagreement in my 11 years as CEO , although he never thought much of my suggestions for more shows about North Korea . "
Is there anyone he would like to interview that he has n't so far ?
For years , he joked in his autobiography , he answered that question " God . "
" And my first question would be , ' Do you have a son ?
Because there 's a lot riding on the answer . ' "

Most of you hardcore vanilla Android fans may not know this but Flash support is n’t a new feature that was implemented into Froyo ( 2.2 ) .
Sense UI has enjoyed Flash since its inception with built in Flash support .
For the most part , Flash lite performed pretty well .
Engadget has put together a head to head challenge between the newly release Flash 10.1 for 2.2 Nexus One ’s and Flash lite that is included with the 2.1 Desire .
Who ’s going to be the winner ?
Since the specs of the two devices are similar , this is a pretty even fight .
HTC does have a slight advantage though , they have more experience with flash integration in their Sense devices .
But , Froyo throws all of that out of the window .
The Nexus One with Froyo has way better Flash performance than the Desire .
The video was really smooth and fluid on the nexus while the same video had a few hiccups on the Desire .
This is expected given the performance gains 2.2 presents to Android .
In my experience with Sense devices , it ’s better to let the video load completely before playback that will eliminate most of the lag .
So if you ’re looking for an Android handset and you the best Flash experience available at the moment , go with the nexus .
Young people from poorer backgrounds are still struggling to get into top universities , says the agency in charge of widening access to higher education .
The wealthiest 20 % of youngsters are seven times more likely than the most disadvantaged 40 % to get places at England 's most selective universities .
The Office for Fair Access ( Offa ) says there has been no significant change since the mid-1990s .
This " weak point " must improve , says Universities Minister David Willetts .
The report from Offa considers how to widen accss to the top universities .
Tuition fees
Sir Martin Harris , director of Offa , says that bright disadvantaged youngsters need to be identified and supported at an earlier age .
This should happen before the age of 14 when pupils are making their decisions about GCSE options , he says .
Image caption Oxford says it already spends £ 3 m in outreach projects
" Right at the heart of the matter is the need to ensure that those young people with the potential to succeed in a research - intensive university , but who do not currently choose to apply , are identified as early as possible , " says Sir Martin .
Offa was set up to protect access to university for poorer students when tuition fees were increased four years ago .
It is now submitting a report to the review of university funding chaired by Lord Browne , which could recommend a further increase in fees .
The report says that while more students from poorer families are getting into university , there remains much less progress in the most sought - after university courses .
Access from the 40 % least disadvantaged youngsters has been " almost flat since the mid-1990s " .
Underachievement
Talented youngsters from disadvantaged backgrounds are still failing to realise their potential , says the report .
Image caption The Russell Group of leading universities wants to raise tuition fees
It identifies a series of reasons causing this underachievement .
Poorer youngsters are more likely to underperform in exams than their better - off counterparts , which means they might miss out on the grades needed for the most competitive courses .
They are also at greater risk of making bad decisions over GCSE choices , which could limit their chances .
And even if they have the exam grades in the right subjects , poorer youngsters are less likely to apply to the top universities .
Sir Martin wants leading universities to make greater efforts to give advice and guidance to potential applicants .
He says there should also be more information about the financial support available , to reduce fears over student debt .
Independent schools
Facing such challenges over social exclusivity , the top universities have argued that they can only offer places to the best candidates who apply .

More than two - thirds of the new cabinet are Oxbridge graduates
Oxford University , responding to the Offa report , says it spends £ 3 m a year on outreach projects and a further £ 6 m on bursaries .
But it highlights how independent school pupils are so over - represented in the top grades - accounting for almost a third of pupils achieving three grade As at A - level .
Mike Nicholson , in charge of undergraduate admissions at Oxford , says that it is inequality of opportunity at school age that " is one of the major barriers to progression " .
" This is why support for students early on in their educational careers is vital : government , schools , universities and parents all have to work together to achieve social mobility , " he says .
A report from the Sutton Trust last month claimed that social mobility was lagging behind in England - and children 's achievement was more linked to their family background than in many other countries .
Earlier this week , the Russell Group of leading universities submitted proposals to Lord Browne 's review which called for a lifting of the current £ 3,225 limit on fees .
This could mean the most prestigious courses charging much more , as a market develops in university charges .
Students have complained that " mortgage - style debts " would mean young people choosing courses on price rather than their own ability .
There were also questions raised about the narrowness of the educational background of the new Conservative - Liberal Democrat cabinet - with two thirds having gone to Oxford or Cambridge .
Mr Willetts says : " The report recognises the importance of attracting a wider group of people applying to very selective universities and courses .
" Wider and more flexible progression routes from colleges and apprenticeships to universities will be an important part of this agenda .
This is one of the weak points of the English education system and we are committed to improving it . "

Four months later , the death toll remains unknown .
But most accounts place it between 12 and 19 , with up to 40 wounded .
The local morgue attendant , Georges Raymond , said that he initially registered 11 dead detainees , with several more arriving later after they died of bullet wounds at the adjacent hospital .
Prison officials would not allow The Times to enter the walled prison compound , which sits directly behind the police station in the heart of town .
But reporters interviewed six witnesses to the disturbance as well as five others who visited the prison either immediately after the shootings or the next day .
None saw inmates firing weapons or any evidence that inmates killed inmates .
Instead , witnesses said the police shot unarmed prisoners , some in the prison yard , others in their cells .
Afterward , the authorities failed to notify inmates ’ relatives of the deaths , buried bodies without conducting autopsies and burned the surviving prisoners ’ bloodstained clothing and shoes .
Myrtil Yonel , a human rights leader here , said , “ For us , we consider this to be a massacre . ”
Under a bare bulb in his office beside the prison , Olritch Beaubrun , the superintendent of the antiriot police unit , scoffed at this accusation .
He said that a detainee nicknamed Ti Mousson had slaughtered inmates who resisted his escape plan .
“ Ti Mousson put down the 12 detainees , ” Superintendent Beaubrun said .
“ We did not .
We never fired our guns . ”
This assertion is at odds with what The Times found after reviewing confidential Haitian and United Nations reports and conducting interviews with former detainees , guards , prison cooks , wardens , police officials , judicial officials and relatives of dead prisoners .
Among other things , United Nations police officers noted that day in an internal incident report that the Haitian police had used firearms .
The cooks , three women trapped inside during the riot , said that the detainees did no shooting .
No weapons were recovered .
Ti Mousson — whose real name is Luguens Cazeau — escaped .
And the authorities did not treat the prison as the crime scene of what they portrayed as a mass murder by Mr. Cazeau , who was awaiting trial on charges of stealing a satellite dish .
The Haitian government said that it was conducting three separate investigations into the episode .
But witnesses and others interviewed by The Times during two visits here last month said that they had never spoken to investigators .
The inmates ’ bodies had not been exhumed , and there was no indication that basic forensic evidence had ever been collected .
-- Flyers forward Ian Laperriere was all smiles Monday morning at the Flyers ' practice facility in Voorhees , N.J. The veteran forward , named the NHL 's toughest player by The Hockey News , underwent an MRI in the morning and was given the green light by doctors to resume skating with contact .
It 's the first step in Laperriere 's comeback , which it appears might happen sooner rather than later .
" When the doctors say it 's 100 percent and if it's this year and coach ( Peter ) Laviolette feels that he needs me in the lineup right now , we 'll see , " Laperriere said .
" The team 's playing great right now .
I do n't want to be in there , those guys are playing unbelievable .
But if I 'm 100 percent and the team needs me … that 's why I 'm doing what I 'm doing right now .
" Laperriere was diagnosed with a brain contusion April 23 , one night after he blocked a shot with his face during Game 5 of the Flyers ' first - round series against the New Jersey Devils
It was thought then that Laperriere would miss the remainder of the playoffs .
Instead , he 's back on the ice , now wearing a clear - plastic shield and a cage .
But at least he no longer sticks out like a sore thumb , like he did during Sunday 's practice when he wore a yellow jersey that signifies no physical contact .
On Monday , he wore his regular orange practice sweater , the same as everyone else .
" I wo n't be in the best shape as everyone else in here , but I 'll try to be in the best shape I can if my number is ever called , " Laperriere said .
Flyers General Manager Paul Holmgren told the media following Monday 's practice that Laperriere was cleared earlier in the day .
" Ian was cleared for contact but it 's a situation where he was n't able to do a whole lot , " he said .
" The first day he skated on his own was last Thursday and ( Monday ) he took part in practice with his teammates .
I think he 's possible at some point in this series .
" The Flyers lead the Montreal Canadiens , 1 - 0 , in the Eastern Conference Finals .
The series resumes Tuesday here at the Wachovia Center ( 7 p.m. ET , VERSUS , CBC , RDS ) .
When asked if the insertion of Laperriere would mess with the current positive karma circulating throughout the lineup , Holmgren paused .
" No … we 'll jump off that bridge when we get to it , " he said .
​ Ronnie Lee Smith wants to be sheriff of Gallatin County , Kentucky .
Which is not that unusual , until you realize that Smith is better known as pot comedian and social media personality Roland A. Duby .
“ All activist potheads should run for sheriff like I am , ” Smith said Friday .
“ I remember having my marijuana taken and thrown in the creek by a friendly policeman who shall remain nameless , ” Smith said .
“ I was n’t arrested and turned into a criminal for it . ”
​ According to Smith , the laws against marijuana violate the constitutions of the United States and of Kentucky “ on numerous levels . ”
“ These laws have no business being enforced , ” Smith said .
“ If I am elected sheriff of Gallatin County , I will protect the farmers ’ rights to grow as much marijuana as they want ! ”
According to Smith — a libertarian who pledges to stop all bank foreclosures in the county — if he is elected the Sheriff ’s Department will accept marijuana as payment of property taxes .
“ The value wil be set after I am elected , but the way I see it , we should have marijuana available to the general public , ” Smith said .
“ The Commonwealth of Kentucky already sells marijuana tax stamps .
And there is nothing stopping Gallatin County from issuing their own tax stamps ! ”
“ People will come from around the country to sample Gallatin County ’s finest marijuana tops , ” Smith said .
In an admission that may spell further disaster for coastal areas and marine life surrounding the oil spill that erupted after a rig sunk off the Gulf Coast , British Petroleum said Tuesday that containing the spill may take three months .
TimesOnline reports that BP “ launched a new front in its battle to contain the spill , as engineers began drilling a relief well designed to cut off the leaking oil permanently . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
“ The new well , which is in 5,000 feet of water , is planned to intercept the existing well at 13,000 feet Ã¢â‚¬â€ about two miles Ã¢â‚¬â€ below the seabed .
It will be used to inject cement to cap the one that is leaking . ”
“ Drilling began on Sunday at 3 pm local time , after days of delays caused by poor weather conditions .
However , BP confirmed that the operation would take Ã¢â‚ ¬Å “ some three monthsÃ¢â‚ ¬Â to complete . ”
Winds pushed a giant slick towards fragile wetlands on the United States coast Tuesday as efforts intensified to bottle up a ruptured oil well causing the growing environmental disaster .
Beleaguered energy giant BP said it had prepared the first of three giant domes to collect oil gushing into the Gulf of Mexico and channel it into a waiting tanker .
But a political tempest spread across the US , with California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger backing away from a contentious proposal to drill for oil off the state ’s southern coast .

At least 210,000 gallons of crude a day has been streaming from a well below the Deepwater Horizon rig that sank on April 22 , two days after a massive explosion that killed 11 workers .
A slick now covering the size of a small country has already touched Louisiana and is moving along the coast .
Shifting winds meant the oil could be pushed into a current that would take toward a wide area of the Florida coast , forecasters said .

“ The magnitude of this spill is daunting , ” said Michael Sole , Florida ’s secretary of the Department of Environmental Protection .
Weekend storms grounded aerial sorties of dispersants and prevented skimming vessels from mopping up the growing 130 - mile ( 200 kilometer ) by 70 - mile ( 110 kilometer ) slick .
ADVERTISEMENT
But an army of more than 2,500 responders and some 200 boats took advantage of better conditions Monday to lay out miles of protective booms , relaunch skimming vessels and train local fishermen for the clean - up effort .
“ If we can get the seas to lay down for us we can make a dent , ” said Petty Officer Curtis Ainsley , leader of a coast guard team surveying the slick and installing mobile protective boom stations on boats .
“ As soon as we can get the vessels here and the booms laid down we can get started skimming . ”

Florida Governor Charlie Crist added 13 more counties to the six already covered by a state of emergency .
The region boasts some 40 percent of US wetlands — prime spawning waters for fish , shrimp and crabs and a major stop for migratory birds — and cleaning up a maze of channels accessible only by boat would be all but impossible .
BP Chief Operating Officer Doug Suttles said the company had fashioned the first of three domes designed to be placed “ over the leak sources and allow us to collect the oil , funnel it up through pipework to a drill ship called Enterprise on the surface . ”
He added that the company expects to load the fabricated containment chamber on Tuesday “ and we hope to have the system up and operating within a week . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
Efforts to contain the leak are costing more than six million dollars a day , the company said in a statement .
BP has been operating a fleet of robotic submarines in the murky depths for more than a week to try to activate a 450 - tonne valve system that should have shut off the oil after the initial accident .
One has also been pumping dispersant directly into three leaks , but its impact on the amount of oil reaching the surface .
was not immediately known .
BP began operations on a relief well Sunday , penetrating the sea floor as it began drilling down to approximately 18,000 feet so that special fluids and then cement can be injected to cap the oil .
ADVERTISEMENT
With this process expected to take up to three months , attention is focusing on giant containment structures to be deployed to cover the leaking pipe a mile down on the seabed .
Suttles admitted there would be “ technical challenges ” in trying to sink a 65 - tonne structure so deep , but added that physics was to some extent in BP ’s favor despite the extreme pressure .
With BP facing fierce criticism and political fallout from the disaster driving a new environmental debate , the disaster convinced California officials that a proposed drilling project off the Santa Barbara coast , northwest of Los Angeles , should not go ahead .
“ It will not happen here in California , ” Schwarzenegger told a news conference .

ONE DAY IN 1994 , when I was living in Ede , a small town in Holland , I got a visit from my half - sister .
She and I were both immigrants from Somalia and had both applied for asylum in Holland .
I was granted it ; she was denied .
The fact that I got asylum gave me the opportunity to study .
My half - sister could n’t .
In order for me to be admitted to the university I wanted to attend , I needed to pass three courses : a language course , a civics course and a history course .
It was in the preparatory history course that I , for the first time , heard of the Holocaust .
I was 24 years old at that time , and my half - sister was 21 .
In those days , the daily news was filled with the Rwandan genocide and ethnic cleansing in the former Yugoslavia .
On the day that my half - sister visited me , my head was reeling from what happened to 6 million Jews in Germany , Holland , France and Eastern Europe .
I learned that innocent men , women and children were separated from each other .
Stars pinned to their shoulders , transported by train to camps , they were gassed for no other reason than for being Jewish .
I saw pictures of masses of skeletons , even of kids .
I heard horrifying accounts of some of the people who had survived the terror of Auschwitz and Sobibor .
I told my half - sister all this and showed her the pictures in my history book .
What she said was as awful as the information in my book .
With great conviction , my half - sister cried : “ It ’s a lie !
Jews have a way of blinding people .
They were not killed , gassed or massacred .
But I pray to Allah that one day all the Jews in the world will be destroyed . ”
She was not saying anything new .
As a child growing up in Saudi Arabia , I remember my teachers , my mom and our neighbors telling us practically on a daily basis that Jews are evil , the sworn enemies of Muslims , and that their only goal was to destroy Islam .
We were never informed about the Holocaust .
Later , as a teenager in Kenya , when Saudi and other Persian Gulf philanthropy reached us , I remember that the building of mosques and donations to hospitals and the poor went hand in hand with the cursing of Jews .
Jews were said to be responsible for the deaths of babies and for epidemics such as AIDS , and they were believed to be the cause of wars .
They were greedy and would do absolutely anything to kill us Muslims .
If we ever wanted to know peace and stability , and if we did n’t want to be wiped out , we would have to destroy the Jews .
For those of us who were not in a position to take up arms against them , it was enough for us to cup our hands , raise our eyes heavenward and pray to Allah to destroy them .
Western leaders today who say they are shocked by Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad ’s conference this week denying the Holocaust need to wake up to that reality .
For the majority of Muslims in the world , the Holocaust is not a major historical event that they deny .
We simply do not know it ever happened because we were never informed of it .
The total number of Jews in the world today is estimated to be about 15 million , certainly no more than 20 million .
On the other hand , the world ’s Muslim population is estimated to be between 1.2 billion and 1.5 billion .
And not only is this population rapidly growing , it is also very young .
What ’s striking about Ahmadinejad ’s conference is the ( silent ) acquiescence of mainstream Muslims .
I cannot help but wonder :
Why is there no counter - conference in Riyadh , Cairo , Lahore , Khartoum or Jakarta condemning Ahmadinejad ?
Why are the 57 members of the Organization of the Islamic Conference silent on this ?
Could the answer be as simple as it is horrifying :
For generations , the leaders of these so - called Muslim countries have been spoon - feeding their populations a constant diet of propaganda similar to the one that generations of Germans ( and other Europeans ) were fed — that Jews are vermin and should be dealt with as such ?
In Europe , the logical conclusion was the Holocaust .
If Ahmadinejad has his way , he shall not want for compliant Muslims ready to act on his wish .
The world needs to be informed again and again about the Holocaust — not only in the interest of the Jews who survived and their offspring but in the interest of humanity .
Gunmen wearing scarves to hide their faces laid siege to a shopping district in southwestern Baghdad just before noon Tuesday , killing at least 14 people in a robbery of several gold shops , Iraqi authorities said .
In the hunt for the attackers , investigators held the area 's security officials for questioning and sealed off much of Bayaa , a commercial hub that 's lost shoppers in recent years after vicious sectarian cleansing turned it into a predominantly Shiite Muslim enclave .
One of the assailants was killed in a gun battle with police ; two others were detained .
The brazen midday attack was the latest sign of insecurity as Iraq 's top leaders focus on forming a new government .
On Monday night , a newly elected parliament member , Bashar al - Ageidi , was assassinated in his volatile hometown of Mosul , in northern Iraq .
A series of deadly bombings and attacks since the March 7 parliamentary elections has sown fears of a security void during the government 's transitional period .
About 17 heavily armed assailants spilled out of several cars that pulled up to a cluster of shops Tuesday on Bayaa 's busy Street 20 , according to the Iraqi security command in Baghdad .
The gunmen shot into the air and threw percussion grenades , whose loud booms sent passers - by scrambling for safety , which cleared space for the attackers to enter jewelry shops and kill anyone inside before stuffing bags full of gold , authorities said .
A nearby four - man police patrol responded to the sound of the grenades and got into a shootout with the attackers .
All four officers were wounded , one attacker was killed and the other robbers fled with the loot , according to the Baghdad command center .
RPGs for a jewel heist ?
Local news reports and some policemen said the attackers were armed not only with standard weapons such as assault rifles and pistols fitted with silencers , but also with rocket - propelled grenade launchers and belt - fed machine guns .
An interviewer on the Iraqiya TV channel asked Baghdad security spokesman Qassim Atta the question that was on everyone 's mind Tuesday afternoon : " How did they manage to stage this operation at midday and get through all these checkpoints and security procedures in Baghdad ? "
Atta replied that an investigation was under way to determine how the robbers skirted the many checkpoints .
He added that Iraqi forces had responded promptly and managed to arrest two suspects and recover some of the stolen goods .
" You can't imagine how big this issue is .
It 's a big failure that gunmen managed to stage a major raid at midday in central Baghdad , " said a senior Interior Ministry official , who spoke only on the condition of anonymity because he is n't allowed to make public comments .
In recent weeks , politicians and pundits had warned that militant groups are strapped for cash and would attack gold merchants .
Iraqi jewelers are frequent targets for kidnappings , robberies and extortion .
In March , two goldsmiths were injured in a robbery in Kirkuk .
Last year , at least 17 gold merchants were killed in attacks in Baghdad and the southern city of Basra , according to McClatchy 's violence log .
" It 's expected that al Qaida ( in Iraq ) will resort to armed robbery , targeting banks and gold shops to fund its terrorist activities , " Sheikh Ahmed Abu Risha , a U.S. - allied Sunni Muslim tribal leader , told the local newspaper Azzaman last week .
No group immediately claimed responsibility for Tuesday 's operation .
McClatchy special correspondent Mohammed al Dulaimy contributed to this article .

Reducing H - 1B visas actually drives up salaries of foreigners on work visas
HANOVER , MD , May 13 , 2010 – Contrary to public assertions , IT professionals in the U.S. who are not citizens actually earned more than their American colleagues from 2000 - 2005 and therefore did not depress the salaries of American citizens , according to the Management Insights feature in the current issue of Management Science , the flagship journal of the Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences ( INFORMS ® ) .
“ Are Foreign IT Workers Cheaper ?
U.S. Visa Policies and Compensation of Information Technology Professionals ” is by Professors Sunil Mithas and Henry C. Lucas , Jr. of the Robert H. Smith School of Business , University of Maryland , College Park .
Management Insights , a regular feature of the journal , is a digest of important research in business , management , operations research , and management science .
It appears in every issue of the monthly journal .
Their study , the authors maintain , “ provides indirect evidence that visa and immigration policies so far have not had any adverse impact on the wages of American IT professionals due to any relatively lower compensation of foreign IT professionals . ”
The paper , which relies on salary data on more than 50,000 IT professionals , puts into doubt calls for more restrictive policies for workers in the United States on H - 1B visas .
H - 1B is a temporary work visa issued to employers allowing them to hire professionals in occupations that require a bachelor ’s degree and highly specialized skills .
The authors warn that enacting policies that restrict the number of skilled IT professionals reaching the United States may actually hurt American workers by leading American companies to off - shore , hiring IT pros to work outside the U.S. Reports about hiring of foreign IT professionals in Canada by Microsoft who were denied visas to work in the U.S. , they say , suggest that this damage may already be occurring .
In a worst case scenario , they warn , policies restricting immigration of specialized workers will hurt the long - term competitiveness of U.S. firms and the domestic economy .
The authors argue that higher quotas for specialized workers benefit American companies .
“ A culturally and globally diverse workforce , ” they write , “ even if it comes at a higher price and means paying higher wages for foreign IT professionals , may prove highly effective in capitalizing on opportunities for leveraging foreign countries as source or as markets for improved competitiveness . ”

National security , crime and justice
• Urgently review control orders and find a way to allow intercept evidence in court .
• Proscribe groups that have " recently espoused or incited violence or hatred " .
• Seek more " no torture " guarantees overseas so that foreign terror suspects can be deported .
• Directly elected " individuals " to oversee police .
• Greater legal protections for people to apprehend criminals and defend themselves .
• Overhaul drinking laws , ban below - cost alcohol sales and " early warning " bans on new legal highs .
• " Rehabilitation revolution " that will pay independent providers to reduce reoffending .
• Full review of sentencing policy and explore alternatives to prison for mentally ill and drug offenders .
• Extend anonymity to defendants in rape cases .
Analysis by Alan Travis
The agreement clears the way for the consideration of wider bans on extreme Islamist groups but with the careful caveat that they must be " subject to the advice of the police and security and intelligence agencies " .
It may lead to more instances of public funds being denied than outright bans such as that on Hizb - ut - Tahrir demanded in the past by Tory spokesmen .
The position on control orders appears to recognise that despite a Liberal Democrat plan to scrap control orders there is not yet any effective alternative .
The strategy of seeking more " no torture " agreements for deporting terror suspects has already been tried by Labour almost to the point of exhaustion but this enables the coalition to sidestep the immediate debate over the Human Rights Act .
The policing package omits the key Lib Dem election promise of employing 3,000 more police officers and pushes ahead with the Conservative proposals for directly - elected police commissioners – although Theresa May prefers to refer to them only as " individuals " .
The changes in the drinking laws and alcohol prices are likely to provoke a strong reaction from the drinks companies .
On prisons and sentencing , the coalition negotiators have ordered a review of sentencing to square the circle between David Cameron 's campaign promise of longer sentences and the Lib Dem commitment to reduce the use of six - month sentences .
The use of alternative , secure , treatment - based accommodation for the mentally ill and drug offenders could substantially cut the record prison population but will prove controversial .
Immigration and equality
• Annual limit on number of non-EU economic migrants .
• End detention of children for immigration purposes .
• Create border police force as part of Serious Organised Crime Agency .
• New measures to minimise abuse of student visas .
• Citizens from any new EU member states to be banned from working in UK for a transitional period .
• Halt deportation of asylum seekers who have fled to the UK because their sexual orientation or gender identification put them at risk .
• Extend right to request flexible working to all employees .
• Fair pay review in public sector to implement " 20 times " pay multiple .
Analysis by Alan Travis
The Conservatives ' promise to cap annual migration to the UK features strongly while the Lib Dems ' commitment to an amnesty for illegal migrants who have been in the country for more than 10 years is wholly absent .
The document is also silent on what will happen to the estimated 500,000 - plus illegal migrants living in the UK with no mention of increased deportations or plans to give them a route to citizenship .
The limit is carefully worded to refer to non-EU economic migrants to reassure minority ethnic groups that it will not cover the much larger numbers coming to Britain for family reunion purposes .
The agreement acknowledges that the coalition has yet to work out how the limit will be implemented .
Further improvements in the asylum system are promised , and in the equalities section there is a small Lib Dem victory with a ban on deporting asylum seekers who have been persecuted for being gay or lesbian .
Civil liberties
• Introduce a freedom bill .
• Scrap ID card scheme and register , Contact Point database and halt next generation of biometric passports .
• Outlaw fingerprinting of children at school without parents ' permission .
• Changes to the DNA database , restore rights of non-violent protest , regulate CCTV and introduce safeguards against misuse of anti-terrorism legislation .
• New mechanism to prevent proliferation of unnecessary new criminal offences .
• Set up commission to " investigate the creation of a British bill of rights that incorporates and builds on all our obligations under the European convention on human rights " .
Analysis by Alan Travis
The wide - ranging package on civil liberties is designed to " reverse their substantial erosion and roll back state intrusion " .
Its proposals to scrap ID cards go further than initially expected with the halting not only of the ID database but also the next generation of biometric passports .
This could potentially seriously boost the savings to be made but the Home Office will have serious problems disentangling ID cards from passports .
The terms of reference for the commission looking at replacing the Human Rights
Act with its promise to enshrine the European convention rights in British law and protect and extend British liberties sounds reassuring .
But the devil is in the details and the Conservatives are looking to reduce the application of Strasbourg case law , rather than the convention rights themselves , in British courts , opening the way for more deportations of terrorism suspects , failed asylum seekers and other controversial areas .
Energy , climate and environment
• Pledge to reform energy markets – that probably means more state intervention as the markets now are very liberalised .
• Ofgem to establish a " security guarantee of energy supplies " – to stop the lights going out as old coal and nuclear stations are retired .
• Annual energy statement to parliament – a school report way of keeping departments on their toes .
• An offshore electricity grid – along with the promised smart grid , that 's an expensive but necessary pledge .
Who will pay ?
Consumers in the end .
• Promise of " green financial products " so you can invest in wind farms and other forms of clean energy .
• A free vote on repealing the Hunting Act – a Conservative crowd - pleaser • A national tree - planting campaign – a Liberal Democrat policy that 's hard not to like .
• Encouraging councils to pay people to recycle – a Tory " carrot " idea that has been piloted already by Tory councils and is in contrast to Labour 's penalising " stick " proposals .
• " Sharing " the responsibility with farmers for dealing with disease outbreaks – ie farmers will pay for next foot and mouth .
• On housing , coalition says it " will require continual improvements to energy efficiency " – but no mention of Labour 's commitment to make all new homes zero- carbon by 2016 .
Analysis by Damian Carrington
The environment was already one of the most fleshed - out areas of policy in the initial coalition agreement , and today 's new " programme for government " does n't throw up many new surprises .
Aside from nuclear power , which retains a Tory green light with Liberal Democrats allowed to abstain , there is much agreement between the two parties – more energy will be generated from renewable sources such as wind and runway expansion remains ruled out at Heathrow , Gatwick and Stansted .
Some of the newly - announced ideas , such as a national tree - planting campaign – a Lib Dem proposal – are populist as well as good news for the environment .
The Tories got their shires - pleaser with a free vote to repeal the act that banned fox - hunting .
Another Conservative proposal , councils paying people to recycle , could prove popular compared to Labour 's contrasting " pay - as - you - throw " idea .
Some sections of the new agreement are still very woolly .
Houses will have to be more energy efficient – but will new homes have to meet the previous government 's commitment of being zero carbon by 2016 ?
A green bank will encourage clean energy – yet how much funding it will get is unknown .
The government is promising to source food to British Standards – but only where it is cheap .
There is also no mention of the previous government 's promise to pay consumers up to £ 5,000 towards the price of a new electric car .
Time will tell whether the coalition lives up to Cameron 's promise to be the " greenest government ever " .
Defence , security and foreign affairs
• Pledge to " maintain " Britain 's nuclear deterrent , but the renewal of Trident should be scrutinised " to ensure value for money " , with Lib Dems to " continue to make the case for alternatives " .
• Reduce Ministry of Defence running costs by 25 % .
• Measures to improve duty of care and military covenant , including doubling allowance for troops serving in Afghanistan .
• Boost defence exports for " legitimate purposes , not internal repression " .
• Set up a strategic defence and security review , overseen by the National Security Council " with strong Treasury involvement " .
• Establish " a new ' special relationship ' with India " and " seek closer engagement with China " .
• Maintain " a strong , close and frank relationship with the United States " .
• The UK will play a " positive " role in the EU , but amend the 1972 European Communities Act , " examine " the case for a UK " sovereignty bill " , and approach legislation in the area of criminal justice " on a case - by - case basis " .
Analysis by Richard Norton - Taylor
Though there is little startlingly new in the programme relating to defence , security , and foreign policy , the language and emphasis is significant .
All parties agreed before the election on the need to keep nuclear weapons , set up a defence review , and improve the welfare of British troops and their families .
However , there is also plenty of scope for serious disputes over the coming months , notably over when and how to replace the existing Trident nuclear missile fleet and what weapons systems to cut in the defence and security review due to be completed by the end of the year .
The emphasis on Treasury involvement and value for money could provoke tensions within the Conservative party – between those who want Britain to procure every available modern weapons system , and those who are more concerned about the cost .
There are signs of balancing acts – for example between hawks who would like to export as much arms as possible , and those , particularly the Lib Dems , concerned about them getting into the wrong hands .
The language on the EU is robust – when it comes to what is called the " transfer of sovereignty " but pragmatic and flexible on areas the Conservatives have expressed strong opposition to ie cooperation in the fields of criminal justice and the workplace .
With a significant choice of words , the document refers to a " special relationship " with India , contrasting with " closer engagement " with China .
It promises a " frank " relationship with the US , a term reflecting perhaps Nick Clegg 's known scepticism about too close a relationship with Washington after the experience of George Bush and Tony Blair 's period in power .
Health
• Guarantee year - on - year real - terms increases in health spending and end to top - down reorganisations of the NHS ; cut by a third the cost of NHS administration and transfer these savings to frontline services .
• " Significant " cuts in the number of health quangos but strengthened role for Care Quality Commission and Monitor , the foundation trust regulator .
• Reforms to Nice , and create a cancer drugs fund to help patients .
• Stop the " centrally - dictated " closure of A&E and maternity wards .
• Renegotiate the GP contract but give more powers to GPs as patients ' expert guides ; develop a 24/7 urgent care service in England , including out - of - hours services .
• Ban foreign health professionals from working in the NHS unless they have passed " robust " language and competence tests .
• Introduce directly elected members of primary care trust boards .

The coalition 's health plans pledge to implement most of the ideas the Tories developed in opposition , such as a new independent NHS board , real - terms year - on - year increases in spending , halting the closure of hospital A&E and maternity units , and letting patients rate their quality of hospital care .
But the high - profile and ill - advised Tory pre-election plan to scrap NHS targets introduced by Labour – such as A&E patients being seen within four hours , and every patient receiving treatment within 18 weeks of first seeing their GP – seems to have been dropped .
They have been popular with patients and most doctors accept they have brought huge benefits .
Abandoning them could see waiting lists rising again , which would be unpopular .
The dozens of clear , detailed promises of reform will bring profound change both in the NHS 's structures and the way it operates .
Although one promise is to " stop the top - down reorganisations of the NHS " , there will be yet another of those .
Giving groups of GPs the power to commission health services on behalf of patients and control over budgets will limit the role of England 's 152 primary care trusts , and question marks may arise too over the remit and future of the 10 regional strategic health authorities .
Mergers of PCTs , like the one ongoing in Birmingham , are likely , with job losses inevitable .
NHS managers will face tough times , too , thanks to the pledge to slash NHS bureaucracy .
The coalition will also " significantly cut the number of health quangos " .
None of those for the chop have been identified yet , but speculation suggests the Food Standards Agency and National Patient Safety Agency – where Sir Liam Donaldson , the outgoing chief medical officer , is about to become the new chairman – may be among those which are vulnerable .
Publishing much more detailed data about which hospitals provide the best care will encourage even more patients to vote with their feet , and that could in time threaten the viability of some district general hospitals .
Social care and disability
• Establish a commission on long - term care .
• Break down barriers between health and social care funding .
• Extend personal budgets for social care .
• Help the elderly live at home for longer through home adaptations and community support programmes .
• Prioritise dementia research .
• Introduce direct payments for carers and improve access to respite care .
• Reform Access to Work programme .
Analysis by Anna Bawden
Despite 13 years of a Labour government and numerous reports and inquiries , the thorny issue of how to pay for social care funding and tackle the burgeoning numbers with dementia has still not been addressed .
So the government 's announcement of a commission on long - term care , which will report within a year and more resources for dementia research , suggests that it means business .
Crucially , the government seems keen not to simply rehearse old arguments or replicate previous research .
The commission has been told to focus on a range of ideas , including the two main proposals on reforming social care funding : a voluntary insurance scheme and the partnership scheme proposed by Derek Wanless in his 2005 root - and - branch review for the King 's Fund .
Similarly , the promise to prioritise dementia research is long overdue .
A statement that the government would " break down barriers between health and social care funding to incentivise preventative action " makes all the right noises , but , in an era of cuts , whether councils and the NHS will feel able to pool resources in this way is questionable .
While the extension of personal budgets for carers , older and disabled people and improving access to respite care is a continuation of Labour 's policies , the coalition has scrapped plans to implement the Personal Care at Home Act 2010 , which promised free care at home .
Education
• Parents , teachers and charities to be encouraged to set up their own schools under a " Swedish - style " system .
• Emphasis on old - fashioned discipline – strict uniform codes , and rules such as pupils standing up when teachers enter the classroom .
A pledge to give teachers " the powers they need " to keep order .
• A pupil premium for disadvantaged children – but no mention of what the " significant " premium will be worth and no further detail on what cuts " outside the schools budget " will fund it .
• Inspections to be targeted on failing schools , an effort to get more science and maths graduates to be teachers , and state school pupils to sit " elite " exams like the iGCSE .
• Policy on higher and further education is light on detail , with aspirations such as fostering stronger links between universities , colleges and industry featuring more heavily than actual measures to deliver them .
• No firm policy on student fees .
The coalition will wait until Lord Browne 's review into university funding has reported ; Lib Dems can abstain if the government wants to increase fees .
Analysis by Jessica Shepherd
The coalition government has agreed to push forward the Tories ' plans to allow parents , teachers and charities to set up their own schools .
We can expect proposals very soon to change legislation so that these new schools can open .
At the moment , rules on planning permission stand in the way of making these new schools – based on Sweden 's free schools and US charter schools – a reality in the near future .
But while the Conservatives can be seen to have got their way on new schools , where is their big drive to increase the number of academy schools ?
The only mention of academies is in the penultimate paragraph of the schools section .
In the run-up to the election , the Conservatives were loudly proclaiming that they would give primary schools the chance to turn into academies and that any school deemed " outstanding " by Ofsted , the school inspectorate , would be able to transform into an academy within days of a Tory government .
The Lib Dems may well have refused to concede an expansion of academy schools .
They have stated that they want schools to be held accountable to local authorities .
Academies are not , being independent state schools .
Is there a contradiction in telling schools they will have more freedom , but also asserting that they will be " properly accountable " ?
Many teachers will be delighted that the two parties that make up the coalition agree that government should have less involvement in curriculum matters .
We can expect that the Qualifications and Curriculum Development Agency , a quango in charge of curriculum design , may well have had its day .
But teachers and their unions will be worried by the statement that headteachers are going to be given the power to award bonuses to their staff and possibly penalise them too , under a reform of existing " rigid " national pay and condition rules .
Much is still vague in this document .
How exactly will Sats be changed ?
The document says this is " to be reviewed " .
The Lib Dems have got their way on the pupil premium .
This is the financial incentive that would give schools extra cash for taking disproportionately more pupils from poor homes .
But how much this pupil premium will be , and where the money will come from , has not been said .
On universities , the main question has been evaded : tuition fees .
The parties are hiding behind the Browne review , which is currently under way and looking into whether fees should rise .
The Lib Dems are well - known for their stance on phasing out the fees .
All this document repeats is that Lib Dems will be able to abstain from a vote in parliament on the topic .
The Lib Dems have also not got their way on raising the adult learning grant .
In their manifesto , they said this should increase from £ 30 to £ 45 a week .
Just like the pupil premium , the figures are nowhere to be seen .
Sport
• Promise to ensure a " safe and successful " Olympic games , and deliver the 2014 Glasgow Commonwealth games and the 2013 rugby league and 2015 rugby union world cups .
Will " strongly support " the 2018 football world cup bid .
• Promise to " urgently " form plans to deliver a " genuine and lasting legacy " from the Olympics .
• Reform the lottery to ensure more money goes into sports , the arts and heritage .
• Support an annual " Olympic - style " school sports event to encourage competitive sport .
• Use cash in dormant betting accounts to boost grassroots sport .
• Encourage reform of football governance rules to support the " cooperative ownership of football clubs by supporters " .
Analysis by Owen Gibson
The coalition has largely retained all the main sports policies of both parties .
In opposition , both had been strongly critical of ill - formed plans to boost sports participation through the Olympics and now have a chance to do something about it .
The fact they have flagged the issue as urgent in an otherwise fairly noncommittal list of policy objectives suggests they will move on it soon .
Jeremy
Hunt , the new sports secretary , created waves by refusing to ringfence the £ 9.3 bn budget for the Olympics , but it is not understood to be at risk – partly because it would be foolish to cut the contingency budget and risk busting it closer to the games , but mainly because both parties recognise the need not to disrupt a project that appears to be largely on track .
However , they will have to continue to make the case for it as spending cuts elsewhere begin to bite .
Hugh Robertson , the new junior sports minister , has identified overhauling the 2012 legacy plan as one of his first priorities , alongside getting the 2018 World Cup bid back on track and reforming the lottery .
He is then expected to turn his attention to the thorny issue of reforming English football 's dysfunctional governance structure .
Today 's promise to support ownership of clubs by supporters will be welcomed by fans ' groups but is short of the detail that Labour promised during the election campaign .
Proposals to use cash in dormant betting accounts to fund grassroots sporting facilities – a Lib Dem idea – are sensible but will only raise around £ 10 m a year .
That could be a drop in the ocean if an axe is taken to exchequer funding for sport in the wake of the 2012 Olympics .
Coincidentally £ 10 m is also how much the Tories have said it will cost to stage their planned annual " Olympic - style " school sports competition – a plan that critics say replicates too closely existing competitions and would cost money better spent elsewhere .
Communities , local government and social action
• Over 30 commitments ranging across council finance , housing , planning , and volunteering to " shift power from Westminster " and end the " era of top - down government " by devolving decision - making to local councils , communities and individuals , and encouraging social action to help people " come together to improve their communities " .
• Abolition of regional housebuilding targets , returning decisions on where and how may homes are built to local councils , who will also have new powers to stop " garden grabbing " – the practice whereby developers build homes in large gardens attached to suburban houses .
In rural areas farmers will be able to convert existing buildings into social housing , while communities will be able to form trusts to build homes on public land .
• A freeze on council tax " for at least one year " – two years if local authorities agree .
This suggests a coalition compromise – the Tories had previously promised a centrally - imposed two - year freeze .
There will be a review of council and housing finance .
Town halls will be given more freedom to decide how they run themselves , and will face a less onerous inspection regime .
Councillors will be given the power to vote on salary packages for senior council executives .
• Public sector workers will have the right to form co-ops and social enterprises to " become their own boss " and " take over " the services they deliver .
• A cadre of " community organisers " will be trained to support social action in deprived communities .
A National Citizen Service will be introduced for 16 - year - olds " to give them a chance to develop the skills needed to be active and responsible citizens , mix with people from different backgrounds and start getting involved in their communities " .
There are three parts to this policy : allowing councils more autonomy by giving them more opportunities to raise local income ; giving councils the power to set local priorities and standards for public services ; and allowing local community groups and charities to take direct ownership of buildings and services .
In theory David Cameron and Nick Clegg are on the same page here .
" ' Liberalism " and " big society " in effect meant " the same thing , " Clegg told the big society launch at No 10 on Tuesday .
In practice it may be tricky .
The Lib Dems who have around 5,000 local councillors and a strong grassroots activist base , will support greater local autonomy , and will expect rapid and meaningful reform : they will be disappointed if devolution does not materialise , or if the promised review of local government finance ( the third in the last six years ) is , like its predecessors , shelved and ignored .
The Tory right will be unnerved by the coalition 's decision , announced in today 's document , to water down their party 's current commitment to a two - year council tax freeze .
They will be concerned that localism may lead to a proliferation of local taxes and public spending , especially if Labour continues to make gains in local elections .
Housing may be another source of tension .
The coalition 's decision to scrap regional house - building targets will be welcomed by councils in south - east England , who had opposed them vehemently .
But there will be concerns that this , and the promise of greater local control over planning decisions , will fuel nimbyism , make it harder to kickstart the house - building industry , and exacerbate existing housing shortages .
Labour , which flirted with ideas of " community empowerment " in recent years , always feared that localism would undermine the universality of the welfare state and services .
The coalition may be less sensitive about this , but if local councils are allowed to shrug off national standards and go their own way Clegg and Cameron can expect to be criticised for presiding over an unfair " postcode lottery " where citizens in neighbouring boroughs end up with widely differing entitlements and levels of service .
Ultimately , localism is always politically difficult , says Andy Sawford , chief executive of the Local Government Information Unit .
To do localism successfully means " changing the way we govern , as well as the structure of taxation . "
That is rarely popular with national politicians , " who feel that they have a mandate to intervene at local level and that they will be held to account anyway for what happens at local level . "

Families
The Conservatives ' core commitment to family values comes through strongly .
" Strong and stable families are the bedrock of a strong and stable society , " the document states , and measures to encourage couples to stay together include money for relationship counselling , and a commitment to look at addressing the so - called couple penalty in the tax credit system ( which arises because two parents living separately can receive a higher level of benefits than those who live together ) .
Sure Start survives , as promised , but loses its original goal of bringing well - off and poorer children and families together , in order to focus services on the needier , and also shifts its mission to lay greater emphasis on the provision of an extra 4,200 health visitors ( as the Conservatives promised last year ) .
The Conservatives ' concern to protect children from " excessive commercialisation and premature sexualisation " is set out here , chiming with recent media outrage over padded bikinis for seven - year - olds .
Popular frustration over the growth in demand for Criminal Records Bureau checks for people working with children is also acknowledged , with a commitment to scale the system " back to common - sense levels " .
Both Conservatives and Lib Dems promised to adhere to the commitment to end child poverty by 2020 in their manifestos , and that promise is reflected here .
The commitment to promoting shared parenting and flexible parental leave is also an area that both the Conservatives and the Lib Dems have been working on for several years ; campaigners welcome this , but stress that all rests on how this is implemented .
Jobs and welfare
One of the final Conservative party campaign posters to go up across the country said : " Let 's cut benefits for those who refuse to work . "
This is translated in today 's document into a line that pledges : " We will ensure that receipt of benefits for those able to work is conditional on their willingness to work " and a promise that those who turn down " reasonable offers of work or training " will be sanctioned .
There is no further detail on how this will be implemented .
Unsurprisingly , some of the more radical and expensive proposals made by the new work and pensions secretary , Iain Duncan Smith , in opposition , have not made it into the document .
His scheme to remove benefits more gradually when people move into work ( in order to make taking a low - paid job more appealing ) is only hinted at here , with a promise that ways to simplify the benefits system in order to improve incentives to work will be " investigated " .
Equalities
The government will " promote equal pay and take a range of measures to end discrimination in the workplace " .
While this will be welcomed widely , everything depends on how actively it promotes this goal , and the pledge is rather vague .
Forty years after the Equal Pay Act , women are still paid on average 17 % less than men , and even the measures in the outgoing government 's equality legislation are not seen as robust enough to tackle the problem ; campaigners will be waiting to see details of what these measures consist of .
Ben Summerskill of Stonewall said that the two lines on gay rights were a " happy melange " of Conservative and Lib Dem policy .
Both parties had committed to stopping the deportation of asylum seekers who have had to leave particular countries because their sexual orientation or gender identification puts them at proven risk of imprisonment , torture or execution .
The Conservatives had promised to " use our relationships with other countries to push for unequivocal support for gay rights " , while the Lib Dems had pledged to work to make sure UK civil partnerships were recognised internationally .
" The acid test will be what politicians do rather than what they say , but with more openly gay MPs in the Conservative party than in Labour and Lib Dems put together , we suspect that there will be more movement here than there might have been historically . "

The arts
• Free entry to national museums and galleries – and greater freedom for national museums and galleries .
• Bigger share of lottery money for arts and heritage – and as with sports , possibility of tax changes to increase lottery profits to the good causes .
• Lottery distributors - ie the Arts Council and Heritage Lottery Fund - to restrict administration costs to 5 % of total income .
• Cut red tape to encourage more live music .
When media and sports are stripped out , the culture and arts commitments are the thinnest in the entire coalition document , the least likely to be papering over any Conservative / Lib Dem cracks – and the most likely to disintegrate as spending cuts bite .
On the face of it , this handful of principles , with lottery changes bringing the only promise of new money , is common ground between the coalition partners .
However , Jeremy Hunt , the new culture secretary , assured in his first speech that culture will not be a soft target for cuts – but he will be unable to stop the Treasury from seeing it as precisely that , and his ability to defend his new territory has yet to be proven .
The commitment to free admission will be welcomed by most in the sector , after rumblings in opposition from some
Tory sources that charging was on the way back .
The " greater freedom " phrase may yet prove contentious : it covers Hunt 's conviction that private philanthropy , and American - style endowments – a goldmine in the boom years , a millstone which has which has crushed many US museums as the economy crashed – is the way for many arts institutions to guarantee their own long - term stable financial footing .
Cutting administration costs will be a mantra across all government departments : the Arts Council is currently closest to the target at 6.5 % , after a wave of painful cuts under Labour .
The red tape and live music promise relates to a bitter and arcane row , raging quite unknown to most of the public for the last seven years , since the new Licensing Act dropped the " two in a bar " provision that small informal live music venues needed no licence .
The Lib Dems have been running with the campaign launched by the Musicians Union , to sort out a situation which has been policed in some regions to ludicrous extremes of pub landlords threatened with prosecution or losing their licence over carol singers or Morris dancers .

Far be it from me to imply that the birds are the innocent victims of oil spills not be rescued .
I understand and am sympathetic to the desire to save the oiled birds , and in my early career I helped organize bird rescue response .
However , those who do this work should realize they are doing far less good than they would like .
Oiled birds die at a rate several times higher than not - oiled birds .
This is the message of the data , not the messenger .
After the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill , Exxon petitioned the court for financial credits for the costs of shoreline cleanup and oiled wildlife rescue .
The court granted these requests , which reduced Exxon 's obligation by more than $ 1 billion .
However , the court apparently did not consider whether cleanup was effective .
To look at the effectiveness of cleaning oiled birds , I analyzed all band recoveries of oiled birds that had been cleaned and released in North America since the Santa Barbara blowout in 1969 .
Cleaned birds are banded with identifying numbers and an address where to mail the band .
I found after analyzing 219 recoveries of banded birds that , at best , very few , about 10 percent , of cleaned birds survive a year .
Every time there is an oil spill , wildlife rehabilitators claim that better rescue , cleaning and treatment techniques result in more birds surviving .
So I compared days survived from 1969 to 1989 with data from 1989 to 1996 , and with data from spills that occurred in California after 1996 .
The data show that newer techniques are not significantly more effective .
Cleaning techniques have not changed ; the same detergent used in the 1970s is still used today .
Even with supposedly better veterinary treatment developed since Exxon Valdez , only a small proportion of oiled birds and wildlife are rehabilitated enough to allow them to survive after release .
It has been found that most of the birds become sick from oil swallowed , inhaled or absorbed .
In summary , the mortality of oiled birds is five to 10 times that of non-oiled birds , and a large proportion - 90 percent or more - of oiled birds do not survive after release .
It should be noted that it is the policy of some European countries and some U.S. conservation organizations to euthanize oiled birds .
What concerns me is that this truth is largely withheld from the public , which fervently hopes that bird rescue is fixing the oiled bird problem .
The reality is , once oil is in the water , there is little that can be done except to assess damages .
We Americans are a can - do culture , and a we - can - fix - it attitude is the norm .
The BP spill has changed all that : the damages it is causing cannot be fixed .
We have to realize that oil spills of the scale of the BP spill can only be prevented .
Worse , these large spills must be endured , even when the thought of enduring such an evil is almost impossible to ask .
For the public to believe that cleaning oiled birds means they are being saved is worth millions of dollars in PR to the corporation responsible for a spill .
This is why the American Petroleum Institute funds bird rescue organizations , whose work protects the image of the BPs and the Exxon Mobils as being concerned about oiled wildlife .

PARIS ( AP ) —
Trains stood still and children played instead of studied as workers around France went on strike Thursday to protest President Nicolas Sarkozy ’s plans to raise the retirement age to 62 .
Neighboring countries suffered along with Paris commuters , as walkouts by drivers delayed or canceled trains from Italy and Switzerland .
Some flights were dropped or delayed .
Boisterous crowds of protesters filled Marseille ’s port and wide Paris avenues , as unions staged nearly 200 marches in several cities over a broad reform to the money - losing pension system , part of efforts around Europe to cut back on growing public debts .
“ Sarkozy , Do n’t Touch our Pensions ! ” read one banner at the Paris march , near a cardboard coffin marked : “ Here lies Roger .
He ’s 60 , and he died before getting his retirement . ”
France has one of Europe ’s lowest retirement ages , allowing workers to retire at 60 in most sectors .
The government says the reform to the money - losing pension system is an “ obligation , ” given France ’s burgeoning deficit and its aging population .
Unions say money for the pension system should come from higher taxes or charges on those who are still working , and see cost - cutting in the pension system as an attack on a hard - fought way of life .
Sebastien Sihr , secretary general of the SNUipp union , called the reform “ a step backward . ”
“ They are refusing to imagine other sources of funding , ” he told The Associated Press at the Paris march , where a crowd of thousands whistled and cheered , waving red , white and blue balloons under a hot summer sun .
Commuters , meanwhile , made do , some cramming into sweaty , overcrowded buses and subway trains .
Hundreds of passengers were stranded at Rome ’s main train station Wednesday when the overnight train to Paris was canceled because of the strike .
Authorities were putting the passengers on buses instead .
Swiss national railway company SBB said about 60 percent of trains between France and Switzerland have been canceled because of the strike .
The French civil aviation authority , DGAC , asked airlines to cancel 15 percent of their flights out of Paris ’ Charles de Gaulle and Orly airports because of strikes by air traffic controllers .
Air France said long - haul flights would remain unaffected .
Commuter Stephanie Larcher , a 29 - year - old town planner , from Buressuryvette , in the outskirts of Paris , said she ’s had to add an extra hour onto her daily four - hour journey .
“ I find it completely irritating , especially because train workers go on strike for any little thing , ” she said .
About 20 percent of French teachers were on strike , according to the Education Ministry .
Utility workers , postal workers , dock workers , workers at planemaker Airbus and some hospital workers also took part in the one - day walkout .
The French pension reform pales in comparison with more drastic changes elsewhere in Europe .
Germany , for example , plans to gradually raise its retirement age from 65 to 67 , starting in 2012 .
Bernadette Douisson , the secretary general of the FSU union , said the French government ’s real concern should be boosting employment in a country where large numbers of young people and seniors ca n’t get jobs .
Labor Minister Eric
Woerth says the reform will save nearly € 19 billion ( $ 29.3 billion ) in 2018 and should bring the pension system back into the black that year .
The reform is scheduled to be instituted progressively and will also stretch out the total number of years people have to work to win full pension payments .
The Cabinet is to discuss the proposals in July , and they are expected to go before parliament next fall .
Associated Press writers Jean - Marie Godard in Paris , Victor Simpson in Rome and Eliane Engeler in Geneva contributed to this report .

Rasmussen has been this cycle 's most prolific pollster , by far .
As of February :
Yes , Rasmussen Reports has fielded far more polls so far this cycle , both in absolute terms ( 45 vs. 13 ) and as a percentage of the total ( 28 % vs 18 % ) .
Rasmussen 's volume has n't decreased since then .
If you want to see how spammy they are , check out this link .
Yesterday the nation had several hot races , including the House special election in PA - 12 , primaries in both parties in Kentucky and Arkansas , and the Democratic Senate primary in Pennsylvania .
And somehow , Rasmussen was nowhere to be found .
Yet this past week , Rasmussen found time to poll Colorado , California , and those burning Idaho senate and governor races .
He even polled the general election in Arkansas , ignoring the imminent primaries -- the better to show Arkansas Republican primary voters who their strongest candidate was .
You see , the thing about Rasmussen is that he cares only about setting the narrative that Democrats are doomed .
And it 's hard to build those narratives if you screw up polling actual elections .
So why take the risk of getting an actual election result wrong , this early in the cycle ?
There 's a special election in PA - 12 ?
Who cares !
Rasmussen is nowhere to be found .
Just like in January , when Rasmussen -- who had polled the Massachusetts Senate special election twice earlier , decided to pull out of the race two weeks before the actual election .
The day before that special , Rasmussen released a bizarre poll saying that nationally " interest high " in the race .
Who gave a shit if there was national interest ?
Why would n't Rasmussen poll the actual race like the rest of real pollsters ?
Turns out what Rasmussen wanted was to set the narrative , not actually get the results right .
So it skipped the latter , and bragged about the former :
Rasmussen Reports provided the first news feed suggesting that Democratic candidate Martha Coakley might be in trouble on January 5 , two full weeks before the election .
In that poll , we showed Coakley ’s lead down to single digits and noted that Republican candidate Scott Brown was within two points among those certain to vote .
A week later , of course , we showed the race a toss - up with Brown leading among those certain to vote .
About that time , Public Policy Polling also released a poll showing the race to be even .
It 's not as if Rasmussen does n't poll primaries .
In fact , it polled the Pennsylvania Senate Democratic primary two weeks ago .
But again , it refused to do a pre-election poll , because doing so would no longer help set narratives , and that 's all Rasmussen cares about .
Today , Rasmussen released a poll showing Dick Blumenthal suddenly in trouble in Connecticut .
How convenient !
And narrative setting .
Too bad he could n't poll actual elections .
And yes , by November , Rasmussen 's polling will be nicely in line with the rest of the polling aggregate , as he adjusts his voter screens to match reality , not whatever GOP - heavy universe he currently lives in .
By then , he 'll be less worried about setting narratives , and more worried about getting races right so that he can brag about his electoral track record .
That way , he uses that credibility in order to once again set bullshit narratives in the 2012 election cycle .
It 's quite the scam !
Because if it its n't a scam , there 's no reason he should 've skipped polling the big Tuesday races .
Glasspool 's ordination was " joyful and well attended "
The US Episcopal Church has ordained an openly lesbian bishop in a move likely to increase the turmoil in the Anglican Communion .
Saturday 's ordination came despite warnings from the Archbishop of Canterbury that it would deepen an already bitter dispute on sexuality .
Mary Glasspool , 56 , became an assistant bishop at a ceremony attended by 3,000 people in Long Beach , California .
Gene Robinson became the first openly gay US bishop in November 2003 .
BBC religious affairs correspondent Robert Pigott says that since then the Anglican Communion has been on course for a permanent split .
' Snub '
Mary Glasspool was ordained with another woman bishop , Rev Canon Diane Jardine Bruce .
Both were elected last December and become the first two women bishops in the Diocese of Los Angeles 's 114 - year history .
Church spokesman Bob Williams said that those attending burst into applause after the ordination .
" The event was joyful and well attended , " he said .
The election of Mary Glasspool - who has been with her partner Becki for 22 years - represented a snub by the liberal Episcopal Church to other Anglican Churches around the world , our correspondent says .
Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams had urged the American Church not to proceed with the ordination , warning that it would further alienate traditionalists who believe active homosexuality to be a sin .
Our correspondent says the latest ordination is likely to accelerate the gradual marginalisation of the Episcopal Church within a two - tier Communion and increase tensions between Anglicans elsewhere .
Gene Robinson was elected as the first openly US gay bishop in November 2003 in New Hampshire .
The Episcopal Church at first agreed to suspend the creation of gay bishops but reversed that decision last July .

I have chosen 28 Tumblrs that range from contemporary , modern , and classical art ; vintage illustration ; vintage photography ; design and typography .
Each of these Tumblrs has its own spectacular character .
I owe a debt of gratitude to these sites for providing me with inspiration daily .

Mr. Moura was sentenced two weeks ago to 30 years in prison after being found guilty of collaborating with Mr. Galvão .
The trials were seen as a litmus test for Brazil ’s ability to begin to end the lawlessness that reigns in the Amazon region , an area the size of the United States west of the Mississippi River .
The government has little presence in the area , and illegal deforestation and illegal mining are rampant .
According to the Catholic Land Pastoral , a watchdog group that tracks rural violence in Brazil , 1,546 people were killed in land conflicts in the past 25 years , usually by gunmen paid by ranchers with land claims at stake .
“ The vast majority of these crimes are met with absolute impunity by the legal system , ” said Antonio Canuto , an official with the group .
“ Today ’s trial is a nearly singular fact , and it is of supreme importance to set a precedent to stop the violence . ”
According to a report Catholic Land Pastoral delivered to the Justice Ministry on Thursday , of the 1,546 killings , only 85 cases were judged , Mr. Canuto said .
A total of 20 plotters were found guilty , but only Mr. Moura and Mr. Galvão are behind bars .
The rest either escaped from prison or are free on appeals .
It looks like Mandriva , the Paris based Linux company , continues to be a fig leaf away from financial breakdown .
A recent report in LeMagIT , claims that Arnaud Laprvote , the company 's chief executive , has found unnamed investors who are prepared to rescue the company , following months of rumours of financial turmoil , unpaid staff and other troubles .
Loosely translated , Laprvote says that he has had " found investors that have decided to invest in the company to return the group to balance and find a good business model , " and that " community and users " no longer need to concern themselves .
Mandriva has a loyal following across Europe and Latin America , and can still claim to be one of the most friendly and innovative of GNU / Linux distributions .
Sadly , its financial base has n't been equal to its technical prowess .
Unlike Ubuntu , Mandriva has never had the cash reserves it has needed to steady the ship and fund its growth , and has failed to trim its business model to take advantage of the prevailing winds .
For " confidentiality reasons " Laprvote was unable to disclose the identity of the investors , but most commentators assume the most likely candidate to be Linagora , a successful French open source company which expressed an interest in buying Mandriva earlier this year .
The Federal Opposition will today announce the next phase of the immigration policy it will take to the federal election .
As expected , the Howard government 's temporary protection visas will be back , but there will be a new element .
Visa holders who are eligible for welfare would have to work for it .
" What you 'll see is the same resolve from this Coalition in government that you saw from the Coalition last time in government , " Opposition immigration spokesman Scott Morrison said .
" There 's one of the many bows that you need and arrows that you need to deal with this very difficult problem . "
He says the temporary protection visas will last for no more than three years .
After that time , if the visa holder still cannot go home , they will be granted an extension or permanent residency .
As it was during the Howard years , the visa holders will not have family reunion rights , but they will be able to work and have access to Medicare .
They will have to attend English language classes after a year and they will have access to limited income support , but there is a new catch in the form of mutual obligation - visa holders will have to work for welfare .
" In the same way that others are required to do work for the dole and things of that nature , we think that is only fair that those same requirements should apply to those receiving these benefits , " Mr Morrison said .
Mr Morrison said the Coalition would do away with the Government 's recent freeze on visa applications for Sri Lankan and Afghan asylum seekers , which he said was discriminatory .
A Coalition government would also reintroduce the 45 - day rule that was abolished by the Rudd Government .
It means asylum seekers who take more than 45 days to lodge a refugee claim will not be allowed to work or access Medicare .
" We can't have the situation where people at the end of their visas - which may be for anything from working holidays to student visas to any form of visas - simply decide that at the end of their visa they do n't want to go home and seek to lodge an asylum claim , " Mr Morrison said .
He admits the policies are a return to the Howard era and says they have been openly discussed within the party and approved by the shadow cabinet .
Moderates within the Coalition such as Judith Troeth have previously said such policies punish the victims and not the people smugglers , but Mr Morrison disagrees .
" But we 're an open party , we 're a tolerant party and people have different views , " he said .
Mr Morrison says it is difficult to say how quickly the policies could stop asylum seeker boats arriving in Australian waters and he did not rule out a return to the Pacific Solution .
" [ The policies ] were very effective last time but if it requires more than clearly a government who has a resolve to stop boats , well we 'll do it , " he said .
Last night , ABC used hidden cameras and actors to see what regular people would do if they saw an obviously abused woman being harassed by her boyfriend .
A lot of regular people failed the test .

The highly - successful 20 /20 spinoff What Would You Do? brings social experiments to television , using variables to test how ordinary people react to situations such as seeing someone steal a bike in a park , or witnessing a deli clerk give a blind man incorrect change .
Lately , the show has been raising the stakes , and last night reporter John Quiñones showed us what restaurant diners do when they see a very obviously bruised woman getting picked on by her boyfriend at a nearby table .
As they often do , the producers used different variables to see if they changed the outcome , staging the scene with both white and African American actor " couples " to see if race affected bystanders ' willingness to step in .
In both cases , the actresses were helped by fellow diners ( though fewer men got involved with the African American couple ) :

But then they tried a different variable : the women 's clothing .
When the same actresses dressed " provocatively , " and we 're talking clothing that 's pretty average for a Saturday night , not Julia Roberts ' blue - and - white monokini - thing in Pretty Woman , nobody came to their rescue .
Diners complained to the staff that the couple were " upsetting customers " and one man told the abusive boyfriend actor that the two were " embarrassing themselves as a couple , " but nothing like what happened when the women were dressed conservatively occurred in this case , and in fact , two middle - aged female witnesses joked with each other about the beaten - up woman being a prostitute .

While obviously the show is highly unscientific ( notice that in the second video , the white actor is inexplicably dressed up in a suit ) and meant for entertainment , it can't be a bad thing to force viewers to think about issues such as racism or domestic violence .
Maybe the next time they see someone being abused , they 'll be more likely to step up .
( After all , they might be on TV ! )

What Would You Do ? [ ABC ]
Marc Savard has passed his neuro - psych test , clearing him to return to practice with his teammates .
Once Savard is close to game shape , he will have a final meeting with Dr. Kelly McInnis , who has been consulting on the center ’s recovery , to receive clearance to play .
That meeting has yet to be scheduled .
Savard will not play tomorrow .
We are born utterly dependent ; from the moment we pop out , a social relationship becomes essential to living , namely the relationship with our mother ( as well as other family members ) .
Through that dependency — for physical survival and mental , social , physical , and sensory stimulation — we form connections with other people who become significant in shaping our view of ourselves and of the world around us .
That socialization process also structures the brain in important and enduring ways .
Through the complex processes of socialization , families can create in their members , and especially in their children , either susceptibility or resistance to that can last a lifetime .
The notion that depression can be spread strictly by social means as a social contagion is supported by a great deal of evidence .
For example , there is now neurological evidence that the apathy and withdrawal of mothers who have show up in the baby 's brain as an underdeveloped emotional region .
Such mothers are constricted in their emotional displays and do not engage with the baby the way nondepressed mothers do — talking in a singsong voice , playing games , stimulating the baby .
That deficit in the brain , along with other related risk factors , dramatically increases the likelihood that the child , too , will become depressed .
Epidemiologic evidence also points to the major role of contagion factors in depression .
The rate and nature of depression vary dramatically from culture to culture — unlike with , where roughly 1 percent of the population is affected no matter the culture sampled .
The World Health Organization recently declared depression the fourth leading cause of human disability and suffering and predicted that by the year 2020 it will be the second leading cause .
That 's not biology run amok ; it reflects the social spread of the kinds of cultural values and social conditions that give rise to depression .
Further evidence that moods spread through social interaction is found in the social lives of depressed people and their loved ones .
The depressed have far more difficulty than the nondepressed in their social experiences .
They have more family arguments and more marital arguments .
They have less relationship satisfaction and are significantly unhappier .
And they deplete everyone around them , spreading social pain and further corroding social relationships in an ongoing vicious cycle .
" It 's exhausting , " says Sarah Paul , 50 , manager of records for an insurance company in Seattle .
" My husband is depressed much of the time .
He can suck the joy out of things faster than anyone I 've known .
It 's hard on me because I feel like I can't talk about negative things very often ; he 's already so down .
It 's so frustrating I also deal with depression . "
Paul voices concern for their 6 - year - old daughter .
" I worry how she is going to turn out with two depressed parents .
I grew up that way , and I think that 's why I 'm with my husband .
When I was single , my number one desire was to find someone positive .
But I married someone negative because the discomfort is comfortable ; I know what to do .
I 'm concerned about what I 'm modeling ; I do n't want my daughter to continue the cycle . "
Long - term epidemiologic studies show that depression intensifies from one generation to the next .
Today 's parents represent the largest group of depression sufferers raising the fastest - growing group of depression sufferers .
We are on average four times more depressed than our parents and ten times more than our grandparents .
This is not just a reflection of greater awareness of the disorder .
Depression is a disorder with many facets .
There is a genetic vulnerability , although it is turning out to be smaller than many scientists thought .
The larger contribution comes from the ways we learn to regulate our own internal experience , which includes our explanatory style ( the meaning we attach to life experiences ) , our cognitive style ( how we think and use information ) , our coping style ( how we manage and adversity ) , our problem - solving style , and our relational style .
There is a near - perfect correlation between a parent 's explanatory style and a child's .
Every time a child asks , " Why , Mommy ? " or " Why , Daddy ? " the explanation provided invariably embodies a particular style of thinking and attributions of causality .
Each question is a vehicle for the transmission of thinking that interprets events in a way that is congruent with external reality or that reflects more subjective or hyperemotional responses .
" Why did n't Uncle Bob come to the picnic , Mom ? "
There 's a world of difference between " He must be mad at me " and " I do n't know , the next time we talk to Uncle Bob let 's ask him . "
There are also the kinds of attributions that reflect a permanently negative perspective : " Mom , I tried to do this and could n't , would you help me do it ? "
" No , you 'll never be able to do it , it 's too hard . "
Sarah Paul remembers not even being able to ask " why " in her family .
" It was regarded as implicit criticism of the way things were being done . "
One result , she says , is growing up unable to see other options beyond her first ( negative ) reaction to the situation she faced .
" I did n't know there were other ways to be .
I was locked into seeing the world one way . "
Depressed people often globally assume things are out of their control , which fuels their sense of helplessness and hopelessness .
Consider the kind of talk that takes place at the dinner table , an important node in the social transmission of depression .
When asked how your day was , if you say " good " and leave it at that , you 're delivering a global response .
This overgeneral style of thinking supports depression because it leads people to say things like , " All I want is to be happy " or " All I want is to have a good relationship " ; they do n't know how to develop a specific , realistic strategy to be happy or to have a good relationship .
Anything that victimizes someone holds the potential to depress that person .
Others may victimize us if we let them , but what victimizes us the most is telling ourselves what we can't do , what we 're inept at , what we 're not good enough to do — all those things by which we limit and even devalue ourselves .
" My husband does n't see a loving god , " says Paul .
" His view is not exactly paranoid , but distrustful .
He does n't see a friendly world ; therefore he does n't get one .
He sees himself as a victim who has no choices .
He does n't feel like he has much power in his life .
He owns a small business he hates and feels trapped in it .
He has always had a dream of owning a movie theater .
But his sense of hopelessness always provides him with reasons why it would n't work .
So he never does anything to further his dream . "
" When I was little , I thought it was normal to have a mother who cried to herself on the floor of her room on a daily basis , " reports Katie West , a life coach in Portland , Maine , whose early experience inspired her work path .
" Only in college — in a course in children 's literature — did I learn the term ' depression ' and think , ' That 's what my mom has . ' "
Ultimately her mother was hospitalized and diagnosed with severe depression — a relief " because it had always been ignored and often passed off as my problem . "
Parental depression can be insidious ,
West notes , " because the depressive voice can masquerade as realism .
There 's lots of driving depression , and so there can be lots of protectiveness . "
Her mother , she recalls , would typically issue a discouraging " that 's not possible " to young Katie 's requests .
Although it may seem to , depression does n't usually strike out of the blue .
The average age at onset is in the mid-20s .
( Not long ago , it was mid-30s , another factor pointing to social contagion . )
But by the time a person becomes depressed , the risk factors have typically been in place for years .
Statistically , most who suffer from depression also suffer a coexisting , or , condition , the most common of which is some form of anxiety disorder .
However , the two conditions do not manifest at the same time ; anxiety precedes depression by years .
A child who is diagnosably at age 8 or 9 is at high risk for becoming a depressed adult , which , to the aware adult , presents an opportunity for preventive intervention .
Close examination is likely to reveal that such a child does not deal well with ambiguity because he or she sees danger in ambiguous situations ; the child has a negative interpretive style .
Studies show that such a pattern in interpreting experience is established early in life .
In one study , children 8 years old were asked how they would respond if they were out shopping with their mother in a crowded department store 30 miles from home and suddenly found themselves separated from their parent .
The anxious children generated scary scenarios of never seeing their parents again and being adopted into families of strangers .
But the nonanxious kids said they 'd simply go to the store manager and ask that an announcement be made on the public address system .
In short , free of inner emotional turmoil , they could focus on and think their way through to solving the problem .
Clearly , another avenue of depression contagion in families is the failure to teach children specific coping skills to manage adversity .
What 's more , exposure to interpretive styles that overgeneralize negative experience typically renders children hyperemotional in the face of difficulty and thus unable to solve any problem they are up against .
Parents can encourage children to be problem - solvers by good - naturedly asking them during various activities how they would handle contingencies that arise .
( " What do you think you might do if Billy does n't call you back ? " )
The idea is to anticipate not only what might go wrong but how to sensibly correct it .
Asking " What if ? " is a good habit to encourage for general mental health .
Depressed and anxious people are unable to think past the hazard , and then they panic .
A family environment of reflecting unrealistically high standards is another factor that greatly increases vulnerability to depression .
Imagine a child comes home with a 95 on a test and is sternly asked , " How come you missed 5 points ? "
Such interactions feed the destructive idea that you 're not good enough and no matter what you do , you 'll never be good enough .
Perfectionism creates a harsh internal environment , and it fails to teach people how to accept inevitable limitations .
Another important element of socialization that operates in families ( and other groups ) is whether emotions can be expressed or not , what kinds of emotions can be expressed , and to what degree .
Children learn quickly from the affective displays within a family or community what will be tolerated and what will not .
Many families , for example , prohibit expressions of and so teach their children to suppress the emotion .
Being devalued with no means of expression modeled , anger can too easily become explosive , a common theme in depressed relationships .
The havoc depression wreaks in the social milieu of families is not limited to what transpires in parent - child relationships .
It also affects the .
Depression influences how able intimate partners are to support each other and how much conflict there is in their relationship .
It affects the ability to solve problems as a couple and to deal effectively as partners with parenting issues and discipline .
It affects the sexual relationship and how much closeness there is between partners .
And it affects their with others .
At the very least , depression is an extra stressor that partners have to deal with in a relationship .
No less than 50 percent of the depressed who are married ( or have an intimate partner ) experience relationship distress as a direct consequence of the depression in one or both partners .
And of the people who present for , there 's a 50 percent chance that at least one of the partners has diagnosable depression .
Many divorces occur directly as a result of undiagnosed depression .
If I 'm depressed and I have an attributional style that leads me to blame others , I 'll insist you 're the reason I 'm unhappy , and I 've got to get away from you .
But you 're not the problem ; my depression is really the problem .
When a husband is depressed , the wife is more likely to blame herself for his unhappiness and their marital troubles .
But when the wife is depressed , her husband is apt to think she 's the source of their problems .
If victimization is a recipe for depression , the way many people victimize themselves is by getting into destructive relationships or not knowing how to establish and maintain good relationships .
They do n't know how to set and keep clear boundaries about each other 's emotions or how to deal with each other in respectful ways when the going gets tough .
They do n't know how to skillfully negotiate conflicts or self - correct when things go wrong .
What once felt like a happy relationship becomes a source of disappointment , distress , pain , rejection , and .
Unfortunately , depression robs people of the ability to recognize others as sources of comfort .
And indeed , depression spreads socially in yet another way :
The depressed drain others and make it difficult for even the best - intentioned to be around them .
They engage in patterns of behavior such as constant complaining or excessive reassurance - seeking , as in frequently asking , " Am I OK ? "
That gets really old really fast .
Sadly , depression encourages those in its grip to isolate themselves socially .
It is part of the pervasive negativity of depression that they restrict themselves from the things that could make them feel good .
Your spouse says , let 's go to a movie or out to eat or over to see the Smiths ; you say , no , I 'm too depressed .
The depressed make their world smaller and smaller until the depression becomes the centerpiece of their life .
Building regular opportunities for fun as well as personal growth into your life can make a huge difference in your mood .
Everybody is vulnerable to depression to some degree .
As long as you are capable of having a mood , you 're capable of having a mood issue .
You need to assume responsibility for managing your moods the same way you manage your physical body .
It 's an ongoing task , much like managing your checking account or your child ; you can't make a deposit once and be done with money .
You can't discipline your kid once and be done with parenting .
As you learn your vulnerabilities in thinking and behavioral style , you can make good decisions on how to manage your mood and how to operate preventively .
She is " now happily married to a non-depressed guy and , unlike my parents , we are not feeling trapped in our lives .
On the contrary , we are selling our home so we can semi-retire ( at age 50 ) to live in our RV . "
Orion and her husband already took a year off to travel the country in their custom - outfitted bus .
She has written a book about the experience , Queen of the Road , and spends time every week talking to book clubs all over the country .
" It 's fun , interesting , and different for me , because it takes me away from what I 'm familiar with in my upbringing .
My dad is rather antisocial ; he does not like to go out or talk to people , which I 'm sure only adds to his feeling depressed .
I was a pretty , quiet kid , so ' meeting ' all these people is more reinforcement that I 'm doing things differently and inoculating myself . "
Katie
West , equally inspired by her experience growing up , has also found a way of doing things differently .
She describes herself as not just a life coach but a levity coach .
" I target areas where people need .
I 've come to see that the way in life is not through — it 's up .
My job is to make people feel more buoyant , more hopeful . "
It is possible to make people less susceptible to depression by teaching children social and cognitive skills .
But there 's growing evidence that social skills are deteriorating and that people are less available and less deliberate about building quality relationships .
Studies show that young people are becoming more impulsive , more aggressive , more , more self - absorbed .
The more self - absorbed people are , the more negative feedback they absorb from others , the worse they feel , and the less skilled they are in building relationships .
Despite the huge role that social factors play in depression , the disorder tends to be addressed only one - dimensionally — physiologically , with . , now the most widely prescribed drugs in America , may be part of the solution , but they are not the whole solution .
No type or amount of medication will build you a support network or make you more socially skilled .
Good relationships are essential to establishing , maintaining , and restoring mental health .
Unless we recognize and address the critical role of social factors in depression , we will never get the disorder to release its stranglehold on us .

Richard Dawkins did n’t mention it during his visit to New Zealand , but a long - running experiment that most clearly demonstrates how evolution works celebrated a major milestone last month .
Since 1988 , at his lab at Michigan State University in East Lansing , Michigan , evolutionary biologist Richard Lenski has been running an ongoing experiment that demonstrates on a small scale how genetic mutations and natural selection work over successive generations – giving clues as to how us humans have evolved .
The so - called E. coli long - term evolution experiment focuses on 12 beakers containing bacteria grown from one original E. coli bacterium and that have been carefully nurtured for around 22 years .
The idea is that because bacteria reproduce so quickly , changes over thousands of generations of bacteria could be observed in a relatively short period of time .
Dawkins says the reason people struggle to get their heads around evolution is because , for species of large animals like mammals , evolution happens incredibly slowly – noticeable changes take millions of years to manifest themselves .
Here then was an opportunity to watch evolution in fast - forward .
The 12 beakers of bacteria are fed daily with glucose to nurture the populations of bacteria .
This is a ritual that has been carried out since day one and last month , on February 14th , the 50,000 generation of bacteria developed in the beakers .
Through the years , Lenski has been able to observe how these separated populations that came from the same source have grown – and in the process made some startling discoveries .
Many of the populations developed in the same way as you would expect with the uniform environment and diet .
All of the populations grew faster with successive generations until around the 20,000th generation when growth levelled off at 70 per cent faster than the original strain .
But along the way , as is the nature of evolution , the bacteria underwent numerous genetic mutations – hundreds of millions of these .
Only a tiny number of them fixed in the populations and only 10 – 20 were identified as having positive effects on the populations .
Then Lenski ’s team discovered something very unusual , as New Scientist explains in this 2008 article to mark the 20th year of the experiment :
Mostly , the patterns Lenski saw were similar in each separate population .
All 12 evolved larger cells , for example , as well as faster growth rates on the glucose they were fed , and lower peak population densities .
“ But sometime around the 31,500th generation , something dramatic happened in just one of the populations – the bacteria suddenly acquired the ability to metabolise citrate , a second nutrient in their culture medium that E. coli normally cannot use .
“ Indeed , the inability to use citrate is one of the traits by which bacteriologists distinguish E. coli from other species .
The citrate - using mutants increased in population size and diversity . ”
Dawkins in his speech last week described genetic mutation as an incredibly random incident that if successful for the organism , is followed by a fairly predictable path of evolution .
But was the ability to metabolise citrate the result of one random genetic mutation ?
New Scientist continues :
By this time , Lenski calculated , enough bacterial cells had lived and died that all simple mutations must already have occurred several times over .
That meant the “ citrate - plus ” trait must have been something special – either it was a single mutation of an unusually improbable sort , a rare chromosome inversion , say , or else gaining the ability to use citrate required the accumulation of several mutations in sequence .
Lenski had been freezing samples of the bacteria every 500th generation from the very beginning , so he was able to go back through the generations , revive the frozen bacteria and see if they would evolve as the same citrate - gobbling mutants .
He was able to use genetic markers to show the experiments were n’t subject to contamination .
Lenski found that cloned populations from those frozen samples were able to develop the ability to use citrate , put only in bacteria drawn from populations 20,000 generations old or greater and only very rarely ( around once per trillion cells ) .
Some type of mutation must have happened around generation 20,000 the researchers suggest , that set the path for evolution that would be triggered with subsequent mutation around generation 31,000 – 31,500 .
Wikipedia sums it up best :
The authors interpret these results as indicating that the evolution of citrate utilization in this one population depended on an earlier , perhaps non-adaptive potentiating mutation that had the effect of increasing the rate of mutation to citrate utilization to an accessible level ( with the data they present further suggesting that citrate utilization required at least two mutations subsequent to this potentiating mutation ) .
More generally the authors suggest that these results indicate ( following the argument of Stephen Jay Gould ) “ that historical contingency can have a profound and lasting impact ” on the course of evolution . [ 4 ] ”
Absolutely staggering stuff and an experiment that is yet to be mined for still more gems of knowledge about evolution .
Who knows what the future holds for those generations of bacteria , multiplying , mutating and evolving in their own little lifecycle in that lab in Michigan …
Her baby will soon be due , so Modesta Toribio has to grudgingly admit she may not soon make her current career goal 
New York ’s supposedly mandatory $ 7.25 minimum wage  that she has been routinely denied for the past five years .
She inched her salary up to $ 6.60 an hour from the starting $ 5 at a cut-rate Brooklyn clothing store mainly by pestering her bosses .
Ms. Toribio has a brassy knack for that , but she has learned it takes a lot to best scheming employers .
Academic studies estimate that unscrupulous employers in New York City keep an extra billion dollars a year by defying New York State ’s weak labor law and cheating timorous and ill - informed immigrant workers .
Ms. Toribio was both when she arrived from the Dominican Republic 10 years ago .
But she evolved into a word - of - mouth investigator and organizer for the Make the Road New York community group .
The organization has successfully worked with committed state inspectors to wring wage - theft judgments against scores of employers  $ 28,000 for a gouged fruit - stand peddler , $ 70,000 for 99 - cent store workers , $ 400,000 from moguls squeezing the payroll at a sneaker chain .
New York needs a strong labor law like Arizona ’s .
Arizona is rightly notorious for its abusive anti-immigrant law .
But its labor law seriously penalizes employers who retaliate against outspoken workers , and it provides confidentiality for whistleblowers and faster , bigger damages for employers who ignore wage - theft judgments .
A bill to toughen New York ’s law awaits action by the Legislature , which is in its closing days , when the good and the ugly elbow for attention .
ORANGE COUNTY , Fla . --
Speeding and aggressive drivers in Orange County needed more than the luck of the Irish to avoid a traffic citation on Thursday .
An Orange County sheriff 's deputy dressed as a leprechaun and equipped with a laser speed - detection gun targeted speeding and reckless motorists in the area of University Boulevard and state Road 417 .
The " leprechaun " also held a sign reading , " Watch your speed or it will cost you your pot of gold .
" Motorcycle units stopped violators and issued the traffic citations after being informed by the " leprechaun " via radio .
Officials said they issued about a ticket per minute .
A lot of the drivers complained about the method , calling it entrapment " I think that 's just ridiculous , " a deputy said .
" The ( leprechaun ) did n't force anybody to speed .
" Orange County sheriff 's deputies said the laser gun enabled the on -duty " leprechaun " to clock a vehicle long before the driver would see him .
In the past , Orange County sheriff 's deputies have targeted speeding motorists while dressed as an elf , the Grinch and a man waiting for a bus .
" We do this sort of thing a lot on holidays , " Orange County sheriff 's spokesman Jim Solomons said .
Since it launched in 2005 , YouTube has become one of the few Internet properties that ’s much more than a domain name .
Like Google , Facebook , Wikipedia , and Twitter , YouTube has become an essential service of the Internet .
It ’s a utility , a social network , a search engine , a source of online storage , and an endless source of consternation for content owners .
Some quick numbers :
YouTube now gets 2 billion views per day , 30 % of which come from the U.S.
The three most popular videos are Lady Gaga ’s “ Bad Romance , ” at 196 million views and change , with “ Charlie bit my finger ” and “ The Evolution of Dance ” following behind at 186 million and 143 million , respectively .
About 24 hours of video are uploaded every minute these days , and it ’d take 1,700 years to watch all the video currently available .
The challenges YouTube faces in the future are both familiar and foreign .
How to make money , for one thing , a challenge the site has not yet overcome ( that ’s about the nicest way I could possibly say that –it ’s YouTube ’s birthday , after all , and I do n’t want to be rude ) .
How to provide mainstream , for - profit content is another challenge , one that ’s the subject of constant work , from Vevo to the new movie rental service .
Then there ’s the challenge of the “ third screen . ”
YouTube has already conquered the first two ; the computer was the first , and fell easily enough , while the mobile device was beaten thanks to the iPhone and YouTube ’s sister product , Android .
But the TV , the third screen , has never successfully been defeated by a computer product , including Boxee , Apple TV , and Windows Media Center .
According to the New York Times , Google will be announcing more details on their attempt at the I/O conference this week .
For their part , YouTube is celebrating the milestone with a special commemorative site , featuring guest curators offering their favorite video picks ( among the curators are Conan O’Brien , Pedro Almodovar , and LonelyGirl15 ) .
Conan ’s take ?
Our nation ’s obsession with YouTube is “ probably why our country ’s economy is in the toilet , ” because we ’re all “ watching monkeys in propeller hats flush themselves down a toilet ” ( parallel ! ) .

In what can only be described as a laughable piece of propaganda , CNN / Fortune is reporting the recently caught Russian spies are actually " Goldbugs " who may be secretly plotting to " destroy the value of the American dollar . "
That the US dollar has been collapsing in value for the last 100 years due to the Federal Reserve 's inflationary policies is somehow conveniently missed .
Instead , Russia is gearing up some Soviet style espionage plot to destroy the dollar by instituting a " new global currency " backed by gold .
Again , that the Russian government itself benefits heavily from having its own inflationary fiat central bank is also somehow conveniently missed .
What is not missed is the basic message : People who own gold are on the side of the enemies plotting to bring down the value of our dollar !
From Russian ' spies , ' goldbugs and the struggling dollar :
When federal officials arrested 11 alleged Russian spies yesterday , it seemed natural that the accused agents would be interested in the CIA leadership , the Obama administration and Afghanistan .
But who knew that they were goldbugs ?
James G. Rickards , senior director for market intelligence at Omnis , pointed us to the fact that the FBI complaint mentions that the global gold market was one of the key sources of interest of the Russian Federation and its intelligence agency , SVR .
" On a number of occasions , the SVR specifically indicated that information collected and conveyed by the New Jersey conspirators was especially valuable .
Thus , for example , during the summer and fall of 2009 , Cynthia Murphy , the defendant , using contacts she had met in New York , conveyed a number of reports to [ Moscow ]
Center about prospects for the global gold market . "
[...]
Murphy 's alleged tips about the gold market must have been quite powerful .
It 's impossible to tell how they influenced Russian economic policy or thinking , but we can look at some of Russia 's moves at the time and notice some striking trends that show that Russia dramatically reversed its stance on gold in late 2009 .
Before October 2009 , Russia had been planning to sell nearly 25 tons of gold into the market .
In November 2009 , however , one month after Murphy 's alleged report to the SVR about gold , Russia started stocking up on the precious metal .
In November 2009 , Russia 's central bank bought more than $ 1 billion of gold from the foreign exchange market in order to better control the price of the ruble , central bank deputy chairman Alexey Ulyukayev told Reuters at the time .
Russia also said at the time that it might buy gold from the state repository , Gokhran .
Critics at the time noted that Russia 's move into gold could be interpreted as a manifestation of disappointment with the U.S. dollar and U.S. economic policy under Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke ; partly , this was because , as Russia was buying gold it also stopped buying U.S. agency mortgage bonds , the Fannie and Freddie bonds that packed over half of the Fed 's balance sheet .
Of course , it 's difficult to impute this shift solely to Russia ( or Murphy 's market tips ) .
Yes , as of this year , the Russian central bank was still buying gold , loading up on 26.6 tons in the most recent quarter , bringing its holdings to over 668 tons .
But Russia is hardly an outlier .
The central banks of several countries have been loading up on the precious metal , including China , Venezuela and India , which on its own bought 200 tons in November 2009 .
The problem with all the gold buying , of course , is that it often reads as a global central bank reproach to several currencies , but particularly toward our troubled U.S. dollar .
As the World Gold Council wrote in a February report on gold , currencies and the money supply , " gold exhibits a strong negative correlation to the dollar . "
This is where central bank currency moves could get sinister .
Rickards wrote a paper , " Economics and Financial Attacks , " and created an imaginary Pentagon war game describing a crisis situation in which Russia used its gold reserves to create a new global currency and destroy the value of the American dollar .
In the May 2009 paper , Rickards suggested that U.S. intelligence agencies would do well to track the gold reserves of other countries -- just in case .
This story is absolutely fascinating for several reasons .
First , everyone who is anyone owns gold and knows it 's a much better investment than the fiat dollar .
It involves no " espionage plots " to realize the value of the dollar is going to keep going down , as it's done for almost 100 years straight , as a result of the government printing up record amounts of money .
It 's simple math , putting more currency in circulation devalues the value of the currency already in existence .
No plot required , no espionage or " contacts in New York " needed .
All you need is common sense and basic math .
That this is glossed over as though it's not the * real * reason for Russia 's actions should tell you all you need to know .
Second , what is so significant about this report is it 's scapegoating Russia ( or China if you read the full report ( .pdf ) ) for the practically inevitable demise of the US dollar .
The demise for which the Federal Reserve is solely to blame .
Not only does this serve to keep the Federal Reserve from facing the repercussions of its inflationary policies , but it serves to inflame the American people into thinking Russia and China are secretly plotting to destroy us , it sets the stage for World War Three .
In the past , similar propaganda was put out saying how North Korea was counterfeiting masses of US dollars .
No conclusive proof was ever shown and yet similarly the news at the time tried to suggest any inflation the US was experiencing , or was going to experience , may be due to North Korea !
That the Federal Reserve can print endless reams of counterfeit money , and does every single day , is considered completely irrelevant .
The value of the dollar is going to collapse thanks to the policies of the Federal Reserve , a gold standard or quasi - gold standard is extremely likely to make a comeback after the markets finally adjust , already the price of gold skyrocketing to highs of $ 1265 , from just $ 200 or so a decade ago , shows this is taking place .
The trend is all but guaranteed to continue as the Federal Reserve has shown no indication it at all seeks to reverse its policies and skyrocket interest rates to shore up the dollar .
Instead , everything they 're doing indicates they 're going to print themselves into oblivion .
It 's clear with articles like this one they are indeed going to continue as they are , yet they will attempt to scapegoat Russia or China when hyperinflation finally kicks in .
Additionally , they will act as though gold is some evil communist subversive force seeking to bring America down .
Look for more stories like this to come in the future .
If people actually believe this propaganda we are in for a wild ride .

Image caption The Best Party promised Reykjavik voters a new polar bear
A party that calls itself " the Best " has won local elections in the Icelandic capital , Reykjavik .
The Best Party , founded by comedian Jon Gnarr , secured 34.7 % of the vote , ahead of the Independence Party 's 33.6 % .
Its campaign video featured candidates singing to the tune of Tina Turner 's " Simply The Best " .
Key pledges included " sustainable transparency " , free towels at all swimming pools and a new polar bear for the city zoo .
The party also called for a Disneyland at the airport and a " drug - free parliament " by 2020 .
As well as specific pledges , its video promised change , a " bright future " and suggested that it was time for a " clean out " .
The Best Party was only established six months ago .
Its victory means it will hold six seats on the 15 - member city council .
Commentators suggest it has benefited from voters ' loss of trust in government and the establishment in the wake of the country 's banking collapse in 2008 .
According to Iceland Review Online , several local races saw parties that were in power ousted in the polls .

Bebo speak :
Teenagers create secret language to keep parents and bosses in the dark
Teenagers on social networking site Bebo have created a secret language to stop adults knowing what they are up to , researchers say .
Youngsters are using slang words to keep parents and employers in the dark about their social activities such as partying and drinking .
Instead of writing they are drunk , teens post ' Getting MWI ' - or mad with it .
Teenagers on social networking site Bebo have created a secret language to stop adults knowing what they are up to ( posed by model )
Being in a relationship is known as ' taken ' or ' Ownageeee ' , and ' Ridneck ' , a corruption of redneck , means to feel embarrassed .
Meanwhile , girls posting ' Legal ' are indicating that they are above 16 and legally allowed to have sex .
Lisa Whittaker , a postgraduate student at the University of Stirling , who studied teens aged 16 - 18 in Scotland , said the slang had been created to keep their activities private , and cited the example of one young girl who was sacked after bosses found pictures of her drinking on the website .
She said : ' Young people often distort the languages they use by making the pages difficult for those unfamiliar with the distortions and colloquialisms .
' The language used on Bebo seems to go beyond abbreviations that are commonly used in text messaging , such as removing all the vowels .
BEBO SPEAK Getting MWI : Getting mad with it ( mwi ) means getting very drunk , also known as ' steaming '
Ppl : People Kwl : Cool Lyk : Like Taken and Ownageeee :
To be strongly attached to someone Legal : Commonly used by girls to make it clear that they are of legal age to have sex Ridneck : Pronounced redneck and is used to describe embarrassment - in that it will cause them to have a red neck .
Down for Whatever : Bebo requires people to state their relationship status .
Young people can choose from : Single , Seeing Someone ,
In a Relationship , Engaged , Married , It 's Complicated , and ' Down for Whatever '
' This is not just bad spelling , which would suggest literacy issues , but a deliberate attempt to creatively misspell words .
' The creation and use of their own social language may be a deliberate attempt to keep adults from understanding what is written on the page .
' By doing this they are able to communicate with their in - group and conceal the content from the out - group .
This further adds to their online identity . '
She said that one reason for encoding their messages was to keep adults in the dark about their drinking or smoking .
One teen she questioned , known as Kelly , was fired when her employer found pictures of her drinking on the website .
Ms Whittaker said : ' Kelly feels very bitter about losing her job over the content of her Bebo page .
' When I ask her to tell me about it she uses the word " judge " , which indicates that she feels victimised by her ex-employers .
' This issue here surrounds the fact that Kelly likes to drink at the weekends , even though she is still under the legal age .
' She posted videos of herself drunk on her Bebo page , which led her employers to sack her .
' Kelly feels her personal life is separate from her working life , which may be the case , but by posting videos online her Bebo page has given her employer an insight into behaviour which may have otherwise remained private .
' Young people give each other recognition for going to college and having a job but also engaging in social activities such as drinking and smoking .
' Others may see this as a divergence , for example , a young person is labelled a delinquent for drinking alcohol while underage .
' However , these young people are able to recognise each other for both socially desirable and undesirable behaviours . '
She went on : ' Social networking sites like Bebo provide young people with an opportunity to gain informal positive recognition from their peer group .
' The total number of friends you are connected with indicates your popularity .
' However , in terms of self - presentation and recognition this is not a straightforward process .
' For young people , a low number of friends , for example , less than 500 , is a sign that you are not very popular or very well - liked .
' By contrast , having too many friends can also be detrimental to your self - image as you appear desperate .
' The number of friends you have on Bebo must be a carefully monitored .
' It seems young people are creatively developing their internet literacy to keep certain information private from unwanted and unintended audiences while simultaneously gaining recognition and boosting their self - esteem through online interactions with their peers . '
She is due to present her research at a seminar at the Wales Institute of Social & Economic Research , Data and Methods in Cardiff tomorrow .
Oracle talked about Java 7 at the first stop of the Java Road Trip .
The main speaker was Brian Goetz , author of Java Concurrency In Practice .
Despite the disclaimer that everything including syntax is subject to change , the talk was pretty interesting .
Here are my notes .
( this was largely written on my iPad ; please excuse any typos )
Modularity
The JRE download is 13 mb , but most code does n’t get run by ordinary apps
The monolithic jdk makes new releases of platform take longer to roll out
Modularizing apps helps with jar hell and finding out at runtime that something is missing / wrong
Will provide mechanism for apps to express dependencies in way useful to both humans and tools
Based on concepts in Maven and OSGI
Current draft has : Module - info . java defining module and version number along with what module and versions or ranges you depend on
Classpath will be legacy mode , preferred mode will be to turn your app into a module
Multi lingual support
JVM is a managed code environment
Scala is a lot like java , but other dynamic languages ( like Ruby ) run slower because need to rely on reflection or code generation .
JVM is more like Smalltalk than like Java , but some places is tied to Java
Da Vinci machine project is targeted to adding features to better support dynamic languages .
In particular dynamic method linkage which is being able to select version of method based on type of arguments
Invokedynamic vs invokevirtual for method selection and linking .
Once calls stabilize , do n’t look up in vm anymore , then inlines and is as fast as in java .
This is a goal , need to get there .
Productivity
Project coin – add half a dozen small language changes to simplify everyday tasks .
Would be at level of enhanced for loop
Reduce boilerplate of generics with the the diamond operator ( not really an operator ) Map < String , String > map = new HashMap <>( ) ;
Better numerical literals to make long numbers more readable .
Similarly for binary ( long string of 0’s and 1’s ) long cc= 123_5678_567 ; Collection literals – declare inline like we do with arrays and hard coded data .
More declarative .
Like associative array in Perl , but may not go that far Automatically close resources in try / catch .
Better idiom try ( InputStream in = createInputStream ( ) ) { // code that reads in from stream goes here } // compiler will call close for you here
Performance
Goal : facilitate scalability across multiple cores
Fork join extend recursive action to split into subtasks and join to get answer .
Will be added to concurrency utilities .
Do n’t have to tell it how many cores you have
ParallelIntArray class automates common operations filter , map and reduce so can say what want to do declaratively
Closures
Saving the best for last .
Like anonymous inner classes but without boilerplate of anonymous inner classes
Still debating syntax
Still debating whether return type should be declared
Still discussing how to extend interfaces ( will be used to add closures for Collections ) .
Options are “ static extension methods ” like in C# where you statically “ pretend there were these methods are on the class and call the static methods instead . ”
Also discussing ” virtual extension methods . ”
Either way the closures project will finally address the issue of api evolution

OK , I know the tournament has been award to Brazil , and if they made their decisions based on qualify of play then nobody would doubt them .
However given this weeks announcement by FIFA that Brazil is far behind :
We know that the last couple years have been tough on economies around the globe and Brazil is no different , and like South Africa which will spend billions in hope of finding a way to long term make a profit , they will fail and money that should have been spend to create long term jobs , schools , hospitals , and things to improve the overall standard of living will be long gone .
I love that FIFA is trying to allow all the nations of the world take part in hosting the games , but anyone who thinks putting on these spectacular events is profitable is n't paying close attention .
Host countries and cities do get a huge boost from PR that will sometimes create tourism revenue in the future , but that is far from a guarantee .
More after the jump :
So if FIFA really wants to do the sport justice , then use nations that do n't have to spend billions on new stadiums and leverage what already exists .
This was done in Germany , could easily be done in the US , UK , and many other nations .
One only has to look at the ticket sales for the 2010 World Cup :
Briefing MPs , Local Organising Committee CFO Farouk Seedat said 107 576 tickets for the event had been sold to the general public in the United States .
The second - highest number of sales was in the United Kingdom ( 63 835 ) followed by Germany ( 29 733 ) and Australia ( 26 488 ) .
By comparison , public ticket sales in South Africa 's " top two " neighbouring countries , Mozambique and Botswana , were 1 474 and 1 257 respectively .
It is clear that despite having little shot at winning the World Cup , we did n't even make it out of our group 4 years ago that in the United States there is both the desire and the means to support the World Cup .
Now I know that there are many out there ( including one of my fellow SB Nation bloggers ) who is n't worried and points to all the chaos that everyone thought about South Africa and how things now seem to be right on track .
He has a point about how many in the " West " want things done months , years in advance for events like this , while some other cultures are fine wrapping up the details a couple weeks before .
He is right , very right .
I do however think that the issues of social responsibility of nations spending money that many do n't have on events like the Olympics , the World Cup , and other huge events is a very risky thing .
One has to ask could the money be better spent ?
Would n't it seem to be the " responsible " thing do to in a world that has some serious economic issues to not impose this type of spending and often debt on others when there are nations who can host the World Cup without impacting national debt levels ?
I think so , I think that the prestige factor is one thing , and in good times ( like when the South Africa decision was made ) if a nation wants to take that risk , then it should be considered but when we see Brazil asking the IMF for funds anytime in the next few years , as they continue to ask for aid money from " the West " and the UN , one has to really question if hosting the World Cup was the best thing for the people of Brazil .
I do n't believe so , I believe that moving the 2014 World Cup makes sense and is something that should be considered .
OFF MY SOAPBOX
Sorry , men ARE more brainy than women ( and more stupid too ! )
It 's a simple scientific fact , says one of Britain 's top dons
Baroness Susan Greenfield is one of Britain 's best - known female scientists ; she 's a professor of neurophysiology at the University of Oxford , a former director of the Royal Institution and an accomplished writer and broadcaster on scientific matters .
So when she very publicly bemoans the lack of women reaching the higher echelons of the scientific establishment , people tend to sit up and take notice .
In a newspaper article last month , she expressed her concern that only ten per cent of science professors in this country are women .
Albert Einstein :
Was he the perfect example of a male scientist being more intelligent than a female colleague ?
Her comments struck a chord , attracting a host of comments agreeing that women scientists were generally getting a raw deal .
This raises an important and controversial question .
Is there really a glass ceiling holding back the careers of talented female scientists ?
Have decades of anti-sexual discrimination legislation really counted for nothing in the laboratories of Britain ?
Or might there be another explanation for why we find such a marked shortage of women , not just in the highest levels of science but in big business , the professions , and politics , too ?
It is my contention - based on a lifetime of academic research - that there is an explanation and I advance it all too aware of the howls of feminist outrage I am about to unleash .
So , here goes : one of the main reasons why there are not more female science professors or chief executives or Cabinet ministers is that , on average , men are more intelligent than women .
Nor do the shocks to the noisy advocates of equal opportunities stop there , I 'm afraid .
Baroness Susan Greenfield
For not only is the average man more intelligent than the average woman but also a clear and rather startling imbalance emerges between the sexes at the high levels of intelligence that the most demanding jobs require .
For instance , at the near - genius level ( an IQ of 145 ) , brilliant men outnumber brilliant women by 8 to one .
That 's statistics , not sexism .
In this context , Professor Greenfield 's indignation that only one in ten science professors is female does n't seem all that bad .
It also goes some way to explaining why , in almost 110 years of Nobel Prize history , only two women have ever won the Prize for physics , only four have won the Prize for chemistry and why no women at all have ever won the coveted Fields Medal for mathematics in eight decades of trying .
In recent years , the forces of political correctness have made the reporting of this sort of statistic virtually impossible .
Yet as a psychologist who has dedicated his career to the study of intelligence - and , in particular , to how it differs between the sexes - I can tell you that in my academic circles these IQ figures are barely disputed .
Ever since the Frenchman Alfred Binet devised the first intelligence test in 1905 , study after study has confirmed the same result .
When it comes to IQ , men and women - at least once they 've gained adulthood - simply are not equal .
Boys and girls may start out with the same IQ but by 16 or so boys are starting to inch ahead .
The ever - growing success of girls at GCSE , A - level and now at university would seem to refute this - but the blame lies with our exam system , with its emphasis on coursework , which rewards diligence more than it does intelligence .
The undeniable , easily measurable fact remains that , by the time both sexes reach 21 , men , on average , score five IQ points higher than women .
Before discussing how and why this might be , I ought to explain what psychologists mean by intelligence .
It 's made up of a range of cognitive abilities that include reasoning , problem - solving , spatial ability , general knowledge and memory .
In all of these , men outperform women - although women hold their own when it comes to verbal reasoning and have a definite edge in foreign language skills and spelling .
We must look to the field of evolutionary psychology for an explanation of why men have emerged as the more intelligent sex .
As the hunter part of a hunter - gatherer society , men were faced with complex , life - threatening problems that needed solving on a daily basis .
For example , how to kill that elusive deer ?
The hunters that used all their mental capabilities to come up with the answers , successfully killing animals day after day , were clearly the most intelligent .
They were the high - status males of their day and - provocative as it is to say so - must have possessed far sharper minds than those of women engaged in the relatively simple tasks of gathering berries and raising children .
The difference in intelligence between boys and girls starts to emerge at school
These high - status males would also have been the most eligible mates , and it would be their genes - chief among which would be those controlling male brain size - that would be passed on to the next generation .
The result is that men today still have physically bigger brains than women , even after adjustments for their different - body size .
Might this underpin the five - point difference in IQ between the sexes ?
Of course , in normal daily life , there 's not much real difference between a man with an IQ of 105 and a woman with an IQ of
100 .
The real difference only emerges as we rise up the IQ scale to the sort of level that the really top jobs require and as we drop lower down the scale - because men , as it turns out , have a much wider range of intelligence than women .
As a result , there are not only far more men with high IQs than there are women , but there are also , as I 'm sure any woman would tell you , far more stupid men around than there are stupid women .
There is , as yet , no simple or , indeed , totally convincing explanation as to why this is , but while the abundance of stupid men has always caused social problems , it is the relative abundance of highly intelligent men that has caused problems for several generations of emancipated , liberated , ambitious women .
As a result , when these women get close to the top , they are simply out - numbered by highly intelligent and often ruthlessly ambitious men .
As our hunter - gatherer example has already suggested , men and women have also evolved different kinds of intelligence .
The demands of hunting - devising tactics and strategies , anticipating likely outcomes - favoured the development of reasoning , together with mathematical and spatial abilities , which is why , thousands of years later , men continue to be overrepresented in fields such as maths and physics .
However , when it comes to verbal intelligence , women match men because , in our hunter - gatherer past , women needed verbal abilities to negotiate their relationships with both men and women and to teach and socialise their children .
This explains why they are every bit as successful as men at writing novels , say , or even newspaper columns .
Their superior foreign language skills explain why if you walk into a university language lecture theatre , you wo n't find many men .
But there 's another reason why , at the very highest and most demanding of levels in society , men have a natural advantage - and it's one we 've seen in countless natural history TV documentaries .
Take , for example , the case of rutting stags or fighting chimps and you get the generally aggressive idea .
Thanks to high levels of the male sex hormone testosterone , men are far more competitive and motivated for success than women .
For a man - at least as far as his hormone system is concerned - succeeding , competing and beating his rivals is very much still a matter of life and death .
Consequently , ambitious , high - achieving men typically work harder , compete more aggressively and become totally immersed in their careers , while even the most high - achieving women will often admit to finding themselves distracted by their genetically preconditioned aptitude for nurture and support .
For them , it is often a question of what to get for supper , or whether the children have got clean shirts for school .
These are small distractions , admittedly , but at the very highest level they have an effect .
As an academic , it 's my job to tell the truth , to explain the scientific evidence before us , irrespective of how unfashionable my conclusions are .
Big ideas such as Galileo 's theory that Earth revolved around the Sun , rather than vice versa , or Darwin 's theory of evolution , met with vociferous opposition when first advanced .
And , certainly , the ideas I 've laid out here have already got some highly respected people into very serious trouble .
Economist Lawrence Summers was forced to resign after saying men are better than women at certain jobs
In 2005 , the distinguished economist Lawrence Summers was forced to resign as President of Harvard University after expressing the view , at a seminar on diversity in the academic workplace , that in some fields the innate cognitive differences between the sexes might make the search for a perfect 50:50 gender balance impossible .
He did n't accept that the lack of women at senior level was all due to glass ceilings , anti-social hours or lack of opportunity and encouragement .
Instead , he went with what the science is clearly telling us - that at the really top level in maths and science , when we 're not dealing with average intelligence but near genius , there are simply more men around who can do the job .
For that simple statement of truth , he was eventually forced out of his post .
I take some comfort from the fact that Lawrence Summers ' hormonally - driven male competitive instincts kicked in and he has now bounced back to become a senior economic adviser to President Obama .
But what if he and I are right - as I am 100 per cent convinced we are ?
If men are innately better at certain subjects than women , then why should society struggle so hard - and so expensively - to try to engineer a perfect balance between the sexes ?
By all means , take steps to ensure that boys and girls get the same opportunities in education , but let 's also accept that those same opportunities will not produce the same outcomes .
Men will always outnumber women in certain fields and vice versa .
My argument is n't based on crude chauvinist doctrine ( although I 'm quite sure my opponents will disagree ) but on decades of research , relatively simple statistics and an understanding of the law of averages .
Of course , just because men , on average , are more intelligent then women , does n't mean there are no individually brilliant women around .
If I 'm right , it does n't mean there will be no female professors of physics ; it just means we should accept that there will be fewer of them .
Nor does it mean that a woman will never win the Fields Medal for mathematics ; it just means that we live in a world where such an event is very , very unlikely .
I realise my views are unfashionable , just as I realise the juggernaut of sexual equality and political correctness will take an awful lot of stopping .
But I say to the social engineers who dream up ever - more - ingenious ways of getting more women into top positions ; do n't be surprised if you find your nobly motivated ambitions foundering on the immovable rock of human nature .

Many think steampunk is a fad that will flare up and burn itself out quickly , as most fads do .
If steampunk fans ’ willingness to permanently ink themselves with steampunk themed tattoos is any indication , the appeal of steampunk will be lasting a lot longer than expected .
From the simplest clockwork and gears , to complex depictions of Victorian era mecha , steampunk tattoos run the gamut from pretty decorations to mobile masterpieces .
Here are 9 of the most intricate and gorgeous examples of steampunk style body art :
( Images via nickbaxter , jockeyjournal , kungdesign )
The melding of technology with nature is a common theme in steampunk , as the dream of Victorian technology is to create a cleanly powered utopia much different from the sooty , chugging urban areas of the time .
There is no better way to display the melding of nature and machine than by displaying a gorgeous steampunk octopus , or the more symbolic lightbulb and skull pictured above .
Another popular design is the mechanical arm , where one can become part machine , at least , visually .
( Images via acemicaylak , fatmeatisgreasy )
Some people like to make themselves resemble machines in a more visually arresting manner , via the appearance of torn skin mistakenly revealing the clockwork components within .
The realism of these depictions can be stunningly three dimensional in appearance .
These tattoos are n’t for the faint of heart , as they tend to upset the squeamish viewer , and require countless hours under the needle .
Clocks are a major symbol of the steampunk genre because of their intricate , scientific nature , and the fact that they manage to overcome their fragility by managing to work hour after hour , day after day .
The endless variety of clock designs and their classy appearance allow one to express their aesthetic without shocking the casual observer .
( Images via brassgoggles , audramelissa , industrytattoo , livewodeadtime , steampunkfashion )
As the foundation piece for the steampunk aesthetic , cogs and gears are present in nearly every steampunk tattoo .
Some individuals would rather stick with the core of steampunk by creating complicated scenes filled entirely with intricate machine parts .
These are the purists .
The Rising Cost of Evil in a Hyperconnected World
My last few columns all concerned the growing potential of the network revolution for performing , far more vigorously , the functions of the regulatory state : exposing corporations and holding them publicly accountable for negligence , pollution , unsafe products , and maltreatment of workers .
I recently saw a phrase by Umair Hacque of Harvard Business Review that summed up the principle better than anything I ’ve seen : “ In a hyperconnected world , the costs of evil explode . ”
Given the prevailing industrial models over the past century and a half , the enormous capital outlays needed for production — not only plant and equipment for manufacturing , but the enormous price of a radio station , recording studio or state - of - the - art printing press — required large hierarchical organizations to govern the physical capital and the people working it .
And given the enormous transaction costs of monitoring their activities , it was commonly understood that a giant bureaucratic organization was needed to regulate such business firms .
The desktop computer and the Internet changed all this .
As Hacque argues , the first principle of a hyperconnected world is information : “ information flows much faster and more freely .
So it ’s less costly to ascertain who ’s really evil — and who ’s really good . ”
The second principle is discipline : “ Cheap information lays the foundations for more collective action .
It ’s less costly to punish those who are evil . ”
The implications of this are just starting to sink in for our corporate overlords .
We ’re barely in the beginning stages of a fundamental transformation in which corporate executives live with the reality constantly in the back of their mind that any particular cutting of corners on safety or customer service , any particular downsizing or speedup , any grinding of the boot into the faces of labor , will show up on WikiLeaks .
And then become the focus of a campaign of boycotts , picketing and letter - writing organized by some advocacy group like the Wal - Mart Workers ’ Association or EmployerNameSucks.com .
What ’s more , they ’re only beginning to learn that every attempt to suppress such campaigns with SLAPP lawsuits and punitive firing will come back to bite them in the tuchus in the form of the Streisand Efffect .
This last was named for Barbra Streisand ’s attempt to suppress online photos of her house — which itself became a news event that attracted tens of millions more eyeballs to the photos .
The McLibel case in Britain in the ’90s , in the earliest days of the Internet , was a dress rehearsal for the Streisand Effect .
McDonald ’s , still used to the comfortable old world in which people like us could n’t talk back , resorted to the tried - and - true tactic of a SLAPP lawsuit against a couple of obscure left - wing pamphleteers .
But the attempt at suppression itself became news , and caused the pamphleteers ’ bill of indictments against McDonald ’s to be read by scores of millions of people around the world .
Since then it ’s happened over and over .
It happened when Diebold attempted to suppress publication of internal corporate emails about its easily - compromising voting machines , and found out what it was like to play whack - a- mole with a thousand mirror sites .
It happened when the movie industry attempted to prosecute a young hacker for publicizing the DeCSS code he discovered for descrambling DVD encryption — and then confronted not only tens of thousands of bloggers who reproduced DeCSS , but spectators in the courtroom with it printed on their T - shirts .
It happens every time a corporation fires an employee for blogging that “ it sucks to work for employer x , ” and sees a story previously limited to an insular blog readership of a few hundred transformed instead into a new one picked up by the wire services and blogosphere and read by tens of millions : “ Employer X Fires Blogger for Revealing How Bad it Sucks to Work There . ”
The bosses are still surprised every time this happens , like Elmer Fudd when the shotgun blows up in his face .
But even a flatworm eventually responds to negative reinforcement .
The day is coming when they wo n’t be surprised .
They ’ll start anticipating it .
And then they ’ll start fearing us .
Imagine waking up in a world , where you would need to use two - factor authentication / biometric based ID , in order to do anything online .
The reason for this ?
Accountability and supposedly , prevention of cybercrime .
This may well sound like the long - term reality , but Kaspersky 's CEO Eugene Kaspersky has been pushing the idea for years .
According to a recently published article , he still believes that the time has come for a mass adoption of hardware IDs affecting every Internet user .
Here are five reasons why I think this is a bad idea , if not one that is virtually impossible to implement .
" To prevent the misuse of social networking accounts , Kaspersky is pushing the idea of government IDs as a prerequisite for all computer users .
" I 've been talking about this for four years already , that we need to have a secure design for the ( entire ) internet , " he says .
In Kaspersky 's perfect world , all digital citizens would carry some form of ID to go online , hopefully creating greater hurdles for malware creators - but creating a nightmare for privacy advocates . "
" When you buy a car , the car is registered and you have a drivers licence .
If you want to have a gun , the same thing - it 's registered to the person who bought it .
The question is why ?
Because it 's dangerous .
With computers , you can make much more harm than with a gun or car . "
At first , the proposed ID scheme seems pretty logic in terms of accountability .
Here are five points on what 's wrong with it .
Privacy vs Security for the sake of accountability - Interestingly , Kaspersky is n't claiming that the ID scheme would somehow lead to more privacy being sacrificed on behalf of the users .
Instead , he argues that privacy is already dead , and that your ISP already knows everything about you , therefore the use of hardware IDs should n't really have an impact on the end user , since he 's losing nothing .
If privacy is already dead , and an ISP somewhere across the globe always knows everything about the activities of its customers , then what 's the point of having a hardware based ID to authenticate something that 's ( supposedly ) already known ?
There is n't .
Which leads us to the best possible solution to the problem of tracking down the source of a cybercriminal - cross - border / cross - agency threat intelligence sharing .
Mass adoption of two - factor authentication is no proof that it works , exactly the opposite - Using the " success " of two - factor authentication for E - banking as an example on the usefulness of the proposed IDs is partially incorrect .
How did cybercriminals manage to undermine the myth of the hardware based authentication ?
Not by attempting to attack it directly , but by bypassing it entirely in the sense of patiently and automatically waiting for the now authenticated victim to start interacting with the E - banking provider .
Neither a SSL connection , nor a two - factor authentication device would prevent a crimeware - infected host from having its owner victimized by cybercriminal on the other side of the world .
In the worst case , it would offer the user a false feeling of security .
Hardware IDs would not solve the problem , since a malware infected host will be used to commit the same crimes -
The article claims that the ID scheme would create some sort of hurdle for malware authors , which is totally untrue .
How come ?
Even if we assume that the end user would be unplugging himself / herself from the Internet and connectivity would be disabled unless he authenticates himself again , botnet masters would continue operating with the bots whose users are online , taking advantage of the different time zones .
With or without the hardware ID , the malware - infected host would continue forwarding the responsibility for the actions of the actual cybercriminal , to the owner of the host , unless it 's proven the same has been compromised .
Long gone are the days when a cybercriminal would use his own host to commit the crimes , unless we exclude the Mariposa botnet masters of course , who got caught by doing exactly the same .
By authenticating yourself on a PC that 's not yours , you automatically inherit its reputation - A quote from the article - " Kaspersky says that in Dubai " they are going to introduce regulations that in public places , to get access to public WiFi , you have to present your ID . "
The idea is that whenever a phishing attack is launched from a particular host , using the proposed ID scheme would allow law enforcement to find out the person that 's supposedly behind the campaign based on the fact that he 's already authenticated himself .
In reality though , even when you 're using a public computer , the malicious campaigns that were going on in the background would continue taking place , with numerous users identifying themselves , and none of them would theoretically have anything to do with these background processed maintained by someone on the other side of the world .
Budgeting the idea on an international scale is off base -
In order for this ID scheme to get even close to being of any use , would be its mass adoption .
Otherwise , certain countries that deny , do not have the resources , or do n't even believe in the idea , would n't bother implementing this .
The real problem with fighting cybercrime has never been about the lack of technologies or knowledge on how the ecosystem really works .
It 's always been about the lack of mass adoption for these technologies , and the lack of active cooperation among countries .
Even if we assume that in a perfect world , this scheme gets implemented , just like photoshop -ed IDs sent to domain registrars in Russia and China in order to comply with new regulations , biometric passports have been under fire since day one .
It would be totally naive to assume that the same would n't happen to these IDs as well .
Do you think the pros of the proposed hardware based ID scheme -- if any -- are worth the loss of privacy ?
Do you still believe privacy exists online ?
Are you willing to sacrifice even the left overs of it , with the idea to improve accountability over the Internet , and supposedly limit cybercrime ?
How long before cybercriminals undermine the ID scheme as well , and would n't a potential flaw in it lead us the same situation we 're into today - millions of end users still susceptible to outdated 3rd party application flaws and vulnerable browser plugins , given the fact that only a small number of the hardware ID users would even know they 're susceptible to impersonation based on the flaw ?

In the wake of the largest weather - related air travel disruption in recent memory , the eruption of the Icelandic volcano Eyjafjallajökull , a number of major airlines in Europe have reported economic losses , compared to the levels of revenue they expected to earn in March and April this year .
Scandinavian - based airlines in particular report being hard - hit economically , relative to the earnings they were expecting for March and April .
Last week , low - cost carrier Norwegian Air Shuttle reported a loss , relative to expected earnings , of at least 100 million units of its currency , the krone .
( That is , at least 12.9 million EUR ; at least 11 million GBP ; and at least 16.25 million USD . )
It lamented on one hand , that more than 2,000 of its scheduled flights had to be cancelled .
But , on the other hand , the airline maintained an on - time performance ratio of 91 percent .
It is the fourth - largest low - cost carrier in Europe .
Another Scandinavian - based carrier , Scandinavian Airlines ( SAS ) , was not so lucky .
Expected earnings for Europe ’s ninth - largest carrier were off at least 650 million SEK ( 67.8 million EUR ; 57.8 million GBP ; 85.4 million USD ) including the entire month of April and the first week of May .
SAS added that it appeared bookings on its flights for May and June had also been decreased ( compared to expected numbers ) due to the ash cloud the settled over Europe last month , paralyzing air traffic .
Tuesday , Austria ’s flag carrier Austrian Airlines announced a 5.2 percent decrease in number of passengers carried from April 2009 to April 2010 , a slump it attributes to the eruption of Eyjafjallajökull .
The carrier did not report actual earnings during April 2010 in contrast with expected earnings during that month , or the difference between those two figures .
Rather remarkably , a member of the airline ’s executive board said Austrian is “ still on course to achieve [ its ] goals , ” presumably speaking about 2010 yearly goals .
The low - cost German carrier Air Berlin was forced to cancel “ more than 3,500 flights ” because of the eruption of Eyjafjallajökull .
Online , Air Berlin expressed its economic loss last April relative to the previous April , in an unusual manner .
It is expressed in terms of revenue ( in EUR cents ) per available seat - kilometer , a measurement which cannot possibly mean much to most lay readers .
And unfortunately , we are still left with an unclear picture as to how effectively Air Berlin weathered the disruption .
Icelandair , the flag carrier of Iceland , has not , as of this post , reported on earnings for the month of April .
A general assessment from Icelandair of the economic effects of the eruption of Eyjafjallajökull no doubt seems premature , because it is expected there may yet be more major effects to come .
In contrast , one North American carrier , in its own assessment , received a shot in the arm from the eruption of Eyjafjallajökull .
Air Canada , in its April traffic report published online last week , said that inconvenience caused to its passengers was minimal .
The Canadian flag carrier possesses a plurality of the market share at St. John ’s International Airport ( IATA : YYT ; ICAO : CYYT ) , North America ’s easternmost airport .
Its operations there were only minimally affected .
The airport closed once , for a few hours late April 18 and early April 19 ( UTC - 2:30 ) , due to concerns the ash cloud would reach North America .
Here is an article from Tuesday , along with spectacular new video probably taken from a propeller plane near Eyjafjallajökull during a recent eruption of the volcano .
The last time Eyjafjallajökull erupted on a scale this large or larger was 1821 - 1822 .
Historical records indicate the eruption lasted for fifteen months .

As we all watched ( happily ) as the United States got knocked out of the World Cup earlier today , I could n’t help but think what they needed to add in order to improve 4 years from now .
Well , they need strikers ( not one goal in World Cup Play from a striker since 1992 ) , they could definitely use a couple new center backs ( both of em blew bad today ) , and a new coach would be helpful ( nothing has to be more humiliating than making a sub in the 30th minute because you know you botched the starting XI ) .
So for fun we thought we ’d put together our own Team USA Soccer team , featuring America ’s best professional athletes on the planet .
Note :
We will be playing a 4 - 4 - 2 formation
Goaltender : Calvin Johnson , WR Detroit Lions
Johnson would the perfect guy to start in goal for Team USA .
At 6 ’ 5 he has more than enough length to interfere and disrupt crosses , while being almost impossible to chip when you factor in his insanely high vertical leap .
Johnson also had 67 receptions last in year in 14 games for the Detroit Lions , so we like his ability to catch and hold onto the ball as well .
At only 24 years of age , Johnson could be the next big thing in USA soccer .
Center Back : Ron Artest , SF Los Angeles Lakers
We like the idea of having a lockdown defender as one of our 2 center backs .
Artest did a wonderful job during the postseason in locking down the opposing teams number 1 option , and that skillset will serve him well in the heart of our back 4 .
Artest is built like a rock with a body from of 6 ’ 7 and 245 pounds , so we like his ability to win tackles and stay with bigger strikers such as Didier Drogba .
Artest also has a flare for making crucial offensive plays which could come in handy late in games .
Center Back : Erik Johnson , D St. Louis Blues
At 6 ’ 4 and over 230 pounds , Johnson not only has size but very good mobility .
He ’s very comfortable playing on the big stage for his national country , as he played on Team USA ’s hockey team at the Winter Olympics that took home the Silver Medal .
In the NHL Johnson is seen as an elite 2 way defenseman with huge upside , and playing together with Artest means we think he ’ll be able to jump into the rush more frequently .
At the tender age of 22 , Johnson could become a future captain for this squad .
Note : Average size of our 2 center backs would be 6 ’ 5 and 238 pounds .
Beast .
Left Back : Lebron James , SF Chicago Bulls / Miami Heat / anywhere but Cleveland
How could we put a team like this together and leave off Lebron ?
Of all the positions on the field , we feel Lebron would be best suited here at left back .
A staple of the NBA All defensive team , Lebron has shown a commitment to defense , while maintaing his elite level status as one of the games best all around scorers .
We would use Lebron has more of a wingback type defenseman and involve him heavily in our offense .
Nobody on the planet can track back the way Lebron does and deny the opposition a score , so we have no hesitation about letting him loose on offense .
At 6 ’9 , he would be a huge factor on set pieces for us ( both offensively and defensively ) .
Right Back : Darrelle Revis , CB New York Jets
The best one on one cover man in the NFL .
He plays the right cornerback position for the Jets and we would have no problem matching him up on the same side as Cristiano Ronaldo or Paul Stalteri .
Revis talks a big game too and we feel he could get under the skin of opposing players .
We would not want him involved too much in our offense as we need him to be a stay at home presence , but Revis is known for game changing plays , and that is always a skill set good to be left unharnessed .
Defensive Center Midfielder : Ray Lewis , MLB Baltimore Ravens
A man who tackles for a living , we could n’t find a better option for this spot than Ray Lewis .
The definition of leadership and beastfulness , he would anchor our midfield and allow for our midfielders to get up in the play .
He would NEVER lose a 50/50 tackle and once you go in once with him , nobody is dumb enough to challenge him again .
Nobody understands the concept of defense better than him , and he has sideline to sideline range .
Lewis would wear the captains armband for us and lead by example every night .
Offensive Center Midfielder : Kobe Bryant , SG Los Angeles Lakers
If Lebron gets to play , than so does Kobe .
We need someone in this positoin who can make plays for himself and his teammates , and is n’t afraid to take a game over .
Enter Kobe Bryant .
A man who can seemingly do anything to help his team win , we like having him in the middle of the park .
At 6 ’6 , he has outstanding height while being able to move a swiftly as anyone on the park .
Bryant also knows multiple languages such as Spanish and Italian , so he could help give us insight on what the opposing teams are doing .
Wide Right Midfield : Patrick Kane , F Chicago Blackhawks
Kane is the perfect combination of skill , flare , and trouble that makes him to hard to pass up .
We like having his speed and skill on the outside and having him play in front of Revis allows for us not to notice some of his defensive deficiencies .
Although he is both young and undersized , his resume of being a big time scorer and big game player will earn him respect among his peers .
His unique celebrations will also be a bonus .
Wide Left Midfield : Delonte West , SG Cleveland Cavaliers
We cant possibly pass up the potential drama of Lebron and West playing on the same side of the field for 90 minutes .
Aside from that ,
West would actually be a decent fit here :
He ’s a left footed player who has no problems continually deferring to Lebron when the game gets serious .
Also , this way Mrs. Lebron James can watch both her men at the same time on the same side of the field .
See , everyone wins .
Striker : Michael Johnson , Retired Olympic Sprinter
Ok , I know this guy is like 85 years old and has n’t done anything of relevance in years .
However , we are going to rewind the clcoks back 15 years and take that Michael Johnson .
We love his speed up front and his ability to run 200 and 400 M faster than anyone else on the planet means we can play long ball all night .
Also , given that this is soccer , if we ever need to fake an injury , Johnson should have no problem doing that :
Striker : Zach Parise , F New Jersey Devils
Parise might ’ve been a good addition to the actual Team USA soccer team .
Great speed , offensive instincts , and one of the best goal scoring touches on the planet makes him an easy choice to lead our attack .
Add in his 1 v. 1 ability and the States finally have that elusive game breaker .
Parise also has a pension for scoring big goals ( see Gold Medal Game ) and always performs well for his country .
Head Coach : Phil Jackson , Los Angeles Lakers
11 championships .
Do I need to say anymore ?
The dude flat out wins and he knows how to coach and handle talent .
This was probably the biggest no brainer other than Delonte West .
Lemme know what you think !
Love to hear your thoughts
Much love ,

Chicago man charged with raping , beating 74 - year - old Elgin woman
A Chicago man was being held on $ 850,000 bond Wednesday on allegations he forced his way into a 74 - year - old Elgin woman 's apartment and raped and beat her .
Rodney L. McGowan , 42 , of the 1000 block of North Monticello Avenue , was charged with two counts of home invasion , three counts of aggravated criminal sexual assault , one count of criminal sexual assault and one count of aggravated battery to a senior citizen , authorities said .
Police were called to the woman 's apartment in the 1300 block of Fleetwood Drive at 12:05 a.m. last Friday on accusations that McGowan broke into her apartment while she was sleeping , punched her several times in the face and raped her , police said .
Nobody else was home at the time and there is no indication that anything was stolen from the apartment , Deputy Police Chief Cecil Smith said .
The incident occurred inside an apartment within the Buena Vista housing complex .
McGowan had already left by the time police arrived , but officers identified him by viewing surveillance that showed him entering another building in the 1200 block of Fleetwood Drive and exiting the woman 's apartment , police said .
Detectives recovered information that placed McGowan at the apartment during the attack , and he turned himself in on Tuesday , Smith said .
The woman , meanwhile , was treated at Provena St. Joseph Hospital for several face and head injuries .
She was released Wednesday afternoon , said Heather Gates , a hospital spokeswoman .
McGowan was taken to the Kane County lockup Wednesday afternoon where he was awaiting his May 11 court date at the Kane County Judicial Center .
The most serious charges in this case are home invasion and aggravated criminal sexual assault .
Both are Class X felonies that are punishable by up to 30 years in prison .

Any guesses at what songs a Molly Moon ’s ice cream truck will broadcast to attract the kiddies as it navigates the busy streets of Capitol Hill and beyond this summer ?

The line - worthy Capitol Hill and Wallingford - based ice cream empire ( early phase ) is readying its not - so - secret weapon for deployment and hiring drivers .

Understanding the excuses
Proof # 50 shows that Jesus is imaginary .
Yet , despite the evidence that we all can see , believers make excuses to try to rationalize their belief .
On this page we look at these excuses one by one .
Imagine that you are talking to a devout Christian .
You ask her , " Is Jesus real ? "
Her response might go something like this :
Is Jesus real ???
What a silly question !
Of course he is !
Jesus is the living son of God !
I have a personal , loving relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ .
I pray to him every day , and he answers my prayers .
He helps me make important decisions and guides me in everything I do .
I walk with Jesus every step I take .
Jesus loves me and has a plan for my life .
Jesus is my savior , the rock of my salvation .
His blood washes all of us and forgives us our sins . "
Now ask her : Has Jesus ever appeared to you in the flesh ?
Can the resurrected Jesus appear to us right now ?
The answers will of course be " No " and No " .
Now ask this simple question : Why Not ? Jesus has to appear to people to prove that he is resurrected .
According to the Bible , Jesus appeared to hundreds of people .
In the Bible Jesus promises to answer our prayers .
So why would n't Jesus appear to us to prove that he is God ?
Why can't we pray for him to appear right now , and have him appear ? "
As soon as you ask this question , the excuses will start to flow .
Here is an explanation of each one : Excuse # 1 - Jesus never promises to answer prayers Normally this excuse will be phrased with something like , " God is not a big vending machine , " or " God is not your personal Genie ! "
And yet , there is no denying that we can find verses in the Bible where Jesus specifically promises to answer your prayers .
For example , in Matthew 7:7 Jesus says : Ask , and it will be given you ; seek , and you will find ; knock , and it will be opened to you .
For every one who asks receives , and he who seeks finds , and to him who knocks it will be opened .
Or what man of you , if his son asks him for bread , will give him a stone ?
Or if he asks for a fish , will give him a serpent ?
If you then , who are evil , know how to give good gifts to your children , how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask him !
So if we ask for Jesus to appear in the flesh , he should appear ?
Right ?
In Matthew 17:20 Jesus says :
For truly , I say to you , if you have faith as a grain of mustard seed , you will say to this mountain , ' Move from here to there , ' and it will move ; and nothing will be impossible to you .
If nothing is impossible for you , then you should be able to ask for Jesus to appear in the flesh , and he should appear ?
Right ?
In Matthew 21:21 : I tell you the truth , if you have faith and do not doubt , not only can you do what was done to the fig tree , but also you can say to this mountain , ' Go , throw yourself into the sea , ' and it will be done .
If you believe , you will receive whatever you ask for in prayer .
If you will receive whatever you ask for in prayer , then you should be able to ask for Jesus to appear in the flesh , and he should appear ?
Right ?
The message is reiterated Mark 11:24 :
Therefore I tell you , whatever you ask for in prayer , believe that you have received it , and it will be yours .
If whatever you ask for in prayer will be yours , then you should be able to ask for Jesus to appear in the flesh , and he should appear ?
Right ?
In John chapter 14 , verses 12 through 14 , Jesus tells all of us just how easy prayer can be : " Truly , truly , I say to you , he who believes in me will also do the works that I do ; and greater works than these will he do , because I go to the Father .
Whatever you ask in my name , I will do it , that the Father may be glorified in the Son ; if you ask anything in my name , I will do it .
If Jesus will do whatever you ask for in prayer , then you should be able to ask for Jesus to appear in the flesh , and he should appear ?
Right ?
In Matthew 18:19 Jesus says it again : Again I say to you , if two of you agree on earth about anything they ask , it will be done for them by my Father in heaven .
For where two or three are gathered in my name , there am I in the midst of them .
If anything you ask will be done for you , then you should be able to ask for Jesus to appear in the flesh , and he should appear ?
Right ?
In Mark 9:23 : All things are possible to him who believes .
If all things are possible , then you should be able to ask for Jesus to appear in the flesh , and he should appear ?
Right ?
In Luke 1:37 : For with God nothing will be impossible .
If nothing will be impossible , then you should be able to ask for Jesus to appear in the flesh , and he should appear ?
Right ?
In other words , despite what Christians say to try to rationalize their unanswered prayers , Jesus does promise in the Bible , in many different places , that he will answer our prayers .
There is no way to misinterpret what Jesus says , and these verses are not taken " out of context " .
Jesus clearly promises to answer prayers .
It would be trivial for the all - powerful , all - loving son of God to materialize in the Flesh .
Supposedly he has done it for hundreds of people .
Supposedly he is in our midst already .
Yet when we pray and ask him to materialize , nothing happens .
For any rational adult , this proves that Jesus is imaginary , especially when you combine it with so many other proofs .
Excuse # 2 -
It is not Jesus ' will to appear
Often this excuse will be coupled with the following explanation , " Jesus is a conscious , sentient , all - knowing being .
He has a will of his own , just like you do .
He hears your prayer , but he has the option of answering , ' No . '
We cannot know the reasons why , but Jesus has his divine reasons for never appearing on earth . "
This explanation , of course , directly contradicts all of the Bible verses quoted above .
At another level , imagine for a moment that Jesus does exist .
He is all - loving and all - powerful .
He is " in our midst " already , according to Matthew 18:20 .
He has promised in many places to answer prayers .
He supposedly hears your prayer .
And then he just stands there laughing at you .
" What , ME appear to YOU - you must be JOKING !!! " is what Jesus would be saying .
In reality , what we have done here is create an unambiguous situation , as described in Proof # 9 .
There is only one way for Jesus to appear in this situation : he must exist .
Coincidence cannot answer this prayer .
Since he does not appear , we know he is imaginary .
Excuse # 3 -
Thou shalt not test the lord
This is a really common one : " It says right in the Bible that thou shalt not test the Lord .
In step 3 , your prayer tests him , so of course he does n't appear . "
Here 's the most interesting thing about this rationalization .
We are supposed to ignore all of verses in step 1 because " you ca n't take the Bible literally . "
But then we are supposed to take the verse that says , " Thou shalt not test the Lord " literally .
This disconnection shows how strong the delusion of Christianity can be .
Here is another interesting point : EVERY prayer is a test .
If God can not be tested , then no one can pray .
It is also fascinating that millions of Christians keep prayer journals to track exactly what happens when they pray .
See , for example , Prayer - journal.com , or this list of sites .
Why do n't these Christians pray for the resurrected Jesus to appear to them and track this prayer in their journals ?
Excuse # 4 -
It would destroy our free will if Jesus appeared to us This is the famous free will argument .
Of course , if this argument were true , then God could not incarnate himself on earth .
Jesus is supposed to be God .
He supposedly came to earth and millions of people saw him .
According to the Gospel of John : Jesus did many other things as well .
If every one of them were written down , I suppose that even the whole world would not have room for the books that would be written .
( John 21:25 ) That 's an awful lot of miracles -- so many that the world would not have room for all the books describing them .
Presumably at least one person witnessed each miracle .
Think of how many names fill just one phone book .
Now imagine a whole world full of phone books .
That 's millions of people who all had their free wills destroyed by Jesus ' presence on earth .
Clearly the issue of " free will " is irrelevant .
It is purely a rationalization .
Jesus could appear to all of us today just like he ( supposedly ) appeared to millions of people when he was on earth .
Excuse # 5 - Jesus does appear to people -
He appeared to a dozen people at the XYZ church last week The obvious response is , " Really ?
Can you prove that ?
For example , do you have a video tape showing his appearance ?
Did you ask Jesus a question , like ' what will be the winning PowerBall numbers next week ? ' that would certify his omniscience ?
Did you ask him to move Mt. Everest to Nevada to prove his omnipotence ? "
Excuse # 6 - Jesus does appear to people -
He appeared as an image on my breakfast toast this morning
This video is typical of the genre : Paul Gale shows video of Pope John Paul the 2nd appearing
To rational people , these are called coincidences .
If Jesus was going to appear to you as he did in the Bible , he would appear in the flesh as a living , breathing person .
Excuse # 7 - Jesus does not appear to me , but he does speak to me every day and guide me in everything I do .
To rational people , these are called hallucinations .
Since Jesus is an all - knowing being , if he were actually talking to you , he would be able to tell you things that no one else knows .
You , as a person channeling Jesus , would be the smartest person on earth .
You would ace every test you took .
You would never make mistakes .
You would know what the winning PowerBall numbers would be next week .
You would be able to solve world hunger .
Etc .
The fact that none of these things are happening shows us that you are hallucinating .
Drawing a conclusion
Here are the facts : Jesus has promised to answer our prayers ( see excuse # 1 above ) .
It would be trivial for Jesus to appear since he is all - powerful and timeless .
We know it is OK for Jesus to appear to people because , according to the Bible , Jesus has appeared to hundreds .
There are no issues with free will ( see excuse # 4 above ) .
The only way for Jesus to prove that he is resurrected is to appear to people .
Therefore , each person needs an appearance by Jesus to know that he is real .
Therefore , since Jesus does not appear , we know that he is imaginary .
The story of Jesus ' resurrection is no different from the story of Rudolf the Rednose Reindeer or Jack 's Beanstalk .

See Haaretz at www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/at-least-10-activists-killed-as-israel-navy-opens-fire-on-gaza-aid-flotilla-1.293089
Other outlets are reporting that Israel is now censoring news about fatalities and casualties , and the live stream carried commentary from an individual reportedly speaking for the Israeli government or military who claimed weapons were found on board the Mavi Marmara , the ship that was attacked by Israeli commandos by helicopter and boat .
Peace activists involved in organizing and participating in the convoy flatly deny that charge .
Live stream is here : www.livestream.com/insaniyardim 10 PM CST : Solidarity activists aboard one of six relief vessels traveling to Gaza with humanitarian aid report that they have been attacked by Israeli forces , with three aid workers killed and more than 50 injured , according to live updates from the flotilla .
The assault comes in the wake of the flotilla being surrounded earlier today by three Israeli warships in international waters , roughly 70 miles away from the Israeli coast .
The Flotilla moved further west , deeper into international waters to avoid any conflict with Israeli navy vessels , but had been concerned all night that Israeli forces would send small inflatable military boats towards the flotilla and attempt to attack and board the humanitarian vessels .
Those fears have apparently been realized , with people aboard the Mavi Marmara , a Turkish ship with hundreds of aid workers and activists aboard , reporting that they have been attacked .
At least three aboard one ship have been killed and dozens more wounded , including at least one European Parliament member .
Israeli commandos apparently rappelled onto a ship believed to be the Mavi Marmara , whose passengers range in age from 88 to a year old and include Christians , Muslims and Jews seeking to end Israel 's blockade of Gaza .
Midwest U.S. activists have been unable to reach Chicagoan Fatima Mohammadi , traveling aboard the Mavi Marmara .
LIVE STREAM of Israeli commandos attacking the Gaza aid flotilla : www.livestream.com/insaniyardim
Live video from the flotilla shows Israeli naval commando vessels pulling alongside the aid ships , then boarding , while Israeli warships flank the flotilla nearby , and what sounds like gunfire can be heard in the background .
No -one on the aid ships is carrying any kinds of weapons , including for defense against a feared Israeli attack in international waters .
" This is an act of terrorism and piracy that exposes the despicible underbelly of Israeli policy against Gaza and the Palestinians , " says Kevin Clark , midwest coordinator for the Free Gaza Movement .
" Americans need to understand that our tax dollars , to the tune of billions of dollars a year , bankroll this kind of state terrorist attack on peaceful , non-violent people .
U.S. aid to this rogue government and its murderous thugs must end .
" Hundreds of elected officials , former diplomats , aid workers and activists — including a Nobel laureate and many European legislators — are with the flotilla , traveling by sea to Gaza to break Israel 's blockade of the tiny strip of land .
Foreign news correspondents and independent journalists are traveling aboard the Mavi Marmara , a Turkish ship with hundreds of aid workers and activists aboard which is also running its own press operation reachable at the satellite number +8821636619168 .
A total of six ships , including two cargo ships and other passenger vehicles , are carrying thousands of tons of humanitarian aid to the beseiged region , which has been under Israeli blockade since 2006 .
Israel has marshalled its most lethal military vessels to try to stop the humanitarian marine convoy , and at around 2:20 pm Central Standard Time ( US ) the first reports of unmanned drone planes buzzing the vessels was received from convoy passengers .
Two boats in the aid flotilla , one currently traveling with the convoy to Gaza and another in port in Cyprus for repairs , are flagged and registered in the United States .
The ships are U.S. territory under maritime law , and the U.S. government is required to intervene if this " U.S. property " is attacked or illegally confiscated by Israeli authorities — a tactic Israel has threatened and deployed in the past .
Israel has a long history of attacking ships whose missions are deemed undesirable .
In December 2008 , it rammed the Dignity , carrying medical and humanitarian aid , doctors , human rights workers and a former U.S. congresswoman , without warning in international waters .
Israel intensified its 2006 blockade after attacking the area in a weeks - long assault that ended in January 2009 , killing more than 1,400 and leaving thousands more homeless and reducing huge swaths of housing to rubble .
The blockade has created mass unemployment and extreme poverty , leaving four out of five Gazans — half of whom are children — dependent on humanitarian aid .
The Freedom Flotilla carries more than 10,000 tons of relief and developmental aid to Gaza , along with roughly 700 participants from more than 30 countries , among them volunteers from South Africa , Algeria , Turkey , Macedonia , Pakistan , Yemin , Kosovo , the UK and US and Kuwait – and an exiled former Archbishop of Jerusalem who currently lives in the Vatican .
The cargo includes prefabricated homes and playgrounds , cement and other home - building supplies , medical devices and medications , textiles and food , in defiance of Israel 's siege on Gaza , which restricts the entry of all materials , including food and medicine .
The flotilla 's supplies were gathered by a coalition of international civil society and human rights organizations to be sent directly to the people of Gaza by sea , using only international waters and the coastal waters immediately off of Gaza for passage .
The flotilla is expected to arrive in Gaza as early as today .
Participants on board speak languages that include English , Turkish , Kurdish , over ten dialects of Arabic , Hebrew , Italian , Spanish , Portuguese , French , Malaysian , Indonesian , Norwegian , Swedish , Urdu , Punjabi , Farsi , Hindi , German , Flemish , Greek , Catalan , Russian , Bosnian , Chechen , Macedonian and Albanian .
Reporters on board hail from locations that include the United Kingdom , Spain , Malaysia , Indonesia , Venezuela , Kuwait , South Africa , Pakistan , Jordan , the Persian Gulf and across the Arab world .
Protests in support of the aid convoy have been occuring around the world since Thursday , with Chicagoans scheduled to protest again at 4:30 PM on Tuesday , June 1 , in front of the Israeli consulate at 111 E. Wacker Dr. in Chicago .

Gay rights advocates said the rules change was inspired by one of those cases involving a same - sex couple , Janice Langbehn and Lisa Pond , who were profiled in The New York Times last year .
After Ms. Pond was stricken with a fatal brain aneurysm , Ms. Langbehn was denied visiting rights in 2007 by a Florida hospital .
Although Ms. Langbehn had power of attorney and she and Ms. Pond were parents to four children they had adopted , the hospital refused for eight hours to allow her and the children to see Ms. Pond , her partner for 18 years .
Ms. Pond died as Ms. Langbehn tried in vain to get to her side .
Ms. Langbehn , represented by Lambda Legal , a legal advocacy organization , brought suit against the hospital , Jackson Memorial in Miami , but lost .
On Thursday night , Mr. Obama called her from Air Force
One to say that he had been moved by her case .
“ I was so humbled that he would know Lisa ’s name and know our story , ” Ms. Langbehn said in a telephone interview .
“ He apologized for how we were treated .
For the last three years , that ’s what I ’ve been asking the hospital to do .
Even now , three years later , they still refuse to apologize to the children and I for the fact that Lisa died alone . ”
Mr. Obama campaigned saying he would fight for the rights of gay men and lesbians , but he has been under pressure since the beginning of his presidency to be a stronger advocate for their issues .
Many gay men and lesbians grew disenchanted with what they viewed as his foot - dragging on reversing “ do n’t ask , do n’t tell , ” the policy that bars them from serving openly in the military .
The president said in his State of the Union address this year that he intended to move to overturn the policy , and his administration has been taking steps to do so .
The memorandum is intended to “ help ensure that patients will be able to face difficult times in hospitals with compassion , dignity and respect , ” a White House spokesman , Shin Inouye , said Thursday night .
“ By taking these steps , we can better protect the interests and needs of patients that are gay or lesbian , widows and widowers with no children , members of religious orders , or others for whom their loved ones are not always immediate relatives .
Because all Americans should be able to have loved ones there for them in their time of need . ”
THE state 's worst drowning tragedy in more than 20 years has prompted calls for a major crackdown on rock fishing safety .
Relatives flew from Hong Kong to Sydney yesterday to comfort David Poon and grieve for the loss of his father Po , 63 , his mother Delphine , 61 , his brother Dillon , 25 , and two friends , a 56 - year - old man and his partner , 58 .
The group had been on their weekly fishing trip to Catherine Hill Bay , south of Newcastle , on Sunday afternoon when they were swept into the water by powerful waves .
Locals Sharon and Andrew Bourke spotted the group walking towards the rock platform from which they went missing .
" We were talking about how big the swell was when we went home and I actually said , ' mark my words , someone would have been washed off the rocks today ' , " Mrs Bourke said .
" It 's weird to think that we saw them walking to their doom . "
Mark Kulmar , a wave expert at the State Government 's Manly Hydraulics Laboratory , said wave action off the NSW coast on Sunday afternoon was more powerful and dangerous than normal .
Surf Life Saving Central Coast CEO
Chad Griffith said rock fishing was overdue for reform .
" We 're constantly updating our policies and procedures when it comes to beach safety but when it comes to rock fishing , nothing has ever changed , " he said .
He called on the Government to make life jackets compulsory , and to consider other safety measures like harness lines and rock spikes .
David Poon said his family had fished at Catherine Hill Bay " at least 50 or 60 times " .
" It 's a regular fishing trip - they go up there once a week , " Mr Poon said .
Police found one of the bodies on Monday afternoon , and specialist divers located three more bodies in close proximity yesterday morning .
Authorities do n't believe the fifth missing person - Mrs Poon - could have survived , but David remained hopeful his mother would be found alive .

DEATH NOTICE : The Tooth Fairy died last night of complications related to obesity .
Born Jan. 1 , 1946 , the Tooth Fairy is survived by 400 million children living largely in North America and Western Europe , known collectively as “ The Baby Boomers . ”
“ We ’ll certainly miss the Tooth Fairy , ” one of them said following her death , which coincided with the 2010 British elections and rioting in Greece .
The Tooth Fairy had only one surviving sibling who will now look after her offspring alone : Mr. Bond Market of Wall Street and the City of London .
Sitting in America , it ’s hard to grasp the importance of the British elections and the Greek riots .
Nothing to do with us , right ?
Well , I ’d pay attention to the drama playing out here .
It may be coming to a theater near you .
The meta-story behind the British election , the Greek meltdown and our own Tea Party is this :
Our parents were “ The Greatest Generation , ” and they earned that title by making enormous sacrifices and investments to build us a world of abundance .
My generation , “ The Baby Boomers , ” turned out to be what the writer Kurt Andersen called “ The Grasshopper Generation . ”
We ’ve eaten through all that abundance like hungry locusts .
Now we and our kids together need to become “ The Regeneration ”  one that raises incomes anew but in a way that is financially and ecologically sustainable .
It will take a big adjustment .

My approach to everything I have written , studied and analyzed in this space is pretty straight forward : Start with the data and evidence and go forward from there .
Figure out what the “ Truth ” is ; try to get as close to the objective reality beneath the noise in order to make intelligent investing decisions for myself and my clients .
There are others who do not share this objective .
Their goals are either political ( winning the next election ) or ideological ( having their belief system become dominant ) .
Truth is irrelevant to these people .
Not surprisingly , these folks — many of whom contributed to the crisis in a mighty way — are desperately trying to duck responsibility for what happened .
Those who helped cause the crisis are engaged in an ongoing effort to rewrite its history .
Their goal ?
Exonerate their own bad behavior , throw off any responsibility for the collapse , blame anything but their own ideology and horrific decision making .
They want to keep pushing their tired political agendas , despite the damage they may have caused .
When writing Bailout Nation , I tried to steer clear of partisan finger pointing .
I kept the focus on what actually occurred , what could be proven mathematically .
I blamed Democrats and Republicans — not equally , but in proportion to their actions , and what they did .
Unsupported theories , tenuous connection , loose affiliations were not part of the analysis .
To be blameworthy , every legislative change , each regulatory failure , any corporate action had to manifest themselves in actual mathematical proof .
This led me to ascertain the following 30 year sequence :
- Free market absolutism becomes the dominant intellectual thought .
- Deregulation of markets , investment houses , and banks becomes a broad goal :
This led to Glass Steagall repeal , unfettering of Derivatives , Investing house leverage exemptions , and a new breed of unregulated non bank lenders .
- Legislative actions reduce or eliminate much of the regulatory oversight ; SEC funding is weakened .
- Rates come down to absurd levels .
- Bond managers madly scramble for yield .
- Derivatives , non -bank lending , leverage , bank size , compensation levels all run away from prior levels .
- Wall Street securitizes whatever it can to satisfy the demand for higher yields .
-“ Lend to securitize ” nonbank mortgage writers sell enormous amounts of subprime loans to Wall Street for this purpose .
- To meet this huge demand , non bank lenders collapse lending standards ( banks eventually follow ) , leading to a credit bubble .
- The Fed approves of this “ innovation , ” ignores risks .
- Housing booms . . . then busts
- Credit freezes , the markets collapse , a new recession begins .
You will note that the CRA is not part of this sequence .
I could find no evidence that they were a cause or even a minor factor .
If they were , the housing bubbles would not have been in California or S. Florida or Las Vegas or Arizona — Harlem and South Philly and parts of Chicago and Washington DC would have been the focus of RE bubbles .
Nor do I blame Fannie and Freddie .
Now understand , there is no love lost between myself and the GSEs .
For years , I have called them “ Phoney and Fraudy . ”
Since George Bush and Hank Paulson nationalized them , I have accused the government of using these two as a backdoor bailout for banks — a hidden PPIP / TARP used to buy all the garbage mortgages that banks are desperate to get off their balance sheets .
Longtime readers will recall we very publicly shorted Fannie based upon their fraudulent practices and horrific balance sheet when FNM ’s stock was in the $ 40s ( it soon after collapsed ) .
But even I cannot reconcile reality with the movement to place all of the world ’s troubles at the feet of the GSEs .
Not , at least , according to the data .
That lack of evidence , however , does n’t stop ideologues from trying .
Consider this attempt at rewriting the causes of the credit crisis by Kevin Hassett :
“ The worst financial crisis in generations was set off by a massive government effort , led by the two mortgage giants , to make loans to homebuyers no matter whether they could make the payments .
Lenders were willing to lend money to just about all comers , no matter how low their income .
Why ?
Because the lenders knew Fannie and Freddie would purchase the loans from them for a high price before bundling them into securities to sell to investors . ”
Now , this makes for a fascinating narrative that plays into a number of different ideological beliefs .
It exonerates the radical free market deregulators , it ignores what the private sector did , and it somehow ignores the fact that Congress was controlled by a very conservative GOP from 1994 to 2006 — the prime period of time covered leading up to and including the beginning of the crisis .
But worse than all of that , the data supporting Hassett ’s position simply is n’t there .
Over the past 2 years , I have repeatedly asked the people who push this narrative to provide some evidence for their positions .
I have offered a $ 100,000 if they could prove their case .
Specifically , I have requested some data or evidence that DISPROVED the following facts :
- The origination of subprime loans came primarily from non bank lenders not covered by the CRA ; - The majority of the underwriting , at least for the first few years of the boom , were by these same non -bank lenders - When the big banks began chasing subprime , it was due to the profit motive , not any mandate from the President ( a Republican ) or the the Congress ( Republican controlled ) or the GSEs they oversaw .
- Prior to 2005 , nearly all of these sub - prime loans were bought by Wall Street — NOT Fannie & Freddie - In fact , prior to 2005 , the GSEs were not permitted to purchase non-conforming mortgages .
- After 2005 , Fannie & Freddie changed their own rules to start buying these non-conforming mortgages — in order to maintain market share and compete with Wall Street for profits .
- The change in FNM / FRE conforming mortgage purchases in 2005 was not due to any legislation or marching orders from the President ( a Republican ) or the the Congress ( Republican controlled ) .
It was the profit motive that led them to this action .
These are data supported facts I pounded on in BN .
Of course , folks like Hassett hate this factual history , as it conflicts with their goals and politics .
Rather than produce evidence , they create story lines unsupported by facts .
But Monkeys love a good narrative , and so they give that to them .
However , as an investor , I demand evidence , data and facts .
The blame Fannie & Freddie crowd have managed to remain blissfully data free .
They have steadfastly ignored all calls for proof .
Its way past the time to call out their intellectual dishonesty .
If you cannot show any data , if you cannot prove what you are alleging with actual facts , you need to be called out for what it is you actually are : Proponents of a failed philosophy .

( CNN ) -- President Obama hosts leaders from 46 countries for a two - day nuclear security summit starting Monday that will focus on how to better safeguard weapons materials , both old and new , to keep them out of the hands of terrorists .
The gathering at the Walter E. Washington Convention Center in the nation 's capital is considered an unprecedented effort to rally global action on securing vulnerable nuclear materials .
It also is the centerpiece of a major Obama objective aimed at preventing the spread of nuclear weapons and technology .
As the summit begins , the United States is negotiating with the four other permanent members of the United Nations Security Council on tougher sanctions against Iran over its nuclear ambitions .
" The central focus of this nuclear summit is the fact that the single biggest threat to U.S. security , both short term , medium term and long term , would be the possibility of a terrorist organization obtaining a nuclear weapon , " Obama said Sunday , appearing with South African President Jacob Zuma in Washington .
" This is something that could change the security landscape in this country and around the world for years to come , " Obama said .
" If there was ever a detonation in New York City , or London , or Johannesburg , the ramifications -- economically , politically and from a security perspective -- would be devastating .
We know that organizations like al Qaeda are in the process of trying to secure nuclear weapons or other weapons of mass destruction and would have no compunction at using them . "
Obama signed a new treaty with Russia last week to reduce the nuclear stockpiles of both nations , and his administration issued a revised U.S. nuclear arms strategy intended to reinforce the nation 's nuclear deterrent while isolating terrorists and rogue states that fail to comply with international regulations .
It all fits together as an ambitious effort to mobilize a unified global effort against nuclear proliferation , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Defense Secretary Robert Gates said in interviews broadcast Sunday .
" We want to get the world 's attention focused where we think it needs to be , with these continuing efforts by al Qaeda and others to get just enough nuclear material to cause terrible havoc , destruction , and loss of life somewhere in the world , " Clinton told the ABC program " This Week . "
Of particular concern are older nuclear weapons and materials that are n't safeguarded as well as they should be , particularly in Russia and other states of the former Soviet Union , Clinton said on the NBC program " Meet the Press . "
It used to be considered a U.S. - Soviet issue , Clinton said , rather than the high international priority " we intend to make it in the coming week . "
" Unfortunately , we have a situation in which there is a lot of loose nuclear material around the world , " Obama said Sunday .
" And so the central focus of this summit is getting the international community on a path in which we are locking down that nuclear material in a very specific time frame , with a specific work plan . "
South Africa , he said , is a moral leader on the nuclear issue , since it began and then dismantled a nuclear program .
The summit 's goal is to get an agreement and working plan on how each of the participating countries will control nuclear materials or otherwise prevent their spread , Clinton said on the CBS program " Face the Nation . "
White House press secretary Robert Gibbs announced last week that nations participating in the summit would be Algeria , Argentina , Armenia , Australia , Belgium , Brazil , Canada , Chile , China , the Czech Republic , Egypt , Finland , France , Georgia , Germany , India , Indonesia , Israel , Italy , Japan , Jordan , Kazakhstan , Malaysia , Mexico , Morocco , Netherlands , New Zealand , Nigeria , Norway , Pakistan , Philippines , Poland , the Republic of Korea , the Russian Federation , Saudi Arabia , Singapore , Switzerland , South Africa , Spain , Sweden , Thailand , Turkey , United Arab Emirates , the United Kingdom , Ukraine and Vietnam .
In addition , the United Nations , the European Union and the International Atomic Energy Agency will be represented at the summit , Gibbs said .
Obama also is holding bilateral meetings with some of the visiting heads of state , which started Sunday afternoon with Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh , followed by President Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan , South African President Jacob Zuma , Prime Minister Yusuf Raza Gilani of Pakistan and acting President Goodluck Jonathan of Nigeria .
Obama 's nuclear strategy has been criticized by Republicans as too weak in the face of threats and defiance by Iran and North Korea .
" While the treaty [ with Russia ] may be in the right direction and the nuclear summit that 's coming to town may be an impressive group of people , the nuclear posture statement that the president put out is troublesome to me , " Republican Sen.
Lamar Alexander of Tennessee said on the " Fox News Sunday " program . " I mean , it takes away the ambiguity about our use of nuclear power .
Ambiguity in foreign policy is sometimes very useful . "
On Sunday , Iran 's state - run Islamic Republic News Agency reported that Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said the Obama administration " poses a threat to international peace " and is " wicked and untrustworthy . "
Khamenei made the remarks Sunday in a meeting with the Armed Forces chief of staff and other top military officials , according to IRNA .
According to the news agency , Khamenei said Obama had recently threatened Iran with nuclear weapons and called for Iran 's military to prepare itself .
Khamenei apparently was referring to last week 's announced shift in U.S. nuclear strategy , in which the administration said it would swear off developing new generations of nuclear weapons and would not use its existing arsenal to attack non-nuclear states that are in compliance with nonproliferation agreements .
Gates made clear Sunday that the new policy left Iran vulnerable to a U.S. nuclear attack because Iran refuses to comply with nonproliferation agreements .
" All options are on the table " regarding Iran and North Korea , which also defies international regulations , Gates said on the CBS program .
Clinton defended the Obama administration 's policy of seeking a unified international response to Iran 's nuclear ambitions , including stronger U.N. sanctions .
The policy , which broke with President George W. Bush 's nonnegotiation stance , has exposed Iran 's intransigence , Clinton said on the NBC program .
Now , with the U.N. negotiations on tougher sanctions , " the Iranians have been beating down the doors of every country in the world to try to avoid " a new sanctions resolution , Clinton said .
However , when asked whether Iran had the capability now to develop a nuclear weapon , Clinton avoided a direct answer , saying it was unclear .
Gates had no hesitation , declaring immediately that " it 's our judgment here they are not nuclear capable . "
" We 're doing everything we can to try and keep Iran from developing nuclear weapons , " Gates said , adding that there probably would be another Security Council resolution with tougher sanctions on Iran .
He called such a resolution important on its own and as a legal platform for others to take their own steps .
" At the end of the day , Iran has to decide that not having nuclear weapons is a better defense strategy than having them , " Gates said .

The experts at East Anglia and CRU told us in 2000 that :
( March , 2000 ) According to Dr David Viner , a senior research scientist at the climatic research unit ( CRU ) of the University of East Anglia , within a few years winter snowfall will become “ a very rare and exciting event ” .
“ Children just are n’t going to know what snow is , ” he said .
David Parker , at the Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research in Berkshire , says ultimately , British children could have only virtual experience of snow .
Via the internet , they might wonder at polar scenes – or eventually “ feel ” virtual cold .
The 255 experts at the AAAS denouncing “ climate deniers ” in an open letter described this past winter in these cleverly sarcastic terms :
The planet is warming due to increased concentrations of heat - trapping gases in our atmosphere .
A snowy winter in Washington does not alter this fact .
I appreciate that government bureaucrats believe that there is no world outside Washington , yet nature has given us the opportunity to grade both the predictive and observational skills of the experts .
And it looks like they deserve a rather poor grade .
According to data collected by Rutgers University Global Snow Lab , this past October through March period was the snowiest on record in the Northern Hemisphere – with an average monthly snow cover of 39,720,106 km2 .
Second place occurred in 1970 at 39,574,224 km2 .
‘
We also know that the past decade had the snowiest winters on record .
A month ago I discussed an AGW sacred cow – Glacier National Park .
At that time , a WUWT reader ( Craig Moore ) expressed his concern about the lack of snowcover in Montana this year .
The good news for Craig is that as of yesterday , snowpack in Montana is 98 % of normal .
California is 117 % of normal .
Arizona is 175 % of normal .
Wyoming is 101 % of normal , etc .
Every good and conscientious citizen knows that snow cover is disappearing due to global warming .
Google turns up over 100,000 hits on that topic .
This is what the disappearing snowcover looked like in my neighborhood yesterday morning .
With lots more cold and snow on the way .

BGP - Nachbarn ( sogenannte " Peers " ) vertrauen einander – und darauf , dass annoncierte Routen ihre Richtigkeit haben .
Dass dem nicht immer so ist , zeigt nicht nur der jüngste Vorfall .
Bereits Anfang 2008 hatte ein pakistanischer Provider mittels BGP YouTube praktisch aus dem Internet verschwinden lassen .
Solche Vorfälle wecken Zweifel am " Beweismittel IP - Adresse " .
Die Strafverfolgung konzentriert sich ausschließlich auf IP - Adressen ( in Verbindung mit Zeitstempeln zur Vermeidung von Fehlern in dynamisch zugewiesenen Adressbereichen ) .
Kein Gegenstand der Untersuchung ist jedoch , ob eine IP - Adresse zum Zeitpunkt der Straftat durch gefälschte BGP - Routen " entführt " worden war .
Eine IP - Adresse kann durch so eine " Entführung " je nach Provider über verschiedene Routen zu verschiedenen Zielen führen – also mehrfach sichtbar sein .
Ermittlungen richten sich in einem solchen Fall gegen Unschuldige .
Nur wenn andere , handfestere Belege als nur die IP - Adresse für eine eindeutige Schuld vorliegen , kann man zweifellos davon ausgehen , dass hier eben keine " IP - Adress - Entführung " vorliegt .
Nur in Verbindung mit vollständigen BGP - Routing - Informationen beider involvierter Provider zum Zeitpunkt der Straftat kann eine IP - Adresse allein so aussagekräftig sein , wie es ihr derzeit in der Praxis und entgegen dem Prinzip " in dubio pro reo " zugebilligt wird .
Fest steht , dass das BGP - System hundertprozentig sicher werden muss .
Einen effektiven Schutz bieten zum Beispiel kryptografische Verfahren .
Einfacher ist es jedoch , wenn alle Carrier die via BGP akzeptierten Routen dynamisch mit den Datenbanken der regionalen Internet - Registries ( RIR ) abgleichen .
Die dort vorhandenen Objekt - Typen " route " in Verbindung mit " origin " - Einträgen und AS - Nummern oder AS - Sets und den ohnehin vorhandenen Authentifizierungsmechanismen bieten einen ausreichenden Schutz gegen Fälschungen .
Wenn alle ( insbesondere die großen ) Carrier falsche Routen ablehnen und nicht propagieren , gehören Szenarien wie die genannten der Vergangenheit an , und falsche Routen verteilen sich nur noch in sowieso unsicheren Teilnetzen .

[ Michel Bauwens has kindly invited me to serialize excerpts from my forthcoming book The Homebrew Industrial Revolution : A Low - Overhead Manifesto .
Over the next several weeks , I will post two excerpts from each chapter ( one excerpt a week ) . ]
Chapter One . A Wrong Turn ( first excerpt )
Lewis Mumford , in Technics and Civilization , divided the progress of technological development since late medieval times into three considerably overlapping periods ( or phases ) : the eotechnic , paleotechnic , and neotechnic .
The original technological revolution of the late Middle Ages , the eotechnic , was associated with the skilled craftsmen of the free towns , and eventually incorporated the fruits of investigation by the early scientists .
It began with agricultural innovations like the horse collar , horseshoe and crop rotation .
It achieved great advances in the use of wood and glass , masonry , and paper ( the latter including the printing press ) .
The agricultural advances of the early second millennium were further built on by the innovations of market gardeners in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries — like , for example , raised bed horticulture , composting and intensive soil development , and the hotbeds and greenhouses made possible by advances in cheap production of glass .
In mechanics , in particular , its greatest achievements were clockwork machinery and the intensive application of water and wind power .
The first and most important prerequisite of machine production was the transmission of power and control of movement by use of meshed gears … .
Paleotechnic had its origins in the new centralized state and the industries closely associated with it ( most notably mining and armaments ) , and centered on mining , iron , coal , and steam power .
To give some indication of the loci of the paleotechnic institutional complex , the steam engine was first introduced for pumping water out of mines , and its need for fuel in turn reinforced the significance of the coal industry ; the first appearance of large - scale factory production was in the armaments industry .
The paleotechnic culminated in the “ dark satanic mills ” of the nineteenth century and the giant corporations of the late nineteenth and early twentieth … .
Although the paleotechnic incorporated some contributions from the eotechnic period , it was a fundamental departure in direction , and involved the abandonment of a rival path of development .
Technology was developed in the interests of the new royal absolutists , mercantilist industry and the factory system that grew out of it , and the new capitalist agriculturists ( especially the Whig oligarchy of England ) ; it incorporated only those eotechnic contributions that were compatible with the new tyrannies , and abandoned the rest … .
Much of the centralization of paleotechnic industry resulted , in addition to the authoritarian institutional culture associated with its origins , from the need … to economize on power … .
[ Gigantism ] was … abetted by the difficulties of economic power production with small steam engines : so the engineers tended to crowd as many productive units as possible on the same shaft , or within the range of steam pressure through pipes limited enough to avoid excessive condensation losses .
The driving of the individual machines in the plant from a single shaft made it necessary to spot the machines along the shafting , without close adjustment to the topographical needs of the work itself … .
[ Lewis Mumford , Technics and History ]
Steam power meant that machinery had to be concentrated in one place , in order to get the maximum use out of a single prime mover .
The typical paleotechnic factory , through the early 20th century , had machines lined up in long rows , “ a forest of leather belts one arising from each machine , looping around a long metal shaft running the length of the shop , ” all dependent on the factory ’s central power plant .
[ William Waddell and Norman Bodek , The Rebirth of American Industry : A Study of Lean Management ]
The neotechnic revolution of the late nineteenth century put an end to all these imperatives .
If the paleotechnic was a “ coal - and - iron complex , ” in Mumford ’s terminology , the neotechic was an “ electricity - and - alloy complex . ”
The defining features of the neotechnic were the decentralized production made possible by electricity , and the light weight and ephemeralization ( to borrow a term from Buckminster Fuller ) made possible by the light metals .
The beginning of the neotechnic period was associated , most importantly , with the invention of the prerequisites for electrical power — the dynamo , the alternator , the storage cell , the electric motor — and the resulting possibility of scaling electrically powered production machinery to the small shop , or even scaling power tools to household production .
Electricity made possible the use of virtually any form of energy , indirectly , as a prime mover for production : combustibles of all kinds , sun , wind , water , even temperature differentials .
As it became possible to run free - standing machines with small electric motors , the central rationale for the factory system disappeared .
“ In general , ” as Paul Goodman wrote , “ the change from coal and steam to electricity and oil has relaxed one of the greatest causes for concentration of machinery around a single driving shaft . ”
[ Paul and Percival Goodman , Communitas : Means of Livelihood and Ways of Life ]
The decentralizing potential of small - scale , electrically powered machinery was a common theme among many writers from the late 19th century on .
That , and the merging of town and village it made possible , were the central themes of Kropotkin ’s Fields , Factories and Workshops .
With electricity “ distributed in the houses for bringing into motion small motors of from one - quarter to twelve horse - power , ” it was possible to produce in small workshops and even homes .
Freeing machinery up from a single prime mover ended all limits on the location of machine production .
The primary basis for economy of scale , as it existed in the nineteenth century , was the need to economize on horsepower — a justification that vanished when the distribution of electrical power eliminated reliance on a single source of power .
The introduction of electrical power , in short , put small - scale machine production on an equal footing with machine production in the factory .
The introduction of the electric motor worked a transformation within the plant itself .
For the electric motor created flexibility in the design of the factory : not merely could individual units be placed where they were wanted , and not merely could they be designed for the particular work needed : but the direct drive , which increased the efficiency of the motor , also made it possible to alter the layout of the plant itself as needed .
The installation of motors removed the belts which cut off light and lowered efficiency , and opened the way for the rearrangement of machines in functional units without regard for the shafts and aisles of the old - fashioned factory : each unit could work at its own rate of speed , and start and stop to suit its own needs , without power losses through the operation of the plant as a whole .
.
… [ T ] he efficiency of small units worked by electric motors utilizing current either from local turbines or from a central power plant has given small - scale industry a new lease on life : on a purely technical basis it can , for the first time since the introduction of the steam engine , compete on even terms with the larger unit .
Even domestic production has become possible again through the use of electricity : for if the domestic grain grinder is less efficient , from a purely mechanical standpoint , than the huge flour mills of Minneapolis , it permits a nicer timing of production to need , so that it is no longer necessary to consume bolted white flours because whole wheat flours deteriorate more quickly and spoil if they are ground too long before they are sold and used .
To be efficient , the small plant need not remain in continuous operation nor need it produce gigantic quantities of foodstuffs and goods for a distant market : it can respond to local demand and supply ; it can operate on an irregular basis , since the overhead for permanent staff and equipment is proportionately smaller ; it can take advantage of smaller wastes of time and energy in transportation , and by face to face contact it can cut out the inevitable red-tape of even efficient large organizations .
[ Mumford , Technics and Civilization ]
Mumford ’s comments on flour milling also anticipated the significance of small - scale powered machinery in making possible what later became known as “ lean production ” ; its central principle is that overall flow is more important to cost - cutting than maximizing the efficiency of any particular stage in isolation .
The modest increases in unit production cost at each separate stage are offset not only by greatly reduced transportation costs , but by avoiding the large eddies in overall production flow ( buffer stocks of goods - in - process , warehouses full of goods “ sold ” to inventory without any orders , etc. ) that result when production is not geared to demand .
Neotechnic methods , which could be reproduced anywhere , made possible a society where “ the advantages of modern industry [ would ] be spread , not by transport — as in the nineteenth century — but by local development . ”
The spread of technical knowledge and standardized methods would make transportation far less important .
[ Mumford , Technics and Civilization ]
Mumford also described , in quite Kropotkinian terms , the “ marriage of town and country , of industry and agriculture , ” that could result from the application of further refined eotechnic horticultural techniques and the decentralization of manufacturing in the neotechnic age .
Mumford saw the neotechnic phase as a continuation of the principles of the eotechnic , with industrial organization taking the form it would have done if allowed to develop directly from the eotechnic without interruption .
The neotechnic , in a sense , is a resumption of the lines of development of the original eotechnic revolution , following the paleotechnic interruption .
The neotechnic differs from the paleotechnic phase almost as white differs from black .
But on the other hand , it bears the same relation to the eotechnic phase as the adult form does to the baby … .
Mumford suggested that , absent the abrupt break created by the new centralized states and their state capitalist clients , the eotechnic might have evolved directly into the neotechnic .
Had not the eotechnic been aborted by the paleotechnic , a full - scale modern industrial revolution would still almost certainly have come about “ had not a ton of coal been dug in England , and had not a new iron mine been opened . ”
The amount of work accomplished by wind and water power compared quite favorably with that of the steam - powered industrial revolution .
Indeed , the great advances in textile output of the eighteenth century were made with water - powered factories ; steam power was adopted only later .
The Fourneyron water - turbine , perfected in 1832 , was the first prime - mover to exceed the poor 5 % or 10 % efficiencies of the early steam engine , and was a logical development of earlier water - power technology that would likely have followed much earlier in due course , had not the development of water - power been sidetracked by the paleotechnic revolution .
Had the spoonwheel of the seventeenth century developed more rapidly into Fourneyron ’s efficient water - turbine , water might have remained the backbone of the power system until electricity had developed sufficiently to give it a wider area of use … .
[ Ralph ] Borsodi speculated , along lines similar to Mumford ’s , on the different direction things might have taken had the eotechnic phase been developed to its full potential without being aborted by the paleotechnic :
It is impossible to form a sound conclusion as to the value to mankind of this institution which the Arkwrights , the Watts , and the Stephensons had brought into being if we confine ourselves to a comparison of the efficiency of the factory system of production with the efficiency of the processes of production which prevailed before the factory appeared . .
A very different comparison must be made . .
We must suppose that the inventive and scientific discoveries of the past two centuries had not been used to destroy the methods of production which prevailed before the factory . .
We must suppose that an amount of thought and ingenuity precisely equal to that used in developing the factory had been devoted to the development of domestic , custom , and guild production . .
We must suppose that the primitive domestic spinning wheel had been gradually developed into more and more efficient domestic machines ; that primitive looms , churns , cheese presses , candle molds , and primitive productive apparatus of all kinds had been perfected step by step without sacrifice of the characteristic “ domesticity ” which they possessed . .
In short , we must suppose that science and invention had devoted itself to making domestic and handicraft production efficient and economical , instead of devoting itself almost exclusively to the development of factory machines and factory production . .
The factory - dominated civilization of today would never have developed .
Factories would not have invaded those fields of manufacture where other methods of production could be utilized .
Only the essential factory would have been developed .
Instead of great cities , lined with factories and tenements , we should have innumerable small towns filled with the homes and workshops of neighborhood craftsmen .
Cities would be political , commercial , educational , and entertainment centers … .
Efficient domestic implements and machines developed by centuries of scientific improvement would have eliminated drudgery from the home and the farm .
[ Ralph Borsodi , This Ugly Civilization ]
And , we might add , the home production machinery itself would have been manufactured , not in Sloanist mass - production factories , but mainly in small factories and shops integrating power machinery into craft production .
NEW DELHI , May 21 ( UPI ) -- New Delhi police said thieves are pouring sleep - inducing gas into air conditioning units to knock out homeowners during burglaries .
Investigators said the thieves pour the gas into the window - mounted units , which fan air through wet grass , and wait for homeowners to fall asleep before relieving them of their valuables , Sky News reported Friday .

The gang took about $ 11,500 worth of cash and jewelry from a home this week and made off with $ 20,000 in of cash and goods earlier in the month .
Police said one of the victims reported a " revolting odor " coming from the air conditioning unit .
" The investigations are on and we have sent the water sample for testing and efforts are on to nab the people behind the crime , " a police spokesman said .
Are Iranian Ships heading to Gaza or not ?
The Red Crescent of Iran says NO ….. saying “ Iran has been bluffing all along and never had any intention to send any aid ship to Gaza ” He added : “ Iran is jealous that , following the May 31st flotilla attack Turkey is taking over as Gaza ’s main champion in the region ” .
Nine people were killed by Israeli commandos including a Turkish - American .
HERE
That is taken from a Report that can be read
The following was announced this evening on Iranian State Television … .
Iran ’s state television reported that an Iranian ship called Infants of Gaza would sail Sunday for Gaza carrying 1,100 tons of relief supplies and 10 pro-Palestinian activists .
Israel is ‘ concerned ’ that Iran ’s plans are not ‘ humanitarian ’ and are obviously preparing for a confrontation ….
Iran said Tuesday it would send a blockade - busting ship carrying aid and pro-Palestinian activists to Gaza , fueling concern in Israel , where commandos were training for another possible confrontation at sea .
Israel ’s Foreign Ministry , however , voiced doubts regarding the humanitarian goals of the expedition .
Israel has warned Iran to drop the plan .
The Iranian announcement came days after Israel eased its three - year - old blockade of Gaza under international pressure following its deadly raid on a Gaza - bound flotilla last month .
“ No one in their right mind can believe that a ship sent by the ayatollahs and their Revolutionary Guards has anything to do with humanitarian aid , ” said Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Yigal Palmor .
“ I do n’t think there is one single country in this region and beyond that would let such an ayatollah ship come near its coasts . ”
The IDF Chief was quoted as saying this evening that “ We ca n’t let Gaza become an Iranian port ”

It ’s all a wait and see situation at this point …..
The fear that began in Athens , raced through Europe and finally shook the stock market in the United States is now affecting the broader global economy , from the ability of Asian corporations to raise money to the outlook for money - market funds where American savers park their cash .
What was once a local worry about the debt burden of one of Europe ’s smallest economies has quickly gone global .
Already , jittery investors have forced Brazil to scale back bond sales as interest rates soared and caused currencies in Asia like the Korean won to weaken .
Ten companies around the world that had planned to issue stock delayed their offerings , the most in a single week since October 2008 .
The increased global anxiety threatens to slow the recovery in the United States , where job growth has finally picked up after the deepest recession since the Great Depression .
It could also inhibit consumer spending as stock portfolios shrink and loans are harder to come by .
“ It ’s not just a European problem , it ’s the U.S. , Japan and the U.K. right now , ” said Ian Kelson , a bond fund manager in London with T. Rowe Price .
“ It ’s across the board . ”
If you have navigated to Android.com within the past few days you may have noticed some slight changes .
Google ’s first - party Android Market web browser has been tweaked allowing you to browse through Featured , Top Free , and Top Paid apps with a bit more ease .
If you ’re like me , you probably have n’t been to the Android Market website since you first got an Android phone and then realized there were other third - party sites that made online app browsing a lot easier .
But seeing that there is some work going on behind the scenes might mean bigger changes rolling out in the near future .
There have been indications that there will be significant changes in the Android Market app when Froyo launches , and it would n’t be too far - fetched to think Google would be timing a complete revamp of their web portal to coincide .
There has n’t been too much buzz in terms of full - on search capabilities , but I would n’t call it out of the question .

In a previous post I may have given the impression that I advocate .22 Long rifle as a defensive caliber .
If that was the case , I wish to correct that impression .
In a rifle or a handgun , a well aimed .22 bullet is adequate for taking squirrels and other small game .
It is true that a face full of .22 ammo will cause most attackers to cease their activities .
It is also true that the .22 has taken more lives than any other caliber .
I am against .22 ammo for self defense for several reasons .
It 's incapacitation record is low .
The .22 is on record as having caused more deaths than any other caliber .
The deaths all to often occur long after the gun was fired , and the statistics are skewed by the sheer volume of .22 caliber weapons in existence however .
Most of these deaths are due to accidents , not attacks .
The argument for " a faceful of . 22 " holds just as true as the argument for a faceful of .40S&W .
What is lost on many novices is the actual dynamics of self defense .
With a .22 pistol , it would take seven well aimed shots to inject the same lead volume of one bullet of .45ACP .
Those seven shots take time , and the cumulative effect may not be reached until minutes or even hours later .
People have been shot in the face with a .22 and lived .
While you are squeezing off your second and third shot , your attacker will not be just standing there waiting for more .
They will be continuing the attack , or making it a lot more difficult to shoot them again .
Before a jury , seven shots to the face with a 22 caliber weapon has a much greater impact than one shot to the face with a 45 .
When one must defend their actions in a court of law , the number of shots often hold great significance with jury members who do not understand the dynamics of self defense .
To a jury , seven shots of anything to the face is horrible overkill .
One 12 gauge blast to center mass with a duck gun is restraint .
Never mind the ballistics or other facts involved , it 's the impression the attorneys are able to exploit and the jury develops that affects the verdict .
To survive a lethal encounter intact , a person must also survive the legal entanglements afterwards .
The first shot in a gunfight is often the defining shot of a gunfight .
When that shot is made in self defense , it needs to have maximum impact on the aggressor .
That is why I advocate the 12 gauge shotgun for the home and the .45ACP or .40S&W for carry .
None of my preferred self defense weapons force the defender to shoot the attacker in the face multiple times to increase the chances of survival .
All have the capability of stopping an attacker with a center of mass shot .
Of course , as shown in the George Temple incident , multiple COM hits of .45 ACP may not be enough .
There are many articles written by men more knowledgeable than I on the various aspects of ammo and caliber selection .
I will defer to their expertise when it comes to muzzle energy and other variables such as Relative Incapacitation Index .. 22 Long Rifle ammunition is notorious for it 's inconsistency in ignition , as is any rimfire cartridge .
This inconsistency in ignition is as unacceptable in a defensive gun as having tires that may not stay inflated on your car .
When a life is on the line , any history of ammunition failure is unacceptable .
All guns depend on one variable for stopping a determined attacker .
That variable is user input , the willingness to use the weapon and the capability the shooter possesses for hitting their target .
If the defender refuses to shoot , or is a poor marksman , a grenade launcher will not have any impact .
The .22 handgun is better than a pointy stick if one needs a tool to defend one 's life .
A larger caliber is better than the .22 though .
The .22 pistol is a fantastic tool to get acquainted with firearms and learn marksmanship with .
The Ruger MKII and Browning Buckmark are accurate , and inexpensive to buy and shoot .
That allows a person to shoot them a lot .
The volume of shooting with an accurate , low recoil gun is what allows a person to develop into a superior marksman the fastest .
At least that is what I have seen .

Quarterback Daunte Culpepper is on the verge of going from the NFL's Detroit Lions to the UFL's Sacramento Mountain Lions .
Culpepper and the Mountain Lions are putting the finishing touches on a deal that will make him one of the league 's marquee names , according to sources familiar with the talks .
Culpepper will be one of the first big - name players to jump from the NFL to the UFL this offseason , according to sources .
Signing with Sacramento will reunite Culpepper with Dennis Green , the Mountain Lions ' coach and general manager .
The two men worked together in Minnesota and enjoyed some of their greatest professional successes together .
Culpepper 's first full season as a starter in the NFL came under Green in 2000 , when the quarterback threw for a league - leading 33 touchdowns and rushed for seven more .
He said : " During the dress rehearsal of Godot , I crouched by the stage door of the Comedy Theatre , getting some air , my bowler hat at my feet ( and ) seeing an unkempt old man down on his luck , a passer - by said , ' Need some help , brother ? ' and put a dollar in my hat . "

De skyter og bruker granater .
De har tatt folk til gissel inne i moskeen i Garhi Shahu , sa Muszhar Ahmen i det pakistanske sivilforsvaret til nyhetsbyrået AFP .
Fredagsbønnen i to ulike moskéer i Lahore , tilhørende den muslimske minoriteten Ahmadi , ble i dag avbrutt av angripere .
I ettermiddag norsk tid er foreløpig 80 mennesker bekreftet døde .
Det pakistanske politiet sier de har sikret begge bygningene , men at de fremdeles leter etter to militante som klarte å rømme fra åstedene .
Mistenker Taliban Lahore har vært gjenstand for en rekke militante angrep .
BBC melder at ingen foreløpig har tatt på seg ansvaret for angrepet , men Ali Dayan Hassan fra Human Rights Watch forteller BBC at Pakistansk Taliban mistenkes å stå bak .
Geo News melder på sin side at den pakistanske delen av Taliban , TTP , har sagt at gruppen står bak angrepet mot én av moskeene .

Lokalmyndihetene i byen opplyser at angriperne hadde på seg selvmordsvester , og at de både bruke håndvåpen og granater .
« Vantro » Ali Dayan Hassan mener moskégjengerne var enkle bytter for militante Sunni - grupper .
For dem er Ahmadiene vantro , fordi Ahmadiene tror at deres grunnlegger , Mirza Ghulam Ahmad som døde i 1908 , var en profet og at han var varslet i Koranen .
Dette er blasfemisk ifølge sunniene , som regner Muhammad som den siste profet .
Ifølge menneskerettsgrupper ofte blir Ahmadiene i Lahore ofte utsatt for trusler og angrep .
Muhammed - tegninger Angrepene kommer etter at en Facebook - gruppe som inviterte medlemmer til å tegne profeten Muhammad skapte kontroverser og raseri i Pakistan .
Å gjengi profeten på bilder blir regnet som blasfemisk .
Ifølge BBCs korrespondent i Islamabad , Aleem Maqbool sier politiet at de fleste av personene som ble holdt fanget inne i moskéen i det tett befolkede Garhi Shahu - området lyktes i å rømme .
I det finere nabolaget Model Town var angrepet over på kort tid .
Bekymrede norsk - pakistanere Mange norsk - pakistanere kommer fra Lahore , men ifølge kommunikasjonsrådgiver Bjørn Svenungsen i UD har trolig ingen nordmenn omkommet .

Flere har vært i kontakt med folk der og fått bekreftet at slektninger har blitt drept og skadet , sier Anas til Dagbladet .
- Vi blir forfulgt mange steder i verden .
Akkurat nå sitter det for eksempel ti av våre i et fengsel i Egypt , på tredje måned uten rett og dom .
Vi ber til Gud om at situasjonen bedres , sier Anas .

If there ’s one Linux company that has seen lots of ups and downs it ’s the Paris - based Mandriva S.A .
They have a great distribution , but as a company , they ’ve always been on shaky grounds .
First a rumour , now confirmed : the company has put itself up for sale – which , as the community points out , is n’t necessarily a bad thing .
DistroWatch highlighted the news , but tuxmachines.org already covered it the day before .
The gist of the story , originating from the French Mandriva forums , is that the financial situation has deteriorated rapidly this year , and selling the company is the only remaining option .
Two candidates are mentioned : the London - based lightapp Ltd , and Linagora from France .
The news is confirmed by Linagora itself , who posted a statement on their website , in French .
My French is good enough to understand what the statement says ; Linagora is looking to strenghten its position in France and the rest of the world , and is in negotiations with Mandriva regarding an acquisition .
Heck , even if you ’ve never studied French , you should get the gist here .
“ LINAGORA est un acteur majeur de l’innovation et de l’Ã©dition Open Source et , est ainsi Ã la recherche de toutes les opportunitÃ ©s pour dÃ©velopper et renforcer sa position de leadership en France et dans le monde , ” the statement reads , “ A ce titre , des discussions sont en cours avec Mandriva pour Ã©tudier le rachat d’une partie des actifs de la sociÃ©tÃ© . ”
This does n’t have to be a bad thing , the Mandriva community points out .
“ Folks , just because they ’re looking to sell does n’t mean it ’s necessarily bad , ” writes ruel24 , “ Honestly , Mandriva has never had a business sense about them .
They make a great distro , and always have .
What they lack is capital and direction , and hopefully someone will provide both . ”
Time will tell .
Luckily , this is an open source company , so the Mandriva distribution will still be developed by the community no matter what the corporate future brings .
* Report says small - business lending severely cut back
* Says more information needed on impact on small firms
WASHINGTON , May 13 ( Reuters ) - The U.S. government ’s program to bail out the banking industry is not be doing much to help small businesses play a part in the economic recovery , an overseer of the government ’s bailout program said on Thursday .
In its latest monthly report on the $ 700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program ( TARP ) , the Congressional Oversight Panel said small - business credit remains severely constrained and the Treasury Department needs to gather more information on the program ’s impact on small firms .
“ Treasury did not collect good information when it put money in the hands of the banks initially and it has n’t collected good information throughout this process , ” said Oversight Panel chief Elizabeth Warren .
“ Without good data policymakers are flying blind . ”
Warren said lending to small businesses has been severely cut back , much more than lending to large firms .
“ Without these small businesses there will be no meaningful economic recovery , ” she said .
The Congressional Oversight Panel was set up to monitor the bailout program and provide regular reports to Congress .
The May report said it remains unclear whether the TARP programs managed by the Treasury Department “ can or will play a major role in putting small businesses on the path to growth . ”
Small businesses are crucial to the overall economic recovery as they as they account for two out of every three jobs created in the economy , the report said .
The report said that the largest TARP program , the Capital Purchase Program ( CPP ) , provided hundreds of billions of dollars of new capital to banks but that Treasury did not require recipients to use the money to improve access to credit .
President Barack Obama has proposed providing some $ 30 billion to help provide low - cost loans to small businesses , but even if the proposal is enacted into law it may be too late to help small businesses contribute to the economic recovery , the report said .
The oversight panel ’s report said it was unclear whether the cutback in lending reflected weak demand for credit from small businesses or a shortfall of loans available for smaller firms .

The previous lawnmower land speed record was 80.792mph ( 130.022 km / h ) set in America - Mr Wales was recorded as reaching 86.069mph .
His team are now due to return to the same spot on Sunday in a bid to break the 100 mph barrier .
Those making a bid for the record must drive over a measured mile in one direction and return within an hour .
Any of the motorised grass cutters taking part must also be built primarily from lawnmower parts .
Mr Wales 's grandfather was Sir Malcolm Campbell who broke the world land speed record , in a car , at the same venue in 1924 .
The record attempt , named Project RunningBlade , has been led by the National Motor Museum in Beaulieu , Hampshire .
American Bob Cleveland set the previous land speed record on a lawn - mower at Bonneville Salt Flats , Utah , and was present at Saturday 's run in Wales .
The record attempt also raised funds for Great Ormond Street Hospital for Sick Children and Wessex Heartbeat .
Armageddon , brought to you by the FCC
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Your Internet bill will go up $ 50 a month !
You wo n't be able to access your favorite Web site !
Your Internet connection is going to slow to a crawl !
That 's just some of the rhetoric and doomsday scenarios flying back and forth over the contentious subject of " Net neutrality . "
Many of the sky - is - falling , self - serving arguments are standard Washington lobby shop speak , but the reality is quite different .
The talk heated up last week , after the Federal Communications Commission proposed regulatory changes that would give it a say in how the Internet is delivered to consumers .
Under the mandate , dubbed " Net neutrality , " the FCC would require Internet providers , like phone and cable companies , to treat all Web content equally .
That would prevent providers from restricting access to certain sites or applications , or even collecting fees to deliver some sites faster than others .
On one side , the Googles ( GOOG , Fortune 500 ) , Yahoos ( YHOO , Fortune 500 ) , Amazons ( AMZN , Fortune 500 ) and eBays ( EBAY , Fortune 500 ) of the world say Net neutrality is crucial because it would foster an environment where cool new things on the Web could develop , and it would prevent Internet providers from blocking access to sites like Hulu and YouTube that carry a heavy strain on the network .
It would also prevent Internet providers that own media companies from favoring their own content over others ' .
On the other side , the Comcasts ( CMCSA , Fortune 500 ) , AT&Ts ( T , Fortune 500 ) , Verizons ( VZ , Fortune 500 ) and Time Warner Cables ( TWC , Fortune 500 ) of the world say they have been able to provide very good and increasingly better Internet access to customers without any regulation from the FCC .
They say Net neutrality would slow down their Internet service and that the costs would be too prohibitive .
Independent analysts say there are elements of truth to both arguments .
" There appears to be very little risk that broadband service providers would severely discriminate against traffic or content from competing companies , " said Daniel Hays , partner at consultancy PRTM .
" But the flip side of that is the reality that they want to be able to discriminate against applications and users that unfairly clog their networks . "
Here 's a quick look at some of the changes you might see if Congress approves the FCC 's proposals :
Will my Internet bill go up ?
Your broadband service probably wo n't cost more than the incremental amount your bill already goes up every year .
" It 's unclear how any regulatory changes might get back to consumers , " said Doug Williams , broadband analyst at Forrester Research .
" That sounds like a lot of saber rattling on the part of the carriers . "
But it 's not just the carriers touting higher prices .
An independent Frost & Sullivan study found that a Net neutrality law could raise consumers ' broadband bills by $ 10 to $ 50 a month .
Here 's why .
Regulation would make providing Internet service less cost - effective for broadband companies , according to the study .
That means companies would likely stop building out their networks .
However , if the FCC decided to force carriers to continue increasing capacity and service , those costs would be passed onto consumers .
Cable and phone companies have been using the report to fight the FCC 's proposal .
But the study is based on the assumption that the FCC would propose broader and stricter regulations than the ones it actually has proposed .
In fact , historical precedent also suggests the Frost & Sullivan study is far fetched : After AT&T merged with Bell South in late 2006 , the FCC subjected AT&T to a two - year Net neutrality rule .
During that time , AT&T 's broadband prices did not rise , and AT&T actually invested more in their infrastructure on their own volition .
" Empirically , it does n't prove to be the case that increased regulations will result in higher consumer prices , " said Markham Erikson , executive director of the Open Internet Coalition , a group that supports Net neutrality .
How would it impact my service ?
Net neutrality would force Internet providers to provide their customers with access to any Web site .
But that 's what the broadband companies have been doing for years -- without any regulation .
It 's an extraordinarily rare occurrence when a service provider denies its customers access to a Web site , app or program .
Comcast 's temporary block on some peer - to - peer networks that were clogging up its network in 2007 is one of the only examples .
Some mobile companies have also instituted restrictions , like AT&T 's ban of the Sling media app on the iPhone and Verizon 's blocking of pro-abortion text messages in 2007 .
" Excluding content providers does not make good business sense , especially with a growing number of alternatives , like 4G , " said Mike Jude , analyst at Frost & Sullivan .
Analysts said it 's much more likely that broadband providers will begin charging customers for the amount of data they download , just like wireless companies charge more for packages with a greater number of minutes .
Since a
Net neutrality law would ensure that customers can download or upload whatever they please , some are worried that users will soon experience system bottlenecks that slow down their Internet speeds ( think AT&T and the iPhone ) .
But carriers , including AT&T , continue to spend billions of dollars a year improving network capacity , and the communications industry has been resilient about making improvements during tougher regulatory periods in the past .
" Ultimately , we 're talking about very large broadband pipes out there , which can provide 100 megabit speeds , " said Jude .
" Is Net neutrality a concern ?
Yes , but that does n't supercede the carriers ' purpose of deploying the network in the first place . "
A comic rolls in from our brains and onto the internet even though Wes was preoccupied with a ball of entropy covered in fur while Tony woke up with a tremendous beard .
An international survey , carried out by our friends at Heineken , has seen England claim an early success as Fabio Capello ’s team prepares for this summer ’s FIFA World Cup in South Africa – with football fans in this country been crowned world champions when it comes to passion for the game .
England supporters beat off strong competition from footballing heavyweights including Brazil , Spain , Germany and Holland to claim the title .
According to the Heineken research , English football fans spend more time talking , watching and reading about football than any other nation on the planet .
The study found the typical Englishman watches televised football for an average of two hours and 22 minutes every week .
They also spend another three hours and 21 minutes chatting about the latest results , goals or transfer gossip with their mates .
If that was n’t enough to then the normal supporter in England will also read up on the latest gossip , team news and match action for an astonishing three hours and 52 minutes over the course of a week .
The research , which was carried out with 5,300 men aged between 25 and 40 in 15 countries , saw England top the table ahead of fans from Thailand .
World Cup favourites Spain came in sixth with five times winner Brazil in third place .
The Germans were a ruthlessly efficient 11th .
A big shock perhaps was the Dutch , with their famously fervent Orange Army , placed bottom of the league .
Clearly your typical Dutch fan has more things on his mind than just football .
The ‘ football mad ’ league table * in full was as follows :
Talking Reading Watching
1. England 3hr 21 min 2hr 22 min 3hr 52min
2. Thailand 3hr 2 min 2hr 15 min 3hr 2min

The KDevelop Hackers are proud and happy to announce that KDevelop 4.0 is finally available as a stable release .
Released together is the first version of KDevelop PHP plugins , which make KDevelop a very interesting option for PHP developers .
Features
KDevelop 4.0 comes with lots of features already , even though some things had to be dropped compared to the 3.5 series due to time constraints .
In particular we have focused on building an excellent C++ IDE instead of trying to integrate lots of languages halfheartedly .
Of course it is still possible to add support for more languages to KDevelop and we are confident that it is actually easier than before : the best proof for that is the PHP plugin that is released alongside KDevelop 4.0 .
Code navigation , syntax checking and more
The major features for C++ support include code navigation , which allows you to jump to declarations , and semantic highlighting .
Combined they make it much easier to grasp new code bases and navigate in big code projects .
Support for syntax checking and semi-automatic code - correction with assistants is included as well as code completion that supports classes , functions , templates , variables and include statements .
For the Qt developers among us there is extensive support for the signal / slot mechanisms in Qt .
You get signal - completion in connect statements as well as completion for matching slots .
Very handy is the weighting of completion items based on their matching in regard to the type of function arguments or the signal - slot signatures .
Project management and code navigation
For the project management we currently have CMake support as the main buildsystem plugin , building projects with custom or generated makefiles is possible too .
The CMake support also has some of the above features available so you will get some completion and semantic highlighting as well as code - navigation even in CMake files .
Integration between C++ and CMake means new classes can be added to targets in CMake files semi-automatically .
To ease the fixing of build errors KDevelop allows jumping to the errors in the code .
Furthermore you can use QuickOpen to navigate very fast to any file , class or function in your opened projects or inside the currently opened file .
GDB integration
The integrated GDB support makes it possible to find runtime errors you may have in your codebase .
It allows for the usual features like breakpoints , stepping , stopping and inspecting the current call stack .
Additionally through the use of special pretty - printing support in GDB we can show many Qt , KDE and STL types in a human - readable form .
So your QString 's will show up with their actual string literal in the variable list , a QList will have an expandable set of child items and so on .
Documentation
The last great feature of KDevelop we are highlighting is integration of documentation .
KDevelop shows inline API documentation for both , CMake and Qt , in tooltips over classes and functions and it allows you to navigate in complete documentation via a toolview .
PHP plugins
This first release of the PHP support plugins already comes with a wealth of features that take some of the burden off a web developer :
Syntax errors get reported as you type and the sources of whole projects get semantically analyzed , including PHP Doc comments for type hints of parameters and return values .
Furthermore it will give you extensive code completion , with solid support for OOP .
We also support the above mentioned context browsing and semantic highlighting , integrate the online PHP . net documentation and hook into the QuickOpen and class browser plugins .
More to explore
There are many more things to discover in KDevelop and the PHP plugins , like SVN integration with inline editor annotations , grepping over files , session support and source code formatting .
Far too much for a short article like this , so we have created a dedicated blog entry to show off some of the features .
Get Started !
We invite everybody to get a copy of the source code from KDE mirrors or install packages from distributions .
We wish you all many happy hacking hours .
If you run into problems or have questions do not hesitate to contact us either in # kdevelop on freenode , via bugs .
kde.org or on our mailinglists .
[ This post is partly recycled from my recent not - really - on - topic entry on the Index Data blog .
Apologies to anyone who ’s seen the earlier version .
If that ’s you , skip down to ScottKit — my first non-trivial Ruby program , just after the sushi : it ’s all new material from there on . ]
Out with the old , in with the new
A month or so ago , it suddenly struck me that I am writing most of my programs in the same language ( Perl ) that I was using a decade ago .
Sure , I ’ve learned and used some other languages since then , notably Java and JavaScript , but neither of those has wired itself into my hindbrain the way C did in 1986 and Perl in 2000 , so that they spring unbidden to my fingertips when I open a fresh emacs buffer to start a new program .
Ten years is a long time to ride the same horse , especially when programming environments are moving so fast , so I decided to make a conscious effort to learn something new .
Partly just to keep myself sharp ; partly because learning a new language is learning a new way of thinking , which is useful when programming in an old language , too ; and partly in the hope that I might find something that is just plain Better than Perl .
Do n’t get me wrong — I like Perl .
Obviously I do , or I would n’t have been using it as my Language Of Choice for a decade .
I like it , but I ca n’t love it : it ’s a language that was not so much designed as congealed , and consequently it encompasses a huge variety of ideas from a huge variety of sources , going back as far as COBOL .
The various ideas do n’t always sit comfortably on the same conceptual sofa , and there is a certain amount of pushing and shoving .
All in all , it ’s not a language that you would want to introduce to your mother .
Still , these are easy flaws to forgive , because Perl is just so darned useful .
I ’ve hardly written C at all in those ten years , because Perl is capable enough ( and fast enough ) to let me do almost everything I used C for in the 1990s .
( The last exception was a year or two back when I needed a program that would call setrlimit ( ) to establish a desired environment , then execute a named program .
I could n’t do that in Perl because it seems to have no API to the setrlimit ( ) system call , so I had a nice excuse to write some C. )
Choosing a new language
So I was looking for a new language to learn .
Because I wanted something that was fun to work with , bondage - and - discipline languages with masses of compile - time checking were off the agenda ; and because I wanted something with a sufficiently well established ecosystem that I could use it for Real Work right off the bat , novelties like Google ’s
Go were also not the way to go .
For well established , widely used dynamic languages , the choice basically came down to Python or Ruby , which now have selections of packaged libraries on a par with Perl ’s CPAN .
Both of those were appealing , and I nearly went with Python ; but in the end it felt just a bit too familiar — a bit too much like cleaned - up Perl — whereas Ruby felt more like an adventure .
So that ’s what I went with , and a few weeks on it ’s a decision I am really happy about .
How to learn a language ?
The obvious way these days , I guess , is from online tutorials and videos .
But I am a bit old - school in these matters , and I ’ve always found that the most effective way for me to learn a totally new technology is from a book — something I can take away from the screen , snuggle under a duvet near an open fire , with a glass of cheap port and a slice of mature cheddar at my side , and read without being continually tempted to Just Check My Mail .
Luckily I have an old university friend ( Steve Sykes ) who is a big Ruby fan , so from him I was able to get a recommendation for what book to buy .
Turns out that , just as The Book for C is Kernighan and Ritchie , so there is a The Book for Ruby : Programming Ruby : The Pragmatic Programmer ’s Guide ( amazon.com , amazon.co.uk ) , by Dave Thomas .
( I went with the version that describes the new 1.9 release of Ruby , which handles character sets correctly , rather than the older and more widespread 1.8 ) .
While Ruby is an imperative object - oriented language , it also uses a lot of functional ideas — in fact Paul Graham has described it as “ a dialect of Lisp with syntax ” .
One of the really neat things about it , which turns out to be trivial but has huge ramifications , is its syntax for closures ( or blocks , as they are known in Ruby ) , which has finally won me over to how great closures are .
ScottKit — my first non-trivial Ruby program
By the time I ’d read through Programming Ruby , and done a few simple exercises , I had a decent feeling for the language ; but of course you never really learn a language until you write a non-trivial program in it .
So I set out to build something tractable but fun , and I came up with ScottKit .
It ’s a toolkit for messing with Scott Adams format Adventure games — simple two - word - parser interactive fiction of the kind that was popular in the 1980s and which , for me at least , has never lost its charm .
( Part of the reason for that is that I made and sold such games myself as a young teenager — it was a major rite of passage for me . )
ScottKit was a neat exercise for several reasons :
It deals with an existing format , defined and documented , for representing games .
It could be built in stages : first , a decompiler for existing games ; then a system for playing such games ; then a compiler for building games from a source format of my own devising .
Each stage was worthwhile in its own right , so I did n’t have to slog through lots of work before I saw any results .
There are quite a few existing games out there , free to download , which it can play and decompile : decompiling is great when you get stuck , because you can see what the rooms and items are and what the actions do .
You can also decompile a game , tweak the source , and recompile the modified version .
Games are fun !
So how did the experiment go ?
Well , the actual programming was a joy .
Ruby is —
I ’ve thought about it , and this is the best word — fun .
Of all the languages I ’ve ever used , it ’s the one that gets in your way least , that allows you to spend the greatest proportion of your time actually solving your problem rather trying to remember whether you need an Instance Factory Builder or an EntityBuilderFactory , or how many $s and @s to use .
( “ Never write $ a [ $ i ] when you mean $ {$ a [ $ i ] } or @ $ a [ $ i ] when you mean @ { $ a [ $ i ]} .
Those wo n’t work at all ” — the Perl Data Structures Cookbook . )
I do n’t see myself writing a lot of Perl in the future , except where mandated by external forces .
Learning the culture
But of course the actual language is only the tip of the iceberg ( and finally we come to the actual point of this blog post ) : where you really face a steep learning curve is , well , everywhere else .
Learning a language is a great start , but to be productive in any meaningful sense you also have to learn the libraries , the testing frameworks , the packaging systems , the build tools , the inline documentation systems , the code - hosting services , the documentation - hosting services , and no doubt a bunch of other stuff that I ’ve not got around to yet .
Let ’s look at those in turn , and see how they are panning out for Ruby .
Libraries
One of the nice things about Ruby is that the supplied standard libraries are pretty extensive and cover a lot of the kinds of things you want to do , so you do n’t for example have to go and evaluate half a dozen candidate XML libraries before you can start messing with angle - brackets : the no-brainer answer is to use REXML , which comes with the interpreter .
This contrasts nicely with Perl , where the 19,742 modules downloadable from CPAN include FIVE HUNDRED with XML somewhere in their title .
It ’s nice not to have to make those choices .
That said , those supplied libraries and built - in classes give you plenty to learn .
I can do basic string processing in Ruby , but the String class has 145 methods — 145 !
The Array class has 121 .
The Class class has 77 .
I doubt anyone ever fully learns these classes , but good Ruby programmers will have the main methods at their fingertips , and it ’s a little intimidating to think how it might be before I qualify as a “ good Ruby programmer ” by that metric .
Ruby comes with a nice packaging system , rubygems , that makes installation of libraries rather easier than in Perl .
It seems to combine features of CPAN , Debian ’s dpkg system and apt - get .
So far I am pretty happy with it .
( More on rubygems below . )
Testing frameworks
In the old days , the way to do unit - testing in Ruby was with Test : : Unit , which succeeded Lapidary .
In recent years , though , a bunch of alternatives have sprung up , including but not limited to Minitest : : Unit , Rspec and Shoulda .
Test :: Unit itself seems to be phasing out , but Minitest :: Unit includes an emulation for it , and that ’s what I went with just because it seems to be the baseline .
It seems to be possible to mix Rspec and Shoulda tests in with ( real or emulated )
Test :: Unit later , if I should need to .
Packaging systems
This , happily , is a decision made long ago : if you want to distribute Ruby code , you do it as a gem .
You just do .
No -one distributes tarballs of Ruby code .
If you want to be part of the community , you have to distribute your code as a gem , too , otherwise people will just shrug and assume you ’re some kind of crazy sicko .
As it turns out , that ’s a good thing .
The gem packaging system is pretty lightweight , it imposes only a simple canonical directory structure on your code — one that make perfect sense — and leaves you free to add whatever else you might want .
And it ’s really nice that anyone , anywhere in the world , who has a working Ruby installation can get ScottKit just by running “ gem install scottkit ” .
In fact , the gem directory - layout conventions are not quite dictatorial enough for my tastes , which is not something you ’ll hear me say often .
I want to add a change - log for my project , and such files are given many different names in different cultures — Changes ( Perl projects ) , NEWS ( stuff built using GNU configure ) , changelog ( Debian packaging ) , Changelog - with - a - capital - C , History , etc .
I was hoping that the standard gem layout would include such a file and mandate a well - defined format , but I was n’t able to find any such convention .
In the absence of anything better , I picked the name Changes , which is what I use in Perl , and adopted the Perl change - log format .
Build tools
Here ’s where things started to get hazy for me .
Being a traditionalist , I ’ve always been quite happy with Stu Feldman ’s baby , make , and not seen the need for ant and suchlike .
( It ’s like a Makefile — but it ’s in XML !
So it ’s Better ! ) .
I was a bit surprised to find that in the Ruby world it ’s much more common to use rake ( It ’s like make — but it ’s written in Ruby !
So it ’s Better ! )
I strenuously dislike this sort of cultural imperialism in a language — it ’s dangerously close to the classic Java - world attitude of flat - out rejecting anything that ’s not written in Java .
But I ’ve warmed to rake .
Unlike ant , whose whole selling point seems to be that it ’s written in Java ( a horrible language ) and configured in XML ( a horrible metalanguage ) , the point of rake is that the Rakefile is itself a Ruby program — Ruby ’s economical and flexible syntax makes this much less intrusive than you might expect .
And this of course means that you have the full power of Ruby to hand in expressing your rules : no need to call out to the shell , quote your quotes and backslash - end your continued lines as we ’ve all been doing with make for years .
So far I ’ve not really exploited rake beyond the simplest cookie - cutter uses , but it ’ll be interesting to see how it bears up as I start to do so .
In Ruby - world , the build tool interacts with how you do packaging , because rake is so darned configurable that people can’t resist extending it with special kinds of tasks that know how to build gems .
And that means you have more choices to make .
The basic approach to building your gem is to write a projectName .
gemspec file , which specifies stuff like the name and version of your package , your own name and email address , which files are to be included , and so on .
( The gemspec is itself , naturally , a little Ruby program . )
Then you can run “ gem build projectName.gemspec ” and if all is well , then projectName–version.gem will be generated and dumped in the working directory .
But various people have thought that maintaining the gemspec file by hand is too hard , so they ’ve made rake extensions that do it for you .
One such is jeweler , which pretty much leaves you to put the gemspec in your Rakefile , embedded in a Jeweler : : Tasks block , and fills in some of the fields for you , like the date of release .
To be honest , I am not wholly sure that this gets you a great deal , but that ’s what I ’m using right now basically because it ’s what a friend uses .
Jeweler does other objectionable things , too , like assuming your project is at the top level of its own git module and blowing up if that ’s not true ( unless you take special precautions ) .
So I might switch to hoe , yet another rake - extension - that - makes - gemfiles : I ’ve only just glanced at it , but it makes a much shorter Rakefile with a much simpler rule , which I think harvests the relevant metadata from the README.
txt , Manifest.txt , etc. , to make the gemfile .
Looks neater than Jeweler , and also , I notice , expects to see a file History .
txt , which looks like it ’s my change - log at long last .
Jeweler and hoe are not the only games in town , by the way .
There are plenty of other Grand Unified schemes that various people have come up with , and choosing between them seem pretty much roulette .
Inline documentation systems
Ruby classes and functions can be annotated by special comments which are extracted by rdoc to make automatic documentation , just like javadoc does for Java .
Rdoc seems to have superseded an earlier attempts called rd , and — I thought — had complete control of the Ruby inline documentation ecosystem .
Nuh-uh .
Seems that the world is now moving towards using YARD instead , which is kind of similar in spirit , but more complex ( and harder to find documentation for ) .
Ugh .
Code - hosting services
If you ’re getting tired of my listing bunches of alternatives under every heading , you ’re not alone .
I will try to be quick , so we can get to the punchline .
When you build a gem , the gem software complains if you ’ve not defined a rubyforge_project metadata element — in other words , it just assumes you ’re hosting your project on one particular site , which seems extremely presumptuous ( I am trying to be polite here ) .
When you use jeweler to set up a project , it requires that you tell it your username on github .
Which is also , let us say , not the kind of behaviour we like to see .
The upshot is that , because I had my own hosting arrangements already in place , I got whined at by two separate pieces of software that I was n’t doing it the way they wanted .
Rude , rude , rude .
As it happens , I have — for now at least — moved my git repository onto github .
I ’m not sure how that ’s working out , for reasons that will become clear in the next ( and last ! ) subsection ; I might try moving to rubyforge after all .
There ’s also Sourceforge , of course , and Google Code ; but they do n’t seem to have been taken to hearts of Rubyites in the same way as github has .
Documentation - hosting services
If you look at the home page for , say , Ruby - ZOOM , you ’ll see that it has all its rdoc documentation right there on the rugyforge - hosted site .
Very useful .
I ’d assumed , or at least hoped , that github would do the same , but it seems that it does n’t .
( This is the main reason I am thinking of moving to rubyforge . )
I guess this is because github supports projects in any language whereas rubyforge is Ruby - specific .
[ Addendum : turns out I was mistaken — rubyforge does n’t do this for you .
The Ruby - ZOOM authors made their own arrangements to upload the formatted documentation .
Rats . ]
There ’s a solution , sort of , at http://rdoc.info/ — a site that knows how to pull projects from github , assemble their inline documentation and publish it .
Better still , github can be set up , pretty easily , to tell rdoc .
info automatically whenever you push a new commit of your project , and it arranges to have the documentation updated .
It happens quickly , too .
Great , eh ?
Well , nearly .
Sadly , rdoc.info has a couple of issues :
There does n’t seem to be a permalink to the pages documenting any of the classes : frames are used , and the URLs of the frames when you manage to get hold of them turns out to have the git commit ’s SHA1 hash in them which means they are ( A ) ugly and ( B ) not up to date .
Worse , despite the domain name , rdoc.info does not use rdoc !
It uses YARD , and that is causing me problems , not just because I ’d already set my source up to use rdoc comments , but also because YARD seems to have religious convictions that I am not happy about , such as a commitment that you have to document all your private methods .
I ’ve made some steps towards YARDifying the ScottKit source , but I ’m currently thinking that ’s the wrong thing — I need to find a rdoc .
info - like site that really does use rdoc .
Failing that , I ’ll have to make my own documentation - build - and - install scripts that push it to a ScottKit area on http://miketaylor.org.uk/, but I really do n’t want to go that route .
What it all means
None of this the fault of Ruby ; all the same issues exist for other languages .
I ’m gradually coming to the conclusion that they are sort of irreducible : they come with the territory .
For Real Work ( as opposed to solving interesting puzzles with Prolog or APL ) , you need a language that has developed a rich culture over time .
That ’s what enables the language to make all the connections it needs to make in order to do the kinds of things we need to do these days .
What it needs , in short , is an ecosystem .
And ecosystems are complicated things .
They are hard to learn .
Could the Ruby culture be simplified ?
Well , maybe by fiat .
Maybe Matz could decree that all projects must be generated by jeweler , hosted on github , documented in YARD , and must have unit - test using Shoulda .
It would , in a way , be nice to have those decisions made for me .
But even if the community accepted these diktats , which they would n’t , it ’s not really what we want .
Languages that grow and develop and succeed are those with rich , competitive ecosystems ; constrain it too much and it becomes sterile .
I ’m guessing that in three years , some of the issues I ’ve had to make decisions about will be much easier : Darwin will take care of the weaker approaches , and the stronger will survive .
That ’s how we got the point of Ruby being as good as it is , after all — and by “ good ” I do n’t just mean “ elegant ” or “ fun to use ” , but “ capable of doing large - scale stuff using many different libraries available from and documented on well - known community sites ” .
In short : when you learn a programming language — a real , grown - up one rather than a novelty — you have to learn the culture that goes with it .
You just do .
And it ’s time - consuming and frustrating and feels like a waste of time , and yields up very few of those satisfying Aha ! moments .
It ’s only gradually , having waded through these fertile but sometime smelly swamps for a few weeks ’ evenings , that its all starting to swim into focus and make some kind of sense .
I think I am getting there with Ruby culture ; hopefully ScottKit will be properly published and available soon , and I ’ll have found a combination of test frameworks , inline documentation conventions and so on that works for me .
Ask me again in a few weeks , and I ’ll tell you how it went .
And ask me in twenty years and I ’ll let you know whether I ’ve made an progress in penetrating Java culture .

Addendum
By the way , ScottKit is not really ready to use yet , even though I released it as a gem already .
( That was mostly so that I could easily install it on the boys ’ computer upstairs and they could get going building their own games . )
The big gap is the documentation for the source language — it does n’t really exist .
I ’ll try to fix that in the next day or so ; I ’ll post about ScottKit when it ’s ready for the attention .
Enlarge By Claude Paris , AP Workers march during a protest in Marseille , southern France , on Thursday over plans to raise the retirement age past 60 .
Strikes delayed flights , closed schools and frustrated commuters .
PARIS ( AP )  Strikes across France delayed flights , closed schools and frustrated commuters Thursday as workers protested government plans to raise the retirement age past 60 — one of the lowest in Europe President Nicolas Sarkozy says retiring so young is now untenable given longer life spans , but unions see his planned reforms to France 's over - stretched pension system as yet another blow to Europe 's cherished social model .
His government wants to raise the retirement age to 61 or 62 — reforms that have been under discussion since well before the current European debt crisis .
Sarkozy has called them his main priority this year .
Despite the protests , France 's retirement plans pale before the harsh austerity measures adopted by other European nations , including Greece , Ireland and Portugal .
Spain and Italy have also announced austerity plans as the debt crisis that started in Greece has weakened the euro currency and raised questions about its future .
Some unions say France 's pension budget shortfall could be reduced by raising workers ' monthly contributions .
" Even though we need pension reform , extending the retirement age is the most unjust way , " the head of the CFDT union , Francois Chereque , said on France - 2 television .
He criticized " the purely financial logic " of the government 's plan and it's " obsession ... with aligning with Germany " on retirement .
Germany recently raised its retirement age from 65 to 67 because of its rapidly aging population .
Many EU countries have 65 as the general retirement age , though some allow for earlier retirement for women and those in professions considered arduous .
To express their anger , French workers for the government and private companies from Nestle to oil giant Total walked off the job Thursday and planned scores of protests in Paris and elsewhere .
Striking train drivers reduced commuter traffic around Paris , although international train routes did not appear to be affected .
Aviation authorities expected flights at Paris ' Charles de Gaulle Airport to be reduced 10 % and those at Orly airport 30 % because of the strikes .
About 14 % of teachers nationwide were on strike , and about 8 % of hospital workers .
The French government , which had long danced around the retirement issue , has been increasingly bold in recent days .
" It is totally logical that the government follow this option ; we will push back the legal age " of retirement , Labor Minister Eric Woerth said Wednesday .
France is only slowly emerging from its worst recession in decades , and labor relations are tense after waves of job cuts .
Polls show most French voters believe something must be done to keep the pension system from collapsing .
For two decades , successive governments have adopted gradual moneysaving measures , but ambitious changes have been thwarted by protests .
The government is also considering raising the number of working years required to receive a full pension .
Currently 40 years are required for most professions , rising to 41 in 2012 , but that could go higher .
The government will finalize its pension reform proposal in July — heart of summer holiday season , when it is hard for unions to organize protests — and submit it to parliament in early September .
French life expectancy in 2007 was 77 for men and 84 for women , several years above the European average , according to U.N. statistics .

Just a few years ago Australian internet whiz - kid Daniel Tzvetkoff bought a $ 27 million Gold Coast mansion , drove Lamborghinis and Ferraris , flew in private jets and had an estimated personal fortune of $ 82 million .
But in a Las Vegas courthouse on Wednesday ( 8 am tomorrow AEST ) he will seek something most people take for granted - Tzvetkoff will ask for his freedom .
Happier days ... Daniel Tzvetkoff and his former Gold Coast mansion .
The 27 - year - old one - time high - flyer has been locked up in the North Las Vegas Detention Centre since Friday when the might of US law enforcement - the FBI , Department of Homeland Security and the US Attorney 's Office - swooped on him during a business trip to the world 's casino capital .
Tzvetkoff's US lawyer Mace Yampolsky admits it could be a tough fight when they make their bail application in Judge Peggy A. Leen 's court , with US prosecutors so far refusing to entertain the prospect of agreeing to support Tzvetkoff 's release on bail .
WASHINGTON —
In the days since President Obama announced a moratorium on permits for drilling new offshore oil wells and a halt to a controversial type of environmental waiver that was given to the Deepwater Horizon rig , at least seven new permits for various types of drilling and five environmental waivers have been granted , according to records .
The records also indicate that since the April 20 explosion on the rig , federal regulators have granted at least 19 environmental waivers for gulf drilling projects and at least 17 drilling permits , most of which were for types of work like that on the Deepwater Horizon shortly before it exploded , pouring a ceaseless current of oil into the Gulf of Mexico .
Asked about the permits and waivers , officials at the Department of the Interior and the Minerals Management Service , which regulates drilling , pointed to public statements by Interior Secretary Ken Salazar , reiterating that the agency had no intention of stopping all new oil and gas production in the gulf .
Department of the Interior officials said in a statement that the moratorium was meant only to halt permits for the drilling of new wells .
It was not meant to stop permits for new work on existing drilling projects like the Deepwater Horizon .
“ I see many people die because they judge that life is not worth living .
I see others paradoxically getting killed for the ideas or illusions that give them a reason for living ( what is called a reason for living is also an excellent reason for dying ) .
I therefore conclude that the meaning of life is the most urgent of questions .
Albert Camus ”
The opening quote comes from Albert Camus ’s philosophic essay The Myth of Sisyphus .
While I was familiar with some of Camus ’s ideas , I had never read this famous essay itself until recently .
In The Myth of Sisyphus , Camus introduces his “ philosophy of the absurd . ”
The “ absurdity ” is man ’s futile search for meaning in an unintelligible world devoid of God , eternal truths , or values .
Does the realization of the utter absurdity and futility of life mean we might as well just kill ourselves ?
“ No ! ” Camus heroically answers .
What is required of us is constant revolt against the absurdity of life .
As a Buddhist , I found many passages in The Myth of Sisyphus extremely compelling in their clear depiction of the plight of the human being trying to understand himself and his relationship to the world :
“ Of whom and of what in fact can I say ‘ I know about that !’
This heart in me , I can experience it and I conclude that it exists .
This world , I can touch it and I conclude again that it exists .
All my knowledge stops there , and the rest is construction .
For if I try to grasp this self of which I am assured , if I try to define it and to sum it up , it is no more than a liquid that flows between my fingers .
I can depict one by one all the faces that it can assume ; all those given it , too , by this education , this origin , this boldness or these silences , this grandeur or this vileness .
But one cannot add up faces .
This same heart which is mine will ever remain for me undefinable .
Between the certainty that I have of my existence and the content that I strive to give to this assurance , the gap will never be filled .
Always shall I be a stranger to myself .
… Here , again , are trees and I know their roughness , water and I experience its savour .
This scent of grass and of stars , night , certain evenings when the heart relaxes — how shall I deny this world whose power and forces I experience ?
Yet all the science of this earth will give me nothing that can assure me that this world is mine . ”
From a Buddhist standpoint , Camus gives an almost perfect description of the inherent problem of the “ self ” and its relationship to the world .
If you take the existence of the “ self ” at face value , and try to solve the problem of the “ self ” as a “ given , ” you end up in mystery .
Mystery , as existentialist philosopher Gabriel Marcel put it , is when a problem encroaches on its own data .
But what if we do n’t take “ self ” at face value — as a “ given ” — and instead look deeply into “ self ” using meditative concentration and insight ?
What might we find — or not find ?
Is there really a solid , unchanging “ self ” like we think there is ?
Maybe the apparent meaninglessness of the world arises from the meaningless of identifying with something that has no real self or permanence to it .
The Buddha taught that the “ mystery ” of the self is really an illusion that dissolves when we know how to ask the right questions .
For the Buddha , the important problem was not “ What am I ? ” which presumes a “ what ” or a “ self , ” but rather the problem he answered in the Four Noble Truths .
As Buddhist monk Thanissaro Bhikkhu writes in the essay Skillful Thinking :
It ’s very common when we come to [ Buddhist ] practice that we bring along some very strong notions of who we are or the kind of person we ’d like to be : “ I ’m this sort of person .
I want to be this sort of person . ”
This type of thinking is very common .
And yet it ’s not all that helpful , because that concept of who we are is very nebulous , based on all kinds of information and misinformation .
It often gets in the way of what ’s the best thing to do at any given moment .
This is why the Buddha says to put those questions aside —
“ Who am I ?
Who am I going to be ?
Who have I been in the past ? ” — not only in their philosophical , abstract or metaphysical sense , but also in their psychological sense .
Just look at what opportunities you have right here , right now for thinking , acting and speaking in skillful ways .
That kind of question —
“ What ’s the most skillful thing to do right now ? ” — is a useful question .
This is what the Buddha was getting at when he said to put thoughts of “ me , ” “ myself , ” “ what I have been , ” “ what I will be ” aside and to think instead in terms of the Four Noble Truths .
These truths give you a way of looking at experience that focuses directly on the issue of skillfulness .
In other words , you look at your experience in terms of four variables : cause and effect on the one hand , and skillful and unskillful on the other .
The first noble truth , the truth of suffering and stress , is an unskillful result .
The unskillful cause is craving and ignorance .
On the other side you ’ve got the path of practice : that ’s a skillful cause with the cessation of suffering as its result .
So when situations present themselves to you , just ask yourself , “ What ’s the most skillful thing to do right here ? ”
Then allow yourself to think outside the box a little bit .
The teachings of meditation are not necessarily there to just be followed one , two , three , four and bingo !
there you are : Bliss .
Oneness .
Awakening .
You ’ve got to keep reflecting on what you ’re doing , what results are coming , what adjustments have to be made …
That what we might see as profound metaphysical , philosophical , or psychological problems can find their solution in such a down - to - earth practice might at first seem , well , absurd !
But those who have actually learned how to meditate , learned how cause and effect work in terms of intentions and actions , can attest that this approach is actually quite brilliant .
In Buddhist practice , you begin to think of yourself less in terms of who you are and more in terms of what you do .
You begin to realize who you are is actually fluid , ever - changing , and is basically fabricated by what you think and do .
As we begin to realize this , we lose a kind of crippling self - consciousness .
Ironically , we are freer to be our true selves , because we are increasingly not hung - up on ourselves !
Probably all of us have had those times when we were utterly absorbed in something we love to do and were utterly self - oblivious — absolutely “ in the moment ” or in the “ flow . ”
At such times , our sense of self just disappears , but we are not annihilated or turned into unthinking zombies !
In Buddhist meditation and the practice of mindfulness , we learn how rare moments like this can become more and more the way we live all the time .
Paradoxically , the mindfulness and loving - kindness developed in Buddhist mediation are exactly the opposite of a selfish or world - denying self - absorption .
The less we are tangled up in our emotional problems and self - centeredness , the more we are able to love , to help others , to see the beauty of the world around us .
Not so caught up in ourselves , we are better able to see others and to see our interrelationship with everything around us .
Instead of seeing life as “ absurd ” or futile , we find our lives blossoming with meaning and depth and love .
If we live our lives focused on how we create our own suffering and our own happiness , our “ self ” will take care of itself !
We do n’t have to think about our “ self , ” and the fabrication of associations we call our “ self ” really ca n’t think about us !
We are all so much more than our self - definitions of ourselves .
But we can only discover this by letting go of our selves and learning the skills that enable us to live each moment fully and completely .
That ’s where the real meaning of life can be found .

Jonathan Chait has an item about the largely successful attempt not just to blame Obama for our current economic difficulties , but to “ socially stigmatize ” anyone who points out that most of the blame actually lies with his predecessor .
Indeed .
And may I point out that the sainted Reagan was still very much blaming Jimmy Carter for the economy ’s troubles well past this point in his administration ?
( Not to mention that circa 2004 the Bushies were still trying to get the NBER to postdate the beginning of the 2001 recession back to Clinton . )
What Chait does n’t point out , however , is that the idea that enough time has passed that we can’t blame Bush is especially wrong - headed given the nature of our problems .
We ’re in the aftermath of a financial crisis — and there ’s overwhelming evidence ( pdf ) that recovery from financial crises is almost always protracted and difficult .
There ’s no way one should have expected everything to be fine until the Lehman failure lies years in the past .
In fact , the return of job growth we ’ve already seen is ahead of schedule compared with the historical average .
And one thing is clear : the financial crisis occurred on Bush ’s watch .
To demand that everyone let Bush off the hook for where we are now because 16 months have passed under his successor is to defy the overwhelming evidence of history .

Barnes and Noble introduced today the iPad version of its eReader application .
The company took its time in developing the iPad application , which they are said to have done right from the ground up .
Amazon was quicker to move and had the Kindle for iPad available for download right from the start , giving it a bit of an advantage with iPad users which were n’t previous users of either the Kindle or of Barnes and Noble ’s eReader device or software .
Both companies seem to have made the correct decision that they should make the content they sell available in the broadest possible selection of reading devices .
The BN eReader application which is already available from the App Store is quite good - looking and should prove to be a solid reading application in the iPad , as its iPhone sibling is quite good .
The BN eReader application not only has a built - in dictionary but allows you to directly search for terms in Wikipedia and Google .
There is also support for lending eBooks to friends for short periods , which is an interesting idea .
Barnes and Noble has also added to the application the ability to Sync the latest read position with the eReader application running on a personal computer and plans to add that capability to the iPhone / iPod version of the application later this year .
This is a feature that has proven to be very popular with Kindle users .

THERE’S little point in trying to match the horsepower available to a pizzaiolo .
Their professional pizza ovens , especially the models that burn wood or coal , are the muscle cars of kitchens : when blazing at temperatures that range from 800 degrees to an infernal 1,000 degrees , they can turn raw dough into a blistered , bubbling pizza in as little as 75 seconds .
It puts the home cook , whose oven typically reaches 550 degrees , at a permanent disadvantage .
No wonder some of the pizza - obsessed do everything to coax their ovens into performing above their limits .
( Making pizza on the self - cleaning cycle seems to be popular . )
The Johnny Knoxville approach has its appeal .
But after cooking more than 200 pizzas over several months , I learned an easier way to edge closer to the kind of airy , creamy , chewy , thin crust you find at pizzerias that have otherwise sane people waiting in line for an hour .
And it has less to do with heat than good baking technique .
I let the dough rise overnight .
It ’s not a new idea .
Anthony Mangieri redefined New York ’s artisanal scene when he opened Una Pizza Napoletana in 2004 ( now living in San Francisco , he will reopen his pizzeria there later this summer ) .
He learned to let dough rise for 24 hours in Naples .
Pizzeria Mozza in Los Angeles , Pizzeria Delfina in San Francisco and Pizzeria Bianco in Phoenix all have overnight rises ; at Lucali ’s in Brooklyn , the dough rises for about 36 hours ; and at Saraghina , also in Brooklyn , it goes for as long as 72 hours .
And yet most recipes for the home cook specify a three - hour rise at room temperature .
That might be enough to let activated yeast produce carbon dioxide that inflates the dough .
But the prolonged fermentation of an overnight rise not only develops the dough ’s structure , it also enables starches to transform into flavorful sugars .
The dough becomes complex and nuanced .
It ’s a crust you want to eat .
While Michigan voters approved the legalization of medical marijuana in 2008 , California voters will decide in November
and tax the drug .
Mark Binelli reported on the movement for Rolling Stone 's April issue , using Detroit as an example of marijuana 's potential economic impact .
" From California to downtown Detroit , there 's a green revolution sweeping across the nation -- and it's changing the weed business forever , " Binelli wrote .
Medical pot has kick started a supply and service industry in Metro Detroit .
While the law is designed to keep selling operations small , doctors , lawyers and entrepreneurs are
without moving the actual product .
Like several reporters before him , Binelli dropped in on
, the state 's first medical - marijuana trade school located in Southfield , and spoke with founder Nick Tennant and a couple of class members hoping to cash in on the growing industry .
But he also paid a visit to John Sinclair , poet , pot activist and former manager of the MC5 .
In typically colorful fashion , Sinclair and co-manager Holice P. Wood said they 're planning on opening a pot collective in Detroit , Wood humorously suggested he smoked weed with several former City Council members and argued that legalizing marijuana could turn around the struggling city .
According to the magazine , marijuana is the top cash crop in 12 states , growers and farmers produced more than 22 million pounds of the plant in 2006 and prohibition costs taxpayers an estimated $ 42 billion annually .
Marijuana remains illegal under federal law , but President Barack Obama last year indicated his administration will not seek to arrest medical marijuana users and suppliers who follow state laws .

NEW ORLEANS – “ Big business can get away with murder , ” Robert ‘ Tiger ” Hammond , president of the Greater New Orleans AFL - CIO , told the People ’s World here May 11 .
“ And they are doing it right now ! ”
Three weeks after the Deepwater Horizon exploded off the coast of Louisiana , killing 11 workers , over 200,000 gallons of oil are still being pumped into the ocean every day , potentially destroying thousands of acres of beautiful marsh land .
Additionally , Gulf Coast wildlife – unique to the region – and the fishing industry face critical challenges in the months and years ahead .
Hammond , who also serves as the executive secretary for the Southeast Louisiana Building and Construction Trades Council , continued , “ After three weeks they [ BP ] are on plan E .
We do n’t know when the oil is going to stop . ”
Unfortunately , this is the second tragedy – in almost four years – Hammond has had to deal with .
“ First Katrina , now the oil , ” he said in a raised voice , visibly angry .
Before Hurricane Katrina , Hammond lived in St. Bernard Parish , one of the areas hardest hit by the disaster .
“ I had 11 feet of water in my house , 14 inches on the second floor .
We were under water . ”
“ We were rebuilding our lives , our futures !
Now this , ” Hammond continued .
In the weeks following the Deepwater Horizon explosion it has become obvious that more government regulation is needed .
In fact , Hammond connected the oil crisis today to deregulation during the Bush administration .
“ George W. Bush vetoed a law that would have required a mandatory cut - off valve precisely for this type of crisis , ” Hammond said .
“ There has to be stiffer penalties , stiffer laws .
Hundreds of thousands of people ’s lives are at stake .
Hundreds of jobs are at stake – hotels , charter boats , restaurants , the whole tourism industry and the fishermen . ”
Hammond also said that he has seen a huge change in the federal government ’s approach to regulating big corporations since President Obama took office .
David Magee , vice president of International Longshoremen ’s Association ( ILA ) Local 3000 , could n’t agree more .
As we stood on the docks just outside of the local ’s trailer , he told the People ’s World , “ The Obama administration has been part of our post - Katrina rebuilding success . ”
“ Obama is on the side of the community , the workers , the fishermen , ” Magee continued .
“ BP , on the other hand , allowed this tragedy to happen .
They were trying to save money .
As a result , 11 lives were lost and our state , city and region are going to suffer . ”
ILA Local 3000 Secretary - Treasurer Chris Hammond added , “ BP has made a lot of mistakes .
They have been irresponsible .
All of their safeguards failed .
They need to be better regulated . ”
“ This is a new Katrina , ” he continued .
With states all across the nation facing severe budget cuts , the impact of this crisis will also be felt in Baton Rouge , Louisiana ’s state capital .
Off - shore drilling provides hundreds of millions of dollars in state revenue .
“ Off - shore drilling provides revenue for the state that goes towards social programs and helps rebuild our infrastructure , ” Chris Hammond added , indicating that with better regulation this key regional industry could play a positive role in stabilizing the state ’s budget .
For a city still recovering from the wounds of Bush - era mismanagement and corporate deregulation , this crisis could n’t come at a worst time .
“ There is a lot of anger and disbelief , ” Magee added .
“ The outlook is bleak .
On the waterfront , once you lose work it is hard to get it back . ”
Many dockworkers fear layoffs as ships are diverted to other areas to avoid the oil .
The oil pouring into the Gulf Coast can and will affect the economy of the whole region .
If good paying , union jobs are lost in the docking industry , then jobs in the peripheral economy will also be affected – putting downward pressure on wages and benefits in the entire region , especially for tourism , a cornerstone of the economy here , providing hundreds of thousands of jobs .
As “ Tiger ” Hammond said , “ Big business thrives on failure . ”
Unfortunately , it is precisely this type of failure that has allowed BP to rake in billions of dollars in profits while the people of Louisiana get stuck cleaning up the mess .

The catch , however , in order to have all 16 nations represented both in heroes and villains roles , Naughty Dog had to temporarily remove some characters from the selection screen .
However , all characters available through paid DLC are still available , the studio says .
But that means newly added multiplayer characters Blaine and Dutch will be inactive for the life of this promotion .

If your nation is among the sixteen still standing , chances are you already know this .
But even if it 's eliminated today , tomorrow , or down the line , you 'll still be able to pick it .
Here are the multiplayer skins for Uncharted 2 through July 12 :
• Uruguay
• Mexico
• Argentina
• South Korea
• United States
• England
• Germany
• Ghana
• Netherlands
• Japan
• Paraguay
• Slovakia

Too unfit to run : Two - year - old who smokes 40 cigarettes a day puffs away on a toy truck
Taking a deep drag on his cigarette while resting on the steering wheel of his truck , he looks like a parody of a middle - aged lorry driver .
But the image covers up a much more disturbing truth :
At just the tender age of two , Ardi Rizal 's health has been so ruined by his 40 - a - day habit that he now struggles to move by himself .
The four - stone Indonesia toddler is certainly far too unfit to run around with other children - and his condition is set to rapidly deteriorate .
Truck on bad habits : Ardi Rizal sits smoking on his favourite toy at home in Musi Banyuasin , Indonesia
But , despite local officials ' offer to buy the Rizal family a new car if the boy quits , his parents feel unable to stop him because he throws massive tantrums if they do n't indulge him .
His mother , Diana , 26 , wept : ' He 's totally addicted .
If he does n't get cigarettes , he gets angry and screams and batters his head against the wall .
He tells me he feels dizzy and sick . '
Ardi will smoke only one brand and his habit costs his parents £ 3.78 a day in Musi Banyuasin , in Indonesia 's South Sumatra province .
But in spite of this , his fishmonger father Mohammed , 30 , said : ' He looks pretty healthy to me .
I do n't see the problem . '
Ardi's youth is the extreme of a disturbing trend .
Data from the Central Statistics Agency showed 25 per cent of Indonesian children aged three to 15 have tried cigarettes , with 3.2 per cent of those active smokers .
The percentage of five to nine year olds lighting up increased from 0.4 per cent in 2001 to 2.8 per cent in 2004 , the agency reported .
Gun smoke : Four - stone Ardi puffs one of 40 cigarettes he smokes a day while toting a water pistol
A video of a four - year - old Indonesian boy blowing smoke rings appeared briefly on YouTube in March , prompting outrage before it was removed from the site .
Child advocates are speaking out about the health damage to children from second - hand smoke , and the growing pressure on them to smoke in a country where one - third of the population uses tobacco and single cigarettes can be bought for a few cents .
Seto Mulyadi , chairman of Indonesia 's child protection commission , blames the increase on aggressive advertising and parents who are smokers .
' A law to protect children and passive smokers should be introduced immediately in this country , ' he said .
A health law passed in 2009 formally recognizes that smoking is addictive , and an anti-smoking coalition is pushing for tighter restrictions on smoking in public places , advertising bans and bigger health warnings on cigarette packages .
Puff baby : Ardi blows smoke while trundling around on his truck
But a bill on tobacco control has been stalled because of opposition from the tobacco industry .
The bill would ban cigarette advertising and sponsorship , prohibit smoking in public , and add graphic images to packaging .
Benny Wahyudi , a senior official at the Industry Ministry , said the government had initiated a plan to try to limit the number of smokers , including dropping production to 240 billion cigarettes this year , from 245 billion in 2009 .
' The government is aware of the impact of smoking on health and has taken efforts , including lowering cigarette production , increasing its tax and limiting smoking areas , ' he said .
Mr Mulyadi said a ban on advertising is key to putting the brakes on child and teen smoking .
' If cigarette advertising is not banned , there will be more kids whose lives are threatened because of smoking , ' he said .
Ubiquitous advertising hit a bump last month when a cigarette company was forced to withdraw its sponsorship of pop star Kelly Clarkson 's concert following protests from fans and anti-tobacco groups .
Always having a break : Ardi , who is rarely seen without a cigarette , insists on the same brand , costing £ 3.78 a day
However , imposing a non-smoking message will be difficult in Indonesia , the world 's third - largest tobacco consumer .
Tubagus Haryo Karbyanto , a member of the National Commission of Tobacco Control , said Indonesia must also address the social conditions that lead to smoking , such as family influence and peer pressure .
' The promotion of health has to be integrated down to the smallest units in our society , from public health centres and local health care centres to the family , ' he was quoted as saying by the Jakarta Globe on Friday .
Health Minister Endang Sedyaningsih conceded turning young people off smoking will be difficult in a country where it is perceived as positive because cigarette companies sponsor everything from scholarships to sporting events .

US soldiers taunt Iraqi children in Facebook video
An Alaska - based soldier is under investigation for a video on his Facebook page that taunts smiling Iraqi children by asking if they 're gay , if they engage in certain sex acts and if they would grow up to be terrorists .
An Australian man was shot in the leg during a deadly Israeli raid on a Gaza - bound aid ship in the Mediterranean , Foreign Minister Stephen Smith has confirmed .
Mr Smith said two other Australians known to be aboard the ship - a journalist and photographer - were safe after the " terrible and shocking incident " , which left nine people dead .
He said the wounded Australian had received hospital treatment and been provided with consular assistance following the shooting .
The Turkish vessel was leading a convoy of six ships , with 600 people on board , and set sail for Gaza from international waters off Cyprus on Sunday in defiance of an Israeli - led blockade of the territory .
Israeli commandos backed up by warships and helicopters boarded the ships during a night - time operation in international waters .
At least nine pro-Palestinian activists were killed but Israel says its forces only opened fire after coming under attack from activists armed with clubs and knives .
Aerial footage released by Israel appears to show commandos being attacked as they abseil onto the deck of the ship .
But reports from on board the ship say the Israeli soldiers began firing first and that activists were waving white flags .
Mr Smith said he had no information of any other Australians wounded or held , but his department was seeking consular access .
" We are , through our officials , strenuously trying to ascertain the whereabouts and welfare of any other Australians , " he said .
" We do know in the case of the two journalists that they are safe .
So far as the injured Australian is concerned , he is being provided with consular assistance . "
He said the journalists had been advised they were open for deportation .
Mr Smith said the Government would consider very carefully the best way of handling the incident , but stressed the onus was on Israel to provide a detailed explanation of the attack .
" I think we do need to proceed very calmly ; there is always claim and counter - claim , " he said .
" Firstly I think it is appropriate for Australians to deplore the violence and deplore the deaths .
" Certainly Australia thinks there has to be a credible investigation .
The onus is on Israel to effect a credible investigation .
" The onus is on Israel to present to the international community , and in our view the [ UN ] Security Council , a credible , transparent investigation to these matters .
" There are of course concerns , not just expressed in Australia but throughout the international community , of the use of force and the possible use of disproportionate force . "
Asked whether the incident would have a marked effect on Israel 's standing in the international community , Mr Smith said : " That will depend on the way in which Israel conducts itself now . "
Israel 's ambassador to Australia , Yuval Rotem , accused the activists of trying to incite a confrontation to garner media attention .
He expressed sorrow over the incident , but insisted Israel had acted in self - defence .
" Israel is a democratic country and Israel has a commitment to protect its own people , " he said .
" Israel can not compromise its own security by having unchecked boats and ships going into Gaza , because these ships may carry , as far as we know , weapons that may ultimately be used against Israel . "
Greens leader Bob Brown has condemned Israel 's actions .
" It 's a horrifying situation , " he told the ABC's NewsRadio .
" The death toll has to be condemned - there is no apparent excuse [ for the violence ] .
The Israeli government has an answer to give to the world here , and it has not given a satisfactory answer . "

Power laws in chess
Sergei Maslov Department of Condensed Matter Physics and Materials Science , Brookhaven National Laboratory , Upton , NY 11973 , USA
The popularity of various chess openings follows a power law distribution , but the exponent depends on the depth of the opening sequence .

Blasius and Tönjes find that for all games up to d = 40 , the opening sequence popularity follows a Zipf power law with universal exponent nearly equal to − 2 , but for small values of d , the exponent is nonuniversal and depends linearly on d .

( Adapted from Ref . [ 1 ] . ) ×
Finding power laws has now become de rigueur when analyzing popularity distributions .
Long tails have been reported for the frequency of word usage in many languages [ 2 ] , the number of citations of scientific papers [ 3 ] , the number of visits ( hits ) to individual websites in a given time interval [ 4 ] , and many more .
In all these cases ( including this new one related to chess ) the exponent of the distribution is close to - 2 .
That is , the number of entries ( chess openings , words , papers , or websites ) with popularity P approximately scales as P - 2 .
The semi-universal value of this exponent was first noticed by Zipf [ 2 ] when he saw the same statistics apply to such different objects as words ranked by their popularity and cities ranked by their population .
Many scientists proposed simple ( and not so simple ) models aimed at explaining the origins of this scaling .
For city - size distribution , the celebrity list of modelers includes Paul Krugman [ 5 ] — the Nobel Prize winning economist and New York Times columnist .
Even though the laws of population dynamics responsible for city formation and subsequent growth appear to have very little in common with rules dictating preferences in chess openings , all inverse quadratic power - law distributions became collectively known as “ Zipf ’s law . ”
There is indeed something special about the distribution P - α , with α = 2 , since it separates the region with a well - defined average ( α > 2 ) from that where the average formally diverges and thus depends on the upper cutoff ( α ≤ 2 ) .
Nevertheless , the quest for the universal “ first principles ” explanation of Zipf ’s law remains elusive .
Apart from establishing yet another example of Zipf ’s law , the work of Blasius and Tönjes goes a long way towards elucidating its origins in the special case of sequential games or , more generally , any composite multistep decision processes ( e.g. , complex business or political strategies ) .
These processes are best visualized as decision trees with multiple choices at each level ( Fig. 1 ) .
The number of possible paths on such trees grows exponentially with the number of steps .
As a result , even in the simplest cases the exhaustive enumeration very soon becomes impossible .
The first important observation made by the authors is that if one concentrates on the distribution of popularity of opening sequences limited to the first d steps of the game , it will also be described by a power law , yet with a nonuniversal exponent α d that linearly grows with the number of moves .
The universal Zipf distribution with α = 2 is recovered only after these d-dependent distributions are all merged together .
The rationale for such a merger leading to double counting is poorly explained in the paper .
Nonuniversal power - law exponents often implicate multiplicative random walks [ 6 –8 ] and this case is no exception .
Other examples of power laws generated by multiplicative random walks include wealth of individuals [ 9 ] , stock prices and their drawdowns ( deviations down from the maximum ) [ 10 ] , gene family sizes expanding by gene duplication [ 11 ] , and many others .
One way to calculate the popularity of a particular opening sequence σ is to notice that every sequential move i of the sequence reduces the number of games in the database that open with these moves by a factor 0 < r i ≤ 1 .
These factors are the same as branching ratios illustrated in Fig.
1 . If the total number of recorded games is N ( which is ∼ 1 .
5 million in the professional chess database ScidBase [ 12 ] used in this work ) then the number of openings starting with a particular sequence of d moves is given by N ( σ ) = N r 1 r 2 … r d .
The value N ( σ ) = 1 serves as an absorbing lower boundary for this multiplicative process .
When a random walker hits such an absorbing boundary it stops moving altogether .
In the case of chess opening , once the diversity is down to just one realization , a unique move will be selected at each subsequent time step and N ( σ ) will remain at 1 until the end of the game .
In the case of standard ( additive ) random walks , a boundary generally gives rise to an exponential Boltzmann distribution .
For multiplicative random walks after the logarithmic change of variables [ 6,7 ] , this exponential distribution becomes a power law .
The exponent α d of the high - popularity tail of the distribution can be analytically derived for some special cases of the distribution of ratios r i : ρ ( r ) ∼ r β ( see Eq. ( 6 ) in the paper of Blasius and Tönjes [ 1 ] ) .
According to these calculations , α d linearly increases with the number of moves d .
This is in agreement with the actual distribution of popularity of chess openings .
However , the empirically measured ρ ( r ) , shown in Fig. 3 ( a ) of their paper , has a different profile .
Surprisingly , it closely follows the parameter - free distribution ρ ( r ) = 2 / π 1 - r 2 .
This distribution describes the density of points on a circle projected onto its diameter .
Blasius and Tönjes offer no explanation for this empirical observation .
Qualitatively , this profile of ρ ( r ) makes intuitive sense .
At every position of pieces on the chess board , out of many moves allowed by the rules , just one would lead to the most favorable position for the long - term outcome of the game .
Such moves that maximize the gradient of “ fitness ” would be preferentially selected by skillful chess players ( the average rating of players in the database puts them between the Candidate Master and the International Master levels ) .
This selection would manifest itself in ρ ( r ) increasing ( and possibly even diverging ) as r → 1 .
This divergence is a direct manifestation of players ’ skills .
Indeed , if I were to play the game of chess against other equally clueless players , the shape of ρ ( r ) defined by our uninformed random moves would likely to be flatter than that shown in Fig. 3 ( a ) of Ref . [ 1 ] .
As a suggestion for future studies , it would be interesting to empirically verify this hunch using player ratings included in the ScidBase or other less selective chess databases .
In other words , is the distribution of openings selected by the best players significantly different from that selected by the worst players ?
Another observation made by the authors is that the shape of ρ ( r ) is independent of the depth of the game d .
This indicates that , at least at early stages of the game , the phase space of favorable moves does not significantly depend on d .
All these empirical facts summarizing the collective knowledge of many chess players have implications for the design of chess - playing computer algorithms .
Thinking about chess has a long and venerable history in computer science .
One of the founding fathers of information theory , Claude Shannon , has worked on this topic .
In his 1950 paper [ 13 ] he outlined two possible approaches to designing a computer program playing chess : the brute force strategy , performing the exhaustive evaluation of all possible moves and opponent ’s responses for as many steps as computer power would allow .
The other strategy is to iteratively select a few of the most promising moves at every step and concentrate computer resources on following a smaller number of more likely paths on the decision tree of the game .
The shape of ρ ( r ) in Ref. [ 1 ] provides an empirical justification for this latter strategy that is indeed the one used by modern chess - playing programs .
During the last decade it became customary to blame all types of power laws in popularity on linear preferential attachment mechanisms first used to explain the Zipf ’s law by another Nobel Laureate , Herbert Simon [ 14 ] .
According to these models , the high popularity of certain items is a frozen accident self - sustained by fashion .
For example , an initially popular website would acquire new links at a higher rate than its less popular cousins , and as a consequence , further increase its visibility .
While in certain situations fashion - driven preferential attachment is likely to be responsible for long tails of popularity distribution , it is reassuring to know that it is not the case in chess — a quintessential game of skill .

What I can't understand is why you keep encouraging people to vote in rigged elections , Brad .
Without the consent of the governed , our government would n't have as easy a time getting away with everything that it does .
Pointing to what they do wrong and pointing to faith - based elections is n't enough .
It is the faith - based elections that allow them to claim the legitimacy to do whatever they wish , and since we cannot hold them accountable once they 're in office ( the only time they 're supposed to represent us -- once their term of office is up , when we 're allowed to vote in faith - based elections again , the damage has already been done and cannot be undone ) , it really does n't matter who wins .
Sure some officials are more corrupt than others , but they are all dependent upon corporate money .
Yes , I know the people you voted for have done bad things .
I warned you that they would and I begged everyone not to vote for them .
Why would otherwise good , concerned , sincere citizens grant their consent of the governed in faith - based elections ( where they can't even be sure that their votes are counted at all , no less counted accurately ) , to a pro-war , pro-bailout , anti-environment government ?
If we simply refused to vote until we got open , honest , free , fair , verifiable elections , where the popular vote was the final say and could not be overturned , we'd have the possibility of bringing about change .
When you know that the game is rigged , it is okay to ask for a fresh deck .
If you 're willing to keep playing with a marked deck , nobody is going to offer you a new one .
You vote for people when you do n't know if your vote will be counted or not , do n't know if they 're lying or not , and know only that no matter what they do , you wo n't be able to hold them accountable while they 're in office and will have to just gripe and gripe and wait for the next faith - based election and the next faith - based election .
What the hell do you belief in about our system that is so strong that it compels you to continue to vote in faith - based elections ?
Or do you just do it because your friends do ?
Or , maybe , it is local candidates and issues .
Maybe local candidates and issues like health care , reproductive rights , marriage equality , legal pot , etc. , are so important to you that you 're willing to consent to wars of aggression , torture , bailouts , and the destruction of the planet ?
Is it that voters only care about themselves and are lying when they say that they care about human rights , peace , and the environment ?
Really .
Take two presidential candidates who are both pro-war , pro-bailout , and anti-environment , and voters will insist that the one who they hope cares more about reproductive rights or health care or legal pot is less evil .
So what if they kill millions of people , torture known innocents , and destroy the only habitate we have -- they must be less evil because they might side with us about some selfish little thing we want ?
F**k health care , reproductive rights , legal pot , gay marriages , and all the rest of it .
Without a planet to live on , it is n't going to do you any good .
Stop voting .
Stop granting your consent of the governed to mass murder based on lies , wars for oil , and corporate profits .
If that REALLY is n't what you want , stop voting for it .
I know you 're afraid that if you do n't vote , Sarah Palin will win .
And maybe she would be worse than Obama .
Instead of just ignoring a regulatory agency doing meth and watching porn and allowing the corporations to write their own reports , as Obama has , and trying to open up more offshore drilling as Obama has , and granting environmental exemptions as the Obama administration has , maybe Palin would be worse .
I can't see how , but I 'll grant the possibility for the sake of argument .
But with a 20 % turnout or less , and where would her mandate be ?
Who would loan her government money ?
Which allies would send their troops to fight in her wars ?
When a government loses the consent of the government through a successful election boycott , they can no longer pretend to be a democracy and become a pariah .
Do you think we have a democracy ?
Did Obama ask you if he could let BP drill in the Gulf ?
Do you have a voice in government , or just a possibly counted ( or miscounted ) vote in a faith - based election ?
Is that all you want ?
Do n't voters care about their own friggin ' survival ?

Brad , I totally agree and do n't understand why anyone would choose to create a potential worst case scenario that can't be fixed .
Has the nuclear energy industry figured out what to do with nuclear waste ?
I may be behind the times , but I do n't recall a satisfactory way of dealing with it in a totally fail - safe manner .
I guess lobbyists for safe renewable energy do n't throw as good of parties as the oil and coal boys for MMS and other interested parties .

We all know in our hearts that at root capitalism itself is the problem .
We must overcome a century 's worth of very effective brainwashing and admit our planet cannot survive any more genuflecting to the all mighty god Profit .
Socialism is not a bad word .
It is our specie 's only hope we must nationalize OUR airwaves , our energy sector and our healthcare , for starters .
Granted this sounds impossible now , but we progressives need to start calling for it as the only practical solution .
Get the discussion going .
Let our demands on behalf of all humanity be known .
Then , when the entire state of Florida is engulfed in this horrific mess and the eastern seaboard and even Europe are threatened , more and more people will begin to awaken from their slumber and realize how and why they have been indoctrinated with the fallacy that socialism is evil .
If we have done our job in laying the groundwork of imagining the possible , a massive paradigm shift could take place .

Uh , Camusrebel , socialism is n't going to fix any of this problem that Brad is talking about .
Capitalism is not the problem , friend .
Greed , Corporatism and lack of government regulation where it matters , is the problem that led us here .
One thing is for certain , here is an issue that everyone , of all political stripes , agrees is a horrible disaster and one that should never have happened .
Everyone wants to help , but what can we do ?
What if we unite on this one issue and begin to bring America back to a united country rather than divided liberals / progressives vs right wing / conservatives ?
Do n't give up !

Voting is the only way to get rid of the decades old politicians .
However , voters only get to vote on who the pol .
parties choose so we still really do n't get the choice candidate we want .
It 's a vicious cycle only to be altered with a third party or everyone get actively involved in a political party .

Uh , Cathy , when we nationalize energy , media and healthcare greed and corporatism will be ugly remnants of the past .
We all want a bright future for our grandchildren 's grandchildren .
As a species we have the intelligence to provide that .
We must start thinking outside the box , then destroying the box .
Drastic times call for drastic measures .
Half measures and biz as usual are inadequate .
Our planet cannot survive much more capitalism where investors demand more , more , more , more profit no matter the cost on countries workers , ecosystems , our common future .

Green Clover , the only thing that voting in faith - based elections does , is prove that people who do it are true believers unconcerned with the facts or the truth .
Even if every eligible voter in the country voted for a Democratic or a Green , the corporate agenda would still determine policy .
The unelected Supreme Court has the Constitutional power to overturn any election it does n't like .
That could n't happen in a democracy where the votes , not some unelected Supreme power , determines policy .
The Framers of the Constitution feared too much democracy , so they interposed layers of bureaucracy between voters and decision - making .
The will of the public can be disregarded or superceded , but the will of the Supreme court can not be appealed .
Voting in faith - based elections for candidates you cannot hold accountable while they 're in office ( the only time that they are supposed to represent you ) is stupidity .
Before the '08 election I asked people at peace rallies and in an informal online survey , if they would continue to vote if the only federally approved voting mechanism was a flush toilet .
About half of them said that they would .
They believe that people fought and died for their right to flush their vote away or to throw it into some other black hole of an unverifiable system .
They are too stupid to understand the difference between a vote that is n't counted and a real voice in government .

for as brilliant as Chu is supposed to be , his response to Maddow 's question of how do we deal with the nuclear waste was less than satisfying , to say the least .... it was basically " We 've got about 50 years to figure it out . " ....
Uh huh ... we 've already had about 50 years to figure it out and have n't yet , so what 's to make the next 50 years any different given the lack of interest of the " private market " and the lack of government interest / funding for anything other than military endeavors ?

Nuclear power , although " green " for now has a byproduct that will be around until the end of time .
Period .
Solar and wind power are the future and are natural , really " green " .
Obama has been two faced on this matter , saying he is green then approving offshore drilling off the coast of Virginia ( then overturning his decision amidst the current tragedy )
The wind option is being voted down due to the Kennedy 's fear of sea wind farms disrupting their yatching .
A prime example of elitist standing in the way of progress .
The Kennedy 's are fools , and so are you if you think nuclear is completely safe .
I still remember when American 's took a stand against nuclear power , folks like Bruce Springsteen .. a massive supporter of Obama .
So does Obama saying it is safe , make it safe ?
Inexperience on Obama 's part shines through on a daily basis .
Just look at the crime rate in Illinois , he was a failure as a leader on a state level and an even bigger failure as a leader on a national and a pure failure as a leader on a global level .
Other than that he is a cool guy to burn a joint with and listen to some Lil Wayne with .
Come on 2012

This summer , the New Jersey Devils will have at least 5 roster spots to fill , per CapGeek , 2 forwards , 2 defensemen , and a goaltender .
Earlier this month , I 've done an overview of all the free agents coming out of New Jersey with thoughts on what the Devils should do .
Since then , I 've focused a lot of attention on the two biggest unrestricted free agents coming away from the 2009 - 10 roster , if not the league : Paul Martin and Ilya Kovalchuk .
Initially , here was my take on Martin and Kovalchuk :
I thought Andy Greene was great in this past season , but I 'd feel a lot more comfortable with Martin as the # 1 instead of hoping Greene can repeat his 09 - 10 season .
....
Trading for Ilya Kovalchuk was the right call in my opinion .
He brings a lot of positives to the Devils , and he's an excellent scorer who plays against top competition .
He also boosts the profile of the team as an established star in the game today .
Guys like Kovalchuk are rare .
However , given the cap situation and the fact that Kovalchuk plays the same position as Parise and Elias , is it wise for the Devils to commit a ton of money to three left wingers ?
Initially , I think not .
Kovalchuk and Martin being UFAs both require a post of their own in the future .
I 'll go into detail there .
Now , I 've made the case that Paul Martin will be the most effective defenseman on the market this summer ; and gave my opinion as to why the best thing the Devils can do for their defense is to retain Paul Martin and then sign a UFA to upgrade the # 4 spot in place of Mike Mottau .
However , while the short - term decision is between Martin or Kovalchuk ; after researching Kovalchuk 's contributions and on - ice impact a little more , I think the decision is really between Kovalchk or Parise .
Yes , Zach Parise .
I think he 's proven over the last three seasons that while Kovalchuk is a fantastic talent and would make a great Devil , Parise is the better left winger overall and so re-signing Kovalchuk is not necessary , in addition to the salary cap and positional problems that may arise with retaining him .
Please continue on after the jump for my case against Kovalchuk .
The Points
One of the first things people look at when it comes to comparing players is points .
I do n't think it 's the only way , but let 's look at it first before delving into more advanced stats .
From NHL.com , here they are .
GP G A P +/- PIM PPG SHG GWG GTG SOG PCT 07-08 - Ilya Kovalchuk 79 52 35 87 - 12 52 16 2 4 0 283 18.4 08-09 - Ilya Kovalchuk 79 43 48 91 - 12 50 12 0 6 0 275 15.6 09-10 - Ilya Kovalchuk 76 41 44 85 10 53 12 0 4 0 290 14.1
vs .
GP G A P +/- PIM PPG SHG GWG GTG SOG PCT 07-08 - Zach Parise 81 32 33 65 13 25 10 1 8 0 266 12.0 08-09 - Zach Parise 82 45 49 94 30 24 14 0 8 0 364 12.4 09-10 - Zach Parise 81 38 44 82 24 32 9 1 5 0 347 11.0
Kovalchuk has been one of the league 's premier scorers over the past decade , whereas Parise was n't even drafted until 2003 and did n't play until 2005 - 06 .
He really broke out in 2008 - 09 , putting up 98 more shots on net and outscoring Kovalchuk , and the comparison by points is a bit more fair .
We can immediately see that Kovalchuk is the superior shooter by both goals and shooting percentage ; but Parise has racked up far more shots .
Combined with a much smaller shooting percentage range , we get a sense that Parise is about 11 - 12 % overall and given that he creates and takes so many shots , that 's where the production comes from .
I 'd go as far as to say that both players are big producers - Kovalchuk as the better sniper and Parise as the more persistent winger .
Goals Versus Threshold
Let 's go beyond points and use something more complex .
Last week , I brought up Tom Awad 's Goals Versus Threshold ( GVT ) stat to highlight that Ilya Kovalchuk was a big contributor to his teams ( and that he was not a defensive liability ) in 2009 - 10 .
Still , he was n't the best to end in New Jersey .
Zach Parise was one of the few forwards who had a higher total GVT than Kovalchuk last season , per Behind the Net 's listing .
Therefore , Parise contributed more to his team than Kovalchuk did ( and the only forwards he did n't surpass were Ovechkin , Crosby , Henrik Sedin , Backstrom , and Semin ) .
Awad put together an all - time GVT list for all NHL players since 1944 and in the massive file , every player had their GVT broken down by season complete with rank among all NHL players from that season .
While Awad 's GVT listings were normalized to account for changes across eras and rounding errors leave a few GVT values rounded up 0.1 more than they may appear , here 's how Kovalchuk and Parise stacked up in the last three seasons .
Both have been great contributors , but Parise really took it up another level in the last two seasons .
What this tells me is that Kovalchuk may have been more consistent , but Parise has recently been the more significant contributor to his teams .
5 - on - 5 On - Ice Impact
A few days ago , I focused on the on-ice and on - ice impact numbers from Kovalchuk in the last three seasons .
Utilizing the on -ice / off-ice and zone start numbers from Behind the Net , I was able to compare Kovalchuk among all forwards who have played at least 30 games and had at least a time on ice per 60 of 13 for 5 - on - 5 situations .
Here 's my post with those results , but the following chart summarizes Kovalchuk 's own impact .
Where Kovalchuk stood out was in on - ice shooting percentage , on - ice impact on goals for per 60 , and goals for per 60 .
His PDO was quite good across all three seasons .
However , he did n't have a positive impact on his teams ' shots for per 60 , he only provided a small impact in 07-08 for reducing shots against per 60 , and he never had a good adjusted Corsi per 60 due to having such a poor Corsi to begin with .
Partially the result of playing on bad teams , perhaps , but his quality of teammates increased over each of the past three seasons only to result in , well , just above 0 in 2009 - 10 .
Parise was among the hundred or so forwards in the comparison .
However , the significance and number of areas where Parise had a positive impact in New Jersey makes it moot .
In terms of even - strength on - ice impact , Parise is clearly the more well - rounded forward .
When he steps on the ice , good things tend to happen .
That 's not a cliche , that 's not a talking point , that 's the truth at even strength .
5 - on - 4 On - Ice Impact
The same even holds in 5 - on - 4 situations .
While Kovalchuk is one of the few players in the league to get tons of ice time on the power play regularly , his on - ice numbers and on - ice impact were n't very good despite being present for a lot of power play goals .
I go into more detail here , admitting that I still do n't know what could cause this for Kovalchuk while someone like , say , Alex Ovechkin , can play neatly as much and have an amazingly beneficial on - ice impact on his team 's PP .
Parise , on the other hand , well , he out - did Kovalchuk in on -ice and on - ice impact as well despite not having been on the ice for so many PPGs .
Especially in this past season .
Conclusion of Parise vs. Kovalchuk
Here 's what I think about Ilya Kovalchuk , just so does n't anyone mistake me .
Kovalchuk is an excellent player and has been a consistent scorer for about a decade .
Kovalchuk is fast , slick with the puck , able to bust out moves to thrill the fans , and is an exceptional shooter .
Seriously , even Gabe at Behind the Net notes that while what makes a player successful at scoring is still undiscovered , in fact , Kovalchuk 's really in a class of his own when it comes to shooting the puck .
Clearly , he 's the type of player rarely seen in a Devils uniform .
The type of player that makes people go to games just to see what he can do .
The star who can command such fan support to put up a giant " KOVALCHUK ARMY " banner in Section 208 during the playoffs .
The notion that Kovalchuk is selfish or is a sieve on defense or does n't care about the postseason or can't be a New Jersey Devil is absolute garbage in my opinion .
Anyone who wants to tell me otherwise better have some actual facts to back any of that up .
Parise will never be as gifted of a shooter as Kovalchuk .
In terms of production , Kovalchuk 's still ahead of Parise ; and while loved in New Jersey , Parise is n't " there " in terms of being a star .
However , Parise has been playing like a star and he 'll get there in due time .
More importantly , Parise has been a bigger contributor to his team than Kovalchuk has been and the team benefits in multiple ways beyond just goals for per 60 when Parise comes on the ice at even strength .
Both are great , but I think it 's clear Parise is more of a complete player than Kovalchuk .
The Money Issue - The Salary Cap Issue
Kovalchuk is coming off a contract where he 's made $ 6.3893 million over the last 5 seasons per CapGeek .
I highly doubt he 's going to want a maximum value contract , and I do n't see any reason why he would take a pay cut .
If you think he will , well , explain it to me because I 'd be highly skeptical .
Especially given that he's at the prime of his career .
For the sake of argument , let 's consider that the Devils sign him to a nominal increase : $ 6.4 million .
That would make him the highest paid player on the New Jersey Devils and leave the Devils with $ 9.54 million left in cap space to sign two defensemen , sign a back - up goaltender , and sign centers plus retaining restricted free agents like David Clarkson and Mark Fraser , who will both fill up another $ 1.5125 million if they sign for the minimum possible amount .
Actually , make it $ 2.145 million if Rod Pelley signs for the minimum too and stays up in NJ .
So the amount of money really left to play with in this hypothetical , unrealistic - everyone - signs - relatively - cheap scenario , is $ 7.395 million .
Let me continue the cheap deals ; knock off another $ 500 k should Yann Danis or some other back up comes in at the league minimum .
So that 's $ 6.895 left for two defenseman positions and two centers .
Unless
Lou wants to go right up to the salary cap limit - and this whole time I 'm assuming a $ 58.6 million cap - expect the signings to be cost - effective .
That would mean that we can forget about any chance of re-signing or replacing Paul Martin , the most effective defenseman on the market this summer .
Without a real replacement out on the market , that only serves to weaken the defense .
I would also guess that the chances of the Devils retaining Mike Mottau instead would rise dramatically .
While the Devils can bring someone up from Lowell , keep in mind that they have cap hits of their own , per CapGeek .
Tyler Eckford is a RFA and by mandated raises for RFA , he 'll be at a million or higher ; and Matthew Corrente would add another $ 821.7 k .
Of course , if they sign Mottau or some other cheap defenseman , with Fraser retained , the Devils would have 6 defensemen on the roster : a top 4 of Greene - White - Salvador - Mottau / UFA .
Not exactly something that you 'll be necessarily pleased with by the start of the 2010 - 11 season .
As for centers , the Devils can save some space by moving Patrik Elias or Dainius Zubrus to center .
Meaning , the Devils will move players who have been more effective as wingers into a center position .
This would lead the Devils have some cash to sign a checking center or a tweener between the second and third lines .
Now , this is all considering that Kovalchuk signs the cheapest contract where he would n't take a pay cut .
The likelihood of that is probably somewhere less than 1 % .
Essentially , forget about the Devils signing both Kovalchuk and Martin ; the cap situation would be even tighter to really improve where the Devils need to improve .
The Devils could , of course , trade someone to provide space .
Only deals in the NHL are n't done in a vacuum and any deal to free up cap space would probably leave Lou with far less than true value for what he may offer .
And space will likely need to be freed up for Parise getting a deserved raise after 2010 - 11 .
At least with just signing Martin , the Devils have more room to play with while ensuring their defense has a true leader .
Not retaining Kovalchuk would mean , what , Patrik Elias going back to left wing and the Devils looking for a second line center ?
I would think that 's a far more sensible situation to be in this summer and the team could still address needs properly .
The Money Issue - The Positional Issue
Let 's go to a more qualitative question :
If Kovalchuk re-signs for only $ 6.4 million , then he 'll be the highest paid player on his team .
Given that Zach Parise has been the top forward on the Devils in the past two seasons and will likely be the top forward again , can we be satisfied with committing this much money to someone playing behind Parise at left wing ?
Well , we already are with Elias .
He makes $ 6 million and I do n't think anyone minds as long as he produces .
Which he does for the most part .
Still , if the idea is to make a big change , keep Kovalchuk as a star , and have him be a crucial part of the team , how can he do that if he 's behind Parise ?
Would he be happy for a whole season behind Parise ?
Would Parise be happy for a whole season behind Kovalchuk ?
Of course , Elias is the example
Speaking of , let me bring this up again : Elias ' best position is at left wing , Parise 's best position is at left wing , and Kovalchuk 's position is left wing .
Even before a Parise extension , we 're talking at least $ 15.525 million ( it'll be higher depending on what Kovalchuk commands ) at one forward position .
That 's a lot of money to tie up in one side of the ice ; and it leaves less to address center or defense .
That 's why I think if Kovalchuk is signed , it 'll likely mean Elias is going to center or going to the off - wing on the right side .
It makes no sense to put either of these guys on the third line , not that moving Elias away from his best side makes a lot of sense .
That 's why I think keeping Kovalchuk is n't necessary .
He 's talented , he 's fantastic , he works hard , but how much he 'll command will be much more than Martin , it 'll leave less cap space for other moves , and it'll create issues among the roster that could be better addressed with just Parise and Elias at left wing .
There 's merit in keeping in Kovalchuk and I believe an argument can be made for it .
However , I believe that resigning Martin over Kovalchuk is the more sensible option .
It gives the Devils more room to address their other needs , possibly retain some space for an extension for Parise ( which is important ) , and allows Parise and Elias to remain in their best position : left wing .
It 's especially vital that Parise remains the top left wing on the team , as he has been a big contributor on the ice and has had a very positive impact on the team when he has come on the ice .
He needs to be on the first line to best benefit the Devils , and signing Kovalchuk could very well disrupt that .
Again , Elias has had no issue playing behind Parise ; but for the potential money Kovalchuk commands , it begs the question that he needs to be on the first line to possibly justify his contract .
Which leads me back to what the stats showed : Parise is more of a complete player than Kovalchuk .
Therefore , Parise should remain at the top , Elias should remain on the left wing , and that means Kovalchuk walks .
Great player , but ultimately , the situation is n't right to keep him .

LOS ANGELES ( MarketWatch ) --
High - end electric - car company Tesla Motors filed for an initial public offering Friday , seeking $ 100 million in the public - financing arena as conventional auto makers are reeling from anemic sales and product recalls .
Palo Alto , Calif . - based Tesla filed documents with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission , but did not indicate in the filing when those shares would be sold on the public markets , nor what the initial price would be .
Company executives could not be immediately reached for comment .
If successful , the IPO could help usher in a new era for the auto industry , which is steadily moving toward cleaner - burning engines .
The IPO is expected to be one of the most high - profile offerings in some time , and is the first by a U.S. automaker since Ford Motor Co. F , +0.90 % entered the public markets in 1956 .
Whether Tesla can take advantage and shift public tastes more toward zero-emission cars is unclear .
But the timing of the IPO could prove to be shrewd .
" We believe incumbent automobile manufacturers are at a crossroads and face significant industry - wide challenges , " Tesla said in its filing , adding that " the legacy investments made by incumbent automobile manufacturers in manufacturing and technology related to the internal combustion engine have to date inhibited rapid innovation in alternative - fuel powertrain technologies . "
While Ford has been prospering of late , rivals General Motors and Chrysler have been suffering from downtrodden sales , and were taken over by the federal government last year .
Meanwhile , top foreign producer Toyota Motor Corp. TM , - 1.34 % is having to recall millions of its automobiles around the globe due to a problem with sticking accelerator pedals .
The Tesla Model S. NAIAS
Tesla first started selling its $ 100,000 all - electric sports car , the Roadster , in 2008 and followed that up last year with the Roadster 2 .
The company claims in its IPO filing that the car has a range of 236 miles on a single charge , and says it has sold 937 of the vehicles in 18 countries .
It is designing a sedan designed for family use , the Model S , which would run for $ 49,900 after a $ 7,500 federal tax credit , the company 's IPO said .
The sedan would have a range of 160 to 300 miles on a single charge .
In addition , Tesla is negotiating with Daimler AG DAI , +0.72 % to provide its electric powertrain and battery technology for Daimler 's Smart fortwo car .
One thousand Tesla battery packs and chargers are being used in a trial with Smart fortwo cars in five European cities .
Tesla said it has taken out a $ 465 million long - term loan with the Energy Department under its advanced - vehicles manufacturing program to build a facility that will manufacture the Model S .
The company added that it has been given up to $ 31 million under similar California state programs .
In the filing , Tesla indicated its revenue will decrease substantially before the Model S is rolled out -- expected to be sometime in 2012 .
That is because Tesla will cease selling its roadsters in 2011 and wo n't resume production on a new model until at least 2013 .
High - speed chase in Arizona ends with woman thrown to ground after fleeing cops
For the last week , my Twitter feed ( @sfriedscientist ) has been overrun with pictures of half built canoes .
Well , we finally finished the boat , so here is Bluegrass Blue Crab and the Southern Fried Scientist ’s guide to building a plywood canoe on a graduate student budget .
If you live near the water , or want to live near the water , or just want people to think you live near the water , you need a boat .
It does n’t have to be much of a boat , just enough to get you , your beverage cooler , a few fishing poles , and a healthy disregard for personal safety out far enough that you ca n’t get twitter on your smart phone ( about 4 miles offshore for Droid users , 600 yards for the iPhone ) .
So why not build a canoe ?
You need surprisingly few materials to build this boat .
The entire body is made of two sheets of good , flexible exterior plywood ( I used 1/4 inch Lauan plywood ) .
A 2 by 4 and some nice scrap wood is fine for the fittings .
This is a stitch and glue style boat , so you need zip ties , fiberglass tape , epoxy resin and hardener , wood flour or a putty system , and plenty of tarps , paintbrushes , and throwaway cups for mixing .
You ’ll also want spar varnish and a good exterior enamel paint .
If you ’re going to use screws or nails for anything , get them in brass , not steel .
This method is simple , but not as easy as brewing beer .
Finally , you ’ll want some plans .
Bateau2.com has a good free plan available for a cheap canoe .
Actually , you can ignore the rest of this post and just follow their plans .
Some fun terms you should know :
Bow – the front of the boat
Stern – the back of the boat
Port – the left side of the boat , when facing the bow
Starboard – the right side of the boat , when facing the bow
Centerline – the middle of the boat , running bow to stern
Athwart – perpendicular to the centerline
Rubrail – a thin piece of wood that runs bow to stern along both sides of the boat to add strength
Thwart – a thick piece of wood that runs athwart the middle of the boat to add strength
Bresthook – a small piece of decking at the bow or stern
Butt block – a piece of wood used to join two parts of the boat together
Seat – it ’s what you sit on
Hull – it ’s what does the floating
You need a few tools for this project , but nothing fancy .
A jigsaw , drill , and orbital sander , plus paintbrushes for the resin and spreaders for the putty should be enough .
Start by measuring and cutting your panels .
Stitch and glue is fairly forgiving , so minor variations wo n’t affect the final product .
The important thing is to make sure all the pieces are symmetric .
Line the panels up and glue then down with epoxy and butt blocks .
Let this cure the full amount of time recommended by your epoxy mix , usually at least over night .
Put some weights ( dive weights work great ) down to keep pressure on the joints .
Once they harden , it ’ll feel like one piece of wood .
Now we get to the stitch part .
Drill small holes in the panels near the edges and zip tie your panels together .
Once you have it stitched together , cover the outside seams in duck tape to prevent the resin from dripping out .
Inside the canoe paint epoxy at every seam .
Then spread the putty into the seams , making sure to keep it clean and smooth .
Lay fiberglass tape along the seams and paint epoxy over it , throughly filling the fiberglass webbing .
Once the fiberglass is laid down , paint the entire interior with epoxy to seal the hull .
Once that hardens , flip the boat over and lay down fiberglass and epoxy on the exterior seams as well .
Now is the time to add any fittings you ’d like .
I built a thwart and a seat , but you can leave the whole boat empty , too .
After the epoxy cures , sand it .
Then sand it some more .
Then sand it again foor good measure .
Epoxy glue the rubrails on , carefully clamping as you go .
I used homemade PVC clamps for two reasons .
One , they ’re cheap and numerous , and two , epoxy does n’t stick to plastic , so they come off easily .
Remove the clamps , install the bresthooks , and you ’re ready to paint .
The final product .
The interior is coated with semi-gloss spar varnish , the exterior is painted with Duke Blue enamel paint .
Rubrails are oak , bresthooks are birch .
The thwart and seat are old 2 by 4 ’s and some left over plywood panels .
Final cost of materials : $ 198
Total Time : 21 hours
Does it float ?
Maiden voyage this afternoon .

The Tory leadership was warned today that David Cameron had " lit a fuse " after he rushed through a vote to end an 80 - year tradition in which backbench Tory MPs have held a formal weekly meeting .
The prime minister was accused of launching a clumsy operation to block the election of a rebel former frontbencher , Graham Brady , as chairman of the 1922 committee after staging a short election on Wednesday night to allow ministers to attend its meetings .
Cameron won the vote today when 168 of the party 's 305 MPs voted in favour of the change , which will also allow ministers to vote for the committee 's officers .
But 118 MPs voted against the change .
In an article for the Conservativehome website , Paul Goodman , a former frontbencher , estimated that more backbenchers voted against Cameron , on the basis that the 76 Tory ministers would have voted for the change if they had been able to .
This means that an estimated 92 backbenchers are likely to have voted on the leadership 's side compared with 118 who voted no .
Rebel backbenchers have considered a " 2010 committee " to act as a new voice .
But the weight of opinion is running against this .
" If we set up a 2010 committee we might be drawn into a trap , " one MP said .
" But David Cameron has lit a fuse .
It will go off at some point in the future , when there are clouds over Westminster , and Cameron will regret his decision . "
MPs accused Cameron of bouncing the change on them without any notice to try to block the election of Brady , a former shadow Europe minister , as the 1922 committee 's chairman .
Brady is seen as something of a folk hero on the right after he resigned from the frontbench in 2007 during the row over grammar schools .
The change could boost the chances of Richard Ottaway , a veteran moderate MP , who would be more supportive of the leadership .
But MPs may be emboldened to vote for Brady to register their unease .
Goodman warned that the leadership may regret its hasty decision to weaken the power of backbenchers , who were a source of grief for John Major when he had a wafer - thin majority from 1992 - 97 .
" A week ago , Cameron retained the goodwill of most of his MPs , despite failing to win the election outright and forming a coalition with an opposing party – on what many of them regarded as dubious terms , " Goodman wrote .
" Much of that goodwill has vanished since yesterday , driven out by resentment , grievance and anger .
Tory MPs not usually prone to excitement are citing their leader in the same sentence as Kim Il Sung and Robert Mugabe . "
One senior MP said : " This is a very clumsily executed move that has split the party .
A lot of re-elected MPs are astonished and deeply offended .
Is this just a clumsy attempt to stop the election of Graham Brady as chairman of the 1922 committee ?
The sensible way to defuse this would be to say that ministers will absent themselves for the election to the executive . "
One rightwinger was scathing .
" We have a war in Afghanistan , the economy is on the racks and we have a formal coalition agreement .
Yet the prime minister found an hour in his busy diary to speak to us not on those three important matters but on the minutiae of gerrymandering a decades - old constitutional arrangement in the Tory party . "
MPs on the right were deeply offended when Cameron highlighted the need for change by singling out Sir Nicholas Winterton , who retired at the election .
The prime minister said that Winterton talked about " you " , rather than " we " .
Cameron defended the change .
" I am asking a very sensible and serious question , " he said .
" I think it is much better to have one organisation in the party which has one mind and , to coin a phrase , we are all in it together . "

Asynchronous call with multiple servers
Loop enables you to invoke multiple asynchronous calls for multiple servers concurrently .
This is good for advanced network applications .
require ' msgpack/rpc ' # create a event loop loop = MessagePack :: RPC ::Loop.new # connect to multiple servers client1 = MessagePack :: RPC::Client.new ( '127.0.0.1 ' , 18801 , loop ) client2 = MessagePack :: RPC::Client.new ( '127.0.0.1 ' , 18802 , loop ) # call two methods concurrently future1 = client1.call_async(: method1 , arg1 ) future2 = client2.call_async( : method2 , arg1 ) # join the results result1 = future1.get result2 = future2.get #
------------------ server -1 --- different servers # ^ | / # | ---------|-------- server - 2 # | ^ | | # | | | | # ---+-------+-----

Connection pooling
SessionPool #get_session returns a Session .
It pools created session and enables you to reuse established connections .
require ' msgpack/rpc ' sp = MessagePack :: RPC::SessionPool.new client = sp.get_session ( '127.0.0.1 ' , 18800 ) result = client.call( : methodName , arg1 , arg2 , arg3 )
Server API
MessagePack :: RPC :: Server is for RPC servers .
Simple usage
The public methods of the handler class becomes callbale .
require ' msgpack /rpc ' class MyHandler def methodName ( arg1 , arg2 , arg3 ) puts " received " return " return result . " end end server = MessagePack :: RPC::Server.new server.listen ( '0.0.0.0 ' , 18800 , MyHandler.new ) server.run
Advance return
You can use yield to send the result without returning .
class MyHandler def method1 ( arg1 ) yield ( " return result . " ) puts " you can do something after returning the result " end end
Delayed return
You can use AsyncResult to return results later .
class MyHandler def method2 ( arg1 ) as = MessagePack :: RPC ::AsyncResult.new
Thread.new do sleep 10 # return result 10 seconds later .
as.result ( " return result . " ) end return as end end
You can receive and send any objects that can be serialized by MessagePack .
This means that the objects required to implement * to_msgpack ( out = ’’ ) * method .
Transports
You can use UDP and UNIX domain sockets instead of TCP .
For clients
For clients , use MessagePack : : RPC ::UDPTransport or MessagePack :: RPC ::UNIXTransport .
require ' msgpack/rpc ' require ' msgpack/rpc/transport/udp ' transport = MessagePack :: RPC::UDPTransport.new address = MessagePack :: RPC::Address.new ( '127.0.0.1 ' , 18800 ) client = MessagePack :: RPC::Client.new ( transport , address ) result = client.call( : methodName , arg1 , arg2 , arg3 )
You can use transports for SessionPool .
require ' msgpack/rpc ' require ' msgpack/rpc/transport/udp ' transport = MessagePack :: RPC::UDPTransport.new sp = MessagePack :: RPC::SessionPool.new( transport ) client = sp.get_session ( '127.0.0.1 ' , 18800 ) result = client.call( : methodName , arg1 , arg2 , arg3 )
For servers
For servers , use MessagePack : : RPC::UDPServerTransport or MessagePack :: RPC::UNIXServerTransport .
require ' msgpack/rpc ' require ' msgpack/rpc/transport/udp ' class MyHandler def methodName ( arg1 , arg2 , arg3 ) puts " received " return " return result . " end end address = MessagePack :: RPC ::Address.new ( '0.0.0.0 ' , 18800 ) listener = MessagePack :: RPC::UDPServerTransport.new(address ) server = MessagePack :: RPC::Server.new server.listen( listener , MyHandler.new ) server.run
On the future :
We will continue working with our partners to bring cutting - edge new Android handsets to market , but we have nothing to announce right now .
On support :
This announcement does n't have any immediate impact on support for consumers who purchase Nexus One through the web store .
Although Google launched the Nexus One with grand plans to radically change the way consumers purchased phones and service , it looks like the experiment has fizzled to an end -- the company just announced that will eventually stop selling handsets online and instead partner with carriers to sell the N1 in - store while using its website to promote " a variety of Android phones available globally . "
Google says customers simply want a hands - on experience before buying a phone , but we 'd say the lack of subsidies from any carrier except T - Mobile and some serious customer service issues probably played in killing Google 's original sales strategy -- and of course , both Verizon and Sprint essentially refused the N1 in favor of the bespoke Incredible and EVO 4G .
We 'd also say that Android as a whole will remain unaffected , since the Nexus One was never a huge seller , but it 's still rare that a company simply gives up a business model like this , and we do n't know if Google will ever follow up with a successor to the Nexus One .
The Google Phone is dead , people -- long live the Google Phone .
We just asked Google about future devices and support for current Nexus One owners , here 's what they said :
“ Wayne ?
Is that you ? ”
I could barely hear Telders ’ voice over the rumbling of machinery and what sounded like erratic gunfire .
I put one finger in my free ear and thumbed the volume on the satphone to a suitable level .
“ Telders !
Yes , it ’s Wayne !
Where the hell are you ?
You sound like you ’re in goddamn a war zone ! ”
“ Robertson !
Oh good , I ’m glad you called !
Hang on a second ! ”
I heard the sound of Telders ’ hurried footsteps on gravel and a couple of loud , steady pops .
Far off , a voice screamed in agony .
There was another pop , some rustling , more footsteps , and then the sound of a door creaking open and slamming closed .
The noise on the line abated accordingly .
“ Hey , sorry about that , ” Telders said in an even voice .
The rattle of muffled machine guns echoed in the distance .
“ Uh , yeah , ” I said , switching the phone to my other ear .
“ What the hell is going on there ?
Where the hell are you ? ”
I heard the sound of metal sliding against metal , then the distinct ka-chink of a semi-automatic pistol accepting a new clip .
“ I ’m in Kaesong at the moment , ” Telders replied .
“ Kae …SONG ? ” I said , punching the syllables in disbelief .
“ North Korea ? ! ”
“ Well , a few miles outside of it .
Close to the border .
Hey Robertson , sorry man , can you hang on one more quick second ? ”
“ I , uh , I , yeah , I guess . ”
“ Great , thanks . ”
There was a hollow thunk as the phone found a table or a shelf , and a few seconds later the sound of glass shattering , followed by the rapid bark of a pistol .
Korean voices responded excitedly in the distance .
I heard Telders yell something in their language .
There were a few more distant shots , then the phone rustled , and he was back .
“ Alright .
I ’m back .
Sorry , busy day . ”
“ What ? ” I slammed my palm against my head .
“ Telders , what the hell is going on ?
What the hell are you doing in North Korea ? ”
Michael exhaled , and there was a thump followed by two smaller thumps , as if he had dropped into a recliner and kicked up his feet .
“ Well we had some trouble getting the Array online up here and then this whole war thing started and that put us behind schedule … . ”
He trailed off and there was a clink of ice against glass .
“ Ahh , ” he said .
“ North Korean scotch is n’t too bad you know ?
I really did n’t expect that .
But , yeah , anyway , the war has been screwing with our schedule .
And you know , if I had to do it again , I ’d definitely pick a spot further inland .
The South Koreans are being a real pain in the ass . ”
The phone nearly slipped out of my hands .
“ Wayne ?
You still there , buddy ? ”
“ I ’m here , ” was all I could muster .
“ Great .
So how ’s 151 ?
Hey , you have n’t filed a report for a while .
What ’s up man ?
How ’s the weather there ?
How ’s Buzz ? ”
I swallowed and took a moment to gather myself .
“ Michael , you do realize that there has been a global nuclear war ?
Like everywhere ? ”
I heard Telders take another sip of his drink .
“ Yeah , and it ’s really screwing with our timetable .
But these things happen , you know .
We ’ll work around it . ”
“ These things happen ? ” I gasped .
“ Are you serious ? ”
“ Well sure … one does try to make the best of things .
You okay , Wayne ?
You do n’t sound like yourself . ”
I laughed .
“ Telders .
The world ’s blown itself up .
You ’re sitting in a shack somewhere in North Korea , apparently sniping South Koreans from your window while drinking Kim Jong - il brand scotch whiskey … and you think I sound a little strange ? ”
“ Hrm .
Well , yeah , I mean , if you put it that way .
Guess I never really thought about it .
Good point , Robertson . ”
“ You think ? ” I said sarcastically .
“ How the hell did you get there in the first place ?
There was n’t supposed to be an Array in North Korea for God ’s sake . ”
“ Oh , you did n’t know ?
That ’s right , you ’ve been off the radar for a while .
Remind me to kick your ass about that later .
You know , I was about to send someone down there and make sure you had n’t frozen to death or something . ”
I bit my lip , waiting for him to continue .
He did .
“ Anyway … Station250 , as you know , was supposed to go in near Seoul , but we hit a snag with the South Koreans .
It ’s an election year , you know , and apparently the Array was being politicized by the challenging party .
They drummed up all these crazy suspicions and all of a sudden there was a boat - load of public outcry and all kinds of messed up accusations and yadda , yadda , yadda you know how it is … politicians .
Anyway , long story short , we had already arrived in the country with everything and then they told us that we had to basically get the eff-ing , eff out .
So… North Korea seemed like as good of a place as any .
We gave them a buzz and zing - zang - zoom , here we are . ”
“ Zing - zang - zoom . ”
“ Here we are . ”
I rubbed my eyes .
“ And the North Koreans just let you in ?
Just like that ? ”
“ Oh God , no .
They would n’t even talk to us at first .
But I had made a lot of contacts in China when we were assembling Stations48 , 49 , and 50 , and they were nice enough to facilitate the negotiations .
But even then North was n’t interested .
We offered money , food , oil , weapons … everything you could think of . ”
“ Weapons ? ”
“ Oh , yeah , I… ignore that .
Is this a secure channel ?
Oh hell , I guess it does n’t matter anymore .
Nevertheless … they were n’t having it . ”
“ Okay , but you ’re in the country now , so how the hell did you do it ? ”
Telders paused .
I swear I could hear him grinning on the phone .
Finally , he said : “ Steamboat Willie . ”
“ Steamboat what ? ”
“ Steamboat Willie .
You know , one of the very first Mickey Mouse cartoons ?
Actually , the very first cartoon , ever , with completely post - produced music , dialog , and sound effects .
And you know Kim Jong - il is a huge Disney fan .
It ’s almost weird how much of a fan he is , what with all the stuffed animals and action figures and everything .
But hey , live and let live , right ? ”
I shook my head .
“ Wait , you bribed Kim Jong - il , the brutal North Korean dictator , with a… a cartoon ? ”
“ Wayne , Steamboat Willie is not just any cartoon . ”
“ Right , of course .
The very first cartoon with completely post - produced whatever , whatever . ”
“ Music , dialog , and sound effects .
But , no , I did n’t just give him some stupid DVD .
For the privilege of building Station250 on North Korean soil , I traded Kim Jong - il the original hand inked cels from Steamboat Willie .
All of them .
And all of them signed by Walt Disney , who directed the effing thing himself ! ”
“ Jesus , Telders , this is the craziest thing I ’ve ever heard .
Only you could pull off something like this . ”
He laughed .
“ True .
I mean , okay , they were n’t technically the original cels .
And Walt Disney did n’t technically sign all of them , but what the hell , Kim Jong - il is n’t ever going to know , right ? ”
“ What ?
You gave him fakes ?
Man , you better hope he never finds out . ”
I paused and scratched my head .
“ But I guess he ’s probably dead anyway , if he was anywhere near Pyongyang when the fireworks started . ”
“ Oh , ” Telders replied .
“ Do n’t you know ?
Neither of the Koreas were even touched in the war , if you can believe that . ”
“ You mean we just went through World War III and no one thought to take a shot at North Korea ? ”
“ Oddly enough .
They do n’t have nukes — at least not yet — so I guess they were n’t a huge priority . ”
“ I guess .
Japan survived as well .
I wonder who else ? ”
“ Thailand , Malayasia , Burma .
A few others , not really sure .
But most of Eastern Asia seems to have dodged the bullet . ”
But , okay , so if the Koreas did n’t get hit , why the hell is the South shooting at you ? ”
“ Well , the Koreas survived , but their allies sure as hell did n’t .
And with China , Russia , Europe , and the U.S. obliterated to hell , there ’s no one keeping these guys in check anymore .
I mean , we ’re probably five miles from the border and there are South Koreans all over the place . ”
“ That could get bad real quick .
You may want to get the hell out of there , Mike . ”
“ And go where ?
Antarctica ? ”
He laughed .
“ I like you Wayne , but it ’s like 85 degrees here today .
And at least there ’s a functioning government in North Korea .
I ’m legal for the time being , and well protected , so I ’ll pour me another scotch and see what happens .
But let me know if it warms up down there . ”
I shifted in the chair and switched ears .
“ Yeah , well , you see , Mike , I ’m , uh , not exactly in Antarctica right now . ”
“ Huh ? ” I heard Telders set his glass down .
“ Not exactly , Wayne ?
Then , where should I stop sending your paychecks ? ”
“ Telders , listen , we need to have a serious talk . ” I lowered my voice .
“ How long would it take you to get to Tokyo ? ”
BP Fought Safety Measures at Deepwater Oil Rigs Owner of Louisiana oil well objected to system that would have shut off spill .
Apr. 30 , 2010  -- BP , the company that owned the Louisiana oil rig that exploded last week , spent years battling federal regulators over how many layers of safeguards would be needed to prevent a deepwater well from this type of accident .
One area of immediate concern , industry experts said , was the lack of a remote system that would have allowed workers to clamp shut Deepwater Horizon 's wellhead so it would not continue to gush oil .
The rig is now spilling 210,000 gallons of oil a day into the Gulf of Mexico .
In a letter sent last year to the Department of the Interior , BP objected to what it called " extensive , prescriptive regulations " proposed in new rules to toughen safety standards .
" We believe industry 's current safety and environmental statistics demonstrate that the voluntary programs … continue to be very successful . "
CLICK HERE TO READ THE LETTER
That was one in a series of clashes between the industry and federal regulators that began during the Clinton administration .
In 2000 , the federal agency that oversaw oil rig safety issued a safety alert that called added layers of backup " an essential component of a deepwater drilling system . "
The agency said operators were expected to have multiple layers of protection to prevent a spill .
CLICK HERE TO READ THE SAFETY ALERT
But according to aides to Sen. Bill Nelson , a Florida Democrat who has followed offshore drilling issues for years , the industry aggressively lobbied against an additional layer of protection known as an " acoustic system , " saying it was too costly .
In a March 2003 report , the agency reversed course , and said that layer of protection was no longer needed .
CLICK HERE TO READ THE REPORT
" There was a big debate under the Bush administration whether or not to require additional oil drilling safeguards but [ federal regulators ] decided not to require any additional mandatory safeguards , believing the industry would be motivated to do it themselves , " Carl Pope , Chairman of the Sierra Club told ABC News .
A second area of focus emerging Friday involved the cement casing that was supposed to seal the well and prevent gaps from opening between the outside of the well pipe and the inside of the hole drilled into the sea floor .
If cement is not poured properly , oil and natural gas can escape – a cause of more than a dozen previous well blowouts in the Gulf .
House Energy and Commerce Chairman Henry Waxman Friday sent a letter to Halliburton , the company responsible for pouring the cement seal , asking company executives to brief committee investigators on conditions at the rig , and preserve all documents relating to their work on the sea floor .
Elmer Danenberger , an expert on offshore drilling who retired from the U.S. Department of the Interior in January , told ABC News he is worried that " lack of attention " during the pouring of the cement could be to blame .
" With these cementing operations it 's just a matter of not being attentive enough , " he said .
" What you want is a closed system .
You want the cemented pipe totally sealing the well bore .
If you do n't have that , you have problems . "
Because the well us under more than a mile of water , it may be some time before investigators have more clarity on what exactly went wrong .
But Brent Coon , a lawyer who sued BP over a previous deadly oil facility explosion , said he has obtained a restraining order to prevent the company from doing anything to cover up the cause of the accident .
" BP stands apart , heads and shoulders above all the rest of them , with respect to their conduct , " said Coon , who represents a 24 - year - old roustabout who was working on the rig at the time of the blast .
" It 's like they just do n't care . "
BP issued a release saying it had launched its own investigation into the cause of the blast , and would cooperate with federal efforts .
" Losing 11 of our industry colleagues is a tragedy for the offshore community , " said BP Group Chief Executive Tony Hayward in the statement .
" As an industry , we must participate fully in these investigations and not rest until the causes of this tragedy are known and measures are taken to see that it never happens again . "

More than 1,200 people left queuing on election night when polling stations closed were " badly let down " , an interim report has found .
The Electoral Commission said the law should be changed so anyone queuing when polls close could still vote .
It said voters had " every right to be angry " and those running elections must make sure it " never happens again " .
The report found too many voters were allocated to some polling stations , while others had too few staff .
The Electoral Commission said at least 1,200 people were still in queues at 27 stations in 16 constituencies , when polls closed at 10 pm on election night .
None of the elections will be re-run .
It said : " These problems were not widespread but some voters were badly let down on 6 May .
Everyone involved in running elections must make sure that it never happens again . "
' Inadequate ' arrangements
The commission 's interim report examined reported problems in Birmingham , Hackney , Islington , Lewisham , Liverpool , Manchester , Milton Keynes , Newcastle - under - Lyme , Newcastle , Runnymede and Elmbridge and Sheffield .
A fuller report - which will also look at other problems including mistakes on polling cards and ballot papers - will be published in July .
The numbers affected are based on estimates from returning officers , not all of whom had yet provided the commission with an estimate .
It also does not take into account people who were put off voting altogether by long queues .
Some returning officers blamed an unexpectedly high turnout and a late surge in voting .
But the commission , which provides advice and guidance to those running elections , said some " failed to follow our guidance and their performance fell short of the expected standard " .
It said some polling stations had too many voters allocated to them , others had too few staff or used " unsuitable " buildings .
And in some areas , where council or mayoral elections were taking place , there were " inadequate " arrangements to deal with the fact that people took longer to cast their votes .
People in these areas were badly let down and have every right to be angry
Jenny Watson
Electoral Commission
It added : " Election officials did not identify and respond quickly enough to the problems that emerged on polling day . "
The commission pointed out that returning officers were not allowed , under the law , to let people vote after 10 pm and recommended the law be changed to allow them to do so .
The report examined what happened in various constituencies .
Among its findings were :
At the St Paul 's Church polling station in the Birmingham Ladywood constituency , the presiding officer asked staff to confirm the time and chose the watch that was five minutes ' slow and issued ballot papers until it reached 10 pm .
Police were eventually called to disperse the crowd .
In the Ann Taylor Centre in Hackney , annoyed voters staged a sit -in protest .
About 100 students staged a protest at St John 's Ranmoor polling station in Sheffield .
At 9 pm in Lewisham police advised the acting returning officer there was a " real danger of a flashpoint " because of growing queues and that a " public order problem might occur " .
Police supervised the queue inside the polling station .
In Manchester , it is thought 200 people were unable to vote at the Ladybarn Community Centre and 100 at Didsbury United Reformed Church .
At Wolverton in Milton Keynes there were " concerns about the safety of staff " when 100 people were still queuing at 10 pm .
The returning officer went outside to stop the queue but allowed anyone ahead of him to vote .
In Newcastle - under - Lyme , staff at the St Chad's Church polling station decided to allow those that arrived before 10 pm to vote - despite an 80 - strong queue at closing time .
The report also said local authorities and returning officers should review their schemes for polling districts and the whole structure for running elections should be reformed .
' Wake - up call ' Electoral Commission chairwoman Jenny Watson said : " Returning officers in the areas affected did not properly plan for , or react to , polling day problems .
That is unacceptable .
People in these areas were badly let down and have every right to be angry . "
She said the system was " too fragmented " and needed " better co-ordination and accountability , building on existing regional models " .
Sir Howard Bernstein , acting returning officer for Manchester , apologised to those unable to vote and said although contingency measures had worked well at most polling stations - in two they were notified of queues " too late for these contingency measures to kick in " .
He welcomed the proposal to change the law to allow ballot papers to be issued after 10 pm " in exceptional circumstances " .
Peter Facey , director of campaign group Unlock Democracy said high turnout of voters was no excuse as : " Not only did this election see the third lowest turnout since 1945 , but it is a returning officer 's duty to ensure that everyone who has the right to vote can do so . "
He said : " These debacles could have been a lot worse and should serve as a wake - up call to electoral administrators everywhere . "

Thank you so much ! "

Today 's Letter : " I ’m left knowing just how little the Pentagon and the United States government think of me . "
May 14 , 2010 President Barack H. Obama
The White House
1600 Pennsylvania Avenue Northwest
Washington , DC 20500 Dear Mr. President , I am writing to you from a kitchen in the state of Washington .
The love of my life is in the other room .
It has been eight months since I saw him last and I cherish every moment we spend together .
Next week , my mid - tour leave will be over and I will return to Iraq and finish my second deployment .
I do n’t know when I ’ll see my partner again .
When serving in a war zone , you learn quite a bit about yourself and what ’s important to you .
I ’ve had the chance to work on a close and personal level with the people of Iraq , and in doing so , I have realized more than ever that the freedoms we enjoy as Americans should not be taken for granted – we must protect them at all costs .
These freedoms are essential to the very foundation of our society .
Yet so many men and women who fight for these freedoms are n’t allotted their own .
Our freedom to love and be loved by whomever we choose .
The freedom to live of a life of truth and dignity .
Recently I was informed that the military was investigating me for violating the “ Do n’t Ask , Do n’t Tell ” law .
Another service member had apparently “ outed ” me .
At first I felt free : I did n’t have to lie anymore .
But after that initial sense of relief , I ’m left knowing just how little the Pentagon and the United States government think of me .
Mr. President , my unit is extremely undermanned .
We ’re working around the clock in Baghdad .
My commander informed me that the Army cannot afford to lose me .
I was told that they would prepare my discharge paperwork , “ stick it in a Manila envelope , and keep it in a desk -- for now . ”
One moment they wanted to throw me out and the next they are hiding evidence to keep me in .
My comrades now know that I am gay , and they do not treat me any differently .
Work runs as smoothly as ever , and frankly the only difference I see -- besides my pending job loss -- is that I am free of the burden of having to constantly watch my words and ensure my lies are believable .
Having this out in the open makes things a bit less stressful .
But it ’s also clear the Army is only keeping me around until they are done with me .
After I have served my two deployments -- and only a year shy of separating from the military honorably -- I suspect they will kick me to the street .
It ’s bad enough that there is a law that denies tens of thousands of service members from serving with integrity , but it ’s even worse when such a law is carried out with such inconsistency , without any warning of when it might come down .
If my suspicions are true , my discharge will move forward after my deployment .
I am good enough to serve in war , but not at peace ?
I will never be at peace until this law is repealed – and neither will my partner .
In fact , he wo n’t even be informed if I am killed in action .
That might be the hardest part for us both .
Mr. President , when you took office I remember watching your inauguration knowing that history was being made .
I remember feeling like this weight was being lifted off of my shoulders .
I truly believed in you , and I still do .
But , Mr. President , please keep your promise to me .
Please do everything in your power to help Congress repeal “ Do n’t Ask , Do n’t Tell ” this year .
Our government called upon us to fight for our country .
So many of us answered the call ; we did not delay .
We were sent world ’s away to defend your freedoms .
Mr. President , wo n’t you fight for mine ?
With deep respect , A soldier returning to Baghdad ( The writer is currently serving and unable to identify himself publicly . )
Another heartbreaking story .
This is actually not an anomaly but part of an observable pattern supported by mountains of empirical data , and reporting : discharges over the 17 years of DADT have waxed and waned according to staffing needs of our military entanglements .
[ See The Washington Post , 60 Minutes , Columbia University School of Journalism , Metro Source , The Advocate , The Palm Center , Congressman Jim Moran ( D - VA ) Press Release . ]
The policy is clear : when times are tough , gays are good enough to serve .
When we need to trim the payroll , gays are the first to find the door , and discharged without the courtesy of receiving a hero 's thanks from the very country they served and sacrificed for .
They are escorted out like criminals .
From Major Mike Almy 's letter to the President , April 26 :
But instead , after 16 months , I was given a police escort off the base as if I were a common criminal or a threat to national security .
The severance pay I received was half of what it would have been had I been separated for any other reason .
It is a discriminatory application of a discriminatory law .
The part that really hurts me , is the thought that our government treats people this way .
I used to feel so proud to be an American .
I remember standing in grade school and citing the Pledge of Allegiance .
I remember watching " Schoolhouse Rock " on Saturday mornings as a child , and getting so wrapped up in the patriotic messages of the American ideals they presented our country as having been built upon .
It 's a fraud , though .
There is no equality under the law , there is no equal justice .
There are men and women who are welcomed home from war as heros .
And there are the men and women whose thanks are delivered by a boot to the ass , the minute they are needed no more .
There are soldiers who are heros , and there are soldiers who are just cannon fodder , just filler , not worthy of real appreciation or reward .
Why are we allowing this to continue for another day , let alone , year after year after year ?

To raise awareness to the need for Presidential leadership , DADT repeal activists have launched “ Stories from the Frontlines : Letters to President Barack Obama .
” The new media campaign launched in partnership with Servicemember 's Legal Defense Network , is intended to underscore the urgent need for congressional action and presidential leadership at this critical point in the fight to repeal “ Do n’t Ask , Do n’t Tell ” ( DADT ) .
Every weekday morning as we approach the markup of the Defense Authorization bill in the Senate and House Armed Services Committees , SLDN and a coalition of voices supporting repeal , will share an open letter to the President from a person impacted by this discriminatory law .
We are urging the President to include repeal in the Administration ’s defense budget recommendations , but also to voice his support as we work to muster the 15 critical votes needed on the Senate Armed Services Committee to include repeal .
The Defense Authorization bill represents the best legislative vehicle to bring repeal to the president ’s desk .
It also was the same vehicle used to pass DADT in 1993 .
By working together , we can help build momentum to get the votes !
We ask that you forward and post these personal stories .

• SLDN and other coalition voices are urging the President to include repeal in the Administration ’s defense budget recommendations , but also to voice his support as we work to muster the 15 critical votes needed on the Senate Armed Services Committee to include repeal .
• The House and Senate Armed Services Committees will markup the Defense Authorization bill in a few short weeks .
• The Defense Authorization bill represents our best legislative vehicle to bringing repeal to the president ’s desk .
It also was the same vehicle used to pass DADT in 1993 .
LAYOUT FOR REPEAL / HOUSE AND SENATE TRACKS :
• Sen. Mark Udall told the Denver Post the committee was “ within a vote or two ” of including repeal in the Defense Authorization bill .
Udall is a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee .
• Rep. Jared Polis , who holds a key position on the House Rules Committee , told the Denver Post he is willing to help insert a similar provision in the House version of the Defense Authorization bill with the help of Rep.
Patrick Murphy , who is the lead sponsor of the House repeal bill .
THE NEXT 30 DAYS ARE CRITICAL :
• The House Armed Services Committee markup of the Defense Authorization bill is expected May 19 .
• The Senate Armed Services Committee markup of the Defense Authorization bill is expected the week of May 24 .

Oh , those horrible , awful , violent liberals .
Neil Cavuto dug up brought health care protester William Rice out once again to show viewers how mean and violent liberals are .
Evidently , Bill is a little upset about the lack of attention he 's received since his original 15 minutes of fame back in September and was happy to re-enact his heavily edited version of events in Thousand Oaks .
You may not recognize his name , but I do .
I was present at the September MoveOn vigil for health care reform in Thousand Oaks and saw the incident unfold in real time through my camera lens .
That 's why it was a bit of a surprise to me to hear Mr. Rice describe his involvement this way :
... I was in the process of leaving when I was accosted by a man , came across the street , screaming at me that I was an effing idiot .
And he was waving his arms in a violent way , and he came at me as if to attack me .
So a scuffle ensued and my fist ended up in his mouth , and he bit my finger off .
Not so much .
Mr. Rice seems to have forgotten a few things , like the fact that he threw the first punch , nailing the guy hard between the eyes , knocking him into the street and oncoming traffic .
He also seems to have forgotten the second punch he threw where Rice 's " fist ended up in his mouth " [ Rice 's description ] .
The coincidental presence of Rice 's fist in the other guy 's mouth got a reaction : the tip of his finger was bitten off .
Cavuto trotted Mr. Faux Victim Bill
Rice out there to try to paint liberals as violent , firebreathing evildoers , but he chose a very bad example .
There were no heroes in Thousand Oaks that night .
There was Bill Rice , who decided he had the right to punch a man in the face who he disagreed with , and the man who bit his finger off , presumably after the fist found its way into his mouth .
It was an ugly incident all around , but not at all what Cavuto and Rice described .
Of course , that wo n't stop the teabaggers from trotting Rice out whenever they want , now that he's one of them , or so he claims .
There are more photos of the incident here .
They tell the story better than Rice did .
Rice is the guy in khaki .
It 's pretty pathetic to see Faux News pimp a guy who initiated a violent attack on someone else as a victim , but then ... it is FOX after all .
Michael Pollan is a bona fide food celebrity , and rightly so : much of America 's changing attitudes towards food is due to his peruasive and intelligent writing .
But what 's his deal with those pesky " feminists ? "
Advertisement
Broadsheet 's Anna Clark draws attention to Pollan 's discussion of local food movements in the New York Review of Books .
There is , she writes , one segment - that on Janet A. Flammang 's new The Taste of Civilization : Food , Politics , and Civil Society - that she finds troubling : " In a challenge to second - wave feminists who urged women to get out of the kitchen , Flammang suggests that by denigrating " foodwork " — everything involved in putting meals on the family table — we have unthinkingly wrecked one of the nurseries of democracy : the family meal . "
Says Clark ,
Pollan chooses not to challenge the assertion that second - wave feminists are responsible for " wrecking one of the nurseries of democracy " because they urged women to explore possibilities outside of cooking the family meal .
Nor does Pollan question the notion that feminists are to blame for " urging " women to leave the kitchen , when one might imagine that those who left the aprons behind were thinking beings who made their own choice to leave , regardless of the persuasions of feminists and family alike .
Advertisement
And she points to Pollan 's controversial " return to the kitchen " article of last summer , which many took to task for a rather disingenuous disregard for the obvious corollation between women 's historically fraught role " in the kitchen , " and contemporary eating habits .
I , too , was struck by this segment of Pollan 's review , but I was also surprised by what seemed to be an obvious disconnect .
Pollan may snipe at - or at least condone snipes at — " second - wave feminism , " but to suggest that the " return " to food is the work of a new population regretting a prior generation 's excesses and reclaiming lost arts just seems ... odd .
If " second - wave feminism " was the purview of progressives , well ... who does he think is spearheading the return to local and sustainable ?
It 's very much a progressive , frequently ( for good and ill ) political movement , and less a refutation than a continuation .
Indeed , I 'd venture to suggest that many of the same people have championed both causes — Alice Waters , anyone ? — and seen the two not as ideologically opposed but as natural bedfellows .
To lump " second - wave feminism " in with the scourge of fast - food and obesity seems not just wrong - headed but serves to distract attention from the actual root causes of these serious issues .
Clark worries that " nonsensical feminist - baiting is a pattern for the leading thinker of the vibrant food movement . "
Let 's hope not .

The Food Movement , Rising [ NY Review of Books ]
The Foodie Indictment Of Feminism [ Salon Broadsheet ]
The Taliban claimed responsibility on Sunday for a nighttime assault on NATO ’s largest base in southern Afghanistan .
In the second such an attack on a major ISAF installation in one week , insurgents launched rockets , mortar fire and automatic weapons while attempting to storm Kandahar Air Field .
Foreign Secretary William Hague of the United Kingdom and two of his colleagues were en route for Kandahar when the attack occurred .
Their flight was diverted .
After landing in Afghanistan , Hague told the BBC that it would be “ unwise ” and “ unhelpful ” to set a firm date for withdrawal of British forces currently deployed in the country .
“ They should only be here for as long as we need to work toward that objective of Afghans being able to look after their own security , ” said Hague .
The attack on Kandahar Air Field came mere days after a similar insurgent strike against Bagram Air Field , the main coalition base in the east of the country .
Those insurgents , some disguised as American forces , killed one contractor and injured several American service members .
Kandahar , which is one of Afghanistan ’s southernmost provinces , will be the focus of the next phase in General Stanley McChrystal ’s counterinsurgency campaign .
Earlier this month the Pentagon reported to Congress that the operation would commence “ once the political conditions are set . ”
February ’s Helmand offensive managed to put Afghan government and security personnel in place but on the whole this “ hold and build ” strategy has been slow to bear fruit .
Particularly in the south the insurgency has proven difficult to suppress .
Last week , Alex Strick van Linschoten reported from Kandahar for The National Newspaper , “ a city scarred by daily violence and nervously awaiting the attention of America ’s next offensive . ”
According to Van Linschoten , almost nine years of mismanagement and neglect have allowed the Taliban to rebuild their movement as a heterogenous collection of insurgent franchises .
“ Afghan government institutions have alienated large swathes of local society and pushed them directly into the hands of Taliban recruiters . ”
The province is of significance to both fighting parties .
Kandahar sees narcotics being moved into Pakistan while money and manpower go the other way in support of the Taliban ’s campaign .
To ISAF forces , victory in Kandahar will be pivotal to the process of transferring security and power to Afghan authorities .
Western forces are in tough spot though .
According to Van Linschoten , the Taliban represent the “ de facto authority in Kandahar City and in the outlying districts . ”
Bombs , attacks and assassinations were already fairly common but during the past three months , the situation has deteriorated rapidly .
Many families hardly venture outdoors while economic activity , consequently , has readily decreased to a bare minimum .
Economic and political life is sustained only by those who have moved to fill the positions of people who have left for calmer parts of the country .
The Kandahar residents holding official positions or owning companies are arguably the dregs of local society : able to hold their own in an increasingly violent environment but unable to offer ordinary residents a different future .
As the summer offensive grows near , “ still more people are leaving the city , ” reports Van Linschoten , “ selling their land or sending their families to Quetta or Kabul . ”
Kandahar is at the center of the Americans ’ new counterinsurgency tactics .
The Taliban , on the other hand , have always claimed southern Afghanistan as their heartland and primary base of support .
“ Nothing so far has disrupted that perception , ” claims Van Linschoten .
Resources withheld from the south in the wake of the Iraq War are now being doubled and recommitted in the face of what looks more and more like failure , and a last - ditch attempt is being made to tip the scales in favour of the Afghan government , if only temporarily .
After coalition forces secured Helmand Province in February , they managed to establish local authority in the hands of allied officials .
Yet over time , the Taliban infiltrated layers of government and civil society as government troops seemed unable to ensure permanent order .
The Kandahar operation is supposed to turn the tide of the war .
In the words of Karen DeYoung , writing for The Washington Post , “ The bet is that the Kandahar operation , backed by thousands of American troops and billions of dollars , will break the mystique and morale of the insurgents . ”
According to DeYoung , “ There is no Plan B . ”
American officials have been damping expectations for the offensive with General McChrystal saying there will be no “ D - Day ” and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , appearing alongside Afghan President Hamid Karzai before a Washington think - tank audience on Thursday , promising that the effort in Kandahar would not see “ tanks rolling into the city . ”
Clinton added that the United States does n’t want to destroy Kandahar City in order to save it .
Globs of sticky brownish ooze soil miles ( kilometers ) of sensitive shoreline and marsh from Alabama to Louisiana .
Pelican rookeries are awash in oil .
Oyster beds and shrimp nurseries face certain death .
All the while , long , slender barriers intended to protect the shoreline float twisted , tangled or sometimes just broken apart , unable to stop the creeping crude .
Since last month 's rig explosion and spill of millions of gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico — now the largest spill in U.S. history , surpassing the Exxon Valdez — more than 3 million feet ( 900,000 meters ) of so - called boom has been deployed along the coast .
But it 's not a fail - safe method of keeping the oil from washing ashore .
It 's not always sturdy enough , and high winds and waves can send the slime cascading over the barriers .
The key line of defense is sometimes defenseless itself against the elements .
" Even if it 's working properly , the best it will do is move the problem somewhere else , " said Doug Helton , incident operations coordinator for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 's Emergency Response Division .
" It might be moving it somewhere that 's not boomed or it might be moving it 100 yards away where there 's a failure in the boom , " Helton said .
" The use of booms is just one tool but all the boom does is deflect oil , and that 's if it functions properly . "
BP says it has spent more than $ 800 million on cleanup and containment efforts since its Deepwater Horizon rig exploded April 20 and sank 50 miles ( 80 kilometers ) off the Louisiana coast .
Since then , an estimated 19 million gallons ( 72 million liters ) or more of crude has spewed into the sea .
While BP could n't immediately provide a figure for how much money has been spent purchasing and deploying the booms , industry estimates put costs around $ 20 a foot ( more than $ 60 a meter ) for the basic product — totaling at least $ 60 million just to buy it , not to mention the cost to hire people to deploy it .
Experts say while the boom is n't perfect , it provides one necessary line of defense .
It also offers a psychological boost to those who feel helpless .
Because the oil spill is so widespread , manpower needed to maintain the boom and regularly collect oil from its constraints is stretched thin , Helton said .
And as the barriers break apart , he said , response time to repair them must be quick because once the oil seeps past , it 's a losing battle .
The spill 's impact on shorelines now stretches across 150 miles ( 241 kilometers ) , from Dauphin Island , Alabama , to Grand Isle , Louisiana , and has begun to creep inland into sensitive marshland .
" Normally , a spill would affect a smaller geographic area so you'd have more people per linear mile of boom to maintain it , but here the pressure was on to get the boom deployed , " Helton said .
" It 's a difficult situation and people have very high expectations .
" There 's no silver bullet , " he added .
Regardless of the setbacks , BP spokesman John Curry said the booms are still proving to be an effective tool .
" Booms , by and large , do work .
They 're not fail - safe , but they 're our best protection to contain the oil and protect the coast , " Curry said .
Stephen Reilly , CEO of Slickbar Products Corp. , one of the world 's largest manufacturers of oil spill equipment , including boom , acknowledged the product has limitations based on wind , waves and currents .
He said Slickbar has so far provided several hundred thousand feet of boom to the Gulf oil spill effort , and calls it " absolutely worth it . "
" You have to put something in there , " Reilly said .
" You have to at least make an attempt to deflect it away from these sensitive areas ...
The key is to at least try to contain it . "
Inexperience may also be taking a toll on the effectiveness of the booms , said Ed Overton , a Louisiana State University professor of environmental sciences .
Hundreds of people , including fishermen and shrimpers who have never deployed boom , have mobilized to help .
" People are frustrated and they want to do something so they say , ' I 'll go out and lay the boom . '
But if you do n't know what you 're doing , you 're not going to do it right , " Overton said .
" I 'm certain there 's a significant percentage of boom deployment that is basically a wasted effort .
I 've seen shrimp boats just pulling boom and it's not doing anything . "
Jefferson Parish Sheriff Newell Normand said neither BP nor the federal government is listening to the locals , who know these waters , about where to lay the booms .
" We 're still deploying boom in areas that in many cases do n't make sense to us , but that 's where they want it , " Newell said .
" They 're not asking us for input .
Someone else is commanding this ship and they 're not taking input from the local commercial fishing industry that knows these waters better than anybody .
" We do n't have a command post that 's totally unified where they 're actually listening to the locals , " he added .
But even beyond the environmental effort to contain the oil , effective or not , the booming serves another crucial purpose , providing a psychological boost to those who feel helpless , Overton said .
" It 's an ecological incident but this is also a sociological disaster , " he said .
" It 's helping people think they 're helping the environment , and there 's a lot of good to that .
I 'm talking about getting to their psyche .
They do n't know what the future will bring .
" Booming is not just about protecting the environment , " he added .
" It 's also to help the people and that should not be considered trivial or a waste of time . "

Bangkok , May 19 , 2010 .
By Giles Ji Ungpakorn
May 19 , 2010 --
Now that the official protest has been drowned in blood and stopped [ read Giles Ji Ungpakorn 's accounts of the May 19 assault as it unfolded , HERE ] , there will not be peace because there is no justice .
The anger of the ordinary people has finally erupted into violence with numerous buildings being set of fire in Bangkok and the provinces .
People are also trying to use any means to fight the army .
There are reports that government buildings , banks , the stock exchange , luxury shopping malls and pro-military media are all being set on fire .
All this is totally justified .
Because :
1 . The government and the army have repeatedly used armed soldiers , assassination squads , snipers and tanks to kill unarmed pro-democracy demonstrators since April .
The death toll will easily reach 80 with thousands injured .
2 . This state - sponsored violence against civilians was carried out in order that Abhisit Vejjajiva 's military - backed government could stay in power and avoid elections for as long as possible .
It was never elected in the first place .
The government is a product of military and judicial coups since 2006 .
3 . The Red Shirts have repeatedly offered talks and compromises , yet the government has answered with bullets .
4 . In a democracy , the people should be the ultimate decision makers , not the military , the elites and the palace .
Any demand for democratic elections is totally justified , even if it disrupts shopping centres and luxury hotels .
5 . Mealy mouthed so - called non-violent groups could never bring themselves to put the blame entirely on the shoulders of the government , the military and royalist elites , despite the fact that the violence was from the army .
They never put their weight behind the huge struggle of the UDD leadership to try to maintain a peaceful and disciplined protest .
This is because these organisations supported the coup in 2006 in the first place .
They allowed the government to claim that there would be no peace until the protests stopped .
What YOU can do .
Do n't forget the prisoners
May 20 , 2010 -- I often get asked about what people can do outside Thailand to help in the struggle for democracy and social justice .
After the appalling events of the past few days we can all help in the campaign against the Abhisit government ’s misinformation in our local media .
We can also help support any campaign to bring these bloody rulers to justice and any campaign for free and fair elections .
But a new priority now , is to defend the political prisoners .
The Red Shirt leaders are facing the absurd charges of “ terrorism ” .
They are also accused of trying to overthrow the monarchy .
Although the belief in a republic is not a crime , especially after the fact that the king refused to say anything to stop the bloodshed , the top Red Shirt leaders have never expressed anti-monarchy views .
Equally important , we must not forget and ignore the hundreds of ordinary Red Shirt people who have been rounded up by the military and thrown in jail .
They will face a number of different charges , but they must all be seen as illegitimate and political charges , even if they involve fighting back physically , blocking roads or even setting fire to buildings .
It is the oppression and brutality of the military and the elites which is the root cause of any violence among the Red Shirts .
We can not rest until they are all released .
So we can all support any campaign for the prisoners when such campaigns are organised .
* * *
Update , 03.25 hrs Sunday , May 16 , 2010 , Bangkok time -- Earlier on Saturday , unconfirmed reports indicated that Abhisit Vejjajiva 's soldiers had shot dead at least 50 people .
Later , 22 named deaths were confirmed by the Erawan emergency centre , and 172 injured ( including one Canadian , one Polish , one Burmese , one Liberian ) .
But an official from the centre says that the real death toll is higher but cannot be reported at the moment .
Po -tek - tung emergency service official says that there are at least 14 corpses in the Ratchaprasong area which cannot be retrieved because of the danger of being shot at by the army ; one of their crew has been killed .
That would take the death toll to 36 ( http://www.prachatai.net/j ournal/2010/05/29498 ) .
* * *
May 15 , 2010 -- Bangkok is bathed in blood , yet again .
Unconfirmed reports indicate that Abhisit Vejjajiva 's soldiers have shot dead at least 50 people so far since .
The latest military attacks on protesters resumed on May 13 .
Hundreds have been injured .
The government and military say there are 500 " terrorists " at the protest site in Bangkok .
Earlier they said that they would use snipers to shoot " terrorists " .
The only terrorists are in the government , the army and the palace .
The tyrants say that the Red Shirts are determined to overthrow the monarchy and therefore it is justifiable to kill them .
So having a monarchy is an excuse to kill anyone who fights for democracy and social justice ?
Various government spokespeople , including Abhisit 's academic - for - hire Panitan Wattanayagorn and censorship boss Satit Wongnongtuay , continue to lie and lie again , claiming that troops are only firing in self defence .
Yet all press reports show indiscriminate shooting of unarmed civilians , including a 10 - year - old boy , a paramedic and foreign news reporters .
Splits are appearing in the security forces with reports of some police or army units returning fire with the advancing troops .
This is indeed a civil war situation and the government cannot hope to control the situation .
Red Shirts are determined to stand firm .
Millions of people are extremely angry with the government , the military and the monarchy .
Fake human rights groups call on " both sides " to stop the violence .
Yet it is only one side that is using lethal violence against unarmed pro-democracy demonstrators .
Even Reporters Without Borders demands that " both sides " guarantee the safety of reporters .
How can Red Shirts guarantee anyone 's safety when they are being murdered in cold blood .
Many so - called news reports write that troops fired on " rioters " .
No one is rioting except the army .
Others talk about " protests turning violent " .
It is not the protesters who are violent .
Unarmed pro-democracy protesters are being systematically murdered in order to keep Abhisit and his military - backed government in power .
The king is silent as usual .
His only job , apart from counting his wealth , is to legitimise every bloody act that the army commits .
Yet so - called analysts write that he has " held the country together " .
The fact is he has supported every crack down on democracy .
He is weak and spineless .
That is why millions of Red Shirts are becoming republicans .
The United Nations has just selected Thailand to be on the Human Rights Committee .
What a joke !
But what can one expect from a body controlled by warmongers .
Red Shirts throughout the country are standing firm in the bloody fight for democracy , social justice and human dignity .
I salute them !
* * *
May 16 , 2010 -- Some basic facts about the violence in Bangkok
1. Abhisit 's government was NEVER elected .
It came from a process started by the 2006 military coup .
That is why they are very afraid of an election .
2. The Red Shirts are a mass movement of the poor .
They want democratic elections .
It is totally legitimate to stage peaceful protests for this demand , even if it disrupts a shopping centre for two months .
Military coups , undemocratic governments and censorship are illegitimate .
3. Abhisit and the army turned Bangkok into a war zone and started the violence .
They have indiscriminately killed unarmed protesters by using snipers to shoot at civilians .
Nearly 40 are already dead from the actions of the army in the last few days .
4. Dissolving parliament and holding democratic elections would put an end to the protests .
This is what any democratic government would do in this situation .
That is what any responsible leader would do .
Return power to the people .
So why is Abhisit refusing and answering with live bullets ?
Judge news reports and the commitment to the truth by journalists on the basis of these four points .
Judge foreign governments by their public positions on Thailand in this crisis .
Judge academics and NGOs on their positions .
What would end the violence in Bangkok ?
By Giles Ji Ungpakorn
May 18 , 2010 --
If the military - backed government of Abhisit Vejjajia dissolved parliament , announced fresh elections and ordered a ceasefire , the violence would end immediately and the Red Shirts would all go home .
In capitalist democratic countries , when there is a crisis , dissolving parliament and calling elections is a normal way to defuse serious tension .
In the 1970s British Prime Minister Edward Heath called elections when faced with a massive strike wave .
In 1968 the French government called elections in the face of a crisis .
The Abhisit’sg overnment can only cling to power by shooting civilians , announcing a state of emergency in a quarter of the country and censoring the media and the internet .
If the government wants to claim legitimacy it should submit to the wishes of the people through a general election and prove that it has legitimacy .
The UDD ( Red Shirt ) leadership has called for an immediate ceasefire and talks with the government .
This would also end the killing and violence .
Yet Abhisit has refused .
Instead he and the army generals have sent snipers and assassination squads into the centre of Bangkok to kill unarmed civilians in their so - called “ live firing zone ” .
Sixty - five people have been killed since April and nearly 2000 injured .
Among the dead are paramedics , journalists and at least one ten year - old boy .
The government continues to lie about the military actions and continues to lie that the Red Shirts are “ armed terrorists ” .
Numerous media reports from the BBC , CNN and ABC show this not to be true .
One important reason why the government will not end the violence is that it knows that they would lose an election .
They were never elected in the first place and are only in power because of the army and the judiciary that have repeatedly frustrated the democratic process since the 2006 coup .
The government , the military , the palace , the majority of the business class , the judiciary and the top bureaucrats are the elites .
For years they have used their extra-constitutional power to exploit and repress the majority of the population .
They have shot down pro-democracy demonstrators in 1973 , 1976 , 1992 , 2009 and now in 2010 .
This is a class war .
But only the naive believe that class war is a simple matter of rich against the poor .
The Red Shirts represent workers and small farmers .
They are the people who have created the wealth in Thailand , but they have not been able to enjoy the benefits .
Thailand is a very unequal society .
Their hopes were raised when millionaire Thaksin Shinawatra ’s Thai Rak Thai government offered a universal health - care scheme and pro-poor policies .
They were inflamed when the elites staged a coup against the elected government in 2006 .
Now they are standing firm and facing the armed might of the ruling class .
For the above reasons , the Red Shirt protest in the centre of Bangkok is legitimate , even if it disrupts the commercial life in expensive shopping centres and luxury hotels .
Anyone who believes ind emocracy and social justice should support them .

Recovery fund will be first casualty in rule - of - law war
What is known in EU jargon as rule - of - law has the potential to turn into a paralysing political crisis .
This is about the linkage between compliance with EU legal principles and EU budget appropriations .
The first casualty of this war could be the EU 's recovery fund , which is an integral part of the so - called multiannual financial framework .
A delay would not in itself amount to a catastrophe .
The recovery fund is not a fiscal stimulus instrument in any case .
That was the price the EU paid for folding the fund into the EU budget .
The fund is a structural facility .
The plan is to spread appropriations for € 310bn in grants and € 250bn in loans evenly over three years .
The actual flow of the money will be backloaded for another three years .
This is to be expected , since we are dealing with investment projects like mobile data , infrastructure or the electrification of buses and the like .
But would it be right to conclude that we are in a hopeless - but - not - serious category of conflicts ?
Absolutely not .
There is a non-trivial possibility of serious gridlock at the level of the European Council , in the negotiations between the Council and European Parliament and in national parliaments .
It takes just a single national veto for the whole thing to break down .
This dispute is not only about rule - of - law compliance .
It goes to the heart of the debate on European integration in the early 21st century .
It is about the relationship between the EU and its members ; about democracy versus autocracy ; about fiscal union ; and about the role of the EU in the world .
If the EU tolerates violations of the rule of law internally , how can it act as a multilateral referee externally ?
Yesterday , a majority of EU ambassadors voted to start negotiations with EP on the budget , based on the German EU presidency proposal .
Seven countries were opposed , but for different reasons .
Hungary and Poland reject any rule - of - law linkage whatsoever .
The Netherlands , Belgium , Sweden , Denmark and Finland want a stronger linkage than the compromise proposed by the German EU presidency .
Austria and Luxembourg abstained .
You could argue , as some observers did yesterday , that this means that the proposal is likely to be carried because it constitutes a weighted average of views .
We do n't think so .
This is not going to be a re-run of the recovery - fund debate .
The question we are asking ourselves this morning is whether at least one of the opposing countries , which have a strong overlap with the group of frugals , might use the rule - of - law dispute as a pretext to torpedo the unloved recovery fund .
When EU leaders debated the recovery fund in July , they were only haggling over money .
The current debate is about deeply - held beliefs , and it pitches the Netherlands and Hungary at opposite ends of the scale .
If there is agreement , it will be similar to the German presidency proposal .
We think the final compromise may be even weaker .
Angela Merkel made it clear that she prioritises the recovery fund , and that she is ready to sacrifice the rule - of - law mechanism .
But not everybody shares her priorities .
The Dutch compromised already on the recovery fund .
We are not sure that they will so easily compromise on rule of law .
Also yesterday , the European Commission issued a report assessing rule - of - law compliance in all member states .
This report does not tell us anything materially new about Hungary or Poland , but it discusses rule - of - law violations in all 27 countries .
The strategy is clearly to change the nature of the rule - of - law discussion , away from an exclusive focus on two countries and towards more general principles .
We think that is probably the way forward in the end .
Establish the big principles now , and make them binding in future financial frameworks .

A friend is someone
who , when asked " Hold still , I want
to try something , " will .
Yep : hating on gay people is so ingrained in the mindset of today 's Republican Party that Republican Senators are threatening to filibuster the defense authorization bill if it includes the compromise hammered out between Senator Lieberman , Congressman Patrick Murphy and the White House to repeal DADT .
From Roll Call :
Armed Services
Republicans threatened Wednesday to filibuster the defense authorization bill if it comes to the floor with Democrat - backed language repealing the military ’s “ do n’t ask , do n’t tell ” policy .
Armed Services ranking member John McCain said Thursday that he would “ without a doubt ” support a filibuster if the bill goes to the floor with repeal language .
“ I ’ll do everything in my power , ” the Arizona Republican said , citing letters from the four service chiefs urging Congress not to act before a Pentagon review of the policy is complete .
“ I ’m going to do everything I can to support the men and women of the military and to fight what is clearly a political agenda . ”
The funny part about this whole ordeal ?
The compromise that the Republicans are threatening to filibuster allows the Pentagon to have the final say in the issue , which is precisely why it is not receiving the broadest support in activist circles .
And yet , despite the fact that the Pentagon and the Joint Chiefs get to be the ultimate arbiters of whether the policy is repealed , that 's not good enough for today 's homophobic Republican Party .
Today 's Republicans do n't want gay people to be able to serve in the military -- even if the Pentagon says it 's okay .
That 's a pretty good indication of where the Republican Party stands .
They do n't really care what the military has to say .
They 're just interested in trying to preserve one more way of telling the country that being gay is n't okay .
Mitch McConnell yesterday on Meet the Press :
MR. GREGORY : What does it say , though , about the strength of the tea party movement ?
However large and vast that movement is , it certainly has been in evidence in the support for Rand Paul .
SEN .
McCONNELL : Yeah , I think so , and it ’s an important movement in the country , and I think it ’s really going to help us in November .
Have you ever noticed the similarity between what the GOP has done with the tea party movement and what Blackwater attempted to do in renaming itself Xe ?
I guess you have to hand it to Republicans : after spending eight years soiling their brand beyond repair , at least they had the good sense to try and change their name .
Unfortunately for them , they 're still the same old guys , standing for the same old things , and as long as Democrats follow President Obama 's lead in pointing this out ( and as long as President Obama follows his own lead ) , November wo n't be anything for the GOP to remember .

Watching this series was a much better experience compared to the Sharks - Avs series .
The play was mostly even , except for game four , and both of these teams looked like actual playoff teams .
The hours spent recording chances also revealed some insight into how the teams in charge of the television coverage report scoring chances .
In game four , the Detroit crew called a 40 foot unscreened wrist shot from Johan Franzen " another scoring chance . "
In game five , Patrick Marleau entered the zone on the left wing and threw a 49 foot wrister at the net , just inside the blue line .
The San Jose announcers called it a scoring chance .
Knowing the difference between what a scoring chance is for the home team 's television crew and what a scoring chance is for Dennis King , Scott Reynolds , Olivier , et al , makes me hopeful that the scoring chance project is worthwhile .
Scoring Chances
For those of you who are new to the concept of tracking scoring chances , a scoring chance is defined as a clear play directed toward the opposing net from a dangerous scoring area - loosely defined as the top of the circle in and inside the faceoff dots , though sometimes slightly more generous than that depending on the amount of immediately - preceding puck movement or screens in front of the net .
Blocked shots are generally not included but missed shots are .
A player is awarded a scoring chance anytime he is on the ice and someone from either team has a chance to score .
He is awarded a " chance for " if someone on his team has a chance to score and a " chance against " if the opposing team has a chance to score .
Vic Ferrari makes this all possible with his tools to evaluate Corsi , head - to - head ice time and scoring chances .

San Jose 's top two lines played to a near draw with Detroit 's top two lines .
Joe Thornton was even , Marleau was +4 , Dany Heatley was +1 , Devin Setoguchi was +3 , Ryane Clowe +3 and Joe Pavelski even .
By the regular season ratios , the top two lines were worth about 1 goal over their Detroit counterparts .
In nearly all of my recaps , I mentioned Logan Couture as a guy that was winning his battle .
He and Manny Malhotra were the most effective Sharks through the series , though they never had to play difficult minutes in this series .
55 % of Couture 's time was spent against Darren Helm 's line , and less than 20 % of his time was against Pavel Datsyuk and Henrik Zetterberg combined .
He made the most of it by beating the bottom half of Detroit 's roster , which is about all you can ask of a kid in his first playoff run .

The story here is n't that the Wings are aging , though as a team , they are .
The story is that their depth players got beat up by the Sharks depth players .
The outcome would have been the same had they played the Hawks .
Zetterberg and Datsyuk are still the best in the league , and they proved it with their performance in the first two series .
Helm , Drew Miller , Justin Abdelkader , Kris Draper , Jason Williams , Mattias Ritola , and Patrick Eaves just are n't the same level of players that Detroit was able to send in waves in the past .
Even Dan Cleary looked lost in this series .
Getting Jiri Hudler back next year is going to go a long way in restoring some depth to the roster but restoring the rest of the roster is going to have to come from free agency .
Nicklas Lidstrom 's minutes were amazing during this series .
89 % of his minutes at even strength game against Thornton or Pavelski .
He spent about eight minutes combined against the Sharks bottom two lines .
He also played over 60 % of the Wings short - handed minutes and over 80 % of their three - on - five minutes .
He did this all at age forty .
But interest at the counter revived in the afternoon .
Dealers said that there was large unidentified institutional buying despite the morning unloading .
There had been positive talks about Infosys bagging orders from telecom major Vodafone as well which helped sentiment , dealers said .
It is just that the rapidly slowing US economy has resulted in a few quarters seeing slow growth .
But the possibility is strong that the business will rebound with a vengeance .
And Infosys seems to be well - placed when that occurs .
The refrain is that a 30 percent growth will be logged even in the worst case scenario .

Advertisement A fight broke out between a British National Party parliamentary candidate and some Asian men as party members were out campaigning in east London .
Some men earlier swore at leader Nick Griffin and threw fruit at him and he was taken away from the scene .
The candidate for Romford , Bob Bailey , was filmed shouting at a group of men in Ripple Road before punching a man who spat at him .
Police were called after 1500 BST to the fight between the two groups .
' Campaign of hatred '
At the time Metropolitan Police said they were called to the incident but no - one had been arrested at the scene .
Later however , police said an 18 - year - old man attended Barking police station and alleged common assault against another man .
The Barking Community Safety Unit is to look into the matter .
When asked about the fight Mr Griffin told BBC London the fight was the result of a " campaign of hatred and dehumanisation against any group of people , in this case us " .
He said : " I think people have to realise that the people have spoken , this is a democratic vote and everyone has to go along with that , whether it 's us , our opponents or people on the streets , and if there are a few crazies or thugs on the streets I 'm sure the police will deal with them quite quickly .
" The more people in the media talk this up as an issue , the more silly kids on the streets will be inclined to take the law into their hands . "
Candidates for Romford are : Independent : Philip Hyde ; Conservative : Andrew Rosindell ; Independent : David Sturman ; English Democrats : Peter Thorogood ; Labour : Rachel Voller ; British National Party : Robert Bailey ; UK Independence Party : Gerard Batten ; Liberal Democrat : Helen Duffett ; Green : Gary Haines .

A drop in income can trigger big tax breaks and sharply lower rates , sometimes falling to zero .
TO THE TAXMAN TO THE TAXMAN Share of Americans ' income paid as taxes : Source : Bureau of Economic Analysis
Track taxes by using the interactive to enter your salary and see how tax rates and spending priorities have changed over time .
Amid complaints about high taxes and calls for a smaller government , Americans paid their lowest level of taxes last year since Harry Truman 's presidency , a USA TODAY analysis of federal data found .
Some conservative political movements such as the " Tea Party " have criticized federal spending as being out of control .
While spending is up , taxes have fallen to exceptionally low levels .
Federal , state and local income taxes consumed 9.2 % of all personal income in 2009 , the lowest rate since 1950 , the Bureau of Economic Analysis reports .
That rate is far below the historic average of 12 % for the last half - century .
The overall tax burden hit bottom in December at 8.8. % of income before rising slightly in the first three months of 2010 .
" The idea that taxes are high right now is pretty much nuts , " says Michael Ettlinger , head of economic policy at the liberal Center for American Progress .
The real problem is spending , counters Adam Brandon of FreedomWorks , which organizes Tea Party groups .
" The money we borrow is going to be paid back through taxation in the future , " he says .
Individual tax rates vary widely based on how much a taxpayer earns , where the person lives and other factors .
On average , though , the tax rate paid by all Americans — rich and poor , combined — has fallen 26 % since the recession began in 2007 .
That means a $ 3,400 annual tax savings for a household paying the average national rate and earning the average national household income of $ 102,000 .
This tax drop has boosted consumer spending and the economy , which grew at a 3.2 % annual rate in the first quarter .
It also has contributed to the federal debt growing to $ 8.4 trillion .
Taxes paid have fallen much faster than income in this recession .
Personal income fell 2 % last year .
Taxes paid dropped 23 % .
The BEA classifies Social Security taxes as insurance payments and excludes them from the tax calculation .
Why the tax bite has eased : • Stimulus law .
One - third of last year 's $ 862 billion economic stimulus went for tax cuts .
Biggest reduction : The Making Work Pay tax credit reduced income taxes $ 800 for married couples earning up to $ 150,000 .
• Progressive tax rates .
Presidents Clinton and Bush pushed through a series of tax changes — credits , lower rates , higher exemptions — that slashed income taxes for poor and middle - class families .
A drop in income now can trigger big tax breaks and sharply lower rates , sometimes falling to zero .
• Sales tax .
Consumers cut spending sharply in this downturn , thereby paying less in sales taxes .
A Gallup Poll last month found that 48 % thought taxes were " too high " and 45 % thought they were " about right . "
Those saying taxes are " too high " remain near a 50 - year low .
The lower tax burden should last at least through 2010 , says Roberton Williams of the Tax Policy Center , a think tank in Washington , D.C. " Virtually all the stimulus tax cuts expire at the end of the year , " he says .
" So the key decision is whether to extend them into 2011 . "

The interesting thing I spotted quite quickly is that it is also going after Opera , do n’t ask me why , that ’s pretty obscure .
I immediately tested it out , just to see , and ended up getting the pop-up .
After looking at the code for about a half hour , I still do n’t know what everything is , and exactly how it ’s getting past Google , I also do n’t know how ad ’s are created , because I ’ve never bothered to look at it .
So I ’m not sure , if this is something anyone could execute , or if Google is allowing it .
So it ’s possible that there is a vulnerability in Adsense .
What I can tell after looking at the code , is that they are targeting Apple , and Opera , users , as well as using javascript to activate flash , in the background .
First they are setting the DCid as either DCF0 or DCF224198296 , this should always validate as false and the will set DCid as DCF224198296 .
Then , it goes on to check if the browser uses plugins and has at least any values , if it results in true it attempts to setup Shockwave Flash and perform a version check on it , setting the variable pVM to the version number .
If that statement failed , it assumes you are using IE and initializes using ActiveX .
I do n’t understand exactly what is going on in the eval , so I ca n’t say much about it , besides it calls DCFlash with the DCid( “ DCF224198296 ” ) and the pVM ( “ Flash Version ” ) .
I apologize if the rest of this is rushed for now , I ’m getting a bit tired .
The DCFlash function then initializes an assortment of variables , before setting up the FSWin function .
FSWin checks to see if the window is already open or the DCid was set in error to DCF0 , it then checks to see if the window is centered and gather your screen size for offsets on the window border .
Following FSWin is the window initialization , which disables all navigation , in that window .
Next , is the User - Agent analysis , which first check to make sure that your current Flash version is at minimum Vers.
8 , it then checks to see if you are using either a Mac or Opera , if you are n’t the value is less than 0 , returning true , this then compares in with window== ” false ” , which is true , in an or statement , which will return false , if both are set .
If this test of the browser conditions fail , either using an old version of Flash , or using a Mac , or Opera it will default to just the default hyperlinked gif .
Otherwise , it sets up Flash to be displayed in the window pain .
During the course , of writing this the test ad I was using has disappeared , but I ’ll see if I can gather any more of the code .
One thing I found odd , is that the ad was stored within an iFrame , which I could n’t find with any of Google ’s other Adsense ads , I managed to find a representation of using an iFrame , after I woke up .

The iPhone 4 's massive launch has n't been blemish free , with reports of spotty displays ( which seem to have disappeared ) and antenna woes being rather widely reported .
Well -- it looks like it 's possible there 's another issue too -- this time with the proximity sensor .
Now , we 're no strangers to spontaneously turning on speakerphone with our faces ( though admittedly our cheeks are pretty round ) , so it 's hard to say if this is an iPhone 4 - specific issue , but the mounting reports would suggest that it 's possible the new handsets sensor is a little bit ... over sensitive .
Reported issues include accidentally disconnecting calls , throwing the speakerphone switch , and putting people on hold accidentally .
What about you ?
Are you having problems with your iPhone 4's proximity sensor ?
Let us know in the comments .
Le 13 avril 2010 nous alertions les internautes sur une « folle rumeur » que nous avions inventée nous - mêmes et qui laissait entendre que nous serions sur le point de mettre la clé sous la porte .
Et nous répliquions déjà par un appel à dons et à adhésions .
Nous voulions ainsi éviter le ton alarmiste , hélas trop souvent justifié , des appels de nombreuses associations et médias indépendants qui survivent plus qu’ils ne vivent .
En même temps , nous rendions possibles les paiements sécurisés en ligne des dons et des cotisations .
Deux mois plus tard , les adhésions et les dons ont afflué et 10 000 euros ont d’ores et déjà été réunis .
Que toutes celles et tous ceux qui ont répondu à notre appel en soient chaleureusement remerciés .
Mais ce n’est pas assez : nous avons besoin de 20 000 euros pour couvrir les dépenses prévisibles des 12 mois à venir .
Et nous avons l’intention de vivre plus longtemps !
Pour quoi faire ?
Parce que , bien que depuis plus de douze ans l’essentiel des activités de l’association soit assuré par des bénévoles , nos ressources qui ne reposent que sur les cotisations des adhérents ( et sur une subvention du Conseil général d’Île - de - France pour un « emploi- tremplin » de secrétaire administratif ) ne suffisent pas pour payer notre loyer , nos déplacements , notre matériel informatique , nos abonnements et surtout l’emploi salarié d’un secrétaire de rédaction dont nous avons un besoin vital .
À titre indicatif : 20 000 euros c’est , en gros , l’équivalent d’un emploi ( charges incluses ) payé au SMIC pendant un an .
Pourquoi vous ?
Parce que , nous le savons , la plupart de celles et ceux qui consultent régulièrement notre site partagent globalement nos objectifs .
Nous savons qu’ils sont sollicités de tous côtés .
Mais nous savons que nous pouvons compter sur eux .
Que nous pouvons compter sur vous .

Within the United States , there has been a growing awareness of Palestinian suffering .
This has been manifested in the many demonstrations held during Israel 's assault on Gaza from December 2008 - January 2009 .
The boycott of Israeli goods is gaining speed , as well as the campaign to recognize the Israeli government ’s treatment of Palestinians as apartheid .
Yet there is one tragic and shameful event in particular which serves to discourage Palestinian rights activists .
If so - called “ patriotic ” Americans viciously suppress the concerns of veterans and their families by covering up the murder of their own sailors , what hope is there to recognize the voices of oft - maligned Arabs half a world away ?
June 8 will mark the 43rd anniversary of the heaviest attack on an American ship that inflicted the highest number of casualties since World War II .
The USS Liberty was an intelligence vessel , patrolling international waters in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea .
The day was clear and sunny ; the ship flying the American flag , as was standard .
Suddenly and simultaneously , out of that clear azure sky and sea came a two - pronged attack by Israeli air and naval forces .
Napalm , gunfire and missiles rained hell on Liberty ’s crew for two hours while Israeli torpedo boats closed in .
In that two hours , 34 American sailors died .
Another 172 were injured .
The Liberty crew managed to send an SOS , heard by nearby U.S. Sixth Fleet aircraft carriers .
Fighter planes launched immediately , however turned back on orders from President Johnson .
Naval personnel listening to radio relays heard Johnson say “ I do n’t care if the ship sinks , I ’m not going to embarrass an ally . ”
Israel claimed it was a case of “ mistaken identity , ” in other words , “ friendly fire . ”
Israel ’s ludicrous explanation was that pilots thought the USS Liberty was El Quseir , an Egyptian vessel having 1/ 4 of Liberty ’s displacement and half the beam .
El Quseir was 180 feet shorter and very differently configured .
The Liberty had her name clearly written in English , while the Egyptian ship would have displayed Arabic script .
There are several motives for Israel ’s deliberate attack : to prevent the USS Liberty from transmitting intelligence pertaining to massacres by Israeli troops which were taking place in the Golan Heights and that the 1967 War did indeed result from a pre-emptive strike by Israel .
The attack could have been used to draw the U.S. into the 1967 War as well .
Most of the Liberty ’s survivors believe that Israel ’s goal was to sink the ship and kill everyone aboard .
Had there been no survivors , the attack could have been pinned on an Arab country .
Ward Boston , Jr. , himself a U.S. Navy veteran , was the chief legal counsel to the Navy Court of Inquiry investigating the USS Liberty attack .
In an editorial published by The San Diego Union Tribune , Boston stated then President Johnson and Secretary of Defense McNamara ordered the Navy Court of Inquiry to conclude the attack was accidental .
Furthermore , the late Admiral Isaac C. Kidd , the Court of Inquiry ’s president , was given only one week to gather evidence for the investigation , although a proper inquiry would have taken six months .
“ We boarded the crippled ship at sea and interviewed survivors .
The evidence was clear .
We both believed with certainty that this attack was a deliberate effort to sink an American ship and murder its entire crew , ” Boston wrote .
“ I saw the bullet - riddled American flag that had been raised by the crew after their first flag had been shot down completely . ”
For the official record , Admiral Kidd was ordered to rewrite part of the Court ’s findings , including striking Lt. Lloyd Painter ’s testimony in which he stated three life rafts filled with seriously wounded sailors were gunned down at close range by Israeli torpedo boats .
Survivors of the USS Liberty attack , their families and the families of those killed have demanded a fair congressional inquiry , to no avail .
To this day , survivors have never been allowed to testify publicly .
Nor have intelligence officers who received real - time Hebrew translations of Israeli commanders ordering pilots to sink “ the American ship . ”
The cover - up did not stop at the official report : it extended to commemorations honoring USS Liberty survivors and crew members ’ memorials alike .
The USS Liberty ’s Commander , William L. McGonagle was awarded the Medal of Honor in a quiet ceremony at the Washington Navy Yard , not in the customary White House setting .
In 1987 , the town of Grafton , Wisconsin proposed naming a new $ 1 million library –to be built with private donations and an $ 83,000 federal contribution– The USS Liberty Memorial Library .
Days later , Jewish community leaders decried the proposal as “ anti-Semitic . ”
An angry letter from a local rabbi , Gideon Goldenholz , stated the name was “ insulting to Jews . ”
Not surprisingly , the $ 83,000 federal money was put on hold .
Even the priest at Grafton ’s Catholic Church came out in opposition to the name , stating “ The USS Liberty has become a symbol of hate . ”
The Milwaukee Jewish Council attempted to block the name and there were several picketers at the groundbreaking ceremony .
The USS Liberty Memorial Library was finally dedicated in 1989 after two years of battling well - organized opposition .
Shortly after the library ’s completion , Congressman Andy Jacobs ( D - IN ) inserted an essay entitled “ The USS Liberty , 1967 - 89 , ” written by former Congressman Pete McCloskey ( R - CA ) into the Congressional Record .
McCloskey pointed out that the dedication of the memorial with the names of the 34 dead was the first public recognition of their service in the 22 years since the attack .
The greatest sacrilege , however , is that these 34 crew members ’ tombstones are engraved “ ... died in the Eastern Mediterranean , ” rather than “ killed in action . ”
There is little hope of real policy change in a country where citizens would denigrate their own veterans , both living and dead , in order to protect a state where perpetrating war crimes is commonplace .

WASHINGTON - Immigration and Customs enforcement says it is investigating allegations that a guard at a central Texas detention facility sexually assaulted female detainees on their way to being deported .
Spokesman Brian
Hale says the guard has been fired and Corrections Corporation of America , which manages the prison , is on probation pending the investigation 's outcome .
ICE says several women who were held at T. Don Hutto detention facility in Taylor , Texas , were groped while being patted down and at least one was propositioned for sex .
ICE has ordered Corrections Corporation of America to make changes , including not allowing male guards to be alone with female detainees .
A letter from the Homeland Security Department to the corrections company obtained by The Associated Press says the company faces a fine .
This site was created in honor of the character in " Brave Heart " that called Ireland his island .
I call him the " King of Ireland " and write under this name sake in honor of all those in history who , like him , loved freedom so much they were willing to die for it .
My basic theme is the history of liberty and how it relates to the modern world .
Chuck Grassley and Sharron
Angle were both in excellent form today – each supplying their own special moment of WTF ?! to stun the masses .
The first truth bomb was dropped by Chuck during the Elena Kagan confirmation hearings when he informed the unwashed mouth - breathers in the audience that God — not the Constitution — gives Americans the right to bear arms .
If anyone can tell me why this does n’t violate the separation of church and state , I ’ll give you a shiny new nickel — or bullet — or however our creator likes to settle bartering exchanges .
Then , there ’s crazy , crazy Sharron Angle .
Sometimes I imagine the lone , sane Republican standing somewhere in a wheat field , holding a gently swaying leash as he stares off into the distance vacantly , wondering if he ’s made a hasty decision in allowing the Reno neophyte to scamper into the world on her own .
Unlike Rand Paul , Sharron just can’t hide the crazy , and she ’s not savvy enough to pass off the delusional stuff spewing from her mouth as “ being mavericky . ”
She ’s been unable to shed her extremist past , and continues to promote debunked conspiracy theories about the abortion - breast cancer non-connection .
Now , she ’s dropped another turd .
Here is Sharron talking to Bill Manders on his radio show .
MANDERS : Is there any reason at all for an abortion ?
ANGLE : Not in my book .
MANDERS : So , in other words , rape and incest would not be something ?
ANGLE : You know , I ’m a Christian , and I believe that God has a plan and a purpose for each one of our lives and that he can intercede in all kinds of situations and we need to have a little faith in many things .
You see , rape is just part of God ’s majestic plan , ya’ll .
Along with genocide and famine .
I ’ve been trying to think of the liberal equivalent of this crazy bullshit , and I keep coming up empty .
Maybe Obama musing aloud about punching Alan Greenspan across the face before using him as a human shield as he takes all of Wall Street to siege in order to seize corporate assets , and then redistribute the cash to millions of unemployed people ?
Maaaybe that ’s the left - wing version of Republicans saying God approves of guns and rape .
Except , if a liberal said something batshit insane like that , they ’d get impeached .
When the GOP say this stuff out loud , the media treats it as a “ serious comment . ”
The press furrow their brows and take copious notes , pretending they are n’t a bunch of stenographers for a lunatic in a tailored suit .
Of course , I ’m sure I think this stuff because I ’m a godless heathen , but I find it hard to believe devout Christians are cool with Angle and Grassley saying this stuff about their religion .
I do n’t remember Jesus saying anything about the need to pack heat , or it being acceptable to look the other way when encountering a sexual assault because God sees the long game , and the girl ’s little mind ca n’t appreciate the sunny side of a rape .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A congressional panel is poised to take the first step toward ending a decades - old U.S. ban on travel to Cuba and removing other hurdles to food sales to the Caribbean island , a senior lawmaker said on Tuesday .
“ This bill has been needed for a long time , ” House of Representatives Agriculture Committee Chairman Collin Peterson said in a statement ahead of committee action on Wednesday .
The bipartisan bill that Peterson helped craft with Representative Jerry Moran , a Kansas Republican , enjoys broad support from U.S. farm and business groups that favor ending the nearly 50 - year - old U.S. embargo on communist - led Cuba .
The bill is expected to clear the committee and be sent to the full House , where it will face strong resistance from conservative lawmakers and Cuban - Americans who oppose any step to ease restrictions on trade and travel with Cuba until a democratic government is in power in Havana .
Proposals to lift the ban have floundered in Congress over the last decade due to concerns about human rights abuses in the one - party state built from Fidel Castro ’s 1959 revolution .
President Barack Obama has taken some steps to improve relations with Havana , such as allowing unlimited family travel and remittances and greater telecommunications links .
But Washington says the Cuban government has failed to reciprocate , making it politically difficult for the White House to move further in easing the Cold War-era embargo .
Cuban officials have encouraged recent U.S. trade delegations visiting Havana to work for abolish the travel ban because the arrival of more American tourists would give the government more money to buy U.S. goods .
Business groups mounted a lobbying effort on Tuesday to ensure Peterson would have enough votes in the committee to approve the bill without any changes .
“ Enabling Americans to travel to Cuba and expand already legal export operations is an important first step to reforming U.S. policy toward Cuba , ” Bruce Josten , top lobbyist for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce , said in a letter to lawmakers .
Congress exempted farm sales from the long - standing U.S. embargo on Cuba in 2000 so long as Havana paid for the goods in cash and money transfers were handled by a third - country bank .
The administration of former President George W. Bush angered many farm - state lawmakers by interpreting the cash payment rule in a narrow way as payment before shipment .
Even so , U.S. farm exports to Cuba reached a record $ 710 million in 2008 , before dropping to $ 528 million in 2009 .
The Hollywood Reporter 's Eriq Gardner says the nomination of Elena Kagan to the U.S. Supreme Court may be bad news for Tinseltown and good news for Downfall parodists .
The jurist without a paper trail , Gardner writes , does seem to take a broad view of fair use :
Hollywood 's biggest worry about Kagan might be her philosophy on intellectual property matters .
As dean of Harvard Law School from 2003 to 2009 , she was instrumental in beefing up the school 's Berkman Center for Internet & Society by recruiting Lawrence Lessig and others who take a strongly liberal position on " fair use " in copyright disputes …
Kagan got her biggest opportunity to showcase her feelings on IP when the U.S. Supreme Court asked her , as U.S. Solicitor General , to weigh in on the big Cablevision case .
Hollywood was upset when Cablevision announced its intention to allow subscribers to store TV programs on the cable operator 's computer servers instead of a hard - top box .
The introduction of remote - storage DVR kicked off furious litigation , and the 2nd Circuit overturned a lower court ruling by saying that the technology would n't violate copyright holder 's rights .
The studios appealed to the Supreme Court .
In Kagan 's brief to the high court , she argued the justices should n't take the case and trumpeted fair use .
She went against broadcasters there and even criticized Cablevision for limiting the scope of its arguments .
At The Atlantic , Niraj Chokshi says not so fast , and rounds up a range of tech commentators questioning whether Kagan has any views on fair use at all .
The Hollywood Reporter piece also draws many comments from anti-Kaganists , which include along with the expected cheap insults ( " I am convinced Kagan is actually Martin Short in a fat suit , " says Bubba Hercules ) , some serious objections to claims such as Gardner 's prediction that Kagan will be " an extreme supporter of free speech under the First Amendment . "
That high number of detractors may be a function of the piece 's having been linked by Drudge , who also provides the clearest support yet for Cavanaugh 's General Theory of 33.3 : a Rasmussen poll in which exactly 33 percent of respondents say Kagan should be confirmed , 33 percent say she should n't , and 34 percent are undecided .
Is the theory proven at last ?
Probably not .
The same quality that makes Kagan the ultimate Supreme Court nominee — her almost total lack of any discernible beliefs — makes her a too - easy test case .
Reason 's three reasons why YouTube should n't censor Downfall parodies :
In America they have a name for it : Nature Deficit Disorder .
Nature , says the writer Richard Louv , is more important than you think .
Divorce nature from your life and bad things will happen .
For a start , you become fractious and bored , and unable to concentrate .
Then you risk obesity and mental health problems .
Nature , continues Louv , is fresh air for the mind .
It is the link between life and happiness .
But increasingly , it has become a missing link .
To more than half of us aged 30 or less , nature is only of marginal interest .
Like the girl who , when told there was a wild badger in the garden , glanced up from her ipod and mumbled , " This affects me – how ? "
Yet when it comes to public policy , nature is always up there as a big deal .
Parks and public gardens are managed with wildlife in mind .
And we have never had more freedom to roam .
We can go where we like over open hills and downs and commons .
Forbidden forests have been thrown open to inspection , and liberally supplied with car parks , loos and picnic tables .
The Government is committed to open access all around the coast .
We must be the most walker - friendly country in Europe .
So what is amiss ?
Why the disconnection between access and enjoyment ?
One reason , of course , is that parents worry that their children might be abducted and abused .
Or that they could get run over on our busy roads .
Or even , according to social research at Hertfordshire University , that they might get their expensive trainers dirty .
Unlike the generation that went through two world wars , we are not inclined to take risks .
For many parents and children , the countryside has become off - limits , outside the safety barrier , an uncomfortable place .
As Richard Louv puts it , " our society is teaching young people to avoid direct experience with nature " .
But there is another barrier to appreciating nature , and it is this : even when you find it , you are not allowed to touch it .
Nature used to be associated with freedom , freedom to see and think unstructured thoughts , and to wander as you please .
But all too often the nature experience now involves some corralled " country park " or " discovery centre " or guided tours by people who may or may not know much but are usually pretty hot on the dos and don'ts .
I call it the Do n't Touch culture .
The don'ts include picking or playing games with wild plants , catching pond life or flying insects , foraging for wild food , climbing trees , or burning wood on a campfire .
Many people seem to think such activities are illegal .
Doubt has even been raised about the legal position of picking blackberries by the wayside .
Personal , direct contact with nature is being discouraged by fusspots and busybodies and control freaks who seem to want to regulate every waking moment of our lives .
You can read their disapproval in the small print under the welcome sign at the entrance .
Look but do n't touch .
You know it 's illegal .
Well , actually it is n't .
It is not , for example , against the law to pick wild flowers , though you do n't hear many conservation bodies saying so .
It is , however , illegal to dig them up .
Hence we are in the idiotic situation where gathering the roots of a wayside horseradish or grubbing for pignuts for a wayside nibble , as previous generations did , is committing a crime .
Yet the state never intended it to be like this .
It happened in this way : back in the Eighties , after a bit of bother over the sale of wild bluebells and primroses , a law was introduced to make such activities an offence .
But to make life easier for the lawyers , it included a blanket clause making it illegal to dig up any wild plant by the roots .
Hence , in the eyes of the law , and for no better reason than a tidy statute , weeds and edible roots are protected with the same force as orchids .
Nor is there anything in law to stop you chasing butterflies , other than specially protected ones , or collecting their caterpillars to breed .
If there was , high street toy shops might be in trouble when they sell butterfly nets to toddlers .
We can also still forage for winkles and cockles , but as the author of a recent book on wild food noted , the law is a nightmare : " I defy anyone not having a firm and comprehensive grip on the law to collect half a dozen different things from the beach without committing an offence . "
As for mushrooms , an enforceable Code of Conduct allows us to gather a small basketful so long as we do not sell them on , but some public landowners have been reluctant to allow us even that much .
What matters more than the strict letter of the law is the sense that direct contact – enjoying nature by touching , sniffing , chasing or nibbling – is somehow morally wrong .
While we may be within our rights to pick some buttercups for the vase , we may decide not to if it attracts unfriendly whispers and stares , and perhaps a word to some warden or official .
Taking a butterfly net to a protected place may be strictly OK , but it marks you out as a potential criminal .
The result is a deepening divide between people and nature , for it makes nature study to all intents and purposes impossible except as an organised activity ( supervised by adults , that is ) .
This matters because it is only when you get up close and personal with a plant or insect that it enters your memory and imagination : the distinctive smell of the flowers , the way a dragonfly loops its long body to position an egg , or the patterns a mushroom makes on paper when you leave it overnight .
It is through " watching narrowly " that we get to know our fellow beings , and learn their names .
Yet how often , these days , do you find people , and especially children , really looking at things ?
To seek an example of how this alienation from nature is subtly encouraged , you need look no further than the Oxford Junior Dictionary .
Designed to meet the needs of seven - to - nine - year - olds , the latest edition of the dictionary includes such modish words as blog , bullet point , biodegradable , Xbox , chatroom and MP3 player , all of which are deemed to play an important part in the lives of children today .
But to make room for them , the editor has excised many of the most familiar objects of the countryside , words such as acorn , conker , dandelion , minnow and magpie .
In proscribing minnows and conkers , the editor claims she is only responding to the needs of contemporary life : " Nowadays most children no longer live in semi-rural environments and see the seasons .
The environment has changed . "
What a thought : children who do not experience the changing seasons , nor will have any name for the things they find on a simple country walk .
Small hope there of any budding naturalists .
As Kate Humble , the Springwatch presenter , expressed it : " If a child has n't ever got its hands dirty sifting through soil for bugs , kicked up leaves , or been wowed by a cute baby bird , how can we expect them to care about the natural world ? "
How indeed , but what can we do about it ?
There is no shortage of projects and schemes intended to bridge that gap .
Natural England , for instance , not only promotes its own nature reserves as " green gyms " but has also launched a £ 25 m grant scheme to bring nature closer to the lives of " those who face social exclusion or have little or no contact with the natural environment " .
But such officious striving , however well - meant , comes across as heavily paternal , if not patronising .
By placing terms on how we enjoy nature , by treating it as something apart from ourselves , they are still playing the Do n't Touch game .
Nature does n't belong to the planners and conservationists : it 's ours .
It 's our habitat , the place in which we all dwell , whether it is a city centre or a country village .
And , it seems , we also need it , not only for intellectual stimulation but for the basic building blocks of human happiness : the sense of freedom to wander , of wind in your hair , of clouds and stars in the sky , the sounds and feelings of a world beyond everyday cares .
How do we break free of the Don't Touch Gestapo ?
I suggest that we should press for the re-establishment of a right that once belonged to everyone : the right of forage .
At the moment , our ability to collect nuts or berries by the wayside is regulated under the Theft Act , as though we are thieving the rightful property of some lord or squire – a notion that dates back to the Black Acts of the eighteenth century , when you could be hanged or deported for stealing a sheep .
Those nuts and berries are rightfully ours .
A right of forage would establish that every wanderer along the public highway can pick or collect the products of nature on the premise that such things are not privately owned but held in common .
We would , if we chose , be able to pick common wayside flowers , gather wild nuts , berries , mushrooms for the pot , and take home interesting bits of dead wood or fossils .
We could capture caterpillars and tadpoles , build wigwams out of fallen wood , and play games with elder stems or plantain guns .
The wildlife can take it .
And we would become freer , happier , and in the long run , more aware of the plight of nature and ourselves in a perilous and rapidly changing world .
On his 30th birthday , the Flying Finn - who just might wing it for Europe when these playoffs end - burned a permanent place in the memory , guaranteed a berth in the Hockey Hall of Fame , a spot for his uniform in the Northlands Coliseum rafters alongside No. 99 and No. 11 and maybe one or two more , and he sent the Edmonton Oilers home with something very like a lock on the 1990 Stanley Cup . -- prophetic words from Cam Cole , Edmonton Journal , May 19 , 1990
Jari Kurri was almost done as an Edmonton Oiler .
After a glorious decade of sharing his marvelous gifts with us , he saved his greatest moment almost to the last .
What a birthday gift it was , 20 years ago today , the day Jari turned 30 .
Do the math , dear reader , and you will quickly realize that today is Jari 's 50th birthday .
So let 's start by wishing the man well as he attends to his duties as Finland 's General Manager and Elder Statesman at the ongoing World Championships in Germany .
One of the game 's great international stars continues to carve out a productive and successful career in the game which is as great to see as it is unsurprising .
Back in the day the Worlds used to be already over at this time of year , while the NHL was a full series ahead of where it stands today , and in the Stanley Cup Finals .
So it was on May , 1990 , when the Oilers took on the Bruins in Game Two .
The Oil were confounding the pundits by threatening to win the Stanley Cup just two years after the crippling loss of Wayne Gretzky .
The squad had already said goodbye to Paul Coffey , and that spring of ' 90 saw the loss of Grant Fuhr to a shoulder injury .
The dynasty seemed to have crumbled before our eyes .
Still , key players remained , among them Jari Kurri .
The great Finn was faced with monumental task of adapting his game to the new circumstances , and in passing this test over the two subsequent years , surely locked up that Hall of Fame berth .
Among other things , Kurri was formally brought into the core leadership group , joining fellow respected veterans Mark Messier and Kevin Lowe as lettered players .
Much is made - including by me !
- of Messier 's role in that reorganization , but Kurri did his part and then some .
Start on the ice .
Messier still had his great linemate , Glenn Anderson , as well as Craig Simpson , who was the primary return for Coffey .
Meanwhile , Kurri was still paired with his fellow Finn Esa Tikkanen on the port side , but the pair 's centre went from Wayne Gretzky to talented turncoat Jimmy Carson to journeyman plugger Mark Lamb .
That 'll put a hole in your QualTeam .
Kurri was suddenly the most skilled player on his line , and immediately became the primary puck carrier and playmaker , a role he adapted to effortlessly .
He scored his usual 40 goals and 100 points and made his fifth All - Star team in ' 88 - 89 , joining his old pal Gretz on the second team .
Halfway through the next , his 10th season , Kurri became just the 25th NHLer , and first European , to reach the 1,000 - point milestone .
Not bad for a 69th overall draft pick who thought he would come to North America for one year .
It 's interesting to review the team 's production in the wake of Gretzky 's departure .
They had averaged 4.96 goals per game during the 8 years Gretzky and Kurri were together on the team , but that fell off to 4.00 in 1988 - 90 , nearly a 20 % drop .
( A league - wide scoring decline underway in the late 80s was partly responsible . )
However , the guy who might be expected to suffer the most , Jari Kurri , saw his own output drop by only about 10 % .
Expressed as a percentage of team goals and prorated to games actually played , Kurri was involved in the scoring play on about 28.5 % of Oilers goals during Gretzky 's time ; that figure rose to 31.7 % in his final two years as an Oiler .
A pretty impressive response to the new challenge , all things considered .
By the 1990 playoff run , the line my seatmates and I laughingly called Lamb - Kurri - Tikka were a tasty trio , spicing up the Oilers attack with crucial secondary scoring and combining for 66 points in the Oilers 22 playoff games .
Not surprisingly , Kurri topped the unit with 10 - 15 - 25 , while leading all Oiler forwards with a +13 rating .
The line delivered all manner of huge goals , especially in the seven - game test against the Jets which saw the Oil claw out of a 3 - 1 series hole : Kurri set up Lamb for the OT winner in Game Two ; scored the biggest goal of the entire playoffs with an absolute rocket of a shot to decide Game Six and silence the whited out faithful at Winnipeg Arena that were hoping to finally slay the dragon ; then opened the scoring in Game Seven to start the Oilers on their way to the next round .
The dynasty had been that >||< close to ending with a post - Gretzkian whimper , but some of his former sidekicks had other ideas .
Come the SCF and the " underdog " Oilers opened the series in hostile Boston Garden .
With Bill Ranford providing clutch netminding , the two teams played deep into the night in Game One .
Finally Petr Klima broke it up , taking Kurri 's feed and depositing it behind Andy Moog 55:13 into overtime , ending what is still the longest game in SCF history .
Klima and Ranford were the heroes ; Kurri , the silent assassin , stayed in his preferred shadows , another job well done .
Game
Two , however , was all about Kurri , as he exploded for a flurry of goals , points , records and milestones to celebrate his 30th birthday .
Details and video after the jump .
The first goal was Derek 's and my favourite .
With Oilers leading 1 - 0 in the first , Kurri surprised Garry Galley with a deft poke check from behind to dispossess him of the puck .
Tikkanen made a fine play to keep the puck in at the line and whiz a shot towards the Boston net which Kurri deflected past former Oiler teammate Andy Moog .
It was Jari's 90th career playoff goal , passing Wayne Gretzky 's 89 and making Kurri the all - time leader in Stanley Cup play .
It was one of the few Gretzky records to ever fall , even temporarily .
The divorce was complete , and the race had a new leader .
In the second , after a Boston rally had evened the score at 2 - 2 , Kurri turned the tide with a booming slapshot that somehow found its way through Moog .
His 91st postseason goal ultimately held up as the game winner .
The blast drove Moog from the nets after an extended run of playoff success .
With long - time Oiler patsy Rejean Lemelin now between the pipes , Kurri turned playmaker , setting up Simpson on the doorstep , then Tikkanen for a seeing - eye wrister from close range to put the game out of reach .
In the third Kurri completed his dream night , scoring the final goal in a convincing 7 - 2 triumph on a give - and - go play with the Oilers ' other Finn , Reijo Ruotsalainen , before wiring a perfect shot top cheese .
That last goal made several more dents in the record book of the day :
It was Kurri 's seventh playoff hat trick , tying him with Rocket Richard and Wayne Gretzky for the most ever .
I still remember smirking to my wife when they announced it , " who are those guys ? "
those guys ? "
The five points tied a Stanley Cup Finals single game record , which had been done five times between 1942 - 44 including by Syl Apps , Sid Abel and Toe Blake .
Kurri was the first - and remains the only - player since World War II to achieve this feat .
It was the 200th playoff point of Kurri 's glorious career , just the second man to reach this mark .
That 's an awful lot of good things happening at once , enough to swell the head of a less humble man .
Watch the last part of the video to see how much it affected Jari Kurri .
Cole 's column called it : after sweeping those first two in hostile Boston Garden the Oilers did have a lock on that fifth Cup .
They returned home to a hiccup in Game Three before putting it away with convincing wins in Games Four and Five .
There were new heroes as the Messier line exploded in Game Four while Ranford held the fort and ultimately was recognized as the Conn Smythe winner .
Kurri celebrated his fifth Stanley Cup before heading off to Europe , his days as an Oiler done after ten years .
Back to you , Cam :
Don Cherry , hockey 's foremost European - baiter , will probably say something about Finns having no loyalty - as though Kurri just dropped in for a quick , easy 10 years and five Stanley Cups , the carpetbagger .
Well , Cherry always was wrong about Kurri .
He 's tough , and he 's the definitive team player .
And he 's a winner .
-- Cam Cole , op . cit .
Jari Kurri was such a winner that the Oilers have n't won again since the day he left town , 20 long years ago .
They had survived to win again without Coffey , and again without Gretzky , but the loss of yet a third Hall of Famer in his fullest maturity was too much to bear .
The others followed a year later , and that was that .
Jari himself never fared as well in the second part of his career either .
He returned to the NHL after a year in Italy , but his hands were starting to desert him .
People who saw only that second career as a competent journeyman with the Kings , Rangers , Ducks , and Avalance probably wondered what the fuss was about .
But as Cam Cole said up top , his credentials for the Hockey Hall of Fame were already fully established by the time he left Edmonton .
I 'm convinced that if he had never returned to North America he still would have been a first ballot Hall of Famer based on his fabulous decade in the River City .
* * *
Most of the marks Jari set that magical night ( that 's for you , Vic ! ) have since been erased .
Gretzky regained the playoff goal scoring lead the next year , with Kurri safely in Europe .
The Great
One eventually wound up with 10 playoff hat tricks to stand alone in that category as well .
Two other men , Mark Messier and Glenn Anderson ( great Oilers both ) joined the still - exclusive 200 - point club .
However , the 5 points in one SCF game remains a record , in fact Jari Kurri is the only man to have had such a game on the NHL 's greatest stage in the last 65 years .
Happy birthday , Jari , then and now .
Available until Sunday ONLY !
Then it 's gone forever .

Miss U.S.A . the pole dancer : First Muslim woman to win beauty title pictured taking part in stripping contest
She was hailed as the shining example of the American dream , a Lebanese - born woman who became the first Muslim Miss U.S.A .
Marketing executive Rima Fakih , 24 , beat 50 other contestants to win the beauty pageant in Las Vegas .
But her victory was already becoming tarnished last night by revelations that she won a pole dancing contest at a strip club in Detroit in 2007 .
Shaking her thang : Miss Fakih is seen sliding up and down a stripper 's pole in a blue tank top , hot pants and high heels in the strip club contest
Bump and grind : Rima Fakih does n't hold back in the Stripper 101 event in 2007 in Detroit - although it was an all - women event
She was photographed sliding up and down a stripper ’s pole in a blue tank top , hot pants and high heels .
Other photographs from the competition showed her wearing a bra stuffed with dollar bills .
The photos were posted on the website of a Detroit - based radio show following her triumph at the Miss U.S.A. contest on Sunday night .
Butter would n't melt : Rima Fakih , who says she practises both Muslim and Christian faiths , left the club with the title and dollar bills stuffed in her bra
The radio show 's producers claim they have been contacted by the organisers of the Miss Universe competition requesting additional information regarding Miss Fakih 's involvement .
As the winner of Miss U.S.A. , the 24 - year - old marketing executive from Michigan will represent the U.S. in the beauty contest later this year .
It is not known if organisers of Miss U.S.A. were aware of Miss Fakih winning the ' Stripper 101 ' contest at the Coliseum Gentleman 's Club .
[ caption ]
She is believed to have won a variety of prizes , including adult toys and a stripper 's pole .
Supporters had claimed that her success in the Miss U.S.A. contest showed the true face of Arab Americans at a time when they have come under the spotlight over attempted terror attacks .
Her friend Zouheir Alawieh said : ‘ We have culture .
We have beauty .
We have history , and today we made history .
’Miss Fakih emigrated to America with her family when she was three .
[ caption ]
[ caption ]
While Islam disapproves of women showing their bodies in public , Miss Fakih said she was encouraged to enter beauty competitions by her parents .
The Miss U.S.A. pageant , co-owned by Donald Trump and NBC , was held at the Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino on Sunday night .
Mr Trump has refused to comment .
[ caption ]
Miss Fakih competed against the other women in the swimsuit , evening gown and interview competitions .
She nearly fell while finishing her walk in a long , strapless gown because of the length of its train - but managed to recover .
In the interview , Miss Fakih was asked whether she thought birth control should be paid for by health insurance .
[ caption ]
She said she believed it should as it is expensive .
' I believe that birth control is just like every other medication even though it ’s a controlled substance , ' she said .
Supporters wore T - shirts emblazoned with Miss Fakih 's picture .
On the back was a quote from her : ' It 's beauty that captures your attention , personality which captures your heart . '
Miss Oklahoma Morgan Elizabeth Woolard was first runner - up after handling a question about Arizona 's strict new immigration law .
She said she supports it .

The big decision : Rima Fakih holds hands with Miss Oklahoma Morgan Woolard as they nervously await the judges ' final decision The Miss USA pageant has been dogged by controversy in recent years .
Last year 's winner Carrie Prejean was stripped off her title after it emerged she had made a sex tape .
She also caused controversy by claiming during the pageant that marriage should be between ' a man and a woman ' .
And in 2006 Tara Conner , 20 , admitted to taking drugs and underage drinking .
She was allowed to keep her title after going into rehab .

Angle of repose ( Physics ) , the inclination of a plane at which a body placed on the plane would remain at rest , or if in motion would roll or slide down with uniform velocity ; the angle at which the various kinds of earth will stand when abandoned to themselves .
To me it represents a state when elements and influences of my life come into balance .
The angle where a relationship leans perfectly to support one another .
The angle where my relationship with God is where I remain at rest on Him .
The angle where my intellectual and spiritual growth constantly increases .
Tesla 's still got a ways to go before it overtakes those conventional automakers , but darn if it 's not on the right track now .
The company today announced a deal with Toyota -- yeah , Toyota -- in order to collaborate on the " development of electric vehicles , parts , and production system and engineering support . "
Reportedly , the tandem will form a specialist team to further these efforts , with Toyota agreeing to purchase $ 50 million of Tesla 's common stock issued in a private placement .
In the short term , Tesla is purchasing the former NUMMI factory in Fremont , California in order to build the Model S sedan and other " future Tesla vehicles , " which should employ around 1,000 workers now to produce around 20,000 cars per year .
For those unaware , the NUMMI facility was recently vacated , leaving 4,500 Toyota employees holding pink slips and ginormous frowns ; Tesla CEO Elon Musk did confirm , however , that some of those have already been rehired .
The good news here is that consumerssee lower prices due to Tesla having access to Toyota 's streamlined supply chain ( not to mention those hugely leveraged bulk buy deals ) , but the bad news is that citizens of Downey , California -- a town that was purportedly ready to sign a similar deal with Tesla " tomorrow " -- now have to deal with an erupted bubble .
You win some , you lose some , as they say .
This balance did not come about accidentally .
Natural foods companies like Wild Oats Markets and Celestial Seasonings started here , and several national labs and big - tech companies like I.B.M. opened outposts .
Early on , the biotech , telecom and data storage industries took off in Boulder , bolstered by Sun Microsystems ’s $ 4.1 billion acquisition of Storage Technology in 2005 .
“ That generation of entrepreneurs had their success , and importantly , they do n’t leave , ” said Brad Bernthal , director of the entrepreneurship initiative at the University of Colorado Silicon Flatirons Center .
“ Lots of places , you get your money and you go retire somewhere .
This place is a destination for people . ”
The center makes sure that those veterans cross paths with young entrepreneurs .
It hosts meet - ups , a campuswide business plan competition and a law clinic , where entrepreneurs get free legal help on things like intellectual property protection .
TechStars , a three - month mentorship program that has taken place in an old gym in Boulder since 2007 , has spurred the start - up community ’s growth .
Of the first 10 companies that went through the program , eight received venture funding , five were acquired by bigger companies and three are still active .
But David Cohen , the founder of TechStars , is equally proud of one of its failures , because he said it showed how supportive Boulder ’s tech community is .
After EventVue , which built online communities for conferences , shut down , job offers from other tech companies came pouring in .
Almost half of the 30 companies that have gone through the TechStars program have decided to stay in town .
Several of them share space — tiny offices and a big common room , kitchen and deck — above Aji , a Latin American restaurant downtown .

( CNN ) -- Progressive Catholic groups vented outrage Friday over the decision of a Roman Catholic school in Massachusetts to rescind the admission of an 8 - year - old student because his parents are lesbians .
" The idea that a child might be punished because he does not live with his two biologic parents is antithetical to notions of Christian charity and Catholic social justice , " said Patrick Whelan , president of Catholic Democrats , in a statement Friday .
Other liberal Catholic and gay groups issued similar statements Friday , responding to news reports this week that a child accepted to St. Paul Elementary School in Hingham , Massachusetts , for the fall was told he could n't enroll after the school learned that his parents are gay .
In addition to pressuring the Massachusetts school to reverse its decision and accept the student , progressive Catholic activists are attempting to do something much more dramatic : get the Archdiocese of Boston , which includes the Hingham school , to set a precedent for how the American church treats students with gay parents .
In March , the Archdiocese of Denver , Colorado , supported a decision by a Catholic school in Boulder to block two students with gay parents from re-enrolling .
While the Denver archbishop who backed that decision , Charles J. Chaput , may be the most outspokenly conservative bishop in the nation , progressive Catholics think they can get more moderate Boston Cardinal Sean O'Malley to speak against Catholic schools rejecting students over their parents ' sexual orientation .
" I 'm very disappointed in Chaput 's actions , but he has a history of politicizing issues , " said Chris Korzen , executive director of the progressive Catholics United , which has asked O'Malley to intervene in the Hingham case and to allow the child to attend St. Paul .
" Cardinal O'Malley understands that there 's a place to assert church teachings but that it does n't make sense to discriminate against a child because of his parents ' background , " Korzen said .
Korzen and other left - leaning Catholics said they were concerned that the Hingham school was following the example of the Denver Archdiocese in the Boulder case .
" While the relationship between the events in Boulder and Hingham [ is ] not known , Catholic Democrats is concerned that a narrative will develop that legitimizes the exclusion of children of same sex parents from Catholic schools , " the group Catholic Democrats , which is based in Boston , said Friday .
Conservative Catholic groups , meanwhile , have been mostly silent on the matter .
" I do n't really have a strong opinion on this one , " said Deal Hudson , a prominent conservative Catholic activist , in an e-mail on Friday .
" It 's a matter of the individual bishop 's discretion . "
O'Malley has not publicly weighed in on the case , but the Boston Archdiocese said Thursday that the Hingham school was not acting in compliance with archdiocesan policy .
" The archdiocese does not prohibit children of same - sex parents from attending Catholic schools , " said Mary Grassa O'Neill , the archdiocese 's secretary for education and superintendent of Catholic schools .
" We will work in the coming weeks to develop a policy to eliminate any misunderstandings in the future . "
O'Neill said that the Boston Archdiocese met with one of the child 's parents on Thursday and that it has offered to help enroll him in another Catholic school in the archdiocese .
The parents of the St. Paul student have insisted on anonymity for them and their son in press reports of the situation .
The Catholic Schools Foundation , a Boston - based group whose board is chaired by O'Malley , said Thursday that it would not support schools that discriminated against students based on their parents ' sexual orientation .
`
" [ N ] o school that promotes an exclusionary admissions policy or practice will be considered for support , " said the foundation 's executive director , Michael Reardon , in a Thursday letter to school administrators .
" We believe a policy or practice that denies admissions to students in such a manner as occurred at St. Paul 's is at odds with our values as a foundation , the intentions of our donors , and ultimately with Gospel teaching . "
Calls to St. Paul Elementary School and church on Friday night were not returned .
People making travel plans may unwittingly heed a strange rule of thumb — southern routes rule .
In a new experiment , volunteers chose paths that dipped south over routes of the same distance that arched northward , perhaps because northern routes intuitively seem uphill and thus more difficult , researchers suggest .
Volunteers also estimated that it would take considerably longer to drive between the same pairs of U.S. cities if traveling from south to north , as opposed to north to south , says psychologist and study director Tad Brunyé of the U.S. Army Research , Development , and Engineering Command in Natick , Mass . , and Tufts University in Medford , Mass .
For journeys that averaged 798 miles , time estimates for north - going jaunts averaged one hour and 39 minutes more than south - going trips , he and his colleagues report in an upcoming Memory & Cognition .
“ This finding suggests that when people plan to travel across long distances , a ‘ north is up ’ heuristic might compromise their accuracy in estimating trip durations , ” Brunyé says .
Only individuals who adopted a first - person , ground - level perspective treated southern routes as the paths of least resistance , he notes .
From this vantage , one moves forward and back , right and left .
No southern leaning characterized those who assessed routes from a bird ’s - eye view .
This type of navigation uses the directional terms north , south , east and west .
Real - world experiences underlie avoidance of northern routes , Brunyé proposes .
Young children learn that as objects and locations get higher , they become harder to attain .
Examples include reaching for a toy on the counter , climbing the stairs and jumping .
An ingrained notion that “ up is difficult ” then gets applied to other situations .
When someone imagines traversing a northern and a southern path , the northern way feels higher and more physically demanding , Brunyé suggests .
Another phenomenon might account for the new findings , remarks psychologist Stella Lourenco of Emory University in Atlanta , who was not involved in the study .
From infancy on , people categorize different quantities — say , the numbers 2 and 4 or a big and a small object — as instances of “ less than ” and “ more than . ”
Also , adults tend to associate larger numbers with “ up ” and smaller numbers with “ down . ”
If volunteers equated a northern route ’s greater height on a computer screen with “ more than ” and a southern route ’s lower position as “ less than , ” that could explain a southern bias , Lourenco says .
Brunyé ’s group first presented 160 college students with a series of maps on a computer screen showing parts of Pittsburgh or Chicago .
Each map contained icons for various fictional landmarks , including an information booth and subway stops .
Different - colored lines portrayed routes from one landmark to another , going north to south , east to west , or at angles .
An experimenter asked participants to choose the shorter , faster route to a destination .
Some participants took whatever perspective they wanted ; others were instructed to take a first - person or a bird ’s - eye outlook .
Participants who assumed a first - person stance chose southern routes two - thirds of the time .
Most reported no awareness of having favored southern routes .
Students had no preference for eastern or western routes , or for routes that angled in any particular direction .
Further experiments ruled out the possibilities that participants favored left or right turns , perceived northern routes as longer than southern routes or chose southern routes because they liked information located toward the bottom of the computer screen .
Instead , participants rated northern routes as potentially more scenic and requiring more calories to walk or fuel to drive than southern routes — all signs of perceiving northern routes as elevated , Brunyé suggests .
His team is now examining whether volunteers wearing head - mounted devices that place them in virtual settings prefer southern over northern routes .

Early reaction to today ’s column has been curious , though not unexpected : I ’m getting a lot of rage from people who want their deficit - and - inflation crisis , and wo n’t take no for an answer .
Let ’s back up here .
By spring 2009 a sharp division had emerged among economic commentators .
On one side , many people looked at big budget deficits and the rapid expansion of the monetary base , and saw terrible things happening to interest rates — who will finance all that government borrowing ? — and inflation — look at all that money the Fed is printing !
On the other , some of us — especially those of us who had studied Japan in the 1990s — argued that this was n’t that kind of situation .
With the economy depressed and short - term interest rates up against the zero lower bound , government deficits would not crowd out private spending , but rather promote it .
And when you ’re in that situation , expanding the monetary base is n’t inflationary .
On the contrary , the danger was deflation from excess capacity .
In effect , we ’ve had a test of those two views .
And guess what ?
Interest rates have fluctuated , but as of 20 minutes ago the 10 - year bond rate was 3.17 , yes , 3.17 percent .
Bond vigilantes , where have you gone .
Meanwhile , core inflation — and yes , that is the right measure — just keeps falling .
( As Mark Thoma points out , this is a total refutation of those who kept claiming that there is no Phillips curve . )
But as I said , the people who want their deficit - and - inflation crisis just wo n’t take no for an answer .
I was trying to come up with an explanation of the curious insistence that we ’re facing an imminent interest rate and / or inflation crunch ; then I realized that John Maynard Keynes had already done that , in explaining the hold classical economics retained on thought despite its obvious inability to account for the Great Depression :
The completeness of the Ricardian victory is something of a curiosity and a mystery .
It must have been due to a complex of suitabilities in the doctrine to the environment into which it was projected .
That it reached conclusions quite different from what the ordinary uninstructed person would expect , added , I suppose , to its intellectual prestige .
That its teaching , translated into practice , was austere and often unpalatable , lent it virtue .
That it was adapted to carry a vast and consistent logical superstructure , gave it beauty .
That it could explain much social injustice and apparent cruelty as an inevitable incident in the scheme of progress , and the attempt to change such things as likely on the whole to do more harm than good , commended it to authority .
That it afforded a measure of justification to the free activities of the individual capitalist , attracted to it the support of the dominant social force behind authority .
And all of this has a real , damaging effect on policy .
The econ team at Goldman Sachs ( not online ) makes the interesting point that FOMC inflation forecasts are pulled up by a small group that keeps forecasting much higher inflation than anyone else ; this in turn helps limit the Fed ’s willingness to support the economy .
And the deficit hawks have , of course , killed any hope of more stimulus .
Anyway , I ’m sure that the usual suspects wo n’t change their tune .
Even if we do have a Japan - style lost decade , they ’ll keep predicting hyperinflation just around the corner .
Mumsnet Election - Poll Results
Back in February 2010 , we decided to find out how Mumsnetters were thinking of voting in the coming election .
Since then , we 've run five surveys polling on everything from your voting intentions and who you thought performed well during the debates to whether you think Brown , Cameron or Clegg would make the best Prime Minister .
Our first survey took place on 1 February , the second following the pre-election Budget and the third , fourth and fifth polls opened directly after the televised leaders ' debates on ITV and Sky .
As you can see , there was a significant swing towards the Lib Dems and Nick Clegg following the two televised leaders ' debates on 15 and 22 April , mainly at the expense of the Conservatives , but also taking voters from the Greens .
However , following the final TV debate , both the Tories and Labour began to erode that swing to the Lib Dems .
And as 6
May approaches , it looks as though Mumsnetters are gradually stepping off the Don't Know block and choosing who they 'll plump for at the ballot box .

I 'm a little confused how telepathy and telekinesis are mental powers while teleportation is a physical power ... to me it just seems like you have to bend physics for all of them , so they should be mental powers ... maybe the same for a few of the other physical ones , like invisibility .

Democrats are looking at the possibility of raising taxes on families below the $ 250,000 - a- year threshold promised by President Barack Obama Barack Hussein ObamaUnseemly brawl unlikely to change a thing
It 's now up to health systems to solve our food problems Testing the Electoral College process against judicial overreach MORE during the election .
The majority party on Capitol Hill does not feel bound by that pledge , saying the threshold for tax hikes will depend on several factors , such as the revenue differences between setting the threshold at $ 200,000 and setting it at $ 250,000 .

“ With the debt and deficit we have , you ca n’t make promises to people .
This is a very serious situation . ”
Sen. Byron Dorgan ( N.D. ) , chairman of the Senate Democratic Policy Committee , concurred , saying , “ I do n’t think there ’s any magic in the number , whether it ’s $ 250,000 , $ 200,000 or $ 225,000 .
“ The larger question is whether we ’ll be able to extend the tax cuts for middle - income folks , ” Dorgan said .
“ The answer , I expect , would be yes , but we do n’t quite know how it all fits in the larger picture . ”
Feinstein said the economy has not recovered as much as Democrats had hoped and uncertainty about the availability of credit remains a problem .
In the aftermath of the financial crisis in Greece , credit markets have been spooked by questions of whether nations will be able to pay their rising debts .
“ We have to be very careful what we do to further reduce tax revenues , ” Feinstein said .
Thus , raising taxes on families who earn between $ 200,000 and $ 250,000 has become more palatable among Democrats .
Federal spending and debt are widely , although not universally , regarded among economists as unsustainable .
Centrist Democrats and most Republicans demand that new spending be offset .
Democratic lawmakers want to shield middle - income families from tax increases , but they do n’t necessarily put families making over $ 200,000 in that category .

“ Quite frankly , it could be somewhat lower than that .
$ 250,000 — is that the top 1 percent of Americans , or half a percent ?
I mean , come on ! ”
Household income data compiled by the Census Bureau in 2008 shows that families earning over $ 250,000 fall into the top 2 percent .
House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer ( D - Md. ) hinted in a speech Tuesday that House Democrats do not consider family incomes of $ 250,000 an inviolable threshold , despite Obama ’s pledge .
He said at the event sponsored by the Third Way think tank that “ at a minimum , ” the House would not extend the tax cuts to taxpayers above $ 250,000 .
Hoyer argued that higher taxes would be necessary to address the $ 1.5 trillion federal deficit and downplayed threats that such action would hamstring the economic recovery .

He noted that tax increases in the early 1990s raised government revenues from 17 percent to 21 percent of gross domestic product and ushered in a decade of prosperity .
“ Raising revenue is part of the deficit solution , too , ” he said , adding that Congress must also cut spending .
Hoyer said a compromise to cut spending and raise taxes is the only deficit - reduction plan that has a chance of succeeding .
A bipartisan commission Obama established by executive order is scheduled to give its recommendations for reducing the debt by Dec. 1 .
Erskine Bowles , co-chairman of the commission , said in April that the panel would consider a proposal to raise taxes on families earning less than $ 250,000 a year .
During an appearance on Fox News Sunday at that time , Bowles said the president told him that everything should be on the table .
Senate Republicans accused Democrats of breaking Obama ’s campaign pledge .
“ It is noteworthy that the Democratic leader , the majority leader of the House , is saying that we need to , in effect , raise taxes on the middle class , and the president ought to back off of that pledge as a way to get even more money to spend , ” said Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell Addison ( Mitch ) Mitchell McConnellGOP senators pan debate : ' S - -- show , ' ' awful , ' ' embarrassment '

“ Clearly , that ’s the wrong direction , and I do n’t think that ’s what the American people are asking for , ” he added .
McConnell said Democrats are looking to raise taxes because they are having difficulty passing and paying for legislation such as extended tax relief and social safety - net provisions .

We have learnt today that it has been confirmed that Captain America is set to begin shooting in London in July .
This news comes to us via The LA Times who spoke with Marvel Studios co-President Louis D’Esposito .
The reasons for shooting in London appear to be mixed although the possibility of saving money seems to be a big factor in the decision .
That said there are apparently a lot of UK locations in the film , including Piccadilly Circus , and also a number of European locations too .
With the shooting location of Captain America so close to the HeyUGuys base of operations we are hoping that we ’ll be able to bring you up to the minute news on the film so be sure to check back for the latest .
I still have high hopes for Captain America despite my uncertainty regarding Joe Johnston ’s directing abilities and the choice of Chris Evans .
Although I ’ve never been a huge fan of Captain America , recent Captain America comics have been exceptional and if the film can approach these heights then it could a really interesting project .
If you ’re not familiar with Captain America I can recommend checking out Ed Brubaker ’s recent work with the character and with his new project , Steve Rogers : Super Soldier and also the Brian Michael Bendis / John Romita Jr Avengers comic it ’s a great time to get into Captain America .
For all its pretensions of unity , there have always been at least two Europes – the thrifty , hard - working , northern one , made up quintessentially of countries like Germany and towns like Bielefeld ; and the corrupt , extravagant , southern one , of which the Greeks are only the most extreme example .
Such different countries were never really ready to share a single currency at all – and the Germans signed up only on the express condition that they would not have to make large - scale transfers of their own wealth to their black - sheep partners .
Warning : SPOILERS ahead for the final moments of “ Lost . ”
If you have n’t seen it and do n’t want to know , please turn back now .
Sunday night as “ Lost ” faded to its conclusion , some fans were thrown a loop by images of the wreckage of Oceanic Flight 815 sitting on the beach .
The images , played over the closing credits , led many fans to believe that the survivors of the flight had n’t actually survived by had been dead the whole time .
Apparently that was n’t the intention of writers Damon Lindelof and Carleton Cuse .
The images were put in by ABC to ease the transition for the final moments of the show to your local news .
Maybe ABC forgot that fans of the show are a bit obsessed and tend to analyze every last details and morsel of the show .
To the end , the network has issued a clarification and apology .
An ABC spokesperson wrote in an email Tuesday : “ The images shown during the end credits of the Lost finale , which included shots of Oceanic 815 on a deserted beach , were not part of the final story but were a visual aid to allow the viewer to decompress before heading into the news . ”

Different ways of seeing stats
The voters have spoken .
Now it seems the parties must talk .
In his weekly column Michael Blastland asks if the stats suggest this might be easier than it sounds .
Can the parties agree ?
They already do .
Well , nearly .
With the election over , the haggling is well under way .
That 's why my nomination for the best graph of the election - and its aftermath - is from the Institute for Fiscal Studies , for placing sound and fury in the fridge .
This is the time for cool heads .
We see differences on which - if we believe the rhetoric - the whole shebang depends : the health of the economy , the bond markets , and all our favourite abstract nouns - fairness , change , prosperity , etc .
But squeeze a maxed - out credit card between these lines , relative to past variability , if you can .
The differences - for the next seven years , no less - turn out to be rather smaller than New Labour managed all on its own .
The party varied levels of tax or spend - not always up - far more than the parties now say makes all the difference .
Here 's another view of the IFS data on tax to bring out the point , in which we 've expanded the scale to dramatise the differences between the parties ' plans .
Drama , anyone ?
Bear in mind that all three planned levels are below the lowest achieved when Margaret Thatcher was in office ( 39.4 in her last full year , 1989 - 90 ; falling to 38.4 the year after ) .
The IFS graph also puts plans for the deficit in context .
This is the gap between one party 's plans for tax and the same party 's plans for spending , a gap of equal size for all three , with only a small squabble about timing the pain .
So big problems do not make for big differences .
Mind you , if this is all there is in it , how hard would it be to compromise in a hung parliament ?
Then all they have to do is agree about all the other policies .
Add your comments on this story , using the form below .
It 's all very well saying they are going to tax the same and spend the same but who will they be taxing and who will they be spending the money on .
Tax the poor spend on the big business or tax the rich and spend on the ones who need financial assistance ?
Edd , Cardiff Actually Edd , the choice is between taxing more and spending more and taxing less and spending less - it is the gap that is the same size .
I am part or of very small company but I still recognise that the country as a whole must survive otherwise what you call " the rich " ( or I would class as the people who are prepared to take risks ) wo n't be there to support anyone .
Or put it another way , do you want life to be fair , or equal ?
Tim Jackson , Norwich
All of the party projections still show more spending than taxation even after eight years .
This means that the debt will still be growing .
Surely we should be aiming for taxation to rise above spending so that we can pay off the colossal debt that Labour have built up ?
Sam , Bolton
How much of the deficit is down to money spent on rescuing banks and money not coming in from banks in various forms of taxation ?
The return of banks to profit is likely to start making a difference in the next year or two .
Chris , Rochester , Kent
There is a great deal of difference between increasing the overall tax bill while at the same time reducing inheritance tax , or spending more on employment benefits thanks to public sector redundancies , and placing a higher rate of tax on the richest 10 % or spending more to retain employment ( and thus consumption ) in the public sector .

Would you ever think to eat a fern ?
I eat anything that wo n’t make me sick , so I sure have , but young fern shoots are not the first thing that comes to mind for most people when they think of spring .
Oddly , they are the first thing that comes to my mind when someone says “ spring . ”
Early spring is fiddlehead season , and these crunchy vegetables are one thing I look forward to when winter is ending .
Fiddleheads are the young shoots of the ostrich fern , and I am surprised that they are not more popular than they are , the stem is crunchy , and the leafy spiral in the middle is soft and sweet .
Plus , fiddleheads are cute , but not too cute to eat ( like baby bunnies ) .
Fiddleheads do not have a long shelf life .
I generally cook them the day I buy them , or perhaps the next day .
It is not that they go bad , but that they tend to oxidize quickly , which will make them look less appealing .
You may want to cut off the dark , oxidized skin on the fiddleheads to prepare them for cooking , which is very easy as it is just the skin that oxidizes and turns brown .
It is not required , though , as the oxidized skin will not contribute any off flavors to the fiddleheads .
One thing to keep in mind is that fiddleheads should not be eaten raw , they contain compounds that are both unpleasant , and could potentially make a person ill .
But cooking them makes them entirely safe to eat , and tenderizes the shoot as well .
Fiddleheads are also surprisingly high in anti-oxidants , much more so than even blueberries , as well as omega - 3 fatty acids , making them both healthful and tasty .
Fiddleheads are very high in fiber and vitamin A , and low in everything that you do n’t want .
They are an excellent spring treat , particularly for those who are watching what they eat ( e.g. no fat , no cholesterol , almost no carbs , and very low in calories , only 35 per 1/2 cup serving ) .
Many recipes call for boiling or steaming them , which works well and does n’t add any fat or calories from oil , however I prefer to saute them with a little oil and garlic .
That said , I have been known to steam my fiddleheads prior to a quick saute in order to speed the process and this can also reduce the potential for bitterness that may be found in them .
They also go well in pasta and stir fry , but nothing beats a good old saute to bring out their own natural flavor .
Fern shoots may not be an obvious star of a dish , but you would be surprised at their delicate and interesting flavor .
Even my children find fiddleheads a fun and interesting diversion to the usual vegetable argument .
Ingredients
1/2 pound fiddleheads
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 - 2 cloves of garlic , thickly cut
N.B. a few drops of lemon juice can bring out the flavor and help prevent darkening ( oxidation ) of the fern shoots .
Garlic cut thickly
Directions
1 . Cut off any black ends of the fiddleheads , and slice off any black / brown skin from the stems .
2 . Wash the fiddleheads and pat dry .
3. Slice the garlic clove (s ) into thick pieces , thick enough so that they wo n’t cook too quickly ( they tend to become bitter if overcooked )
4 . Put the garlic in the oil and turn heat to medium high .
5 . When the garlic starts to sizzle , add the fiddleheads .
Turn the heat down to medium and saute fiddleheads until soft , about 10 minutes , then serve .
Salt to taste .
Serves 1 , but this recipe easily scales to as many servings as you need .

Editor 's note :
This article , the second of two parts , is the result of a 10 - month CNN investigation into the case of Bryant Neal Vinas , an American al Qaeda recruit featured in the one - hour documentary " American Al Qaeda " to air Saturday , May 15 , and Sunday , May 16 , at 8 p.m. and 11 p.m. ET .
The documentary airs on CNN International on Saturday , May 22 at 8 a.m. ET and Sunday , May 23 at 3 p.m. ET .
( Read Part 1 here . )
( CNN ) --
On the eve of the sixth anniversary of the September 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks on New York and Washington , Bryant Neal Vinas boarded a flight from New York to Lahore , Pakistan .
The 24 - year - old lifelong New Yorker had enlisted in the Army after graduating from high school , in part because of that seminal event .
Now he was a recruit of a different kind , on his way to join al Qaeda in waging holy war against U.S. troops .
A Muslim convert now known as Ibrahim , he would eventually earn a fighting name : Bashir al Ameriki , " the American . "
But when Vinas landed in Lahore on September 12 , 2007 , he had little idea how to achieve his goal .
He had never been to Pakistan .
He had no connections to jihadists in the country , and though he had started to learn Arabic , he did not speak Urdu or Pashto , the country 's main languages .
He had left the United States without telling his parents or sister where he was going .
And he had hidden his true intentions from many of his close Muslim friends on Long Island .
But investigators suspect two of Vinas ' friends at the Islamic Thinkers Society , a pro-al Qaeda extremist organization in New York , knew what he was up to .
One of those , according to U.S. counterterrorism officials , was Ahmer Qayyum , whose hometown was Lahore .
Vinas had planned to travel to Pakistan with him , but Qayyum was , by his own account , delayed a few days .
" We had planned to come back , like , together but ... I had to , like , work for a few extra days in the [ United ] States ... and he arrived in Lahore before me , " Qayyum told CNN .
He denied knowing Vinas ' intentions and said he believed his friend was merely on his way to study the Quran at a madrassa , or religious school .
Within a few days , Qayyum joined Vinas in Lahore .
Vinas , Qayyum said , was staying in a guest house in the Firdous Market district , a bustling neighborhood near the main cricket stadium .
As Vinas acclimated to the hot , crowded city , Qayyum said he spent time with his friend , joining him on occasion to pray in mosques .
After several weeks , Qayyum said , Vinas left to attend a madrassa in Peshawar , near the border with Afghanistan .
Qayyum said he helped Vinas arrange his trip to the madrassa , but denied Vinas was planning to fight jihad .
But counterterrorism officials told CNN they believe Qayyum is the " fixer " Vinas referred to in an interview with authorities after his arrest .
In that interview , Vinas told officials that a " friend from New York ... agreed to help him and introduce him to people who could assist him in getting to Afghanistan . "
In that question - and - answer session , held in the presence of Belgian magistrates in the FBI offices in New York in March 2009 , Vinas provided details about his time in Pakistan .
The Belgian document , which was entered into evidence in a recent trial of an alleged Belgian al Qaeda cell in Brussels , was provided to CNN by a defense lawyer in the case and authenticated by a U.S. prosecutor and Vinas ' defense lawyer .
The following account is based on the Belgian document , as well as interviews with counterterrorism agents and others close to the investigation .
Much of it is drawn from Vinas ' own statements to investigators , contained in the Belgian document .
In late September 2007 , when Vinas traveled to Peshawar , a violent Islamist insurgency was brewing in the North West Frontier Province and tribal areas along the border with Afghanistan .
Two months earlier , Pakistani security services had stormed the Red Mosque in Islamabad , killing many Taliban militants who had taken control of the compound , sparking a wave of suicide bombings and attacks across Pakistan .
Deep inside Pakistan 's Federally Administered Tribal Areas , al Qaeda had again built up the capability to launch an attack on the United States , according to a U.S. National Intelligence Estimate published that summer .
After a series of meetings , Vinas and his New York friend found someone who could connect Vinas with Shah Saab , a militant commander conducting armed forays into Afghanistan from Pakistani territory .
Saab took Vinas to his camp in Mohmand in the tribal areas to prepare for a raid against American troops across the border in Afghanistan .
" The group then crossed the border to get into the Konar Province in Afghanistan , " according to the Belgian document .
" They were a group of 10 to 20 men .
The group separated into two further groups ; one led a ground attack with guns and rocket - propelled grenades against an Afghan military base .
" Vinas was part of the second group who planned to climb the mountains and stockpile mortars to launch a new attack on an American base , " the document says .
" The group eventually decided not to launch the mortar bombs themselves because planes were circulating over the region -- and fearful of being attacked the next night -- the group including S.S. [ Shah Saab ] returned to Pakistan . "
Ready to die
Back in Mohmand , one of Saab 's men asked Vinas to become a suicide bomber .
He accepted .
Not only did he want to kill the servicemen of his own country , but he also appeared to be willing to give up his own life to do it .
U.S. counterterrorism officials believe this may have been a test of loyalty for Vinas -- a way to prove he was not an American spy .
" You 're going to go through multiple paths , multiple doors before someone trusts this person , " said Phil Mudd , deputy head of the FBI 's National Security Branch at the time of the Vinas investigation .
Mitch Silber , director of intelligence analysis for the New York Police Department , believes it was a crucial steppingstone for Vinas .
" His offer to become a suicide bomber obviously gave him some standing and facilitated his ultimate linkup to al Qaeda , " Silber said .
After agreeing to become a suicide bomber , Vinas was sent back to Peshawar to receive more instruction .
It is possible that Vinas ' militant handlers were hatching more ambitious plans for him .
But Vinas said Saab told him that he needed more religious instruction before he could become a suicide bomber .
The young American was growing frustrated .
That feeling was shared by another member of Saab 's militant group , whose identity CNN was unable to learn .
Together , the two resolved to find the contacts necessary in Peshawar to receive training in the tribal areas of Pakistan .
At first , they were unsuccessful .
A series of promises were made , but each time , their contacts did not deliver .
Fed up , Vinas set off on his own for the tribal areas of Pakistan .
To evade Pakistani security , Vinas wore a burqa , the head - to - toe covering worn by some Afghan and Pakistani women .
But he failed to connect with al Qaeda and returned to Peshawar , disappointed .
With his poor Arabic , Western appearance and lack of contacts who could vouch for him , it was difficult at first for Vinas to win the trust of fighters in the tribal areas .
On his second trip , he was almost killed by militants but managed to talk them into letting him go .
Eventually , Vinas met a militant in Peshawar who did have contacts within al Qaeda .
Again , he set off for the tribal areas and made contact with al Qaeda members in North Waziristan .
The fighters there , he said , were from places such as Yemen , Saudi Arabia and Kuwait .
He became friendly with one Yemeni who agreed to vouch for him so he could secure membership in al Qaeda .
In March 2008 , Vinas became a full - fledged member of al Qaeda , pledging to obey all orders .
" What characterized you being an al Qaeda member was the fact you followed the orders given to you by leaders ... [ you were ] totally committed , " Vinas later stated .
A new fighting name , " Bashir al Ameriki , " completed Vinas ' metamorphosis from all - American kid to al Qaeda recruit .
His persistence had paid off .
" That trait would make him potentially very dangerous if he had decided to do some kind of terrorist plot in the West , because he would not have given up , " said Marc Sageman , who advised the New York Police Department on the Vinas case .
As an al Qaeda recruit , Vinas found new friends , too .
The child of a broken home , Vinas had always treasured his friendships , and in the mountains of Waziristan , he found camaraderie with other fighters .
He hung out with a band of European militants who had traveled to the tribal areas from Belgium and France .
While undergoing training , he lived with one of them , Hicham Zrioul , a Belgian - Moroccan taxi driver from Brussels .
After a hard day 's training with al Qaeda , Vinas and Zrioul would unwind in their small mountain shack by watching jihadist videos on a Dell computer Zrioul had acquired .
Between March and July 2008 , Vinas said he attended three al Qaeda training courses focused on weapons , explosives and rocket - based or propelled weaponry .
During these classes , attended by 10 to 20 recruits , Arab instructors taught Vinas how to handle a large variety of weapons and explosives , some of them of military - grade sophistication .
Vinas said he became familiar with seeing , smelling and touching explosives such as TNT , as well as plastic explosives , including the kind U.S. authorities say was used in al Qaeda 's attack on the USS Cole in 2000 .
Vinas also learned how to make vests for suicide bombers .
The terrorist skills Vinas acquired made him a potentially deadly threat if al Qaeda decided to use him for an attack in the United States .
" Once they go out and gain that operational training -- whether communication security or how to build a device -- their potential for lethality is much greater , " said Mudd , the former FBI official who supervised the Vinas investigation .
During a mountain walk one day , Zrioul told Vinas about a planned attack on the Brussels metro , which he called a soft target because of poor security .
Vinas said Zrioul also raised the possibility of launching an attack on a European football stadium .
( A senior Belgian intelligence official told CNN that Belgian security services only learned about these conversations in March 2009 , after Vinas met with Belgian prosecutors in New York .
Although concerned , Belgium 's intelligence service concluded that no concrete plot had likely existed ) .
Despite the threat of U.S. drone strikes in the tribal areas , Vinas ' handlers allowed him to travel widely , perhaps because curiosity had grown about al Qaeda 's valuable new American recruit .
But providing the young American with a window - seat view of their strongholds was a decision his handlers would later regret .
His potential value to the intelligence services of his own country was growing by the day .
During his travels , Vinas met fighters and leaders from an array of al Qaeda - affiliated groups .
At a tribal gathering in North Waziristan , he was introduced to Baitullah Mehsud , then leader of the Pakistani Taliban .
( Mehsud was killed by a drone in August 2009 . )
Vinas met former bodyguards of Osama bin Laden and a veritable who's who of al Qaeda 's top commanders , including the Egyptian operative Mustafa Abu al Yazid , one of al Qaeda 's founders , and Attiya Allah , a Libyan al Qaeda ideologue , who helped mentor Vinas .
But the American recruit was told nobody got to meet bin Laden .
In July 2008 , Vinas completed his final training course and was judged qualified to participate in a missile strike against U.S. troops in Afghanistan .
After weeks waiting for orders , Vinas was dispatched with a group to the Afghan border .
It was September 2008 , almost exactly a year since Vinas had arrived in Pakistan .
As he hiked through the high mountain passes , loaded down with rockets , he was for a second time close to fulfilling a goal that had become an obsession : killing the soldiers of his own country in the name of jihad .
When Vinas ' group reached a site overlooking an American base on the Pakistan - Afghanistan border , they readied their missiles for launch .
Then , things fell apart .
" The first attack was not launched because of radio communication problems , " Vinas would later tell authorities , " but a few days later , I took part in firing rockets at an American base .
Although we intended to hit the military base and kill American soldiers , I was informed that the rockets missed and the attack failed . "
Afterward , Vinas returned to the al Qaeda encampment in the mountains of Waziristan .
U.S. counterterrorism officials said they believe that mission may have been al Qaeda 's final test for their American recruit .
" If you want to go to a further level of training , being tested by proving that you 'll engage in a fight against American or other forces in Afghanistan is a pretty good test , " said the FBI 's Mudd .
Al Qaeda leaders now felt comfortable enough to have detailed conversations with Vinas about plans to attack the West , including the United States .
" I consulted with a senior al Qaeda leader and provided detailed information about the operation of the Long Island Rail Road system , which I knew because I had ridden the railroad on so many occasions , " Vinas later testified in a U.S. court .
" The purpose of providing information was to help plan a bomb attack of the Long Island Rail Road system . "
While Vinas discussed that plot with al Qaeda leaders in September 2008 , three young men arrived in the tribal areas from the United States .
They , like Vinas , were allegedly intent on fighting American troops in Afghanistan .
Their ringleader was Najibullah Zazi , a Denver , Colorado , taxi driver who had gone to high school in Queens , New York , just a few blocks from where Vinas had lived when he was very young .
Zazi later admitted that he received bomb - making training in al Qaeda camps that fall and was persuaded by al Qaeda to launch attacks on the United States .
In September 2009 , the FBI thwarted Zazi's plot to conduct suicide bombings on subway cars in New York , just days before it was about to go into operation , according to court documents outlining Zazi 's guilty plea .
While CNN has not been able to establish whether Zazi and Vinas met , the two appear to have been in the same militant circles in the tribal areas in fall 2008 , according to European counterterrorism sources .
Vinas , they said , was in touch with an al Qaeda member believed connected to Rashid Rauf , the British al Qaeda operative who allegedly orchestrated Zazi 's plot against New York .
Counterterrorism officials said they believed al Qaeda leaders probably would have eventually asked Vinas to take part in an attack on U.S. soil .
No evidence has emerged , however , that they did so before his arrest .
Vinas " must have been for them a great opportunity they wanted to exploit , " said Silber , of the NYPD , because of his appearance and U.S. passport .
" I think his main value to al Qaeda is the same they 've been looking for , really , going back to 9/11 , " Silber said .
" In the sense , who can operate for al Qaeda in the West .
Here 's an individual who has a lot of appeal to you , who 's sort of just shown up on your doorstep . "
A personal mission
Vinas stayed in the al Qaeda encampments in the tribal areas until early October , then set off back to Peshawar to devote some time to a more personal mission :
He wanted to find a wife .
He called his friend , Ahmer Qayyum , in Lahore to tell him the news .
" He gave me a call a couple of times , [ to say ] like I 'm OK , you know .
He even said , ' I 'm going to get married . ' "
But as Vinas walked around the bustling bazaars of Peshawar , U.S. intelligence agencies were closing in on him .
A senior U.S. counterterrorism official said intelligence agencies had begun tracking Vinas some time before his arrest .
He would not reveal the nature of the tracking or when it began .
That month , FBI agents visited Vinas ' father , Juan Vinas , on Long Island , telling him they believed his son was in Pakistan .
But , according to Juan Vinas , they masked their true reasons for inquiring about his son .
The FBI agents then asked if they could search his son's computer and look through his e-mail , which Juan Vinas allowed .
On or around November 14 , 2008 , Vinas ' al Qaeda conspiracy came to an end , according to court papers .
After a tip from their U.S. counterparts , Pakistani security services arrested Vinas in Peshawar and transferred him into American custody .
CNN has not been able to establish the exact date of his arrest .
Vinas ' friend Qayyum said he learned of the arrest through the grapevine .
He was told Vinas was picked up by Pakistani police in a Peshawar market .
" When something like this happens , I mean a foreigner , you know , getting arrested , it circulates , you know .
It 's big news , " Qayyum said .
Back in the United States , Vinas ' father received a call from the FBI , saying that Pakistani authorities had apprehended his son .
" They made it sound like it was for a visa violation and that he would be deported , " Juan Vinas recalled .
After that , he said , the FBI did not return any of his calls .
On November 22 , Vinas was arraigned in secret in federal court in Brooklyn , New York , on terrorism charges .
Although he initially pleaded not guilty , Vinas started cooperating with U.S. investigators .
Just days after his arraignment , federal officials issued an intelligence bulletin warning that al Qaeda had discussed attacking transit systems in the New York metropolitan area , including the city 's subway .
This led New York authorities to step up security on the city 's mass transit systems .
A senior counterterrorism official told CNN that information about the al Qaeda plot came from Vinas and that authorities had acted out of an " abundance of caution . "
After Vinas started cooperating , he provided " extremely helpful information " in targeting al Qaeda operatives in the tribal areas of Pakistan .
" Just by talking about what he saw , telling us what houses and streets operatives were living in , identifying how al Qaeda runs its courier networks , he has provided us priceless information , " a senior U.S. counterterrorism official told CNN .
" This was actionable intelligence . "
In recent years , the CIA has carried out a covert aerial campaign targeting al Qaeda and the Pakistani Taliban in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas using unmanned drones .
Vinas ' arrest coincided with an intensification of the CIA 's drone campaign in the tribal areas of Pakistan , strikes that have killed more than a dozen leading al Qaeda operatives in the last two years .
U.S. counterterrorism officials will not comment on whether intelligence from Vinas helped with any specific strike .
What officials do acknowledge , however , is that Vinas became a powerful resource in the U.S. war against al Qaeda .
" His intelligence was not just useful in the first few weeks after his capture , but for months afterward , " a senior U.S. counterterrorism official told CNN .
" Vinas was as valuable as having our own agent penetrate al Qaeda .
In many ways , the end result was like undertaking a classic intelligence operation . "
Not everybody welcomed his cooperation with U.S. authorities .
Yousef al Khattab , the chief ideologue of the Islamic Thinkers Society , said he feels betrayed by Vinas .
" For informing on the people that are fighting in Afghanistan , " Khattab said , " I call him a coward . "
With such a prized asset in custody , authorities took extraordinary measures to keep Vinas ' arrest secret .
All court proceedings were kept closed on national security grounds , and his family members were kept in the dark about his arrest .
On January 28 , 2009 , in a closed - door session in federal court in Brooklyn , Vinas pleaded guilty to all charges against him : conspiracy to murder U.S. nationals , conspiracy to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization and receiving military - type training from a foreign terrorist organization .
Vinas faces a maximum of life in prison but could receive a lower sentence if he continues to cooperate .
Sources told CNN that Vinas has come away from his radical views and is cooperating willingly .
On July 22 , 2009 , news broke of Vinas ' arrest after federal authorities unsealed his guilty plea .
The revelation that he helped al Qaeda plot a bomb attack in New York came as a shock to his family .
At first his mother could not believe the news .
" He 's accused of such horrible things , " she told CNN .
In prison , Vinas became increasingly restless and lonely .
In August 2009 , he wrote a letter to his friend Alex Acevedo , begging him to write back with news .
" You ever see the movie Groundhogs day , [ sic ] well that 's how I feel like every day , " Vinas wrote .
Acevedo did not write back .
" I 'm pissed off with him .
...
It 's wrong .
He could have been killing his own people on that train , " he said .
Other friends of Vinas ' , however , feel no anger about what he did .
" I feel proud of him .
I respect him .
...
If I ever meet him , I 'm going to hug him .
I 'm going to love him for what he did , " said Ahmer Qayyum , the former Islamic Thinkers Society devotee .
" And if my message can reach him , you know , I mean I just want him to stay strong .
I do n't think the American evil empire is going to last too long now .
Inshallah . "
For Vinas ' mother and sister , the shock of his arrest has been replaced by terrible disappointment and flashes of anger .
Vinas was no different from most other American teenagers , they said .
But now , they feel like they do n't know him anymore .
If all this can happen to them , they fear it can happen to another American family .
The study looked at monetary exchanges
Exposure to an oxytocin " potion " led people to be more trusting , tests by University of Zurich researchers found .
They report in the journal Nature that the finding could help people with conditions such as autism , where relating to others can be a problem .
But one expert warned it could be misused by politicians who want to persuade more people to back them .
Some may worry about the prospect that political operators will generously spray the crowd with oxytocin at rallies of their candidates
Dr Antonio Damasio , University of Iowa College of Medicine
It also acts on other brain regions whose function is associated with emotional and social behaviours , such as the amygdala .
And animal studies have shown oxytocin is linked to bonding between males and females and mother - infant bonding .
Reaping rewards
The Swiss and American team of researchers suspected the same effect may occur in humans and invited 58 people to take part in a " trust test " .
The participants in the study played a game , in which they were split into " investors " and " trustees " .
The investors were then given credits and told they could choose whether to hand over zero , four , eight or 12 credits to their assigned trustee .
If the investor showed trust , the total amount which could be distributed between the two increased , but the trustee initially reaped all the reward .
It was then up to them to decide if they would honour the investor 's trust by sharing the profit equally - or if they would keep the lot .
At the end of the game , the credits were translated into real money , meaning both participants had a selfish financial incentive .
Investors and trustees were either given oxytocin via a nasal spray , or a dummy , or placebo , version .
Of 29 investors who were given oxytocin , 13 ( 45 % ) displayed " maximal trust " by choosing to invest highly , compared with six ( 21 % ) of the 29 investors who were given the dummy spray .
Oxytocin did not change the behaviour of trustees .
In addition , when trustees were replaced by a computer , the oxytocin effect was no longer seen on the investors .
Possible ' abuses '
The researchers , led by Dr Ernest Fehr , say this suggests the chemical promotes social interaction , rather than simply encouraging people to take risks .
And they say it appears to over - ride obstacles such as the fear of being betrayed .
Writing in Nature , the team says : " Oxytoxin does not increase the general inclination to behave prosaically .
Rather , oxytocin specifically affects the trusting behaviour of investors . "
They suggest this is because people in the position of " investors " have to take the first step .
The scientists say their findings could potentially be used to help people with conditions such as social phobia and autism which can be linked to persistent fear and avoiding social situations .
" Our results might lead to fertile research on the role of oxytocin in several mental health disorders with major public health significance . "
In the same journal , Dr Antonio Damasio of the Department of Neurology at the University of Iowa College of Medicine , US , said some might fear the findings could be used by those trying to gain people 's trust .
" Some may worry about the prospect that political operators will generously spray the crowd with oxytocin at rallies of their candidates .
" The scenario may be rather too close to reality for comfort , but those with such fears should note that current marketing techniques - for political and other products - may well exert their effects through the natural release of molecules such as oxytocin in response to well - crafted stimuli .
" Civic alarm at such abuses should have started long before this study . "
