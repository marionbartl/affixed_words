JACKSON , Mo. --
A collision with a semi- trailer truck seven years ago left 52 - year - old Deborah Shank permanently brain - damaged and in a wheelchair .
Her husband , Jim , and three sons found a small source of solace : a $ 700,000 accident settlement from the trucking company involved .
After legal fees and other expenses , the remaining $ 417,000 was put in a special trust .
It was to be used for Mrs. Shank 's care .
Instead , all of it is now slated to go to Mrs.
Shank 's former employer , Wal - Mart Stores Inc .

Sorry , Charlie .
Price promotions may not be the best way to increase sales of canned tuna — or any other frequently purchased consumer good .
The iconic cartoon mascot never got the message : “ StarKist does n’t want tuna with good taste ; it wants tuna that tastes good . ”
Some companies may not be getting the message that “ if value is driven only by price , price becomes the only value proposition you have , ” said Chakravarthi Narasimhan .
According to Narasimhan , a marketing professor at the Olin Business School at Washington University in St. Louis , “ managers can be overly focused on losing market share and get caught up in a mindless cycle of discounting – without regard to the long - term implications of their actions . ”
Take automobile manufacturers , for example .
Dealers want to move more vehicles .
In response , manufacturers initiate price promotions , offer rebates and lower buyers ’ financing costs .
“ The additional volume that comes from these promotions will slowly fall , ” Narasimhan said .
“ Why ?
In the mind of the consumer , there ’s always another promotion and no real pressure to buy at a particular time .
This dynamic , in turn , leads companies to continue price promotions .
“ Strategic consumers are those who form expectations about future prices , ” he explained .
In other words , they anticipate that certain products fluctuate in price and react in one of several ways .
Narasimhan and fellow researchers
Tat Chan , associate professor of marketing , and Qin Zhang , assistant professor of marketing at the University of Texas at Dallas , examined A.C. Nielsen scanner panel data to compute the canned tuna purchases of 1,000 randomly selected households in Sioux Falls , S.D. , during a 123 - week period .
Their study focused on 6.5 - ounce cans and included StarKist , Chicken of the Sea , 3 Diamonds , private - label and other brands .
They proposed “ a dynamic structural model to understand the impact of temporary price promotions on households ’ behavior and determine the amount of consumption increase , brand switching and stockpiling . ”
Although some consumers switched brands to take advantage of any sale , loyal customers stocked up on their preferred brand when its price was reduced .
A price cut caused light users to increase their consumption of canned tuna , but heavy users stored cans .
Narasimhan , Chan and Zhang found price promotions could hurt large - share brand profits in the long run .
An increase in sales at a lower price frequently came at the expense of future sales at the full price .
Similar conclusions were drawn when the researchers looked at data from the paper towels category .
Managers can use these findings to develop more effective pricing and promotion strategies .
They must keep in mind customers vary in their needs , preferences and ability ( or willingness ) to pay a certain price for a product or service .
Understanding this kind of consumer behavior is critical .
Narasimhan said companies can drive value in ways other than price .
For instance , a business could improve customer service , initiate a customer loyalty program or enhance the emotional appeal and image of a particular brand .
Find creative opportunities to benefit from the entire marketing mix , he advised .
“ Retain loyal customers through nonprice , value - added components , and limit discounts to entice new buyers or brand switchers . ”
Narasimhan , Chan and Zhang ’s paper , “ Decomposing Promotional Effects With a Dynamic Structural Model of Flexible Consumption , ” will be published in the Journal of Marketing Research .

New Observations Slightly Decrease Mars Impact Probability
Updated Uncertainty Region for 2007 WD5 at encounter with Mars , shown as white dots .
The thin white line is the orbit of Mars .
The blue line traces the motion of the center of the uncertainty region , which is the most likely position of the asteroid .
Note that the scale is considerably finer than it has been in past diagrams .

Pasadena CA ( JPL ) Jan 03 , 2008
Additional position observations for asteroid 2007 WD5 taken on December 29 through January 2 have been used to improve the accuracy of the asteroid 's orbit .
As a result , the range of possible paths past Mars has narrowed by a factor of 3 and the most likely path has moved a little farther away from the planet , causing the Mars impact probability to decrease slightly to 3.6 % ( about one chance in 28 ) .
The new positional observations were made using the 2.4 meter telescope at New Mexico Tech 's Magdalena Ridge Observatory and reported by astronomer Bill Ryan .
It seems likely that as additional observations further shrink the uncertainty region of this asteroid , the region will no longer intersect Mars and the impact probability will quickly drop to zero .

I 'm still trying to sort through what it might mean that , after signing an unlikely plea agreement with the government , Duke Cunningham briber Tommy K has continued to engage in mortgage fraud , at the expense of the company most deeply buried in the shitpile , Washington Mutual ( WaMu ) .
But let 's start with the description John Michael 's lawyers gave of Tommy K's method .
Kontogiannis would have a loan application prepared in the name of a putative home purchaser , sometimes with the knowledge of the person ( who might be paid a fee ) and sometimes without the person ’s knowledge , for a property that Kontogiannis either had developed or had planned to develop .
Fraudulent paperwork would be prepared related to , for example , income , assets , or appraisal .
( Kontogiannis presumably would pay a kickback to the individual preparing these documents . )
Applications would then otherwise be submitted for approval to various financial institutions in accordance with normal industry practices .
At closing , all title documentation ( such as the mortgage and note , the uniform settlement statement ( HUD - 1 form ) , title - insurance paperwork , and affidavits pertaining to the purchaser ’s identity and intent of occupancy ) would be fraudulently executed by a loan officer controlled by Kontogiannis .
The settlement agent , using money that had been forwarded by the lender and placed in escrow , would issue checks to cover mortgage taxes , transfer taxes , recording fees , title insurance , and lender fees , as well as the net proceeds ( the balance of the loan money ) , all of which ( with the exception , sometimes , of lender fees ) would go to Kontogiannis - controlled entities , including companies ostensibly owned by one of Kontogiannis ’s daughters and controlled by Kontogiannis .
The mortgage and note , however , would never be recorded , the taxes never paid , and title insurance never purchased .
Instead , the funds that had been disbursed for these purposes would eventually be steered to another company ostensibly owned by one of Kontogiannis ’s daughters but controlled by Kontogiannis .
These fraudulent loans would ultimately be sold into the secondary - mortgage market to a lender who would be led to believe , based on the loan documentation provided by Kontogiannis ’s agent , that the loan had been sent for recording and that all taxes and recording fees had been paid .
A Kontogiannis controlled financial - services company , typically Parkview Financial , Inc. ( “ Parkview ” ) , would assume responsibility for making monthly payments on the loan .
So long as timely payments were made , the loan would be viewed by the new owner as performing and , consequently , never questioned .
Kontogiannis ’s greed , however , did not stop there .
He would then market the property to an end -user , whose financing was often out of Kontogiannis ’s control .
Upon closing with the end -user , Kontogiannis would take a second bite from the mortgage - fraud apple : iin light of the fact that the first mortgage on the property had never been recorded , the settlement
agent would release the net proceeds of the second loan directly to a Kontogiannis - controlled company without paying off the existing loan because the latter had never been recorded .
For
its part , the lender who had purchased the first mortgage would not know that the property had been sold again and that , consequently , its position in the chain of title had been compromised .
[ my emphasis
So basically , Tommy K would double dip on mortgages on houses that no one ( except for at least one corrupt Congressman ) was really buying .
Here 's where we get into WaMu 's role in this .
The " one company alone " in the following paragraph must be WaMu , given the government 's assertion that WaMu had purchased $ 50 million in Tommy K's fraudulent loans .
The volume of Kontogiannis ’s fraudulent loans as of June 1995 is shown by one of Parkview ’s bank - account statements .
See Exhibits 12 and 13 .
The statement reveals mortgage payments on 140 different properties .
One company alone had purchased over 100 of the loans in the secondary market , with an average loan amount of approximately $ 500,000 .
That publicly traded and federally chartered bank thus had approximately $ 50,000,000 in loans that were potentially worthless because , as a result of Kontogiannis ’s scams , none of the mortgages were recorded in primary position as the bank had assumed .
That , in turn , meant that if any of the loans defaulted , the bank would not be able to foreclose on any real property and thereby recoup any of the losses .
Needless to say , the impact of such losses would be profound both on the individual bank and on the shareholders of the company .
Even scarier , that bank may have since purchased many more such loans from Kontogiannis .
[ my emphasis ]
Note , Michael 's lawyers are citing how many bad mortgages WaMu had bought in 1995 , not how many they bought by 2007 .
And , as they helpfully point out , Tommy K may well have continued this fraud after he signed his plea deal in February .
That 's certainly the implication of this passage from yesterday 's filing .
... as a direct result of being contacted by Michael 's defense counsel , Washington Mutual contacted the government with information regarding Mr. Kontogiannis 's continued illegal activity .
[ my emphasis ]
Michael 's filing was in August , which would leave several months after Tommy K's plea deal for him to continue to sell Greek shitpile to WaMu .
And of course , the government did n't bother to tell anyone that Tommy K had been selling Greek shitpile until June , which appears to have allowed WaMu to continue to buy up Tommy K's fraudulent loans .
Five or seven months of Greek shitpile , depending on how you 're counting -- that might be a significant amount of shitpile .
Now , I might feel bad for WaMu .
Except for the fact that they 're pretty damned corrupt themselves , and seem to have been in the business of making sure they did n't know if they bought shitpile .
Here 's what Andrew Cuomo alleges them to have done .
Recently unsealed documents show that a federal judge has rejected an attempt by federal prosecutors to obtain the records of thousands of people who bought used books on Amazon .
The records were sought as part of an investigation of a Robert B. D'Angelo , a Madison city employee who is accused of underreporting his income to tax authorities and operating a private business using city resources .
The ruling was released after a federal grand jury handed down a 39 - count indictment against D'Angelo .
The customers whose records the government was seeking were not suspected of any wrongdoing .
D'Angelo is accused of selling used books and other merchandise via Amazon 's website , using city time and resources to do it , and failing to report the income to the IRS .
Prosecutors wanted to interview some of D'Angelo 's customers to help build their case .
They initially sought records from 24,000 customers , but after they encountered resistance from Amazon , they narrowed their request , seeking the records of 120 customers — 30 from each of the four years D'Angelo is alleged to have operated his business .
In a June ruling , Judge Stephen Crocker rejected the government 's demands for customers ' private information , ruling that the First Amendment gives heightened protection to records concerning the sale of expressive works .
However , he also acknowledged that the federal government had a legitimate need to contact some of D'Angelo 's customers .
He brokered a compromise in which Amazon agreed to contact a larger sample of customers asking for volunteers willing to talk to the feds .
Those who declined to volunteer would have their privacy respected .
In a striking passage of his June decision , Judge Crocker acknowledges that the government 's intentions were honorable , but nevertheless worries about the fallout that would result from a revelation that Amazon had turned over the purchasing records of thousands of book buyers .
He predicted that news of the disclosure would " spread over the Net " — transmitted by sites like Ars , perhaps — and that " the chilling effect on e-commerce would frost keyboards across America . "
In an interview published today with CNet 's Declan McCullagh , Amazon VP for litigation David Zapolsky said that Amazon receives such subpoenas roughly once per quarter , and that the company will challenge any subpoenas that involve the " compelled disclosure of customer expressive choices . "
In most cases , he said , the government will modify or withdraw their request in response to Amazon 's concerns .
More rarely , Amazon will take the case to court and let the judge decide if the order is appropriate .
Zapolsky cites two cases that have bolstered Amazon 's ability to mount First Amendment challenges to grand jury subpoenas of book - purchasing records .
In one case , the Colorado Supreme Court sided with a Denver bookstore that was fighting the compelled disclosure of one of its customers ' records .
In the other case , special prosecutor Kenneth Star unsuccessfully sought records regarding Monica Lewinsky from Kramerbooks , a popular book store and restaurant in Washington , DC .
Leopard quarantine bug
flaw has surfaced in Apple 's Leopard quarantine system that allows unsuspecting Mac users to open specially crafted files that run with nearly any application .
The quarantine system included in the latest revision of Mac OS X is designed to alert users when they attempt to open applications or disk images that arrive via Mail , Safari , or iChat .
However the safety measure fails to issue a proper warning when Mail attachments posing as pictures arrive containing a resource fork which instructs the Mac to open the file using a specific application .
A proof of concept exploit created by heiss Security -- the firm that discovered the bug -- demonstrates the flaw by printing some harmless text in a terminal window after the user clicks on an image received via email , noting that the shell script could just as easily contain commands to delete all of a user 's files .
Intego 's sample file using Apple 's Mail program appears as an attachment with a JPEG icon that will open in Preview when double clicked , but attempting to view the file with Quick Look reveals the truth about the masked shell script .
Users receiving such a file might click the attachment to view the contents , trusting Apple 's quarantine security measure to warn them about any unwanted applications received by email or other means .
" Until this bug is corrected in Mac OS X 10.5 , Mac users are at risk of receiving maliciously crafted files , pretending to be image files , which could delete all of a user 's files , or may contain Trojan horses , " Intego said .
" It is important that users do not open attachments from unknown senders , especially those that come with spam messages . "
“ In the last six years , Washington has stepped up its sales and transfers of high - technology weapons , military training , and other military assistance to governments regardless of their respect for human rights , democratic principles , or nonproliferation , ” according to a report in the current ( Jan. - Feb . )
“ Arms Control Today , ” published online by the Arms Control Association ( ACA ) .
“ All that matters is that they have pledged their assistance in the global war on terrorism . ”
You read it right .
The Bush regime has been using 9/11 as an excuse for the reckless sale of weapons around the globe , working $ 16.9 billion in new arms deals in 2006 , 41.9 percent of the world ’s total .
This compares to runners - up Russia , $ 8.7 billion , and Great Britain , $ 3.1 billion , writes Rachel Stohl , a senior analyst at the Center for Defense Information ( CDI ) , which tracks such data .
Despots once banned from getting U.S. weapons and training are being showered with both .
“ By providing military assistance with a disregard for human rights ( HR ) conditions , the U.S. is not only giving up the opportunity to use military assistance as leverage to improve ( HR conditions ) , but is also rewarding abusive governments for their unconscionable actions , ” Stohl writes .
Noting that U.S. aid is growing “ at the same time as human rights conditions are worsening , ” Stohl cites the example of Ethiopia , “ which is carrying out a brutal counterinsurgency campaign within its own borders ” and Nepal , whose security forces “ opened fire on peaceful strikers and anti-government demonstrations . ”
Bush is also funneling millions into Uzbekistan , where thousands of Muslims have been imprisoned without due process and many tortured to death .
One headline - making scandal , of course , is the $ 10 billion in taxpayer ’s money Bush has funneled to the Pakistan military since 9/11 , where General Pervez Musharraf has habitually disappeared his political foes , and recently invoked emergency rule , suspended the constitution and jailed thousands .
Bush okayed the multi-billion dollar sale to Musharraf of F - 16 jet fighters that can pack nuclear warheads , just as he okayed their sale earlier to India , escalating the capability of these long - time antagonists to inflict dreadful atrocities if they go to war .
Since 2001 , CDI has tracked skyrocketing U.S. military aid to the following 25 countries that “ have a unique role in the ‘ war on terror ’ through the strategic services they provide the U.S. ” : Armenia , Azerbaijan , Georgia , India , Nepal , Pakistan , Indonesia , Philippines , Thailand , Bahrain , Oman , Yemen , Kazakhstan , Kyrgyzstan , Tajikistan , Turkmenistan , Uzbekistan , Algeria , Chad , Mali , Mauritania , Niger , Djibouti , Ethiopia and Kenya .
CDI documented U.S. aid in foreign military , and direct commercial , sales to the 25 soared 400 % over the five years prior to 9/11 .
This despite a 2006 U.S. State Department finding of “ serious , ” “ grave , ” or “ significant ” abuses committed by them against their own citizens .
CDI summarizes , “ the U.S. is sending unprecedented levels of military assistance to countries that it simultaneously criticizes for lack of respect for human rights and , in some cases , for questionable democratic processes . ”
According to reporter Stohl , what the U.S. is billing as “ counterterrorism training ” often is nothing more than “ counterinsurgency training . ”
This results , she says , in the U.S. “ involving itself in internal conflicts around the world and is in practice encouraging countries to continue their internal struggles that predate September 11 , 2001 . ”
President Bush is just back from the Middle East where he preached the virtues of “ democracy . ”
His arms sales , though , betray his forked tongue .

The reliability of Wikipedia information has been an issue since its debut in 2001 .
2001 : Wikipedia goes online .
Doing scholarly research will never be the same again .
Wikipedia takes the principle of the wiki and applies it to the encyclopedia , hence “ Wikipedia . ”
Whether that is a felicitous marriage or not remains a subject of contention , a circular argument likely never to be completely resolved .
Wikipedia was the brainchild of Larry Sanger and Jimmy Wales .
Wales gets the credit for the open - to - all encyclopedia concept while Sanger was , " sources " say , the advocate of using a wiki to accomplish this .
As of December 2007 , there were more than 9 million Wikipedia entries in a variety of languages , more than 2 million of those in English .
Since Wikipedia entries are open to editing by anyone , and peer review is nonexistent , there is legitimate skepticism :
What if the " editor " ( or " Wikipedian , " in the site 's argot ) is a liar ?
An idiot ?
Merely incompetent ?
What if two Wikipedians disagree over an entry and begin editing , and re-editing , each other ?
Well , if that happens and you do n't cross-check the information , you 're going to screw up your term paper .
But not all Wikipedians are mountebanks and fools , despite a few conspicuous exceptions .
Wikipedia also has the advantage of being expedient , something not to be overlooked in this hyper age of " we wanted the information last week . "
As readers have no doubt noticed , I use Wikipedia as a source for this feature on occasion .
I have found it , in the main , to be reliable , but not reliable enough to depend on it as a sole source .
( Of course , you should n't be relying on a single source in our beastly profession anyway . )
Still , it 's not bad .
Here 's a litmus test : Read some entries in areas where you know you possess superior knowledge .
You 're a wombat expert ?
Check out the wombat posting and see if it squares with the hard truths as you know them to be .
And , remember , you can edit the entry as you see fit .
There 's a saying in the newspaper business : " If your mother says she loves you , check it out . "
If it applies to Mom , it applies to Wikipedia , too .

Pot compound slows breast cancer RAW STORY

This A compound found in marijuana has been shown to prevent breast cancer , according to researchers in San Francisco .
A new study finds that properties of cannabis slows breast cancer by preventing cells from taking destructive paths of growth .
" New hope for patients with aggressive breast cancer may come in the form of an isolated compound found in cannabis , researchers say .
KNTV's Marianne Favro reports . "
Excerpts from KNTV :
The study , released in the medical journal Molecular Cancer Therapeutics , discovered that the CBD compound found in cannabis can slow the activity of a gene that causes the spread of cancer cells .
Researchers announced the finding with hope that the compound could be part of a non -toxic treatment for metastatic breast cancer .
" Right now we have a limited range of options in treating aggressive forms of cancer , " said Dr. Sean McAllister , lead author of the study .
" Those treatments , such as chemotherapy , can be effective but they can also be extremely toxic and difficult for patients .
This compound offers the hope of a non -toxic therapy that could achieve the same results without any of the painful side effects . "
CBD is not like THC , found in marijuana , and can be used without the psychoactive side effects of marijuana so its use does not violate anti-drug laws , according to researchers .
Researchers remind patients that , " this is not a recommendation for people with breast cancer to smoke marijuana , " because the levels of CBD necessary for treatment are not attainable through smoking marijuana , according to researchers .

US drafting plan to allow government access to any email or Web search RAW STORY

Print This Email This National Intelligence Director Mike McConnell is drawing up plans for cyberspace spying that would make the current debate on warrantless wiretaps look like a " walk in the park , " according to an interview published in the New Yorker 's print edition today .
Debate on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance
Act will be a walk in the park compared to this ,  McConnell said .
 this is going to be a goat rope on the Hill .
My prediction is that were going to screw around with this until something horrendous happens .
The article , which profiles the 65 - year - old former admiral appointed by President George W. Bush in January 2007 to oversee all of America 's intelligence agencies , was not published on the New Yorker 's Web site .
McConnell is developing a Cyber - Security Policy , still in the draft stage , which will closely police Internet activity .
" Ed Giorgio , who is working with McConnell on the plan , said that would mean giving the government the autority to examine the content of any e-mail , file transfer or Web search , " author Lawrence Wright pens .
 Google has records that could help in a cyber - investigation , he said , " Wright adds .
" Giorgio warned me , ' We have a saying in this business :  Privacy and security are a zero- sum game . ' "
A zero -sum game is one in which gains by one side come at the expense of the other .
In other words -- McConnell 's aide believes greater security can only come at privacy 's expense .
McConnell has been an advocate for computer - network defense , which has previously not been the province of any intelligence agency .
According to a 2007 conversation in the Oval Office , McConnell told President Bush ,  If the 9/11 perpetrators had focused on a single US bank through cyber - attack and it had been successful , it would have an order of magnitude greater impact on the US economy . 
Bush turned to Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson , asking him if it was true ; Paulson said that it was .
Bush then asked to McConnell to come up with a network security strategy .
" One proposal of McConnells Cyber - Security Policy , which is still in the draft stage , is to reduce the access points between government computers and the Internet from two thousand to fifty , " Wright notes .
" He claimed that cyber - theft account for as much as a hundred billion dollars in annual losses to the American economy .
' The real problem is the perpetrator who doesnt care about stealing he just wants to destroy . ' "
The infrastructure to tap into Americans ' email and web search history may already be in place .
In November , a former technician at AT&T alleged that the telecom forwarded virtually all of its Internet traffic into a " secret room " to facilitate government spying .
Whistleblower Mark Klein said that a copy of all Internet traffic passing over AT&T lines was copied into a locked room at the company 's San Francisco office -- to which only employees with National Security Agency clearance had access -- via a cable splitting device .
" My job was to connect circuits into the splitter device which was hard - wired to the secret room , " Klein . said " And effectively , the splitter copied the entire data stream of those Internet cables into the secret room -- and we 're talking about phone conversations , email web browsing , everything that goes across the Internet . "
" As a technician , I had the engineering wiring documents , which told me how the splitter was wired to the secret room , " Klein continued .
" And so I know that whatever went across those cables was copied and the entire data stream was copied . "
According to Klein , that information included Internet activity about Americans .
" We 're talking about domestic traffic as well as international traffic , " Klein said .
Previous Bush administration claims that only international communications were being intercepted are n't accurate , he added .
" I know the physical equipment , and I know that statement is not true , " he added .
" It involves millions of communications , a lot of it domestic communications that they 're copying wholesale . "
Todd Smith , owner of the Maine Fire Equipment Company , spent Wednesday battling a conflagration of angry callers convinced that his small business was responsible for threatening them during the course of pushy credit - card solicitations .
Maine Fire Equipment
( Web site slogan : " Are you protected ? " ) does n't issue credit cards and obviously does n't need this kind of grief , which essentially prevented them from conducting business yesterday .
The company -- and hundreds if not thousands of call recipients -- were victimized by someone spoofing Maine Fire 's telephone number , a deception which in and of itself is not illegal -- at least not yet .
Not only is the Caller - ID con going unchecked and getting worse , one security expert tells me , there soon will be " another explosion of this despicable practice " thanks to , of all things , the release of a Hollywood movie .
( March 3 update : " In defense of Caller - ID spoofing . " )
Smith 's tale of woe first :
" I 'd say as of right now , we have gotten 200 phone calls from people across the nation saying I called them , threatening to turn them in to the FBI over their credit , " Smith told the Morning Sentinel of Waterville , Maine , yesterday .
" A lot of them were from the Midwest .
Lots of people from Texas and Alabama , too . "
My efforts to reach Smith to see how he 's faring on Day 2 of his misery proved difficult for the simple reason that Maine Fire Equipment has stopped answering its phone .
Instead , callers hear this plaintive recording :
" If you 're calling for fire - related business or service , please leave a message after the tone .
If you 're calling because you received a phone call originating from this number regarding a credit - card scam , we did not make that phone call ; you need to call the ( Verizon ) Unlawful Call Center .
That number is 800- 518-5507 .
Please help us put an end to these calls we 're receiving . "
After a round of phone tag , Smith and I finally connected .
" Trying to get stuff done yesterday was impossible ; we pretty much just shut down , " he says , adding that the calls from irate scam targets were coming every two minutes for at least nine hours before he decided the answering machine was their only option .
Smith says he's " certainly concerned " that the episode has cost him business and customers .
Verizon offered to change his phone number , " but we 're in a bunch of phone books that we paid a great deal of money to be in . "
I 've yet to hear back from Verizon .
Security expert Rob Douglas , who runs the Web site IDAlert.info , says the victimization of Maine Fire Equipment is by no means uncommon .
" There is no doubt that Caller ID spoofing is on the rise , " says Douglas .
" I testified against the practice in both the House and Senate in 2006 and warned Congress that the practice is growing by leaps and bounds .
The Congress in its infinite wisdom declined to pass a law against spoofing and the predictable result is that more and more companies are offering the service . "
The House has passed anti-spoofing legislation and a Senate bill was making progress at the end of last year .
In the meantime , Douglas says opportunists continue to make hay off the practice .
" Take a look at spoofcard.com and other similar firms that are openly advertising the ability to deceive recipients of calls into believing they are actually being called by someone else — due to what appears on the Caller ID , " he says .
" The technique can also be used to defeat authentication systems for banking services and voicemail . "
And we may not have seen the worst of it , thanks to Hollywood .
" There may be another explosion of this despicable practice as the movie Untraceable , about to be released , is reportedly going to demonstrate the practice of spoofing , " he says .
You can see a trailer for the movie here , and while it may appeal to fans of action thrillers , it will be unfortunate if the film romanticizes or otherwise encourages spoofing .
In the meantime , I 've changed my mind and now see the need for legislation that outlaws Caller - ID spoofing .
The conversation came about the time that Todd Smith at Maine Fire Equipment was telling me he hopes he 'll be able to turn his phone back on tomorrow -- or at least by Monday .
My solution to the localization horror story Maximizing your income as a translator » Six GoF design patterns , Python style Although it usually requires some adaptation , Python makes implementing most of the GoF design patterns trivial .
In some cases , they 're actually part of the core language ; in most of the others , they 're a lot simpler in Python than C++ et al .
Here I have implemented examples of the following common design patterns in Python : Iterator
Decorator
Abstract factory
Factory
State
Template Please see the links below for the Wiki articles describing each pattern .
For now , I 'll punt on when design patterns should be used .
Iterator Iterators are built into the Python language .
Anything that is iterable can be iterated , including dictionaries , lists , tuples , strings , streams , generators , and classes for which you implement iterator syntax .
This example shows a generator that counts by number words . " " " Implementation of the iterator pattern with a generator " " " def count_to ( count ) :
" " " Counts by word numbers , up to a maximum of five " " " numbers = [ " one " , " two " , " three " , " four " , " five " ]
# The zip keeps from counting over the limit
for number , pos in zip ( numbers , range ( count ) ) :
yield number #
Test the generator
count_to_two = lambda : count_to(2 )
count_to_five = lambda : count_to( 5 ) print " Counting to two … "
for number in count_to_two ( ) :
print number ,
print "
"
print " Counting to five … "
for number in count_to_five ( ) :
print number , Output :
one two Counting to two…one two Counting to five …
one two three four five Decorator
This one is another gimme — decorators have built - in syntax since Python 2.4 ( they 're still trivial to implement in earlier versions ) .
This example shows a time_this decorator , which measures and prints the time it takes the decorated function to run , in seconds .
import time def time_this ( func ) :
" " " The time_this decorator " " " def decorated ( * args , ** kwargs ) :
start = time .
time ( )
result = func ( *args , ** kwargs )
print " Ran in " , time . time ( ) – start , " seconds "
return result
return decorated # Decorator syntax
@time_this
def count ( until ) :
" " " Counts to ' until ' , then returns the result " " " print " Counting to " , until , " … "
num = 0

Although the built - in decorator syntax is for functions and methods , it 's also very simple to decorate classes in Python .
Here 's a simple output - stream decorator I wrote .
Abstract factory
This pattern is a lot simpler to implement than the GoF example , because there 's no need to inherit just to satisfy types .
In the example below , the PetShop class has an abstract factory as a member ( pet_factory ) .
We can configure it at runtime with the desired concrete factory .
The pet shop will then generate the appropriate pet type depending on its factory . " " " Implementation of the abstract factory pattern " " " import random class PetShop :
" " " A pet shop " " " def __init__( self , animal_factory =None ) :
" " " pet_factory is our abstract factory .
We can set it at will . " " " self.pet_factory = animal_factory def show_pet ( self ) :
" " " Creates and shows a pet using the
abstract factory " " " pet = self.pet_factory.get_pet ( )
print " This is a lovely " , pet
print " It says " , pet.speak ( )
print " It eats " , self.pet_factory.get_food ( ) #
Stuff that our factory makes class Dog :
def speak ( self ) :
return " woof "
def __str__(self ) :
return " Dog " class Cat :
def speak ( self ) :
return " meow "
def __str__(self ) :
return " Cat " # Factory classes class DogFactory :
def get_pet ( self ) :
return Dog ( )
def get_food ( self ) :
return " dog food " class CatFactory :
def get_pet ( self ) :
return Cat ( )
def get_food ( self ) :
return " cat food " # Create the proper family
def get_factory ( ) :
" " " Let 's be dynamic ! " " "
return random.choice ( [ DogFactory , CatFactory ] ) ( ) #
Show pets with various factories
shop = PetShop ( )
for i in range ( 3 ) :
shop.pet_factory = get_factory ( )
shop.show_pet ( )
print " = " * 10 Sample output :
This is a lovely Dog
It says woof
It eats dog food
==========
This is a lovely Cat
It says meow
It eats cat food
==========
This is a lovely Cat
It says meow
It eats cat food
========== Factory
We do n't need our factory products to have a common base class in order to give them a common type , but we can if we want to in order to share functionality .
In this example , we have a factory function called get_localizer , which returns the appropriate localizer class depending on the language name we pass to it .
#coding : UTF8 class JapaneseGetter :
" " " A simple localizer a la gettext " " " def __init__ ( self ) :
self.trans = dict ( dog= " 犬 " , cat= " 猫 " ) def get ( self , msgid ) :
" " " We 'll punt if we do n't have a translation " " " try :
return unicode( self.trans[msgid ] , " utf - 8 " )
except KeyError :
return unicode ( msgid ) class EnglishGetter :
" " " Simply echoes the msg ids " " "
def get ( self , msgid ) :
return unicode ( msgid ) def get_localizer ( language = " English " ) :
" " " The factory method " " " languages = dict ( English=EnglishGetter ,
Japanese=JapaneseGetter ) return languages [ language ] ( ) # Create our localizers
e , j = get_localizer ( " English " ) , get_localizer ( " Japanese " ) # Localize some text
for msgid in " dog parrot cat " .split( ) :
print e.get ( msgid ) , j.get ( msgid )
Output : dog 犬
parrot parrot
cat 猫 State
The state pattern allows us to change an object 's behavior at runtime — something that Python naturally excels at !
This example has a very simple radio .
It has an AM / FM toggle switch , and a scan button to scan to the next station . " " " Implementation of the state pattern " " " class State ( object ) :
" " " Base state .
This is to share functionality " " " def scan( self ) :
" " " Scan the dial to the next station " " "
self.pos += 1
if self .pos == len( self.stations ) :
self.pos = 0
print " Scanning … Station is " , self.stations[self.pos ] , self.name class AmState ( State ) :
def __init__ ( self , radio ) :
self.radio = radio
self.stations = [ " 1250 " , " 1380 " , " 1510 " ]
self.pos = 0
self.name = " AM " def toggle_amfm ( self ) :
print " Switching to FM "
self.radio.state = self.radio.fmstate class FmState( State ) :
def __init__ ( self , radio ) :
self.radio = radio
self.stations = [ " 81.3 " , " 89.1 " , " 103.9 " ]
self.pos = 0
self.name = " FM " def toggle_amfm ( self ) :
print " Switching to AM "
self.radio.state = self.radio.amstate class Radio( object ) :
" " " A radio .
It has a scan button , and an AM / FM toggle switch . " " " def __init__( self ) :
" " " We have an AM state and an FM state " " " self.amstate = AmState ( self )
self.fmstate = FmState ( self )
self.state = self.amstate def toggle_amfm( self ) :
self.state.toggle_amfm ( )
def scan( self ) :
self.state.scan ( ) #
Test our radio out
radio = Radio ( )
actions = [ radio.scan ] * 2 + [ radio.toggle_amfm ] + [ radio.scan ] * 2
actions = actions * 2
for action in actions :
action ( ) Output : Scanning … Station is 1380 AM
Scanning … Station is 1510 AM
Switching to FM
Scanning … Station is 89.1 FM
Scanning … Station is 103.9 FM
Scanning … Station is 81.3 FM
Scanning … Station is 89.1 FM
Switching to AM
Scanning … Station is 1250 AM
Scanning … Station is 1380 AM Template
The template pattern allows us to abstract away common parts of an algorithm .
We simply supply a template skeleton with concrete actions .
In Python , functions are first - class objects , so we can create template functions via composition rather than classes and inheritance as shown in the GoF .
In this example , we build functions that iterate over a sequence , performing some action on each element ; we fill in a skeleton function with a getter that retrieves the sequence , and an action that acts on each element . " " " An example of the Template pattern in Python " " " # Skeletons
def iter_elements ( getter , action ) :
" " " Template skeleton that iterates items " " " for element in getter ( ) :
action ( element )
print " - " * 10 def rev_elements ( getter , action ) :
" " " Template skeleton that iterates items in reverse order " " " for element in getter ( ) [ : :- 1 ] :
action ( element )
print " - " * 10 # Getters
def get_list ( ) :
return " spam eggs " . split( ) def get_lists ( ) :
return [ list ( x ) for x in " spam eggs " . split ( ) ]
# Actions
def print_item ( item ) :
print item def reverse_item ( item ) :
print item [ ::- 1 ] # Makes templates
def make_template ( skeleton , getter , action ) :
" " " Instantiate a template method with getter and action " " "
def template ( ) :
skeleton ( getter , action )
return template # Create our template functions
templates = [ make_template(s , g , a )
for g in ( get_list , get_lists )
for a in ( print_item , reverse_item )
for s in ( iter_elements , rev_elements ) ]
# Execute them
for template in templates :
template ( )
As you can see , it 's quite easy to alternate among both concrete functions and skeletons .
Output : spam
eggs

———- Conclusion
It 's fairly straightforward to adapt most of the GoF patterns to Python — and they end up a lot simpler in the bargain !
Edit : Modified abstract factory to match " classic " pattern .
Edit 2 : Implemented new iterator and state patterns .

Two recent articles in USA Today illustrate the hidden costs of the war .
The first is about an Army study that found mental issues in 25,000 troops that came back from Iraq , including “ post - traumatic stress disorder and depression to substance abuse and family conflict . ” 7,000 soldiers admitted to having a drinking problem .
The second is about police officers who come home from Iraq with symptoms of PTSD “ that law enforcement and mental health authorities fear could put their judgment and public safety at risk . ”
Americans who served in the military and those who have the misfortune of being in their family or otherwise dealing with them will be suffering from the effects of this evil war for years to come .
When will this madness end ?
Will it have to drag out as long as Vietnam did ?
CIA wooed defectors from within Iran 's nuclear ranks
The CIA launched a clandestine effort aimed at degrading Iran 's nuclear weapons capabilities by persuading key officials to defect , an effort which has had limited success but provided US intelligence agencies with information that recently concluded the Islamic state halted its weapons program in 2003 , the Los Angeles Times ' Greg Miller reports in Sunday 's [ registration - restricted ] edition .
CIA officials dubbed the program " the Brain Drain , " which was initiated in 2005 , the reports says .
" Intelligence gathered as part of that campaign provided much of the basis for a U.S. report released last week that concluded the Islamic Republic had halted its nuclear weapons work in 2003 , " Miller writes .
" Officials declined to say how much of that intelligence could be attributed to the CIA program to recruit defectors . "
Using a tactic that was a hallmark of the Cold War , the CIA aimed to pluck key scientists and military personnel working on the program from Iran .
In the past , this technique was aimed at acquiring military secrets .
With Iran , however the effort was aimed a degrading an existing nuclear program , " suggesting that U.S. officials believe Iran 's nuclear know - how is still thin enough that it can be depleted . "
Miller says the program has had " limited success , " with " fewer than six " well - placed Iranians actually defecting .
" None has been in a position to provide comprehensive information on Tehran 's nuclear program , " he added .

Yes , the former mayor is that far gone .
Remember when Rudy Giuliani made the off - the - reservation loony claim that if we were to cut taxes , we would have to fix the resulting hole in the budget by balancing it out with more tax cuts ?
Everyone assumed Giuliani had misspoken .
When he insisted he meant what he said , everyone assumed it was just gratuitous , empty pandering to the economic right .
As Avi Zenilman found out , even conservative economists are unwilling to associate themselves with this sort of lunacy .
But now it turns out Giuliani has actually proposed a tax plan that , indeed , seems to balance out tax cuts with more tax cuts .
Kevin Drum fleshes out some of the key details :
Take that , Huckabee !
You say your plan is big ?
Well , according to an expert that Townhall blogger Matt Lewis talked to , " This plan would be huge . "
How huge ?
" It would be 4 % of GDP .
By comparison , GWB tax cut was 1.3 % of GDP .
Reagan 's was 1.9 % of GDP . "
Twice the size of Reagan's !
Three times the size of Bush's !
And deficits ?
No worries .
These babies will pay for themselves !
Oh , and just in case you have n't figured this out yet , all six of Giuliani 's tax cuts are aimed at people who already have lots and lots of money .
But you knew that , right ?
Raise your hand if you 're surprised .

Free markets routinely provide us with advantages — sometimes near - miracles — that no government or non-profit organization can match .
Why , then , do some people hate free enterprise so much ?
Why are so many people so hostile to free markets ?
Markets provide miracles that we take for granted .
Clean , well - lighted supermarkets sell 30,000 products .
Starvation has largely vanished from countries where private property and economic freedom are permitted .
Free markets have rescued more people from poverty than government ever has .
And yet , when innovators propose extending this benign power , people shriek in fear .
This was clear reading The Wall Street Journal not long ago .
The “ Letters ” section led with complaints about Bob Poole ’s column on well - maintained private highways that keep traffic moving .
One writer complained that such highways exist for “ the privileged ... who can afford surprisingly large ... fees ... to drive a very boring 45 minutes around metropolitan Toronto .
Highway 407 is certainly a great success — for its bondholders . ”
Surprisingly large fees ?
Only if you are clueless about what you pay for “ free ” roads .
And why is success for the bondholders a bad thing ?
Is the writer envious ?
If the ride is boring , he does n’t need to take it .
No one forces anyone to use a private highway .
Why do so many begrudge the successes that voluntary private exchanges bring ?
That same day ’s Journal also included a story on the “ radical ” idea of kidney selling .
Why is selling an organ “ radical ” ?
Banning the sale of kidneys kills thousands of people a year .
That should be considered “ radical . ”
Today , 74,000 Americans wait for kidney transplants while enduring painful , exhausting and expensive hours hooked up to dialysis machines .
The machines are technological miracles that keep many alive , but dialysis is not nearly as good as a real kidney .
Every day , about 17 Americans die while waiting for a transplant .
Yet plenty of Americans would give up a kidney if they could just be paid for their trouble and risk .
Ruth Sparrow of St. Petersburg , Fla. , ran a newspaper ad saying : “ Kidney , runs good , $ 30,000 or best offer . ”
She told “ 20/20 ” that she got a couple of serious calls , but then the newspaper refused to run her ad again , warning her that she might be arrested .
Why is n’t someone with two healthy organs allowed to put one on the market ?
Because in 1984 , U.S. Rep. Al Gore sponsored a law making the sale of organs punishable by five years in jail .
Congress could n’t contain its enthusiasm ; the bill passed 396 to 6 .
So giving someone a kidney is a good deed , but selling the same kidney is a felony .
When I confronted Dr. Brian Pereira of the National Kidney Foundation about that , he said , “ The current system functions extremely well . ”
I asked him how the system could be working “ extremely well ” when 17 people die every day because they ca n’t get kidneys .
He said that the “ desperate ( situation ) does n’t justify an unwise policy decision . ”
The Kidney Foundation fears that poor people would be “ exploited . ”
But what gives the foundation the right to decide for poor people ?
The poor are as capable as others of deciding what trade - offs to make in life .
No one forces them to give up an organ .
To say the poor are too desperate to resist a dangerous temptation is patronizing .
But gatekeepers like Dr. Pereira say there should be “ no barter , no sale of organs .
That ’s where we have to step in . ”
When I asked him who that “ we ” is that has the right to “ step in , ” he replied , “ The government ( and ) the professional societies . ”
That conceit — that the government and “ professional societies ” must decide for all of us , and the underlying hostility toward commerce — kills people .
Money should n’t make giving up an organ suspect .
As one kidney patient told me before he died , “ The doctors make money , the hospitals make money , the organ procurement organizations make money .
Everybody gets something except for the donor ! ”
If you think it ’s immoral to sell an organ , do n’t do it .
But sick people should n’t have to die because some people despise markets .

“ I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies , foreign and domestic . … ”
— Oath of Office
“ Our mission is to educate , train , and inspire men and women to become officers of character motivated to lead the United States Air Force in service to our nation . ”

“ We will not lie , steal , or cheat . … ”
— Air Force Academy honor code
“ Military professionals must remember that religious choice is a matter of individual conscience .
Professionals , and especially commanders , must not take it upon themselves to change or coercively influence the religious views of subordinates . ”
— Religious Toleration ( Air Force Code of Ethics , 1997 )
Forty - two years ago , at the age of 18 , I took the oath of office on my first day as an Air Force Academy cadet .
The mission of the academy was not only to train future leaders for the Air Force but for America as well , because , in the end , most academy graduates do not serve full military careers .
The honor code became an integral part of everyday life .
These are the values that I , and most graduates of the 1960s and early ’ 70s , took with us from our four years at the academy .
I , as did many graduates , underwent pilot training followed by tours of duty in Vietnam .
Like military men and women of today , we did our best to become technically competent and professional leaders .
Never , during my four years at the academy and subsequent pilot and combat training , was the word warrior used ; nor , whether as a cadet or officer , did I ever encounter “ Christian supremacist ” rhetoric .
In April of 2004 , my son , after receiving a coveted appointment to the United States Air Force Academy , asked me to accompany him to the orientation for new appointees .
This 24 - hour visceral event changed my life forever , and crushed my son ’s lifelong dream of following in my footsteps .
The orientation began with a one - hour “ warrior ” rant to appointees and parents by the commandant of cadets , Brig .
Gen. Johnny Weida .
The fact that the word warrior had replaced leadership was a signal of what was to follow .
I later learned that cadets , to determine when a new record was established , had created a game in which warrior was counted in each speech Weida gave .
My son and I then made our way to the modernist aluminum chapel , where I expected to hear a welcome from one or two Air Force chaplains offering counsel , support and an open - door policy for any spiritual or pastoral needs of these future cadets .
In 1966 , the academy had six gray - haired chaplains : three mainline Protestants , two priests and one rabbi .
Any cadet , regardless of religious affiliation , was welcome to see any one of these chaplains , who were reminiscent of Father Francis Mulcahy of “ MASH ” fame .
Instead , my son ’s orientation became an opportunity for the academy to aggressively proselytize this next crop of cadets .
Maj .
Warren Watties led a group of 10 young , exclusively evangelical chaplains who stood shoulder to shoulder .
He proudly stated that half of the cadets attended Bible studies on Monday nights in the dormitories and he hoped to increase this number from those in his audience who were about to join their ranks .
This “ invitation ” was followed with hallelujahs and amens by the evangelical clergy .
I later learned from Air Force Academy chaplain MeLinda Morton , a Lutheran who was forced to observe from the choir loft , that no priest , rabbi or mainline Protestant had been permitted to participate .
I no longer recognize the Air Force Academy as the institution I attended almost four decades earlier .
At that point , I had no idea how invasive this extreme evangelical “ cancer ” had become throughout the entire military , that what I had witnessed was far from an isolated case of a few religious zealots .
In order to better understand this shift to a religious ideology at this once secular institution , I called the Academy Association of Graduates ( AOG ) .
Its response : “ We do n’t get involved in policy . ”
What I did n’t know was that the AOG , like the academy , had affiliations with James Dobson ’s and Ted Haggard ’s powerful mega-churches .
When Dobson ’s Focus on the Family “ campus ” was completed , the academy skydiving team , with great ceremony , delivered the “ keys from heaven ” to Dobson .
During some alumni reunions , the AOG arranged bus tours of Focus on the Family facilities in nearby Colorado Springs , Colo .
I also learned that the same Monday night Bible studies discussed at orientation were taught by bused - in members of these evangelical mega-churches and that some spouses of senior academy staff members were employed by these same religious institutions .
It seemed that my beloved United States Air Force Academy had morphed into the Rocky Mountain Bible College .
The academy chaplain staff had grown 300 percent while the cadet population had decreased by 25 percent : from six mainline chaplains to 18 chaplains , the additional 12 all evangelical .
The academy even gained 25 reserve chaplains , also nonexistent in earlier times , for a total of 43 chaplains for about 4,000 cadets , or one chaplain for every 100 cadets .
In the following weeks , a uniformed Army Maj. Gen. William Boykin began sharing his Christian supremacist views from church pulpits around the country , declaring that he was “ God ’s Warrior ” and that “ America is a Christian nation . ”
He demeaned the entire Muslim world by stating that his God was bigger than a Muslim warlord ’s god and that the Muslim ’s god “ was an idol . ”
He received little more than a token slap on the wrist .
At the time , Joseph Schmitz , then the Department of Defense inspector general ( Schmitz is currently the chief operating officer of Blackwater International ) , found that Boykin had committed no ethics violations .
Days later , the May 10 edition of The New Yorker featured the Abu Ghraib torture article by Seymour Hersh , who more than three decades earlier had brought us the story of My Lai .
As a late critic of the Vietnam War , in which I lost many high school and academy classmates , I was skeptical and critical of the drum beat for war orchestrated by the Bush administration .
When then - Secretary of State Colin Powell again sold his soul in front of the United Nations and the world , the die was cast .
I say again because as a major on his second tour in Vietnam , Powell whitewashed reports of the My Lai massacre and attempted to discredit and silence those few , most notably Ron Ridenhour , who had the courage to get the story into Hersh ’s hands .
These were some of my thoughts on the day my son had to decide whether or not to accept his appointment to the Air Force Academy .
It was a time in my life when fatherhood and truth were confronted with faux nationalism .
With tremendous courage and sadness my son declined his appointment and ended his dream — and my dream for him — to attend the Air Force Academy .
Though deeply saddened , we were not sorry .
In what would have been my son ’s academy summer encampment , chaplain Watties “ suggested ” that cadets return to their tents and tell their tent mates they would “ burn in hell ” if they did not receive Jesus as their savior .
At the same time , the academy commandant , Weida , made a habit of including biblical passages in official e-mails and correspondence to subordinates and cadets .
He had developed a secret “ chant and response ” with the cadets :
When he yelled “ Airpower , ” the evangelical cadets in the know would respond “ Rock , sir ” in reference to the Bible story that Jesus built his house upon a rock .
Coincidentally , at this time and at the invitation of the academy , the Yale Divinity School was observing the pastoral care program for sexual assault victims at the academy .
Under the leadership of professor Kristen Leslie , the Yale team issued a stunning report on the divisive and strident evangelical pressures by leadership and staff at the academy .
The response from academy leaders was telling .
They at first denied the reports of Watties ’ “ hell - fire ” threats .
Under media pressure , they later claimed the violations were committed by a visiting reserve chaplain , when in fact they were by the recent Air Force Chaplain of the Year himself : Watties .
In an interview after receiving his Chaplain of the Year award , Watties boasted of baptizing young soldiers in Saddam Hussein ’s swimming pool .
It is difficult to think of more inflammatory and Crusader - like behavior in an Arab nation .
In response to the Yale report , the academy demanded that chaplain Morton denounce the report she had co-signed .
When she refused , she was transferred to East Asia , ultimately resigning from the Air Force in protest .
Morton was the only officer who put her oath of office “ to support and defend the Constitution ” above careerism .
Then - DoD Inspector General Schmitz , noted for his Christian supremacist rhetoric in the book “ Blackwater , ” sent a team led by evangelical “ born again ” Lt. Gen. Roger Brady to investigate the academy .
Schmitz had recently found no ethics violations in the actions of Gen. Boykin and allowed Boykin ’s promotion to senior military officer in charge of Abu Ghraib , Guantanamo and “ extraordinary rendition . ”
The “ Brady Report ” found the academy only to have an “ insensitivity ” problem .
Air Force Academy graduate Brig .
Gen. Johnny Weida , “ silenced ” and removed from the major general promotion list , was secretly promoted with back pay the following year at Wright Patterson Air Force Base .
Following the release of the “ Brady Report , ” West Point graduate and Secretary of the Air Force Mike Wynne , ignoring the existing code of ethics , issued another “ code of ethics ” that allowed evangelical proselytizing .
A month later , in an effort to appease the religious right , Wynne issued an even softer “ code of ethics . ”
Amazingly ,
Wynne ’s document is in complete violation of the code of ethics issued in 1997 by Secretary of the Air Force Sheila Widnall prohibiting proselytizing by commanders and other officers .
The pre-existing Air Force code of ethics in The Little Blue Book states :
“ Military professionals must remember that religious choice is a matter of individual conscience .
Professionals , and especially commanders , must not take it upon themselves to change or coercively influence the religious views of subordinates . ”
Here are just a few violations of that principle over the last three years : Academy football coach Fisher DeBerry hung a banner in the team locker room reading : “ Competitor ’s Creed : I am a Christian first and last . … I am a member of Team Jesus Christ . ”
Baseball coach Mike Hutcheon , recruited from evangelical Christian Bethel College , forced players to lead team prayer during practice .
When asked about locker room prayer in March 2007 , Lt. Gen .
John Regni , the academy superintendent , responded “ we have chaplains that are attached to each of the teams and they are very important in that area . ”
In a July 12 , 2005 interview with the New York Times , Brig .
Gen. Cecil Richardson , Air Force deputy chief of chaplains , stated , “ …we reserve the right to evangelize the unchurched . ”
For over a decade , the official academy newspaper ran ads stating : “ We believe that Jesus Christ is the only real hope for the World .
If you would like to discuss Jesus , feel free to contact one of us !
There is salvation in no other name under heaven given among mortals by which we must be saved . ”
The ads were signed by 16 department heads , nine permanent professors , both the incoming and outgoing deans of faculty , the athletic director and more than 200 academy senior officers and their spouses .
Mikey Weinstein , founder of the Military Religious Freedom Foundation , in just a few short years has received complaints from more than 6,000 service members and discovered church - state violations at the academies , at military installations in Iraq and around the world , and even within the inner corridors of the Pentagon .
In 2005 , when Weinstein filed suit against the Air Force for constitutional violations of church - state separation , the House of Representatives , with little public notice , passed a chilling bill that undermines enforcement of the First Amendment ’s separation of church and state .
The Public Expression of Religion Act , H.R. 2679 , provides that attorneys who successfully challenge government actions that violate the establishment clause of the First Amendment shall not be entitled to recover attorney ’s fees .
According to The Washington Post , the purpose of this bill is to prevent suits challenging unconstitutional government actions advancing religion .
In December 2006 , the Military Religious Freedom Foundation brought media focus to the Christian Embassy Evangelical Organization and its now famous video , which clearly showed the egregious ethics and constitutional violations of several flag officers and the breadth of the problem .
Air Force Academy graduate Maj. Gen. Jack Catton , who suggested in the film that his religious beliefs trump country and his oath to the Constitution , was cited last year for sending e-mails to military subordinates and contractors advocating they vote for a particular candidate for Congress , arguing that there are “ not enough Christians in Congress . ”
West Point graduate and Army Brig .
Gen. Robert Caslen , who was filmed stating “ We are the aroma of Jesus Christ here in the Pentagon , ” is now commandant of cadets at West Point .
West Point graduate Army Brig .
Gen. Vincent Brooks , another Christian Embassy star , was the “ voice ” and “ face ” of the press conferences at Qatar .
His office is famous for the creation of the “ Rambo ” Jessica Lynch fabrications and the manipulation of the killing of Pat Tillman into a recruiting and media event .
West Point graduate and evangelical Lt. Col.
Ralph Kauzlarich , involved in the investigation of Tillman ’s death , stated publicly that Pat Tillman ’s family was not at peace with his death because they are atheists who believe their son is now “ worm dirt . ”
Air Force Academy graduate Maj. Gen. Peter Sutton , assigned as the senior U.S. military officer in Turkey at the time the Military Religious Freedom Foundation brought the Christian Embassy into media focus , was questioned by Turkish officials about his membership in a radical evangelical cult .
Many are aware of the mercenary army , Blackwater USA , led by Eric Prince , former Ambassador Cofer Black and Joseph Schmitz , the same Joseph Schmitz mentioned above .
It is here where the ties become complex and suggestive of an even grander “ crusade . ”
As described by Jeremy Scahill in his book “ Blackwater , ” Prince , who attended the U.S. Naval Academy , comes from a wealthy theo - con family , is a “ neo- crusader , ” and a Christian supremacist .
He has been given billions of dollars in federal contracts to create a private army .
COO Schmitz , another Naval Academy graduate , is a member of the Order of Malta , a Christian supremacist organization dating back to the Crusades , and happens to be married to the sister of Jeb Bush ’s wife , Columba .
And Cofer Black , former coordinator for counterterrorism at the U.S. State Department and former director of the CIA ’s Counterterrorism Center , who was quoted by the BBC as saying “ Capture Bin Laden , kill him and bring his head back in a box on dry ice , ” brings his own skill set to the Blackwater team as vice chairman .
The Christian supremacist fascism first reported at the Air Force Academy is endemic throughout the military .
From the top down , there has been a complete repudiation of constitutional values and time - honored codes of ethics and honor codes in favor of religious ideology .
And we now have a revolving door between Blackwater USA , which is Bush ’s Praetorian Guard , and the U.S. military at every level .
The citizen - soldier military dictated by our founding fathers has been replaced with professional and mercenary right - wing Christian crusaders in control of the world ’s most powerful military .
The risks to our democratic form of government cannot be overstated .
This evangelical Christian supremacist fascism within our military and government is a cancer .
Officers , especially commanders , who violate the original code of ethics , must be rooted out of the military .
The undermining of the Constitution , especially by senior military officers , must end .
As I look back at my 30 years as an active - duty officer , two combat tours in Vietnam , decorations including air medals and the Distinguished Flying Cross , I realize that not once was my service in support or defense of the Constitution .
For the very first time , I am upholding my oath of office .

Only 31 % of respondents could say the First Commandment
The poll of more than 1,000 people found that only 31 % could recite the First Commandment .
The survey was carried out on behalf of the Iona Institute , the Evangelical Alliance of Ireland and Evangelical Alliance Northern Ireland .
It showed that just one in eight respondents knew the name for changing of bread and wine into the body and blood of Christ at Mass as transubstantiation .
Stephen Cave of Evangelical Alliance Northern Ireland said the results " throw serious doubt on the claim that we are a Christian country " .
" Overall the figures are not good but the drop in knowledge , almost halved within a generation , indicates that the Christian faith is becoming less meaningful to those under 25 years of age . "
POLL FINDINGS
Only 42 % of NI respondents can say there are four Gospels Only 54 % of respondents can name the Holy Trinity Just 60 % of respondents can name the first book of the Bible Only 31 % of respondents could say the First Commandment Only 31 % of respondents could identify Martin Luther as the man who started the Reformation Just 21 % of NI respondents aged 16 - 24 could say there are four Gospels versus 54 % of the over 65 s
David Quinn of the Iona Institute said it was " likely that many people will find the Northern Ireland results surprising in that the general impression is that the north is more religious than the south " .
" As with the poll conducted in the south , we find that levels of religious knowledge in the north are very low , especially among young people .
It shows that knowledge of Christianity , both north and south , is disappearing from general knowledge , " he said .
Sean Mullan of the Evangelical Alliance said the survey " again shows that the notion of Ireland , both north and south , being a Christian culture is becoming a thing of the past " .
" The notion that Christianity can be transmitted through the culture from one generation to the next is clearly no longer valid .
These findings present a challenge to all those who believe that the message of Jesus Christ needs to be heard in Irish society . "
The poll is based on a sample of 1,018 people and was conducted with face - to - face interviews in October .

Leaves on the line , cancelled planes and interminable traffic jams have all become part of the British psyche but our public transport woes are nothing compared to the astonishing crisis gripping China .
After weeks of blizzards and ice storms , the rail network has come crashing to a halt in spectacular style .

Such is the extent of the chaos that police and soldiers have been called in to deal with a staggering 200,000 travellers waiting for a train .
The swelling crowds , who are mainly migrant factory workers have filled up a huge plaza in front of the main station in Guangzhou , China .
They eventually spilled out into a busy thoroughfare that had to be closed to give people space to camp out while they waited .

What is even more extraordinary is that the legions of commuters have now been told it will be over a week before tickets go back on sale on February 7 .
The date is the start of Chinese New Year - the nation 's biggest annual holiday .
Today , officials were scrambling to control the crowds and find temporary shelter for the migrant workers in schools and convention centers .
Police blew whistles and barked orders into bull horns as they tried to restore order while soldiers stood guard at key spots around the station .

There was a threat protests or worse could be sparked by the workers , who already have a long list of grievances , such as rising living costs , poor working conditions and low salaries that often go unpaid .
But so far , the scene in Guangzhou , which rarely sees snow , was relatively calm .
Many of the workers were stoic or cheerful , accustomed to huge crowds , discomforts and long delays that are common in the lives of China 's impoverished classes .
In more bad news , the chaos is likely to get worse as forecasters warned that new snowstorms and freezing rain could soon hit central and eastern China , putting more pressure on already strained transport , communications and power grids .

The freakish weather has already affected 67 million people since sleet and snow storms began wrecking havoc two weeks ago .
Freak conditions snapped power lines for scores of electric passenger trains in neighboring Hunan province - a midpoint for the busy rail line that runs from Guangzhou to Beijing .
The ice storms also closed highways , and 24 deaths have been reported since the heavy snow began on January 24 .
But despite the extreme conditions , people seem to remain upbeat .
One young mother who would give only her surname , Yang , spent the night on the street in front of the train station with her 7 - month - old daughter .
The ground around her was littered with chicken bones , sunflower seed shells and cigarette butts .
Yang said her morning train was canceled , and she thought her only option was to cancel her holiday visit with her family in neighboring Jiangxi province .
She said she would probably spend the holiday in her small apartment in nearby Foshan city , where she works in a factory that makes digital cameras .
" There 's no reason to get upset about this or blame anyone , " Yang said .
" It 's just the weather 's fault . "
New Political Patterns
I have been doing a social network analysis of the purchase patterns of political books since 2003 .
A quick analysis of Amazon 's sales data of political books gives us a highly similar analysis to that of political pollsters & pundits .
We will review how the political book maps changed during 2008 as the U.S. presidential election approached .
October 2008
As both presidential campaigns sprint toward the finish line I took one more look at the political books purchased in October 2008 and the patterns they created .
The arrows in the network map above show which books were " also bought " together .
A-->B shows that customers who bought A , also bought B .
We see a few surprising patterns in the this pre-election map .
unlike in previous maps , there are no bridging books between the red and blue clusters -- the two parties are totally separated !
This reflects the immense polarization and animosity we currently see in campaign rallies on both sides .

those buying positive books about Obama , are not buying other political books .
Are they interested in the candidate , but not politics in general ?
August 2008
During August we see several anti-Obama books appear .
A new pro-Obama book , written by Barrack himself , is also in pre-release and being purchased on Amazon .
Who is reading these books ?
The pro-Obama book -- Change We Can Believe
In -- is solidly in the blue cluster .
People that already support Obama are reading this positive book .
The anti-Obama books -- The Obama Nation and The Case against Barack Obama are mostly being read by people who are already against Obama .
One of the anti-Obama books is connected to one of the purple books -- The The Late Great USA .
Could some undecided voters be reading this to make up their mind on Obama ?
What is interesting is that no books on McCain , neith pro nor con , were in the best seller data .
Do people already know him ,
or are they not interested ?
Based on the pattern of connections between the books in the map above , the most influential political books at the end of the summer 2008 are : What Happened and The Post American World -- neither addresses the current election !
June 2008
After the major party candidates have been selected via the long primary season , we again probe the predictive patterns of partisan political polemics .
Obama says we are one nation -- not divided into blue and red .
McCain proclaims his purple " maverick " roots [ purple is mix of blue and red ] .
What does the book data tell us ?
Two books are connected if Amazon reports that they were frequently bought together by the same consumer .
I do n't arrange , nor color the nodes before feeding the also - bought data through the InFlow software .
The software has an algorithm that arranges the layout of the nodes based on each node 's connections , both direct and indirect .
Once the software finds the emergent pattern , and any clusters , I review the books in those groups and then see whether they naturally cluster as blue , red or purple .
This diagram adds a new color -- light blue .
Why ?
According to the Amazon sales figures , these books definitely cluster with the blues .
But , looking at the titles and authors , they do not fit the common blue themes and supporters .
Popular conservatives , independents and libertarians are all finding more connection with the blues than with the reds .
The reds only have George Will bridging them to the rest of the US political world .
We are seeing the split on the Right between the " old conservatives " and the " neo-cons " -- with the old conservatives more aligned with the progressives than with the neo-cons in the summer of 2008 .
Previous Years
In our 2003 network analysis we saw just one book holding the red and blue clusters together .
Ironically , that book was named " What Went Wrong .
In 2004 , several books held the two clusters together .
The 2004 network analysis was published in the New York Times .
Here is my original article on mapping networks of books .

PHILADELPHIA , Pennsylvania ( CNN ) --
Alice Mills signed her lease in February , thinking she would have a nice place to stay for the next year , until she could make her way into a senior citizens ' community .
Alice Mills thought this lease would let her live in her rental house for a year .
Because of foreclosure , it wo n't .
The corner house she found in northeast Philadelphia was small , but it was enough for the 67 - year - old great - great - grandmother who lives by herself .
Then in July , Mills got a rude surprise when she came home from a hospital stay to find a sheriff 's notice on the door , saying the house had been foreclosed and she must call about being evicted .
Mills says her landlord told her not to worry because he would " take care of it , " so she ignored other letters and notices that came to the apartment .
Not until a sheriff 's deputy showed up on November 13 did Mills take the eviction notices seriously .
He told her she had to be out of the house the next day .
Mills is one of a growing number of renters who are being caught up in the nation 's foreclosure crisis .
According to RealtyTrac , a company that tracks foreclosures across the country , 1,785,596 foreclosures have been filed nationwide so far this year , a dramatic increase over a year ago .
RealtyTrac say October foreclosures this year were up 94 percent over last October .
In most states , when a bank forecloses on a landlord , the tenant has no guarantee of being allowed to stay in the property .
In addition , neither the bank nor the landlord has any legal obligation to inform the tenant of the foreclosure .
Often , the renter first learns of the foreclosure when he or she is being told to vacate the property within a few days or weeks .
Watch Mills ' struggle to find a place to live »
No one can say how many tenants are finding themselves in this situation , according to Judith Liben , an attorney with the Massachusetts Law Reform Institute .
She has been studying this issue and says it 's happening in both poor and middle - class neighborhoods .
" It 's a significant problem all around the country , in cities , in suburbs and in fact in some rural areas , " Liben says .
Higher - end neighborhoods have n't been affected as much because they have not experienced foreclosure problems to the same extent as lower - and middle - class neighborhoods .
With such short notice , people living on a fixed income -- like Mills -- can have trouble finding new living arrangements , and the situation can be taxing financially .
Besides the need to come up with a security deposit for a new rental house or apartment , tenants may never recoup their security deposit from the foreclosed landlord .
Do n't Miss CNN / Money : Mortgage Meltdown 2007
Often people have continued to pay rent to a landlord even though that landlord no longer owns the dwelling .
Lenders sometimes offer an incentive to tenants called " cash for keys , " in which they give the tenant money if they 'll move out within a certain period of time , but Liben is skeptical .
" These offers are usually useless .
They are just small change that does n't help with the problem at all and does n't help the renter who is forced quickly out into a market that they have to navigate at their own peril , " says Liben .
A bill that passed the U.S. House of Representatives in November may help renters in this situation .
It would give tenants who must leave the property because of a foreclosure , and who have leases , up to six months to vacate after being told of the foreclosure .
However , that bill would not become law until sometime next year at the earliest , if it becomes law at all .
Lenders are opposed to a law that would force them to become landlords .
The Mortgage Bankers Association , an industry group , says in a statement to CNN that " it really is unfortunate that a renter , who is essentially blameless in the whole process , faces eviction if their landlord is foreclosed upon .
However , forcing new requirements on lenders would be extremely burdensome as most lenders have neither the knowledge nor ability to be effective long - term landlords . "
Even if a national law is passed , it wo n't come soon enough for Alice Mills .
Working through a community housing organization , the Housing Association of Delaware Valley , Mills was given several more weeks to stay in the house .
She now has until December 9 to leave , but so far has nowhere to go .
She is distraught .
" I need a longer time to get a place , a decent place , a safe place , " she says , wiping tears from her eyes .
" I really need longer . "
Unfortunately for her -- and many other renters across the nation -- time may be running out .

PENACOOK , N.H. –
In a shift from her failed campaign strategy in Iowa , Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton dispensed with her stump speech at her first campaign event here Saturday morning and threw open the floor for questions .
The first one was from a young woman who said that , just earlier , she was asked by Fox News ’s Bill O’Reilly about Mrs. Clinton ’s plan on Iraq .
Mr. O’Reilly was standing close by himself .
“ Oh hi Bill ! ” Mrs. Clinton said .
“ We , this question is for you , ” she added to the young woman , “ and Bill O’Reilly ! ”
She went on to share her ideas for Iraq , such as swiftly withdrawing troops within her first 60 days and insuring that returning wound soldiers had quality health care .
In her opening remarks , Mrs. Clinton focused on the economy , warning that the nation may be slipping into a recession and proposing an “ economic action plan ” that included tax relief for middle - class families and aid to people facing home foreclosures .
“ Yesterday we had some unfavorable economic news – we saw the unemployment rate going up , and we saw the worst three days in the American stock market to begin a year since 1932 , ” Mrs. Clinton said .
She called for a moratorium on home foreclosures and more assistance for families dealing with winter costs such as higher heating bills .
She also said “ we need to take a hard look at how we get more tax relief to the to middle class families ” – Mrs. Clinton has proposed continuing tax cuts for middle - income earners and raising taxes on people earning $ 200,000 or more .
About 400 people filled the Merrimack Valley High School gymnasium and scores more stood in line outside .
Mrs. Clinton interrupted her opening remarks several times by asking the fire marshal to let more people in to fill empty seats .
“ See , I am a problem - solver , I ’ve been telling you that through this whole campaign , ” Mrs. Clinton said .
“ Big challenges , real solutions , right ? ”
About 150 more hundred people streamed in , with more waiting outside .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
The AIDS virus invaded the United States in about 1969 from Haiti , carried most likely by a single infected immigrant who set the stage for it to sweep the world in a tragic epidemic , scientists said on Monday .

Michael Worobey , a University of Arizona evolutionary biologist , said the 1969 U.S. entry date is earlier than some experts had believed .
The timeline laid out in the study led by Worobey indicates that HIV infections were occurring in the United States for roughly 12 years before AIDS was first recognized by scientists as a disease in 1981 .
Many people had died by that point .
“ It is somehow chilling to know it was probably circulating for so long under our noses , ” Worobey said in a telephone interview .
The researchers conducted a genetic analysis of stored blood samples from early AIDS patients to determine when the human immunodeficiency virus first entered the United States .
They found that HIV was brought to Haiti by an infected person from central Africa in about 1966 , which matches earlier estimates , and then came to the United States in about 1969 .
The researchers think an unknown single infected Haitian immigrant arrived in a large city like Miami or New York , and the virus circulated for years -- first in the U.S. population and then to other nations .
It can take several years after infection for a person to develop AIDS , a disease that ravages the immune system .
DISEASE MULTIPLIES
“ That one infection would have become two , and then it doubles again and the two becomes four , ” Worobey said .
“ So you have a period -- probably a fair number of years -- where you ’re dealing with probably fewer than a hundred people who are infected .
“ And then , as with epidemic expansion , at some point the hundred becomes 200 , you start getting into thousands , tens of thousands .
And then quite rapidly you can be up into the hundreds of thousands of infections that were probably already there before AIDS was recognized in the early 1980s . ”
The study was published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
The path the virus traveled as it jumped from nation to nation has long been debated by scientists .
The University of Miami’s Dr. Arthur Pitchenik , a co-author of the study , had seen Haitian immigrants in Miami as early as 1979 with a mystery illness that turned out to be AIDS .
He knew the government long had stored some of their blood samples .
The researchers analyzed samples from five of these Haitian immigrants dating from 1982 and 1983 .
They also looked at genetic data from 117 more early AIDS patients from around the world .
This genetic analysis allowed the scientists to calibrate the molecular clock of the strain of HIV that has spread most widely , and calculated when it arrived first in Haiti from Africa and then in the United States .
The researchers virtually ruled out the possibility that HIV had come directly to the United States from Africa , setting a 99.8 percent probability that Haiti was the steppingstone .
“ I think that it gives us more clear insight into the history of it ( the AIDS epidemic ) and what path the virus took -- and hard objective evidence , not just armchair thinking , ” Pitchenik said in a telephone interview .
Studies suggest the virus first entered the human population in about 1930 in central Africa , probably when people slaughtered infected chimpanzees for meat .
AIDS has killed more than 25 million people and about 40 million others are infected with HIV .
The most popular cryptographic software for Windows is probably TrueCrypt .
In this article I will explain how TrueCrypt works and as a by - product a working Python implementation will be provided .
This article is written from a programmer perspective and the math will be kept to the minimum .
The emphasis is on how TrueCrypt uses cryptographic primitives such as AES and SHA - 1 , not how the primitives themselves work .
It should be noted this article was written with the current ( as of writing ) TrueCrypt 4.3 specification in mind , which has deprecated several cryptographic algorithms and modes of operation , although they are still in the program for compatibility reasons .
This article will only describe the non-deprecated features namely AES , Serpent , Twofish and the LRW mode of operation .
If you have an old TrueCrypt volume that uses for example Blowfish and CBC mode , you wo n’t learn how to read it in this article .
Before we get into the nitty - gritty details of TrueCrypt there are some basic things we must understand .
If we remove the cryptographic part of TrueCrypt the only thing the software does is mount file systems , exactly like the program ‘ mount ’ on unixes and ‘ daemon - tools ’ ( which can mount the CD and DVD file systems ) on Windows .
If we take an encrypted TrueCrypt - container and decrypt it , we ’re left with a file system .
What we are going to do is take a TrueCrypt volume , we can call the file volume.tc , and decrypt this to a file system , say volume .
fat32 .
We can then use user - level file system tools to extract files from the file system , just like we work with zip / tar archives .
This is not very user friendly , but perfectly adequate since we are only interested in the cryptographic part of the program , not the win32 - driver that does the mounting or the graphical user interface .
If you remove every part of TrueCrypt except the part that does the encryption and decryption , TrueCrypt is very easy to understand .
Preparations
In this article we are using the Python programming language .
The good news is Python actually provides the SHA - 1 algorithm in the standard library , and SHA - 1 is one of the cryptographic primitives required to read a TrueCrypt volume .
The bad news is we do n’t have Rijndael aka AES , Serpent ( a cryptographic algorithm like AES ) , Twofish ( another cryptographic algorithm like AES ) , RIPEMD - 160 ( a hash similar to SHA - 1 ) or Whirlpool ( an advanced hash algorithm ) .
Fortunately for us , there are many third party Python modules with this functionality , such as the Python bindings for mcrypt or the Python Cryptographic Toolkit .
It is also fairly straightforward to create modules from C code using Pyrex .
However , for the sake if portability and simplicity , I have provided some pure Python implementations of all the cryptographic algorithms needed .
These implementations are converted directly from the C code and are thus very ugly Python , but the code works although it ’s slow .
Code : serpent.py , twofish.py , rijndael.py , ripemd.py , whirlpool.py
The three ciphers have the same interface and should be easy to work with .
The two hashes have the same interface as the sha and md5 module .
>>> from serpent import * >>> cipher = Serpent ( ) >>> cipher .
set_key ( ' a ' * 32 ) >>> cipher .
encrypt ( '01234567abcdefgh ' ) ' \xc0 oN \xef w \\\xa8\x06 GQG [ \xcc\x94\x0e 1 ' >>> cipher .
decrypt ( _ ) ' 01234567abcdefgh '
Please note that the cryptographic primitives above are not really part of this article .
For the rest of this article I will simply assume the ciphers and hashes with the interfaces described are available .
As mentioned previously , this article wo n’t explain how the five primitives works , just how TrueCrypt uses them .
To try the code in the article it is very useful to have a TrueCrypt volume ready .
I strongly recommend against using your production volumes with all your secret files , mainly because your password may end up in log files or swap files .
Here are some recommendations when you create the new volume .
One .
Select a small size , a few MB or so .
A small volume is easier to work with .
Two .
Use a FAT file system .
The FAT file system is much easier to read for humans than NTFS .
Three .
Select the SHA - 1 hash .
While RIPEMD - 160 and Whirlpool works perfectly well , the SHA - 1 code is much faster because it ’s not implemented in pure Python like the other two .
Four .
Do n’t forget to add some files to your volume !
I suggest text files , which are very easy to read .
Once you have code for the cryptographic primitives and a working TrueCrypt volume , we can proceed .
High - level overview
You have a TrueCrypt volume and you want to decrypt it .
The only thing you have at your disposal is the correct password and a programming language .
Here is a high - level overview of what must be done .
For now we will ignore hidden volumes .
Those will be dealt with later .
Step 1 .
The password you chose when you created the TrueCrypt volume is not actually used directly , but indirectly .
Using a so - called key strengthening algorithm , we use the password and some additional data to generate new better passwords ( the correct terminology is keys ) .
These keys will be needed later .
The idea of key strengthening is to perform lots of time - consuming transformations on the initial password to make brute force attacks more difficult .
Step 2 .
Using the keys generated , the volume header will be decrypted .
The volume header is the first few bytes of the TrueCrypt volume file and it contains information needed to decrypt the rest of the volume .
The volume header also contains useful ancillary data such as time stamps .
Step 3 .
If Step 2 was successful , we now have at our disposal all the keys necessary to decrypt the actual file system .
These three steps are somewhat simplified since we do n’t know which cryptographic algorithm is the correct one ( when a TrueCrypt volume is created we can select between several , including chains of algorithms ) .
We will deal with this later .
Key Strengthening
Do you remember when you created your last TrueCrypt volume ?
One of the steps required when creating the volume is you have to choose a hash algorithm , one of SHA - 1 , RIPEMD - 160 and Whirlpool .
This algorithm is used for the key strengthening .
But I ’m getting ahead of myself here .
As mentioned previously , key strengthening is the conceptual method of creating strong key (s ) from a weak key .
There are many methods to do this .
A very simple method is to hash the key thousands of times .
Consider for example the following Python code .
import sha def strengthen ( key ) : for i in xrange ( 50000 ) : key = sha .
new ( key ) . digest ( ) return key >>> strengthen ( " password " ) '+ \xde F \xb4\xd9\xb6\xf3\x1f\xde\xb9 !* \xe6 \xec\xa2 K \xac ! \xbb v'
An attacker armed with a dictionary will soon be discouraged because for each password he tries he has to perform several thousand additional computations .
If the attacker has a list of 2000 potential passwords , he has to perform 2000 * 50000 SHA - 1 computations if we are using the example above !
Notice there is no way to parallelize our strengthening algorithm .
This is by design .
As a clever by - product most key strengthening algorithms can also be used to derive several keys from one key .
Lets say you already have a 128 bytes long key .
In that case you can create several shorter keys by splitting it , for example into four 32 bytes long keys .
But what if your key is short ?
Instead of repeatedly hashing the output as above , we can for example concatenate the output to the input and thus create a very long stream of bytes , which can be used to create several keys of various lengths .
The important thing to realize is by some small modification to the strengthen routine we can return a key much longer than 20 bytes , which can be split into several keys , if needed .
import sha def strengthen ( key ) : for i in xrange ( 50000 ) : key += sha .
new ( key ) . digest ( ) if len ( key ) >= 128 : key = key [ - 128 :] return key >>> strengthen ( " password " ) ' \xab $ \xa1\x83 l \xba\xa6 Y \x94 wi \x00\xe1 1 \x96 I \xb1\xc7\x84\x14\xcd ' ' \x8 f o \x97\xd6 4 \xaf w \xd0 ?

A \xb0\xc3 J '
TrueCrypt uses an advanced key strengthening algorithm known as PBKDF2 , described in RFC 2898 .
It is not completely necessary for us to understand how PBKDF2 works ; it is a cryptographic primitive like AES and SHA - 1 .
We only have to know how to use it .
The function PBKDF2 takes as arguments a hash - function , a password , a salt , an iteration count and a desired length of the output .
( Note that the hash function is not the function directly but a HMAC version .
This does n’t change anything for us since it ’s just another cryptographic primitive well understood ) .
Here ’s an example :
>>> PBKDF2 ( HMAC_RIPEMD160 , " password " , " \x12\x34\x56\x78 " , 5 , 4 ) ' \x7a\x3d\x7c\x03 '
The first argument is the HMAC version of the RIPEMD - 160 hash algorithm .
The second argument is our password .
The third argument is the salt .
A salt is a randomly generated value , more about the salt later .
The fourth argument is the iteration count .
In this case we have selected 5 iterations , but more is better ( but slower ) .
This is basically the same thing as the 50000 iterations in our simple example above .
The fifth argument is the desired length of the output .
As seen , the output is 4 bytes long .
With our new acquaintance the cryptographic primitive PBKDF2 we can proceed .
For each hash algorithm TrueCrypt uses we are now going to generate a 128 bytes long key .
This key is needed later .
We already know the password ; after all we created the TrueCrypt volume .
The iteration count is part of the TrueCrypt specification and is 2000 for SHA1 , 2000 for RIPEMD - 160 and 1000 for Whirlpool ( because Whirlpool is more advanced and computationally heavy than the two others ) .
Why generate a 128 byte long key and not a shorter or longer one ?
We only need 128 bytes , which we will see in the next step .
What then is the salt ?
Now we can finally start working with the actual TrueCrypt volume file .
The salt is the 64 bytes at the beginning of the volume file .
Open the TrueCrypt volume , read the first 64 bytes ( do n’t forget to read the file in binary mode ) and we have the salt .
Notice that the salt is not encrypted and it does n’t need to be !
Intuitively this does n’t make any sense but it will become clear later in the article .
It should be noted that we are not supposed to know which of the three hash algorithms was used when the volume was created .
We simply create three 128 bytes keys , one for each of SHA - 1 , RIPEMD - 160 and Whirlpool , and find the correct key in the next step by trial - and - error ( assuming , of course , we used the correct password ) .
With that said , the only thing we have to do before proceeding to the next step is get the salt and generate the three keys .

Decrypting the header
The good news is : from here on everything will be relatively easy .
None of the hash algorithms are used after we have created the keys , and no new keys will be generated .
Once we have the three 128 byte keys from the previous step we can forget everything about hash algorithms , key strengthening , Whirlpool , HMACs , PBKDF2 and what not .
The bad news is this part is heavy on theory .
In this step we have to work very closely with the TrueCrypt volume file .
More specifically , we have to work very closely with the first 512 bytes of the TrueCrypt volume file .
Open your TrueCrypt volume , read the first 512 bytes , and forget about the volume file because this is the only thing we need for now .
If you remember the previous step , the first 64 bytes of the volume file is the salt .
We do n’t need the salt , so we can discard it .
So what we are actually interested in is the 448 bytes from byte 64 to byte 512 .
>>> data = file ( " volume.rc " , " rb " ) . read ( 512 ) >>> header = data [ 64 : 512 ] >>> len ( header ) 448
So , just to remind us , we now have a 448 bytes long encrypted header and three 128 bytes long keys .
We are going to use one of the keys to decrypt the header .
How do we know we are successful ?
Fortunately for us , the decrypted header begins with the magic bytes ‘ TRUE ’ .
So if we use one of our keys , decrypt the header with it and find that the first four bytes are ‘ TRUE ’ , we have probably provided the correct password to the key strengthening algorithm .
To make sure we have the correct password and the magic bytes were not just a coincidence , there are some additional data in the header we can use to verify the correctness of the header .
This is not important now .
So what to do ?
Simple , you say : Just try the three keys in each cryptographic algorithm and see if the magic bytes are what we ’re looking for when decrypting the header .
Not so fast .
TrueCrypt does n’t use the cryptographic algorithm directly on the data .
This is why :
All the cryptographic algorithms we are using are so called block ciphers .
They encrypt and decrypt blocks that are a certain number of bytes large .
Let ’s say the block size is 16 bytes .
This means the cipher can only encrypt and decrypt data of length 16 .
If we have a large block of data we split it into 16 bytes long blocks and encrypt / decrypt them separately .
Here is the problem .
What if two blocks contains the exact same data , for example file headers ?
Then the encrypted blocks will look exactly the same for an attacker looking at the cipher text ( that is , the TrueCrypt volume file ) .
This is highly undesirable , especially for such large files as file systems where there ’s plenty of room for redundant information .
If each block in the volume was decrypted separately with the same key an attacker would easily be able to guess the contents of the volume , based on the regularities alone .
Enter cryptographic modes .
A cryptographic mode is a “ scheme ” how data should be encrypted and decrypted to remove weaknesses , such as the weakness we have described .
A very simple cryptographic mode works like this :
Fill the first block , block 0 , with random bytes .
The remaining blocks should contain the actual data .
However before encrypting block one , XOR the data with the random bytes from block 0 .
Before encrypting block two , XOR the data with the encrypted data from block one , and so on .
As each block is “ chained ” to the previous block , the cipher text will not look the same for two blocks with the same plain text .
As with the salt in the previous steps , the random bytes do n’t have to be encrypted .
Using the common cryptographic notation , this mode can be described as :
C i = E K1 ( C i - 1 xor P i )
Where C i is the cipher text , E is the encryption algorithm , K1 is the key , C i- 1 is the previous cipher text block and P i is the plain text .
The mode described above is a simple form of the so - called CBC - mode , where CBC stands for Cipher Block Chaining .
For the untrained eye CBC - mode seems plausible and useful but in fact it has many non-obvious weaknesses .
For this reason , a new mode was designed .
This is known as the LRW - mode from the authors Liskov , Rivest ( the guy who designed MD5 ) , Wagner , and it ’s the mode TrueCrypt use .
The LRW - mode is one of the few cryptographic primitives very useful to understand how it works to better understand TrueCrypt .
With the same notation as above , we can completely describe the LRW mode :
C i = E K1 ( P i xor ( K2 mul i ) ) xor ( K2 mul i )
If you understood the notation describing CBC above it should not be too difficult to understand the description of LRW .
There are three problems .
First of all , K2 is a second key , we can call this the LRW key .
This LRW key is actually part of the 128 bytes long key we generated in the previous step , exactly like the cipher key K1 .
We know both K1 and K2 .
Second , the above mode mentions i.
What is i ?
It ’s just the block index , that is the index of the block P i .
Now , unfortunately , comes the abstract algebra .
In the description above , mul means multiplication in the Galois field GF ( 2128 ) .
This is the mathematician ’s way of describing a kind of advanced bit hacking operation .
Addition and subtraction in GF ( 2n ) is the same thing as our old friend xor .
In fact , the formal definition of LRW does n’t “ xor ” , it “ performs addition in GF ( 2n ) ” .
( Note that n can be something other than 128 , but it is 128 for the ciphers in this article . )
I will not describe exactly how this kind of multiplication is performed , I will just refer to the following Wikipedia article : Wikipedia : Finite File Arithmetic and give these encouraging words : if you can multiply large numbers with a pen and paper like you learned in elementary school , you can perform a multiplication in GF ( 2128 ) .
We can now write some code !
First of all we have to write a short module for arithmetic in the Galois fields GF ( 2n ) , because we need to do this where n=128 for the LRW mode and the ciphers TrueCrypt uses .
There are many clever ways to quickly multiply numbers in this field but I will for simplicity go for a schoolbook implementation , it ’s less than 100 lines .
For example :
def gf2n_mul ( a , b , mod ) : " " " Multiplication in GF ( 2^n ) . " " " pass def gf2 pow128 mul ( a , b ) : " " " Multiplication in GF ( 2^128 ) . " " " return gf2n_mul ( a , b , mod128 ) >>> gf2pow128mul ( 0 xb9623d587488039f1486b2d8d9283453 , 0 xa06aea0265e84b8a ) 0 xfead2ebe0998a3da7968b8c2f6dfcbd2
Code : gf2n.py .
Using the module we just wrote , we can now write some code for the LRW mode .
The main function will look like this ( see lrw.py for the actual implementation , it 's just in code what we explained above ) :
def LRW ( cipherfunc , lrwkey , i , block ) : pass
Where cipherfunc is a cryptographic function initialized with a key ( K1 ) that performs either encryption or decryption , lrwkey is the LRW key K2 , i is the block index and block is the block of plain text or cipher text , depending on whether we want to encrypt or decrypt some data .
The informed reader will notice a multiplication in our Galois field will at most output 16 bytes .
This means the length of the block must be 16 , or a multiple of 16 .
A helper function LRWMany will be provided which simply splits the block into 16 byte blocks and calls the LRW function for each block .
def LRWMany ( cipherfunc , lrwkey , i , blocks ) : length = len ( blocks ) assert length % 16 == 0 data = '' for b in xrange ( length / 16 ) : data += LRW ( cipherfunc , lrwkey , i + b , blocks [ 0 : 16 ] ) blocks = blocks [ 16 :] return data
Code : lrw.py .
Requires gf2n .
We can now finally decrypt the TrueCrypt volume header .
Remember the 128 bytes long key ?
The first 16 bytes of the key is the LRW key .
The bytes from 32 to 128 are keys for the cryptographic algorithms themselves .
More precisely byte 32 - 64 is cipher key 1 , byte 64 - 96 is cipher key 2 and byte 96 - 128 is cipher key 3 .
For TrueCrypt volumes using multiple cascaded ciphers two , or all three , cipher keys are used .
For volumes using a single cipher only the first key is used .
In Python :
lrwkey = key [ 0 : 16 ] key1 = key [ 32 : 64 ] key2 = key [ 64 : 96 ] key3 = key [ 96 : 128 ]
Let us for a short moment ignore cascaded ciphers and say we have a TrueCrypt volume using the Twofish algorithm .
To decrypt the header we simply do the following :
>>> cipher = Twofish ( ) >>> cipher .
set_key ( key1 ) >>> decryptedheader = LRWMany ( cipher .
decrypt , lrwkey , 1 , header )
Where header is the 448 byte header and 1 is the block index .
The header has block index 1 .
Here ’s an example how the header may look like before and after decrypting it .

As we can see , the decrypted header has the magic bytes ‘ TRUE ’ in the beginning , as promised .
Before we go over the content of the header , we should be able to handle cascaded ciphers .
This is actually trivial to implement because we do n’t have to change the LRW functions , just supply a decrypt or encrypt function as we did before .
Consider the following code , with ( almost ) the same interface as the cipher algorithms :
class CipherChain : def __init__ ( self , ciphers ) : self .
ciphers = [ ciph ( ) for ciph in ciphers ] def set_key ( self , keys ) : i = 0 for cipher in self .
ciphers : cipher .
set_key ( keys [ i ] ) i += 1 def encrypt ( self , data ) : for cipher in self .
ciphers : data = cipher .
encrypt ( data ) return data def decrypt ( self , data ) : for cipher in reversed ( self .
ciphers ) : data = cipher .
decrypt ( data ) return data def get_name ( self ) : return ' -' . join ( reversed ( [ cipher .
get_name ( ) for cipher in self .
ciphers ] ) )
Ponder the code for a while .
Especially consider the encrypt and decrypt function and the use of the Python function “ reversed ( ) ” .
Now consider a TrueCrypt volume using a three cipher cascade instead of simply Twofish .
The cascade Rijndael , Twofish , Serpent is known as “ Serpent - Twofish - AES ” in the TrueCrypt user interface .
>>> cipher = CipherChain ([ Rijndael , Twofish , Serpent ] ) >>> cipher .
set_key ( [ key1 , key2 , key3 ] ) >>> decryptedheader = LRWMany ( cipher .
decrypt , lrwkey , 1 , header )
Please note that CipherChain ( [ Rijndael , Twofish , Serpent ] ) is not the same cascade as CipherChain ( [ Serpent , Twofish , Rijndael ] ) .
In this section of the article we have covered lots of ground and we have taken some detours into the realms of abstract algebra and cryptographic modes .
We can now do something that is probably more familiar to the reader : parse binary data .
We can now temporarily forget everything above and concentrate fully on the decrypted header ( such as the one above ) .
There are basically two parts of the decrypted header .
First we have information .
This is the data in the very beginning of the header .
Then we have the curious bytes in the middle of the header , with all the zero bytes surrounding it .
These bytes are very important because they are the keys for the rest of the volume .
These keys are needed to decrypt the actual file system .
We will call this key the master key .
Let ’s get back to the information in the beginning of the decrypted header .
The first 4 bytes are as previously mentioned the magic bytes TRUE ( assuming , of course , we have decrypted the header correctly .
If we used the wrong cipher or the wrong hash or the wrong password , the first four bytes will probably be garbage ) .
Following the magic bytes are some big endian integers .
The complete layout is as follows :
4 bytes :
The string ‘ TRUE ’
2 bytes : A 16 bit big endian integer .
The version number of the volume .
2 bytes : A 16 bit big endian integer :
The minimum version of TrueCrypt required to read the volume .
4 bytes : A 32 bit big endian integer : A checksum .
In our decrypted header above , we can parse the first bytes by hand here and now .
The version number is 2 , the minimum TrueCrypt version is 0x0410 and the checksum is 0x19e8890 c .
This checksum is used to make sure we really have a correctly decrypted header .
Although it ’s highly improbable , decrypting a volume with the wrong password may result in the first four bytes being ‘ TRUE ’ .
The checksum is added to verify the decrypted header is really valid .
If the checksum matches the CRC32 of byte 192-448 of the header , we have a valid header ( with extremely high probability ) .
Following the checksum are three 64 bit big endian integers .
The first two are timestamps and the third is the size of the volume if this is a hidden volume ( ignore this for now ) .
The first timestamp is the date and time the volume was created .
The second timestamp is the date and time the header was modified .
Knowing all this , we can now write some code to decrypt the header using only the password we chose when the volume was created .
First lets write some pseudo - code :
for each hash key = keystrengthening ( hash , password ) for each cipher decryptedheader = decrypt ( key , header ) if magic bytes matches and crc32 matches checksum : success !
As a recap , in the first step in this article we took the TrueCrypt volume password and generated keys needed to decrypt the header .
These keys , in turn , we used in the second step to decrypt the volume header .
In the middle of the decrypted volume header lays the master key needed to decrypt the rest of the volume .
Here ’s the complete code for this and the previous step .
This code will work like this :
fileobj = file ( " aestwoser.tc " , " rb " ) tc = TrueCryptVolume ( fileobj , " passwordpasswordpassword " , Log ) TCPrintInformation ( tc ) fileobj . close ()
TrueCryptVolume is a class representing a TrueCrypt volume and tc is the object representing the volume aestwoser.tc specifically , which has the password as shown .
The constructor of TrueCryptVolume will generate the strengthened keys from password , as described in the first step in this article .
It will then decrypt the header by trying each cipher and cascade .
In essence , it works exactly like the pseudo code just written .
A TrueCryptVolume object has some useful member variables , especially “ master_lrwkey ” which is the master LRW key extracted from the decrypted header , and “ cipher ” , which is the cipher algorithm relinitilized with the master keys also extracted from the decrypted header .

Reading the data
A short recap of what we have done .
In step one we took our TrueCrypt volume and a password .
We used this password to derive several new keys using a key strengthening algorithm .
These keys were in turn used to decrypt the TrueCrypt volume header .
In the volume header we found the keys for the rest of the volume .
These are the keys we are going to use to decrypt the actual file system .
Fortunately for us , since we have already implemented the LRW functions , this step will be very easy !
We just reinitialize the cipher we used to decrypt the header with the keys from the header and use the new master LRW key to decrypt the rest of the volume .
We only have to add one new function to the code above and other than some math to compute the LRW block indices the code should not be too difficult to understand .
Given an index starting from 1 , the function TCReadSector will read 512 bytes long blocks of data .
512 bytes is the sector size defined in the TrueCrypt specification ( note that the sector size does n’t have anything to do with the underlying file system , it is just the TrueCrypt terminology for the smallest block of data we work with when decrypting the file system ) .
def TCReadSector ( tc , index ) : " " " Read a sector from the volume . " " " assert index > 0 tc . fileobj .
seek ( 0 , 2 ) file_len = tc . fileobj .
tell () # The LRW functions work on blocks of length 16 .
Since a TrueCrypt # sector is 512 bytes each call to LRWMany will decrypt 32 blocks , # and each call to this function must therefore advance the block # index 32 .
The block index also starts at 1 , not 0 . index 1 # corresponds to lrw_index 1 , index 2 corresponds to lrw_index 33 etc. lrw_index = ( index - 1 ) * 32 + 1 # For a regular ( non-hidden ) volume the file system starts at byte # 512 ( after salt + header ) .
seekto = TC_SECTOR_SIZE
* index # last_sector_offset is the beginning of the last sector relative # the end of the file .
For a regular non-hidden volume this is simply # 512 bytes from the end of the file .
last_sector_offset = TC_SECTOR_SIZE if seekto > file_len - last_sector_offset : return '' tc . fileobj .
seek ( seekto ) data = tc . fileobj .
read ( TC_SECTOR_SIZE ) return LRWMany ( tc . cipher .
decrypt , tc .
master_lrwkey , lrw_index , data )
While we ’re at it it ’s useful to know how many sectors we can read .
The function TCSectorCount works pretty much the same as the code above .
def TCSectorCount ( tc ) : " " " How many sectors can we read with TCReadSector ? " " " tc . fileobj .
seek ( 0 , 2 ) volume_size = tc . fileobj . tell () # Minus the salt + header .
volume_size -= 512 return volume_size / TC_SECTOR_SIZE
The first block may look like this , for a FAT volume :

We have now successfully decrypted a TrueCrypt volume and printed the first 512 bytes of the underlying file system !
We can now write a small command line program that will write the complete file system to disk , like this :
$ truecrypt.py volume.tc password filesystem.fat
Here 's the code .
def cmdline ( ) : scriptname = sys .
argv [ 0 ] try : path , password , outfile = sys .
argv [ 1 :] except ValueError : print >> sys .
stderr , " %s volumepath password outfile " % scriptname sys .
exit ( 1 ) if os .
path .
exists ( outfile ) : print >> sys .
stderr , " outfile %s already exists .
use another " \ " filename and try again ( we do n't want to overwrite " \ " files by mistake ) " % outfile sys .
exit ( 1 ) try : fileobj = file ( path , " rb " ) except IOError : print >> sys .
stderr , " file %s does n't exist " % path sys .
exit ( 1 ) try : tc = TrueCryptVolume ( fileobj , password , Log ) except KeyError : print >> sys .
stderr , " incorrect password or not a TrueCrypt volume " fileobj .
close ( ) sys .
exit ( 1 ) except KeyboardInterrupt : print >> sys . stderr , " aborting " fileobj .
close ( ) sys .
exit ( 1 ) TCPrintInformation ( tc ) outfileobj = file ( outfile , " ab " ) num_sectors = TCSectorCount ( tc ) num_written = 0 try : for i in xrange ( 1 , num_sectors + 1 ) : if i % 100 == 0 : Log ( " Decrypting sector %d of %d . " % ( i , num_sectors ) ) outfileobj .
write ( TCReadSector ( tc , i ) ) num_written += 1 except KeyboardInterrupt : print " Aborted decryption . " pass outfileobj .
close ( ) print " Wrote %d sectors ( %d bytes ) . " % ( num_written , num_written * TC_SECTOR_SIZE ) fileobj .
close ( ) sys .
exit ( 0 ) if __name__ == ' __main__ ' : cmdline ()
This program is of course not very useful in practice but it is at least more user friendly than looking at the file system in the Python top loop .
It should be mentioned : you should not use the above program on a “ production ” volume with all your secret files on them .
Your shell may log the password to file , which is undesirable .
Additionally you do not want your encrypted file system written to disk because traces may be left of your secret files even if you delete the extracted file system .
Traces of your secret files on a non-encrypted filesystem is extremely undesirable .
Finally , do n’t worry if the written file system is full of garbage – TrueCrypt writes random bytes to the empty areas of the file system during formatting .
If you create a new volume with a FAT file system and then add some text files , you can find your files in the beginning of the file system .
Wrapping it up : hidden volumes
By now we have some code that can successfully decrypt most TrueCrypt volumes .
We still have to handle hidden volumes , though .
Fortunately for us this is very easy .
Before we do that , here is a short explanation of hidden volumes .
A hidden volume is a second TrueCrypt volume residing in the same file as another TrueCrypt volume .
Note that the hidden volume is not inside the regular volume , but beside – it is not necessary to decrypt the regular volume to access the hidden volume .
A TrueCrypt volume with a hidden volume is basically the same thing as two regular TrueCrypt volumes concatenated together , but in a clever way so the file system in the first volume believes it is as large as the TrueCrypt file itself ( it would be very suspicious if the TrueCrypt file was say 10 gigabytes , but the regular volume was only say 6 gigabytes when mounted ) .
The reason TrueCrypt supports hidden volumes is plausible deniability .
If the user is forced for some reason to give up his password , he will give the adversary the password to the regular volume .
There is no way whatsoever to tell if there is a hidden volume in the TrueCrypt file so from the adversary ’s point of view the TrueCrypt volume just mounted looks like any other TrueCrypt volume , with or without a hidden volume .
In fact , when the regular volume is mounted , the hidden volume may become overwritten if new files are added .
Not even TrueCrypt knows there ’s a hidden volume when the regular volume is mounted .
( TrueCrypt does however know when a hidden volume is mounted , but this is not necessary for plausible deniability – we are not giving up the password to the hidden volume when we can give up the password to the regular volume ! )
The only way to mount a hidden volume is to provide the correct password .
This password must , of course , be different than the password to the regular volume ; otherwise the regular volume would be mounted all the time regardless of our intentions .
Here ’s what happens when we use the hidden volume password instead of the regular password .
Obviously , all the steps we have described previously will fail : the hidden volume password is not the same as the regular password .
This is because we have n’t written any code for hidden volumes yet .
The question is then : what should we do ?
This is fortunately very straightforward .
When we fail to decrypt the header for the regular volume , we will now go back to step 1 , that is we are going to generate new keys using the key - strengthening algorithm .
But instead of reading the 64 bytes salt from offset 0 in the TrueCrypt file we are going to read the salt from offset 1536 from the end of the TrueCrypt file .
We now have new keys and we will try to decrypt the header .
Not the same header , but another header from offset 1536+64 from the end of the TrueCrypt file .
In the code we have already written to read regular TrueCrypt volumes , we have the following two lines to read the salt and the header :
salt = fileobj .
read ( 64 ) header = fileobj .
read ( 448 )
To read a hidden volume , we only have to add a line to seek to 1536 bytes from the end :
fileobj . seek ( - 1536 , 2 ) salt = fileobj .
read ( 64 ) header = fileobj .
read ( 448 )
Because we should be able to handle both regular and hidden volumes , we only have to add a loop outside the code that decrypts the header :
for volume_type in [ " normal " , " hidden " ] : fileobj .
seek ( 0 ) if volume_type == " hidden " : fileobj .
seek ( - 1536 , 2 )
We can now decrypt both regular and hidden volume headers by using different passwords .
The only thing remaining is to fix the TCReadSector function : the first sector is obviously not at the same offset ( in the TrueCrypt file ) as the regular volume .
The first sector of a regular volume is 512 .
The first sector for the hidden volume depends on the size of the file and the size of the hidden volume .
def TCReadSector ( tc , index ) : " " " Read a sector from the volume . " " " assert index > 0 tc . fileobj .
seek ( 0 , 2 ) file_len = tc . fileobj .
tell () # The LRW functions work on blocks of length 16 .
Since a TrueCrypt # sector is 512 bytes each call to LRWMany will decrypt 32 blocks , # and each call to this function must therefore advance the block # index 32 .
The block index also starts at 1 , not 0 . index 1 # corresponds to lrw_index 1 , index 2 corresponds to lrw_index 33 etc. lrw_index = ( index - 1 ) * 32 + 1 # For a regular ( non-hidden ) volume the file system starts at byte # 512 .
However for a hidden volume , the start of the file system # is not at byte 512 .
Starting from the end of the volume , namely # byte file_len , we subtract the hidden volume salt + header ( at offset # 1536 from the end of the file ) .
We then subtract the size of the # hidden volume .
mod = 0 last_sector_offset = TC_SECTOR_SIZE if tc .
hidden_size : mod = file_len - tc .
hidden_size - TC_HIDDEN_VOLUME_OFFSET
#
We subtract another sector from mod because the index starts # at 1 and not 0 . mod -= TC_SECTOR_SIZE last_sector_offset = TC_SECTOR_SIZE + TC_HIDDEN_VOLUME_OFFSET
seekto = mod +
TC_SECTOR_SIZE
* index # last_sector_offset is the beginning of the last sector relative # the end of the file .
For a regular non-hidden volume this is simply # 512 bytes from the end of the file .
However for hidden volumes we # must not read past the headers , so the last sector begins 512 bytes # before the header offset .
if seekto > file_len - last_sector_offset : return '' tc . fileobj .
seek ( seekto ) data = tc . fileobj .
read ( TC_SECTOR_SIZE ) return LRWMany ( tc . cipher .
decrypt , tc .
master_lrwkey , lrw_index , data )
def TCSectorCount ( tc ) : " " " How many sectors can we read with TCReadSector ? " " " volume_size = 0 if tc .
hidden_size : volume_size = tc .
hidden_size else : tc . fileobj . seek ( 0 , 2 ) volume_size = tc . fileobj . tell () # Minus the salt + header .
volume_size -= 512 return volume_size / TC_SECTOR_SIZE

Conclusion
There we have it , a couple of hundred lines of code describing the essence of TrueCrypt .
We have not fully implemented TrueCrypt – in fact there are some features missing such as key files not to mention the ability to read and write files to volumes directly – but we have described the most important parts of the specification .
Hopefully the code and the article will be useful for some purpose .
Finally some technicalities :
One : the author is not affiliated with the TrueCrypt foundation in any way .
Two : see the source code for code licenses .
Most of the primitives are public domain or almost public domain and most of the TrueCrypt specific code is MIT License .

Villagers say they came under air attack for several hours
Coalition and Nato - led forces , in co-operation with Afghan troops , launched the strikes against Taleban insurgents on Friday .
Local officials say they believe tens of civilians died but there has been no independent confirmation of this .
President Hamid Karzai recently accused foreign troops of acting " recklessly " .
The coalition said the latest incident had been sparked when its forces , working with the Afghan national army to clear a river valley , came under heavy insurgent fire , including the use of rocket - propelled grenades .
It said its forces had identified several rebel positions , returned fire and then called in air strikes by the coalition and the Nato - led Isaf , which destroyed all the rebel positions .
A coalition spokesman said that later the remains of people who appeared to be civilians were found and that these bodies were in the places previously defined as firing positions .
Saying he was deeply saddened by any civilian deaths , the spokesman said insurgents were continuing to put women and children in harm 's way .
' Rescue '
Earlier , Helmand 's police chief said the foreign forces had not consulted their Afghan counterparts before launching the air strikes .
But a Nato spokesman denied this , saying the air power was used to help rescue the Afghan army .
The mayor of the nearby town of Gereshk told the BBC there were reports of tens of civilian deaths .
Local people who telephoned the BBC said that as many as 50 to 80 civilians had been killed .
They said " foreign forces " had bombed their area for two to three hours late on Friday .
A week ago , after the death of some 25 civilians in the same district , President Karzai accused foreign forces of acting recklessly and ordered them to co-ordinate better with his government .
Sony 's decision to drop its ATRAC file format and shutter the Connect music store signals a radical departure for the electronics giant , which has tried for 15 years to market its proprietary file format as a viable competitor to MP3 and other digital music formats .
Though technically ATRAC has its merits , the format failed to catch on with consumers in North American and European markets ( though it 's still big in Japan ) .
The biggest problem :
If you wanted to listen to ATRAC files , you were required to use Sony software and hardware , and Sony 's offerings never took off like the iPod .
" It 's been an interesting year in the music industry , especially with a number of services announcing the move towards non-DRM music sales , " said Sony Walkman product manager Mitch Li in a phone call Thursday .
" With everything that 's going on , it made sense for us to move to more of an open format and to become better positioned to be a participant in this overall ecosystem . "
To better position its hardware , Sony debuted two new Walkman players , the NWZ - A810 and NWZ - S610 , at the IFA conference in Germany on Thursday .
The two players are the first entries in Sony 's flagship personal audio player line released in the United States that are capable of playing video .
They are also the first to drop support for the Sony - only ATRAC format .
Li said the new players are in response to growing consumer demand for devices that are compatible with the expanding stable of online outlets selling music in MP3 and WMA formats such as Napster and Yahoo .
While the new line of Walkmans are not the first to feature MP3 and WMA support , they are the first to support WMA files with Digital Rights Management data attached .
Sony has chosen to add support for Microsoft's PlaysForSure DRM scheme , which is playable through the Windows Media Player 11 application .
Customers will be able to use Windows Media Player 11 to add PlaysForSure - protected purchases to the devices , and for audio and video playback on the desktop .
" If ( a customer ) happens to like to buy music from Yahoo or Napster or whoever , " said Li , " it 's nice to be able to say to them , ' Look , you do n't have to stop using those services just because you have a Sony piece of hardware . ' "
Sony will be shutting down music sales in its online Connect Music store , which sold ATRAC - encoded files only playable on Sony devices .
Sony will , however , continue to sell eBooks through the outlet .
The Connect music store will remain open for North American and European customers at least through March 2008 .
As a part of the transition , the SonicStage jukebox software used by Walkman owners to manage their devices is also being phased out .
In the meantime , Sony will begin phasing out the ATRAC audio format .
The company has published an FAQ for ATRAC users instructing them on how to continue to listen to their music , and it has provided a conversion tool that will cross-encode ATRAC files to either WMA or MP3 .
The conversion tool ships with the new Walkman players , and it's also available as a free download on Sony 's website .
ATRAC was originally developed by Sony in 1992 as a way to squeeze an album 's worth of music onto its then - revolutionary MiniDisc media .
The format uses lossy compression similar in sound quality and execution to MP3 .
In fact , for several years in the 1990s ATRAC was a viable competitor to MP3 and WMA .
But a lack of consumer interest in the format and the popularity of the iPod , which like other non-Sony devices does not play ATRAC files , has resulted in the format 's demise .
However , one place ATRAC continues to thrive is Japan , where the debate about file formats and device lock - in does n't have the impact on the digital music market as it does here .
While Sony shuts down its ATRAC - only Connect store in the West , its Japanese equivalent , Mora , will continue to sell songs to Sony device owners .
" ATRAC is simply more ingrained into the way they consume music in Japan , " says Li .
AT&T engineer says Bush Administration sought to implement domestic spying within two weeks of taking office John Byrne
Published : Sunday December 16 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This Nearly 1,300 words into Sunday 's New York Times article revealing new details of the National Security Agency 's domestic eavesdropping program , the lawyer for an AT&T engineer alleges that " within two weeks of taking office , the Bush administration was planning a comprehensive effort of spying on Americans  phone usage .
In a New Jersey federal court case , the engineer claims that AT&T sought to create a phone center that would give the NSA access to " all the global phone and e-mail traffic that ran through " a New Jersey network hub .
The former AT&T employee , who spoke on condition of anonymity to the Times said he took part in several discussions with agency officials about the plan .
" The officials , he said , discussed ways to duplicate the Bedminster system in Maryland so the agency could listen in with unfettered access to communications that it believed had intelligence value and store them for later review , " Times reporters Eric Lichtblau , James Risen and Scott Shane wrote .
" There was no discussion of limiting the monitoring to international communications , he said . "
 At some point ,  he told the paper ,  I started feeling something is nt right . 
" Two other AT&T employees who worked on the proposal discounted his claims , saying in interviews that the project had simply sought to improve the N.S.A.s internal communications systems and was never designed to allow the agency access to outside communications . "
AT&T 's spokesman said they did n't comment on national security matters , as did a spokesman for Qwest , which was also approached but apparently rebuffed the plan .
The lawyer for the engineer and others in the New Jersey case says AT&T 's internal documents would vindicate his clients .
 What he saw ,  Bruce Afran , a New Jersey lawyer representing the plaintiffs , told the Times , was decisive evidence that within two weeks of taking office , the Bush administration was planning a comprehensive effort of spying on Americans  phone usage .

Common Lisp on Mac OS X
You could be having fun with Common Lisp on your Mac right now ; you know that , do n’t you ? ;)
Lately I have been having a ball doing Common Lisp programming on my MacBook Pro .
But as with all great starts , this was not without its pitfalls .
After many frustrating hours , and questions asked on the #lisp IRC channel , I ’ve come to realize that perhaps others may benefit from treading a path already trodden .
Installing MacPorts
The first step towards enjoying Common Lisp on your Mac is to install MacPorts .
Really , if you have n’t installed this beautiful system by now , you ’ve been missing out .
It puts ( most of ) the world of free software right at your fingertips .
Once MacPorts is installed , just run the following commands :
sudo port install emacs + carbon
sudo port install sbcl slime
This will do three things for you :
It installs the Carbon version of Emacs 22 , which OS X does not ship with .
Emacs 22 is surprisingly stable , and feature rich .
I use Emacs heavily every minute of every day , and this version has not crashed on me a single time .
It installs the latest version of Steel Bank Common Lisp ( SBCL ) , a branch off the source tree for CMU Common Lisp ( CMUCL ) .
This version is more actively developed , and seems to be what current Lisp hackers are excited about .
For you , the end user , this means better integration with nerdy development environments , like Emacs and SLIME .
It installs SLIME , the “ Superior Lisp Interaction Mode for Emacs ” .
SLIME gives you an interactive REPL ( read : Lisp console ) that you can interact with while you develop your Lisp code .
This is such a wonderful thing I wo n’t even try to describe it in this simple article .
It also allows you to interactively debug programs , inspect and evalution values at runtime , and quickly access reams of documentation and type information relating to your code .
This is one of the best Lisp IDEs out there — although the graphical stepper from LispWorks is pretty sexy too .
Configuring SLIME
Now you have SBCL and SLIME installed .
You could , at this point , run Emacs and type M-x slime .
When it prompts for a command to run , just pick sbcl .
Boom , you are now in a Lisp REPL and can type things like this :
CL - USER > ( format t " Hello , world ! " )
Hello , world !
NIL
CL - USER >
This is great and all ; but life can be so much more wonderful than this .
cldoc
First , there is cldoc , a very cool module for Emacs that knows a lot about the arguments and return values for all the ANSI Common Lisp functions .
Although SLIME itself could show you the arguments for functions , this handy piece of work will show you the return values for standard functions .
This is very helpful .
Just throw this into your .emacs.el file after installing cldoc.el into your site - lisp :
( autoload ' turn - on - cldoc - mode " cldoc " nil t)
( dolist ( hook '( lisp- mode - hook
slime - repl- mode - hook ) )
( add - hook hook ' turn - on - cldoc - mode ) )
paredit
paredit is a curious mode that you may either come to love ( as I have ) or you ’ll hate it and never look back .
It tries to orient your editing behavior around sexps , instead of text .
The way it does this is by preventing you from ever having a mismatched number of open and closed parentheses in your source file .
If you try to hit backspace and delete a closing parenthesis , paredit will just ignore you and move the cursor inside the parentheses .
It goes out of its way to ensure that there for every open parenthesis , there is a matching closed parenthesis .
Sometimes this can get in the way .
But once you use it for a while , and start to get into the “ zen of paredit ” ( as I think about it ) , it starts becoming incredibly helpful .
The best part is that it provides some utilities for manipulating sexps that are not found in the stock Emacs .
Two of the most useful of these it calls “ barfing ” and “ slurping ” .
You barf a sexp when you push it out from its containing sexp .
Let ’s say I ’m editing the following list .
I ’ll use the pipe character to show where my point is :
( format |t " Hello , world ! " (+ 10 20 ) )
Here I have a format call which takes an argument I do n’t need .
But instead of deleting it , I want to return it as the value of my function .
Easy , just hit Control - } to barf the last sexp out of the current one .
This is what results :
( format |t " Hello , world ! " )
(+ 10 20 )
All without every moving my cursor .
Slurping is the reverse operation .
I find these two most useful for pushing sexps outside of an enclosing let , or sucking them in .
This is how I have my paredit configured :
( autoload ' paredit - mode " paredit "
" Minor mode for pseudo - structurally editing Lisp code . " t)
( dolist ( hook '( emacs-lisp-mode-hook
lisp - mode - hook
slime - repl- mode - hook ) )
( add - hook hook #'( lambda nil ( paredit - mode 1 ) ) ) )
( eval - after - load " paredit "
'( progn
( define - key paredit - mode - map [ ?\ ) ] ' paredit-close-parenthesis )
( define - key paredit - mode - map [ ( meta ? \ ) ) ]
' paredit-close-parenthesis-and - newline ) ) )
Configuring SLIME itself
Now we come to SLIME .
There are a lot of things that SLIME can do , so there ’s lots to configure .
I ’m just going to share my current configuration with you here , leaving it to the reader to correct pathnames as necessary , or delete the stuff he does n’t want .

Installing new packages
SBCL by itself is quite useful , but it has very few builtin packages .
Over time , you ’re going to find yourself wanting some things , like Perl - style regular expression support .
Here is the absolute quickest way to get that going with SBCL :
Hermes : / usr / local $ sbcl
This is SBCL 1.0.10 , an implementation of ANSI Common Lisp .
More information about SBCL is available at < http://www.sbcl.org/>.
SBCL is free software , provided as is , with absolutely no warranty .
It is mostly in the public domain ; some portions are provided under
BSD - style licenses .
See the CREDITS and COPYING files in the
distribution for more information .
* ( require ' asdf )
* ( require ' asdf - install )
* ( asdf - install : install ' cl - ppcre )
You will see some output between this commands , which you can safely ignore .
At this point , the system will ask you whether you want to install CL - PPCRE as a system - wide or a local installation .
Pick whichever is appropriate for you .
It will then go out to the Internet and download CL - PPCRE , and then ask you if it ’s OK to skip the GnuPG signature key .
Just type 0 ( zero ) to indicate that it ’s OK to go ahead .
Or , if you love security , install the key and setup your system right .
Once installed , CL - PPCRE is now ready for use .
But what happens if you exit SBCL and restart ?
Yep , it ’s gone .
At that point you will have to load it again like this :
* ( asdf:operate ' asdf:load - op :cl- ppcre )
But , you ’re wondering , is n’t there a better way ?
Why yes , my friend .
I ’m so glad you asked .
Bootstrapping SBCL
At any point in time you can save your running SBCL environment out to disk , and then reload it back in exactly where you left off .
This means that you can preload all the packages you love most , then dump SBCL so that the next time you start , they are all available without having to load them again .
The best way to do this is to write a file called bootstrap.lisp .
Put all the commands you need to initialize your environment into this file , and then run the following command :
$ sbcl -- load bootstrap.lisp
If you ’ve written your file correctly , there will now be a core file in the current directory .
You can restart SBCL then like this :
$ sbcl -- core sbcl.core
This is not only a much easier way to preload the packages you need , it ’s also much , much faster .
In fact , I ’m going to show you how to not only preload packages , but preload SLIME itself , so that the next time you type M-x slime , SBCL will load in just under a heartbeat .
Example bootstrap.lisp file
Here ’s the bootstrap.lisp file that I use .
You ’ll need to change the pathnames to match your system .
It ’s main advantage is that it will install all the packages you need from the Internet , but thereafter will load them from disk if you ’ve already downloaded them .
Feel free to comment out the load - or - install lines which load packages you do n’t care about .
Oh , and if you choose to go ahead and install CL - SQL , always choose “ Continue ” when you see errors about failing to load the libraries for databases you do n’t have installed .
I use PostgreSQL , so that ’s the only file that compiled without problems for me .
Also , be sure to fix the pathnames that point to Swank , the SLIME integration library for talking to SLIME .
By preloading Swank this way , I find that SBCL loads in about a third of a second from Emacs .

Further information
At this point , I highly recommend you to read some of the documentation that comes with SLIME , and with SBCL .
When you start having problems , head over to the #lisp channel on IRC , or to the CLiki website .
Or feel free to send me a note .
I ’d be happy to help you get started with Common Lisp on OS X .

The Belgian capital Brussels currently has the highest infection rate in Belgium , with about 10 % of all those tested returning a positive result - more than double the national average for the previous week .
Authorities in the city on Monday announced a ban on prostitution until further notice to combat the spread .
They also shut down three hotels hosting sex workers , and sent police out to inform prostitutes and ensure the ban was respected .
Sex workers have been badly affected by the pandemic , seeing their incomes disappear overnight .
The YNot Project
The goal of the Ynot project is to make programming with dependent types practical for a modern programming language .
In particular , we are extending the Coq proof assistant to make it possible to write higher - order , imperative and concurrent programs ( in the style of Haskell ) through a shallow embedding of Hoare Type Theory ( HTT ) .
HTT provides a clean separation between pure and effectful computations , makes it possible to formally specify and reason about effects , and is fully compositional .
This was actually commented on here , by Greg Morrisett himself .
Conceptually , this seems like it's related to Adam Chlipala 's A Certified Type - Preserving Compiler from Lambda Calculus to Assembly Language .
See , in particular , slides 23 - 24 of this presentation ( PDF ) .
More generally , computation and reflection seem to be gaining recognition as important features for the practical use of such powerful tools as Coq ; see also SSREFLECT tactics for Coq and their accompanying paper A Small Scale Reflection Extension for the Coq system ( PDF ) .
It 's also interesting to observe that the work appears to depend on the " Program " keyword in the forthcoming Coq 8.2 , the work behind which is known as " Russell , " as referred to in this thread .
Russell 's main page in the meantime is here .
Again , the point is to simplify programming with dependent types in Coq .
Update : Some preliminary code is available from the project page .
The Pythagorean theorem is a celebrity : if an equation can make it into the Simpsons , I 'd say it 's well - known .
But most of us think the formula only applies to triangles and geometry .
Think again .
The Pythagorean Theorem can be used with any shape and for any formula that squares a number .
Read on to see how this 2500 - year - old idea can help us understand computer science , physics , even the value of Web 2.0 social networks .
Understanding How Area Works
I love seeing old topics in a new light and discovering the depth there .
For example , I realize I did n't have a deep grasp of area until writing this article .
Yes , we can rattle off equations , but do we really understand the nature of area ?
This fact may surprise you :
The area of any shape can be computed from any line segment squared .
In a square , our " line segment " is usually a side , and the area is that side squared ( side 5 , area 25 ) .
In a circle , the line segment is often the radius , and the area is pi * r^2 ( radius 5 , area 25 pi ) .
Easy enough .
We can pick any line segment and figure out area from it : every line segment has an " area factor " in this universal equation :
Shape Line Segment Area Area Factor Square
Side [ s ]
s2 1 Square
Perimeter [ p ]
1/16 p2 1/16 Square
Diagonal [ d ]
1/2 d2 1/2 Circle
Radius [ r ] pi r2 pi ( 3.14159 ... )
For example , look at the diagonal of a square ( " d " ) .
A regular side is $ \frac{d}{\sqrt{2}} $ , so the area becomes $ \frac { 1} {2} d^2 $ .
Our " area constant " is 1 / 2 in this case , if we want to use the diagonal as our line segment to be squared .
Now , use the entire perimeter ( " p " ) as the line segment .
A side is $ \frac{p} {4} $ , so the area is $ \frac{p ^2} {16} $ .
The area factor is 1/16 if we want to use $ p ^2 $ .
Can we pick any line segment ?
You bet .
There is always some relationship between the " traditional " line segment ( the side of a square ) , and the one you pick ( the perimeter , which happens to be 4 times a side ) .
Since we can convert between the " traditional " and " new " segment , it does n't matter which one we use -- there 'll just be a different area factor when we multiply it out .
Can we pick any shape ?
Sort of .
A given area formula works for all similar shapes , where " similar " means " zoomed versions of each other " .
For example :
All squares are similar ( area always $ s ^2 $ )
All circles are similar , too ( area always $ \pi r^2 $ )
Triangles are not similar :
Some are fat and others skinny -- every " type " of triangle has its own area factor based on the line segment you are using .
Change the shape of the triangle and the equation changes .
Yes , every triangle follows the rule " area = 1/2 base * height " .
But the relationship between base and height depends on the type of triangle ( base = 2 * height , base = 3 * height , etc. ) , so even then the area factor will be different .
Why do we need similar shapes to keep the same area equation ?
Intuitively , when you zoom ( scale ) a shape , you 're changing the absolute size but not the relative ratios within the shape .
A square , no matter how zoomed , has a perimeter = 4 * side .
Because the " area factor " is based on ratios inside the shape , any shapes with the same " ratios " will follow the same formula .
It 's a bit like saying everyone 's armspan is about equal to their height .
No matter if you 're a NBA basketball player or child , the equation holds because it 's all relative .
( This intuitive argument may not satisfy a mathematical mind -- in that case , take up your concerns with Euclid ) .
I hope these high - level concepts make sense :
Area can be be found from any line segment squared , not just the " side " or " radius "
, not just the " side " or " radius " Each line segment has a different " area factor "
The same area equation works for similar shapes
Intuitive Look at The Pythagorean Theorem
We can all agree the Pythagorean Theorem is true ( here 's 75 proofs ) .
But most proofs offer a mechanical understanding : re-arrange the shapes , and voila , the equation holds .
But is it really clear , intuitively , that it must be a 2 + b2 = c2 and not 2 a2 + b2 = c2 ?
No ?
Well , let 's build some intuition .
There 's one killer concept we need :
Any right triangle can be split into two similar right triangles .
Cool , huh ?
Drawing a perpendicular line through the point splits a right triangle into two smaller ones .
Geometry lovers , try the proof yourself : use angle - angle - angle similarity .
This diagram also makes something very clear :
Area ( Big ) = Area ( Medium ) + Area ( Small )
Makes sense , right ?
The smaller triangles were cut from the big one , so the areas must add up .
And the kicker : because the triangles are similar , they have the same area equation .
Let 's call the long side c ( 5 ) , the middle side b ( 4 ) , and the small side a ( 3 ) .
Our area equation for these triangles is :
where F is some area factor ( 6/25 or .24 in this case ; the exact number does n't matter ) .
Now let 's play with the equation :
Divide by F on both sides and you get :
Which is our famous theorem !
You knew it was true , but now you know why :
A triangle can be split into two smaller , similar ones
Since the areas must add up , the squared hypotenuses ( which determine area ) must add up as well .
This takes a bit of time to see , but I hope the result is clear .
How could the small triangles not add to the larger one ?
Actually , it turns out the Pythagorean Theorem depends on the assumptions of Euclidean geometry and does n't work on spheres or globes , for example .
But we 'll save that discussion for another time .
Useful Application : Try Any Shape
We used triangles in our diagram , the simplest 2 - D shape .
But the line segment can belong to any shape .
Take circles , for example :
Now what happens when we add them together ?
You guessed it : Circle of radius 5 = Circle of radius 4 + Circle of radius 3 .
Pretty wild , eh ?
We can multiply the Pythagorean Theorem by our area factor ( pi , in this case ) and come up with a relationship for any shape .
Remember , the line segment can be any portion of the shape .
We could have picked the circle 's radius , diameter , or circumference -- there would be a different area factor , but the 3 - 4 - 5 relationship would still hold .
So , whether you 're adding up pizzas or Richard Nixon masks , the Pythagorean theorem helps you relate the areas of any similar shapes .
Now that 's something they did n't teach you in grade school .
Useful Application : Conservation of Squares
The Pythagorean Theorem applies to any equation that has a square .
The triangle - splitting means you can split any amount ( c2 ) into two smaller amounts ( a2 + b2 ) based on the sides of a right triangle .
In reality , the " length " of a side can be distance , energy , work , time , or even people in a social network :
Social Networks .
Metcalfe 's Law ( if you believe it ) says the value of a network is about n2 ( the number of relationships ) .
In terms of value ,
Network of 50M = Network of 40M + Network of 30 M .
Pretty amazing -- the 2nd and 3rd networks have 70 M people total , but they are n't a coherent whole .
The network with 50 million people is as valuable as the others combined .
Computer Science
Some programs with n inputs take n2 time to run ( bubble sort , for example ) .
In terms of processing time :
50 inputs = 40 inputs + 30 inputs
Pretty interesting .
70 elements spread among two groups can be sorted as fast as 50 items in one group .
( Yeah , there may be constant overhead / start up time , just work with me here ) .
Given this relationship , it makes sense to partition elements into separate groups and then sort the subgroups .
Indeed , that 's the approach used in quicksort , one of the best general - purpose sorting methods .
The Pythagorean theorem helps show how sorting 50 combined elements can be as slow as sorting 30 and 40 separate ones .
Surface Area
The surface area of a sphere is 4 pi r2 .
So , in terms of surface area of spheres :
Area of radius 50 = area of radius 40 + area of radius 30
We do n't often have spheres lying around , but boat hulls may have the same relationship ( they 're like deformed spheres , right ? ) .
Assuming the boats are similarly shaped , the paint needed to coat one 50 foot yacht could instead paint a 40 and 30 - footer .
Yowza .
Physics
If you remember your old physics classes , the kinetic energy of an object with mass m and velocity v is 1/ 2 m v2 .
In terms of energy ,
Energy at 500 mph = Energy at 400 mph +
Energy at 300 mph
With the energy used to accelerate one bullet to 500 mph , we could accelerate two others to 400 and 300 mph .
Try Any Number
You can use any set of numbers that make a right triangle .
For example , enter a total amount ( 50 ) and one subportion ( 30 ) , and the remainder will appear below :
Suppose you want to see if a large pizza ( 16 inches ) is bigger than two mediums ( 12 inches ) .
Plug in 16 for C , and 12 for A .
It looks like the large pizza can be split into a 12 - inch and 10.5 - inch pizza , so two - mediums are in fact bigger .
Enjoy Your New Insight
Throughout our school life we think the Pythagorean Theorem is about triangles and geometry .
It 's not .
When you see a right triangle , realize the sides can represent the lengths of any portion of a shape , and the sides can represent variables in any equation that has a square .
Maybe it 's just me , but I find this pretty surprising .
There 's much , much more to this beautiful theorem , such as measuring any distance .
Enjoy .

The man had removed all but one of the wheel nuts
The 66 - year - old man from Washington state was repairing his car outside his home when the accident took place .
Shooting at the wheel from arm 's length with his 12 - gauge shotgun , he was peppered with buckshot and debris .
The man - who police say was on his own and not intoxicated - was taken to hospital with severe , but not life - threatening , injuries .
The man , from South Kitsap , 10 miles ( 16 km ) southwest of Seattle , had been repairing his Lincoln Continental for two weeks , according to the police , and had removed all but one of the nuts on the right rear wheel .
Frustrated by the one remaining nut which refused to budge , he resorted to fire power in an effort to shift it .
" He 's bound and determined to get that lug nut off , " said Deputy Scott Wilson , a spokesman from the sheriff 's office .
He sustained injuries from his feet to the middle of his abdomen , with some pellets reaching as high as his chin , police said .
Last Saturday a comment was posted here by an anonymous reader that contained text that was copyrighted by the Church of Scientology .
They have since followed the DMCA and demanded that we remove the comment .
While Slashdot is an open forum and we encourage free discussion and sharing of ideas , our lawyers have advised us that , considering all the details of this case , the comment should come down .
Read on to understand what this means .
This is the first time since we instituted our moderation system that a comment has had to be removed because of its content , and believe me nobody is more broken hearted about it than me .
It 's a bad precedent , and a blow for the freedom of speech that we all share in this forum .
But this simply does n't look like a case we can win .
Our lawyers tell us that it appears to be a violation of Copyright law , and under the terms of the DMCA , we must remove it .
Else we risk legal action that would at best be expensive , and potentially cause Slashdot to go down temporarily or even permanently .
At the worst , court orders could jeporadize your privacy , and we would be helpless to stop it .
We need to choose our battles and this is n't one we want to have .
We want Slashdot to be a forum where you can say what 's in your heart , but we simply can't defend an anonymous poster who violates copyright law .
Keep that in mind when you post in both this discussion , and in others in the future .
Post your ideas .
Post your thoughts .
And most of all , post your links .
We need to play by the rules or it 's game over .
Now there is the matter of this specific comment .
It contained a text called " OT III " , part of what is known as the Fishman Affidavit .
This text is Copyrighted by the Church of Scientology .
In compliance with the DMCA , we are removing it from Slashdot .
In its place we are putting non-copyrighted text : Links to websites about the church of Scientology , as well as links to how you can contact your congressman about the DMCA .
Thanks a lot to Jamie for putting this together .
First of all , we would like to point out that the text of OT III is available at many other places on the web .
To many to list here in fact .
Instead , try a Google search on " OT III " and " Fishman " , which as of this writing ( March 2001 ) returns over 250 pages .
A broader search on AltaVista returns over 2,000 webpages .
Operating in the jurisdiction of the Dutch courts , Karin Spaink 's Fishman Affidavit webpage has fended off two lawsuits from Scientology , one in 1996 and one in 1999 .
The latter suit , according to the page , is still being appealed .
> From the link listed just above , you can click through to the Fishman Affidavit , which contains links to not only to an annotated copy of OT III , but to the documents on the other OT levels as well , number one through the disputed number eight .
If you would like a plain English explanation of OT III , see OT III Rewritten For Beginners , by Jon Atack .
Its author is a former Scientologist who himself completed level OT III .
The webpage contains nothing copyrighted by a Scientology organization .
It is an explanation of what OT III says and what that means , along with commentary by the author .
Jon Atack is also the author of A Piece of Blue Sky , which is a history of Scientology from before its founding to after L. Ron Hubbard 's death .
At the above link , you can either purchase it , or read it in its entirety online .
If you are interested in Scientology , you will want to visit Operation Clambake , at xenu.net .
It seems to be the most important central resource for information on the organization .
You may also want to visit the Lisa McPherson Memorial Page , which claims that " Lisa died needlessly at the hands of Scientology . "
Her case is truly a tragic one and she deserves to be remembered .
The site has a great deal of information on her death .
Related is The Lisa McPherson Trust , which has not only information about Lisa , but a very large archive of interviews , court transcripts , news reports , testimonials , and videos about Scientology .
Here 's a Slashdot story last year on eBay removing auctions for e-meters based on the Church of Scientology DMCA copyright allegations , which is odd because Copyright law does n't cover a physical device .
If there 's anything else about Scientology you want to know , you will want to see AltReligionScientology.org , which contains a huge list of links to all the sites I do n't have room to list here .
The DMCA is actually five separate modifications to copyright law .
Its Title I is known for providing legal protection for " technological measures " ( typically encryption ) which prevent copying ; this is the part that empowered the MPAA to sue over DeCSS , to name the best - known example .
That 's not the part that concerns us here ;
Title II is its other major modification of copyright law and that 's what we 're dealing with .
Title II created 17 U.S.C.
Section 512 , and we 're specifically looking at our liability under paragraphs ( c ) ( 1 ) ( A ) , which says we have to act " expeditiously to remove or disable access to the [ infringing ] material . "
Here 's the U.S. Copyright Office 's 18 - page summary of the DMCA as a whole .
If 18 pages is too long for you , here 's the American Library Association 's much quicker summary
Here 's a list of resources on the DMCA , including the DMCA itself in PDF format .
The EFF page on the DCMA seems to relate mostly to Title I , the anti-encryption - circumvention portion , but it 's too good not to mention anyway .
Do n't know who your Congressperson or Senators are ?
That 's OK , now 's as good a time as any to learn .
Finding your Senators is easy , just go to Senate.gov .
To find your Representative , you just need your zip code .
You can use the form on the website to write them if you 're lazy , but if you want your message to have more impact , print it out and send it in a real envelope .
Anything 's better than nothing , though .
When you write , you 'll want to write something they 'll read .
Here are the ACLU 's tips for writing to your Congressperson or Senators .

ERNEN , Switzerland  Bruno Prior , a British entrepreneur , saw the ad from the Ernen ski-lift company one day as he was sipping coffee and looking through the newspaper in London .
Several months later  after paying the token sum of one Swiss franc , or about 90 cents  he is the proud owner of four ski lifts , two trail groomers and a restaurant on 12 miles of ski slopes .
Effectively giving the ski operation away was an act of desperation on the part of Ernen , which , like hundreds of other small Alpine ski stations at medium altitudes , faces dire times .
Most customers these days prefer the larger resorts with hundreds of miles of ski runs , après-ski activities and luxury shopping .
As global warming brings less snow , lower - altitude stations rely more on costly snow machines .
“ Mr. Prior is our lucky charm , ” said Heinz Seiler , who runs the Ernen ski-lift company , Sportbahnen Erner Galen , now owned by Mr. Prior .
“ He spared our 560 - soul village from a catastrophe . ” Mr. Seiler ’s tiny office looks out on the village square , with its 16th - century wooden houses .

Amazon Kindle might be the worst thing that could happen to e-books ?
Amazon , possibly the biggest name in paper books , has come out with a wonderful new e-book device called the Kindle , which does n't require a PC to operate .
Cellular connectivity lets you buy and download a book from almost anywhere , and you do n't even have to pay a monthly fee for the wireless provider .
It has potential ( especially in future models as prices drop ) to gain acceptance by the general public .
There is a huge book list of available titles .
Free first chapters are available for the books , so you can try before you buy instead of wasting your money on dud books .
In almost every way , this looks like the revolution that e-book lovers have been waiting for .
So how can I possibly wonder if this is the worst thing that could happen to e-books ?
I 'll give you a hint ...
Amazon has gone out of their way to make sure that you can only buy books from them , and ca n't use them anywhere else .
When you buy a book , you use it on the Kindle or you 're out of luck .
We 're talking about control of content , with format and DRM lock - in as the tool of power .
We 're on the verge of a future for content that makes you buy the same thing over and over every time you have a new technology .
If you do n't want to think about this in more detail , I 'd suggest you jump to the end .
But in case some of you are interested fanatics , let 's take a look at how DRM locks every purchased book into a particular device .
Just imagine if every paper book you owned could only be read using a particular book light .
If the light bulb burns out , you have to get a new DRM key from the company that sold you the book , or you can't read it anymore even though you have the book in your possession and you paid for it .
That 's what it 's like with device - based DRM .
There are gentler versions , but that 's the core idea .
If you want to read the e-book you purchased after you buy a new device you are at the mercy of the seller .
Maybe they will allow you some small flexibility like allowing you to upgrade to another newer model of the device , or even use the same reading software on another device .
But if you want to change to something else , you 're probably out of luck .
Want to keep reading the e-book ?
You have to buy it again !
And again !
And again !
Is that the best future for e-books ?
Maybe for publishers ( but that 's up for debate as they may be cutting off their own arms by limiting the market this way ) , but definitely not the best scenario for customers .
In fact , I 'd say it 's the worst result .
Higher prices and basically all you will get is a book rental .
You 're only renting the e-book for the period of time you use a particular technology .
And we know how fast technology changes .
Then you have to lose the use of the e-book or buy it again .
Does n't sound too customer oriented .
Now consider Amazon 's plan for the Kindle as I understand it .
As it stands now , it looks like you can read other formats on it , maybe requiring a conversion step .
That 's good .
But if you want to buy a modern book for it , you had either find a non-DRM'd book seller like Baen Science Fiction or Steve Jordan Books , or you had better consider your book to be held hostage by your Kindle .
You wo n't be reading it on your PDA .
And you wo n't even be able to read your purchase of a DRM'd e-book from MobiPocket sellers .
That seems to be an innocent statement at first - you can only read non-DRM'd MobiPocket format on the Kindle .
But think about it .
It 's a power play .
So like I said earlier , even though Amazon owns MobiPocket , Amazon has gone out of their way to make sure that every book you buy for the Kindle stays there , and that you can't buy anywhere else .
If you buy the more common MobiPocket formatted ( DRM'd ) e-book , you can't read it on the Kindle .
That 's power for the seller .
And it 's trouble for the customer .
If this is the Amazon plan , beware .
It 's nice in the short run .
But in the long run , it might just be the worst possible scenario for readers like you and me .
Is there an alternative ?
Actually there are two other general roads to the future that give some additional benefits to the consumer .
Booksellers are probably going to fight this unless they believe the benefits of a large market outweigh any apparent loss of control over the content .
*) A generic shared DRM future
Imagine if we have DRM controls on e-books , but you can buy one of the standard formats with a standard DRM protection .
There are only a few different competing approaches .
There is so much of a customer base that you have some comfort level that new technologies will also support some of the existing formats and DRM .
That means you can probably buy books at multiple stores , and price competition should keep prices more reasonable ( although the publishers still control pricing on particular titles , so competition is still somewhat limited ) .
More importantly , it allows you to keep using your e-book even when technologies change .
Someone is probably going to support the existing format on new devices and platforms .
It 's not perfect .
Even such a format might end up being worthless 20 years from now , but it sure beats only being able to read a book on one particular device .
Sony is supporting this incrementally better future by indicating its support and partnership with Adobe for ePub .
Assuming they do n't limit the DRM on e-books to the Sony Reader only , it allows the potential for multiple e-book sellers to sell for the Reader and it allows a purchased e-book to be read even if you do n't always use a Sony Reader to read the book .
In addition , they allow for several devices on an account to read a purchased book .
That is also slightly better than limiting the book to a single device .
( In fairness , the same might be true of the Kindle , I just do n't know yet . )
e Reader format uses a credit card number ( stored only as the hash value internally for safety and privacy reasons ) .
The advantage of this is that you or your family members can read the book on any device that supports eReader software .
Of course , that 's the problem -- the device list is very limited .
So what is the ideal answer for an e-book consumer ?
This might just be it ...
*) A DRM - less e-book future
In this case , the consumer wins , and by making the consumer happy , publishers and writers get rich also due to the explosion of sales and renewed interest in reading .
The danger is the potential for book copying to become so rampant that publishers and authors can't make money on books .
The opportunity is for e-book sales to explode , and for consumers to buy an e-book and use it on whatever device they want to read it on , and to say goodbye to the nightmare of incompatible formats or general DRM problems .
Your own version of the future with no DRM probably depends on whether you are a consumer or publisher , whether you believe most people are inherently honest , and whether or not you believe that consumers need to be encouraged or extorted .
Maybe that 's a bit harsh , but a future of DRM certainly has both elements of opportunity and fear , and I do n't think anyone has the definitive answer of what is best or most fair .
But the Amazon vision of the future apparently is not in the consumer 's best interest .
Kindle supplies a full e-book ecosystem , but it 's a very closed ecosystem when it comes to purchased books .
You want to buy a modern book ?
Buy it in Kindle format and you can only read it on a Kindle .
Even worse , maybe you can only read it on your Kindle .
So as I said , Amazon might just be the worst thing that can happen to e-books .
The Kindle looks like a great device , so I hope I 'm wrong .
Let 's give Amazon a chance to show us the future they are trying to shape .
I really , really hope I 'm wrong .
But the early signs so far are ominous for the general public .
E - book fans , hang on to your wallet ... you might find it hemorrhaging content loss .
Amazon , possibly the biggest name in paper books , has come out with a wonderful new e-book device called the Kindle , which does n't require a PC to operate .

Assuming they do n't limit the DRM on e-books to the Sony Reader only , it allows the potential for multiple e-book sellers to sell for the Reader and it allows a purchased e-book to be read even if you do n't always use a Sony Reader to read the book .
In addition , they allow for several devices on an account to read a purchased book .
That is also slightly better than limiting the book to a single device .
( In fairness , the same might be true of the Kindle , I just do n't know yet . )
eReader format uses a credit card number ( stored only as the hash value internally for safety and privacy reasons ) .
The advantage of this is that you or your family members can read the book on any device that supports eReader software .
Of course , that 's the problem -- the device list is very limited .
So what is the ideal answer for an e-book consumer ?
This might just be it ...*)
A DRM - less e-book futureIn this case , the consumer wins , and by making the consumer happy , publishers and writers get rich also due to the explosion of sales and renewed interest in reading .
The danger is the potential for book copying to become so rampant that publishers and authors can't make money on books .
The opportunity is for e-book sales to explode , and for consumers to buy an e-book and use it on whatever device they want to read it on , and to say goodbye to the nightmare of incompatible formats or general DRM problems .
Your own version of the future with no DRM probably depends on whether you are a consumer or publisher , whether you believe most people are inherently honest , and whether or not you believe that consumers need to be encouraged or extorted .
Maybe that 's a bit harsh , but a future of DRM certainly has both elements of opportunity and fear , and I do n't think anyone has the definitive answer of what is best or most fair .
But the Amazon vision of the future apparently is not in the consumer 's best interest .
Kindle supplies a full e-book ecosystem , but it 's a very closed ecosystem when it comes to purchased books .
You want to buy a modern book ?
Buy it in Kindle format and you can only read it on a Kindle .
Even worse , maybe you can only read it on Kindle .
So as I said , Amazonjust be the worst thing that can happen to e-books .
The Kindle looks like a great device , so I hope I 'm wrong .
Let 's give Amazon a chance to show us the future they are trying to shape .
I really , really hope I 'm wrong .
But the early signs so far are ominous for the general public .
E - book fans , hang on to your wallet ... you might find it hemorrhaging content loss .
On Tuesday our friends and colleagues at Joomla ! announced the release of Joomla !
1.5 .
In their release note , the Joomla !
developers remark that
The next phase offers the opportunity to bring together the code created , lessons learned , and momentum gained , to build something truly great .
It took us tens of thousands of hours , thousands of revisions , and hundreds of people to get to this point .
It has been a remarkable journey filled with fun , discovery , and enlightenment where everyone has something to offer and anyone can contribute .
I do n't think we could have said it better ourselves !
And , with the release of Drupal 6 right around the corner , I 'm sure we all know exactly how proud they are of a job well done .
As our Joomla !
friends have said before , we 're friends with common goals , and we are all on the same side .
We both value PHP , MySQL , GPL licenses , community based collaboration , open standards , accessibility , low - resource requirements , ease of use , and an extensible and modular design .
And , ultimately , we all agree that open source matters .
From the Drupal community to Joomla ! , Congratulations !
" Security maintainability is the elephant in the living room ; people know there 's an awful problem but are generally too polite to mention it ( especially as we do n't really know what to do with the beast ) . " [ 1 ]
 Ross Anderson
Security solutions are built to solve very specific cases , with very specific assumptions , parameters , and environments .
Because the real world changes , security solutions gradually get out of sync with their deployment environment [ 2 ] .
Sometimes the effects are undesirable , such as with key / secret leaks .
There are also weird and cryptic side - effects ; for example , a distributed system needs a PKI to scale , but PKIs are brittle and centralized , and do not scale [ 3 ] or , heavens forbid , you need to modify your naming scheme [ 4 ] .
How do we keep up with real - world changes as efficiently as possible ?
Dig around in any nontrivial security - related application , and you 'll find places where it is hard to tell where the application stops and the security solution begins .
The " spaghettiness " seems to worsen with the software 's age , complexity , number of upgrades / patches , number of developers , and so on .
There seems to be an inherent conflict of interests .
On one hand , you want to maximize the flexibility of the application , add features , and whatnot ; on the other , you want to have the best security available .
In a dynamic environment , this sounds brittle .
Of course , there 's little wonder why : A complete redesign to ensure harmony between application and security is costly .
However , it 's sometimes easier to redesign than to fix , which is why we get incompatible upgrades : SSH1 versus SSH2 , SSL2 versus TSL , Win95 versus Win2000 , and so on .
For example , replacing a nontrivial security solution based on shared - key technology with one based on public - key technology is a major undertaking .
If you do n't think so , try modifying , say , Firefox to use password - based PGP instead of SSL / TSL it 's possible , but insanely difficult .
Obol ( http://www.pasta.cs.uit.no/~perm/Obol/) is a freely available security protocol programming language that has been built to address this problem .
i.e
At his news conference , Bush called the election results a " thumping " but vowed to maintain his policy of refusing to pull U.S. troops out of Iraq " before the job is done . "
Bush indicated that he had made the decision to replace Rumsfeld before the elections , but he said he had not held a " final conversation " with the defense chief or talked to Gates at the time he told reporters in response to a question last week that Rumsfeld would be staying on .
Asked about that comment , Bush said he made it because " I did n't want to inject a major decision about this war in the final days of a campaign , " Bush said .
He appeared to acknowledge having misled reporters , saying , " And so the only way to answer that question and to get you onto another question was to give you that answer . "
He added later , " Win or lose , Bob Gates was going to become the nominee .
He said that he had begun to contemplate Rumsfeld 's exit before the election -- even while he was publicly vowing that he would keep the defense secretary through the end of his term and insisting that polls forecasting Republican defeat were wrong .
" I thought we were going to do fine yesterday , " Bush insisted .
" Shows what I know . "
But " win or lose , Bob Gates was going to become the nominee . "
Did the president of the United States make a rare admission on national television that he had told an untruth ?
Or had he merely engaged in a dodge of the sort that is common in politics ?
Journalists by nature shy from pinning the " liar " label on any political leader , but President Bush 's acknowledgments that he had not been forthcoming about his plans to dump Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld have kicked up a fuss at the White House and sparked a debate about the limits of presidential evasion .
UPDATE
UPDATE II
" We need candor , we need directness , " said Gingrich , a potential 2008 presidential candidate .
"
We need to understand the threats we faced with are so frightening and so real , the danger that we 'll lose two to three American cities so great , that we cannot play games with each other , cannot manipulate each other , we have to have an open and honest dialogue , and I found yesterday 's staments at the press conference frankly very disturbing . "
He condemned Bush 's admission that in making last week 's statement about Rumsfeld , he had known he was being misleading .
" It 's inappropriate to cleverly come out the day after an election to do something we were told before the election would not be done , " Gingrich said .
" I think the timing was exactly backwards and I hope the President will rethink how he engages the American people and how he communicates with candor . "
It is now conclusively clear that President Bush lied last week , several days before the election , when he vowed definitively to reporters that Donald Rumsfeld would remain as Defense Secretary for the next two years .
At the time he made that statement , he was deep into the process of replacing Rumsfeld , if not already finished , and the President knew that the statement he made about Rumsfeld was false at the time he made it .
That is the definition of " lying .
" There can be no reasonable dispute about this , since the President at his Press Conference not only admitted lying when he told the reporters that Rumsfeld would stay , but he even went on to explain his reasons for lying ( " the reason why is I did n't want to inject a major decision about this war in the final days of a campaign .
And so the only way to answer that question and to get you on to another question was to give you that answer " ) .
The decision was clearly a fait accompli before the election , as the President himself said : " win or lose , Bob Gates was going to become the nominee .
" The President 's admission of lying was so glaring that even Byron York immediately described it as such ( as did other conservatives such as James Joyner ) .
So what are the consequences , the implications , the fallout ?
So far , virtually nothing , and the behavior of The Washington Post shows why that is the case :
As I noted in the post I wrote two days ago about the President 's Rumsfeld lie , The Washington Post article which reported on the Press Conference , written by Michael Fletcher and Peter Baker , detailed the Rumsfeld lie and even described what the President did with unusual candor , . , that the President " appeared to acknowledge having misled reporters . "
It 's so unusual to see a major newspaper accurately report on the President 's dishonesty that I noticed and praised the Post 's candor ( " It 's encouraging ( although it should be commonplace ) that the Washington Post is calling this what it is " ) .
At the time , as I quoted in my post , this is what the Post article reported about the President 's Rumsfeld explanation :
But at some point , the Post fundamentally changed this article ( without leaving any indication that it did so ) .
Now , in that same Post article , the passage I quoted about the President 's having acknowledged that he " misled reporters " is gone entirely -- just disappeared , deleted with no trace -- and instead one finds only this :
At some point , the Post changed what was the accurate reporting -- that Bush expressly acknowledged that he " misled " reporters because he had " indicated that he had made the decision to replace Rumsfeld before the elections " -- by claiming in the new version that he merely " contemplated " Rumsfeld 's exit before the election .
Worse , the Post deleted entirely the accurate statement that the President " appeared to acknowledge having misled reporters . "
( If one does a search of the Post for the deleted paragraphs , the article will still come up in the Post 's search engine , but the entire passage is nowhere to be found in the article ) .
Ironically , the explanation for why this happened may be found in today 's Howard Kurtz column , the whole point of which is to explore the unbelievably stupid question of whether Bush 's lie about Rumsfeld was " on par with [ meaning : as bad as ] President Bill Clinton 's hair - splitting defense in the Monica S. Lewinsky investigation that ' it all depends on what the definition of is is ' " ?
In other words , was Bush 's pre-election " untruth " about management of the Iraq war as bad as Clinton 's lie about sex with Monica ?
In the course of pondering that idiocy ( even quoting " experts " comparing the two lies ) , Kurtz says this :
As Kurtz 's own column illustrates , journalists most certainly do not " shy away from pinning the ' liar ' label on any political leader . "
All of the wise and brave pundits and other Beltway luminaries -- one after the next -- fell all over themselves calling Bill Clinton a " liar " continuously because he claimed not to have had sex with Monica Lewinksy .
In that instance , they were more than happy to use the word " liar " as clearly and freely as can be imagined .
Journalists " shy away " from pinning the " liar label " not -- as Kurtz claims -- " on any political leader , " but on the specific political leaders who currently occupy the White House .
And for proof of that , Kurtz need look no further than his own newspaper , which appears to have engaged in some sort of Stalinist - like purging of history by zapping out of existence the Post 's accurate detailing of the President 's Press Conference admission of lying .
So the President got caught lying to the American people , several days before an election , about a matter of unquestionable importance -- namely , who will manage our war in Iraq and , more broadly , will the President change how the war is being managed ?
And not even the President claims there was some national security " justification " for lying .
It was a pure political calculus : " I did n't want to inject a major decision about this war in the final days of a campaign . "
( And incidentally , this is not the first time Bush lied this way ; last May , he assured reporters that Treasury Secretary John Snow was not leaving and specifically stated that Snow " has not talked to me about resignation , " even though Snow had already told the President he was leaving and the decision to replace Snow had already been made and finalized ) .
All Howie Kurtz can do is wonder whether this was as " on par with " the Greatest Evil Ever -- Bill Clinton 's lie about Monica Lewinsky .
Why did The Washington Post delete the passage in its own article detailing how the President misled reporters when he answered their questions about Rumsfeld ?
Presidents simply do not have the right to lie to Americans about important matters of public concern , particularly before a major election .
If we do n't embrace and enforce that standard , what standard exists ?
And if newspapers like the Post are too afraid to detail dishonest statements that come from our highest political officials -- to the point where they publish such revelations only to then surreptitiously delete them -- what possible purpose do journalists serve ? :
It seems that some people ( including certain bloggers ) are missing the point of this post completely .
The crux of the post is not about Bush 's lie regarding Rumsfeld , but instead , is about how The Washington Post reported this lie , and then un-reported it .
Some of the confusion may be my fault ( although the post title , by itself , seems to make that sufficiently clear ) , but this comment from sysprog is highly clarifying and , in its own right , worth reading . :
Even Newt Gingrich recognizes that the President essentially acknowledged at his Press Conference that he lied about Rumsfeld , and Gingrich objects Gingrich has all kinds of politically self - interested motives for trying to distance himself this way from this increasingly and unprecedentedly despised President , but he is right about what the President did .
If Byron York , James Joyner and Newt Gingrich can all recognize and say that the President admitted to lying at his Press Conference , why did The Washington Post delete that passage and deprive its readers of that knowledge ?

I 1997 sendte jeg et bidrag til Riksmålsforbundets tidsskrift " Ordet " som jeg kalte " Samnorsk , nynorsk , riksmål og ris . "
Artikkelen ble en smule redigert av Ordets redaksjon før den ble trykt , og en del av denne redigeringen var grei nok .
Tittelen ble f.eks , forkortet til " Tellemåter og ris . "
Jeg ble allikevel en smule skuffet over at noen av mine saftigste anarko - politiske bomber ble operert bort .
Derfor har jeg lagt den sensurerte delen av teksten i rød skrift .
Ordets redaksjon skal allikevel ha ros for at de beholdt min kraftige punchline på slutten , og de skal vite at jeg har forståelse for plassmangel .
Sensuren av fortellingen om Oslo Kretsfengsel var allikevel hard å svelge .
Tellemåter og ris
I 1950 ble det fattet et vedtak i Stortinget om " Den nye tellemåten " .
Det ble forbudt å si syvogtyve .
Tjue - sju var obligatorisk .
De fleste barn som i likhet med undertegnede befant seg i Frogners barnehaver i årene som fulgte , levde fremdeles i lykkelig uvitenhet og uskyld angående slike vedtak .
Noen av oss kom allikevel til å erfare tvangen som et ris - i bokstavelig forstand .
Jeg er neppe alene blant riksmålbrukere om å veksle mellom tradisjonelle og fornorskede tallord i dagligtale .
På telefonen sier jeg " tjue - to , seksti - ni , tolv , åtti-fire " , eller på amerikansk vis " to - to - seks - ni-en-to - åtte - fire . "
Om en venns fødselsdag sier jeg imidlertid at han fyller femogtredve på lørdag , selv om et bjerkeris skulle ha gjort ende på denne uvanen da jeg var seks år gammel .
Norske tallord har gitt meg både hodebry og sjelelig uro .
Mine besteforeldre var nemlig nynorsktalende målsakforkjempere .
I førskolealderen bodde jeg på Frogner , hvor min mor snakket riksmål .
Altså , mitt morsmål .
Ikkje noko " målet hennar mor " i Løvenskioldsgate nei , til tross for at min far fra tid til annen brukte kryptiske fremmede uttrykk som " graut " og " blaut " .
Årsaken til min fars verbale eksentrisiteter var at han var en innvandrer fra Telemark .
I feriene tok han meg ofte til gamlelandet Nedre Telemark , hvor farmor var fra Sunnfjord og farfar fra Vest - Telemark .
Sistnevnte hadde en så sær dialekt at min far måtte tre inn som tolk da jeg var fire .
I tillegg til nynorsken var mine besteforeldre pensjonerte skolelærere .
De likte derfor å avsette en times tid hver dag til å undervise meg i matematikk når jeg var på besøk , så jeg skulle bli ekstra flink når jeg begynte på skolen .
Bestefar var forøvrig en varm tilhenger av samnorskpolitikken , så det falt ham ekstra tungt for brystet å høre meg si " syvogtredve " når selveste Stortinget hadde vedtatt at " tretti- sju " var obligatorisk .
Denne såkalte " nye tellemåten " var så fremmed for en seks år gammel frognergutt at bestefar ble sint .
Da jeg i tillegg viste uvilje og antipati mot både nynorsk og ny tellemåte , ble bestefar så frustrert at han gikk ut og hentet et bjerkeris .
Deretter ble jeg beordret til å telle fra en til hundre :
" En , to , tre , fire , fem , seks , syv ... "
" Sju ! "
" Sju ! " Jeg ser på bestefar for å få bekreftet at han er fornøyd med min uttale av " sju " slik at jeg kan fortsette .
" Åtte , ni , ti ... "
Etter hvert tall frykter jeg en eksplosjon fra bestefar , for jeg husker ikke hvilke tallord han uttaler annerledes , dvs. ord jeg oppfatter som hans dialekt , men som for meg er fremmedlyder selv om jeg har lært å forstå dem .
" ... atten , nitten , tyve ... "
Endelig kommer det ventede bjeffet :
" Tjue ! " Bestefar fekter vilt med bjerkeriset .
" T...tj... tjue , enogtjue ... "
" Tjue - en , tjue - to , tjue - tre ! " Bjerkeriset dirrer truende foran ansiktet mitt .
" Tjue - en , tjue - to , tjue - tre , tjue - fire , tjue - fem , tjue - seks , tjue - syv ... "
" Sju !
Det heiter sju !
Tjue - sju ! "
Bestefars bevegelser er utålmodige .
" Tjue - sju , tjue - åtte , tjue - ni , ....?... tredve . "
Bjerkeriset treffer meg midt i pannen .
" Tretti ! "
" Tretti ! Tretti-en , tretti-to ... "
Isolert sett gir denne episoden et totalt misvisende bilde av bestefar .
Han døde da jeg var elleve , og jeg har bare varme minner om ham fra utallige fisketurer , eventyrlesning , sangunderholdning osv .
Og han ville aldri ha klart å slå meg med riset , bortsett fra det harmløse klasket i pannen .
Men det er interessant å merke seg at av alle spillopper jeg foretok meg som guttunge , var det ingenting som hisset bestefar opp mer enn når jeg insisterte på å bruke riksmål , som var mitt morsmål .
Jeg så ham aldri så oppskaket som da jeg skulle tvinges til å lære den nye tellemåten .
Det var muligens denne episoden , mer enn noen annen , som tente gnisten til både riksmålsfanatismen og anarkismen som meldte seg som brennende flammer i min sjel etter at jeg hadde begynt på skolen .
Poenget var ikke hva riset ble brukt til .
Hvis bestefar hadde vært stygg og slått meg , ville det ikke ha gjort noen forskjell .
Riset symboliserte tyranni , tvang og straff , og av en eller annen merkelig grunn lekte bestefar med tanken på at barn ble lydige av juling - eller ihvertfall av å bli truet med det .
Og dette riset skulle alts å gjøre en uskikkelig byunge til en kjekk og snill samnorskgutt .
Anstrengelsen var så mislykket at jeg ble hverken kjekk eller snill .
Jeg feiret min tyveårsdag - ikke tjueårsdag - bak Oslo Kretsfengsels låste porter og dører for cannabis , en utsøkt stimulans som jeg fremdeles ( 28 år senere ) anbefaler på det varmeste til alle kresne riksmålshedonister .
På dumhetens anstalt snakket jeg riksmål til de sosialt underutviklede analfabetene , de åndelige krøplingene som var dømt av skjebnen til å rasle med nøkler i statens tjeneste .
Det eneste disse stakkarene kunne tilby samfunnet lot seg høre som hule ekkoer fra metalldørenes klang .
Året etter døde bestemor , forh åpentligvis skånet for viten om hvor dypt jeg hadde sunket .
Fra da jeg var tolv til jeg var fjorten bodde jeg i Telemark , hvor jeg utbroderte mitt riksmål i tråd med André Bjerkes oppskriftsbøker , i protest mot den lokale verbale kulturp åvirkningen og mot bestefarskogens bjerkeris .
Det passet meg derfor utmerket at mitt neste oppholdssted ble Bergen , hvor språket var så blottet for hunkjønnsord at man snakket om " hønen på kuen " .
I Bergen var nynorsk så fremmed at det var en trøst å lære tysk samtidig .
Bergenske skoleelever måtte nemlig ty til logikken i tysk grammatikk for å takle norsk sidemål .
Som guttunge vekket jeg en viss oppsikt med mitt riksmål i Telemark , hvor min fars NRK - dyrkning av Landsmaalets Hellige Treenighet ­ nemlig Aasen , Vinje og Garborg ­ hadde gjort ham til en slags folkehelt .
Når jeg så ble spurt med et varmt og hyggelig smil om jeg var flink i nynorsk fordi jeg var " sonen til skodespelaren Gisle Straume " , ville jeg reagere med en forakt så iskald og nådeløs at man øyeblikkelig skiftet tema .
Bestefars ris gnistret stygt i øynene mine .
Mine besteforeldrene var begge født i 1880 .
Selv midt i sommervarmen gikk de med tykke lusekofter , og de hadde en utpreget angst for trekk uansett årstid .
Alt måtte være lufttett og godt innpakket .
Min far og hans tre søsken vokste opp i Holla , hvor den lokale dialekten ligger nærmest bokmål .
Men heime var det nynorsk , tjukke lusekofter , tette vindauge , Målsaka og Samnorsksaka .
Eivind og Brita Straume var forøvrig barneflokkens skulelærarar - også i norsk .
Denne bakgrunnen satte diverse spor i barna , som alltid tok til orde for samnorsk eller nynorsk til tross for at bokmål var dagligspråket deres - om enn ikkje målet hennar mor reint bokstaveleg tala .
Da jeg ryddet opp i min fars bo etter hans bortgang i 1988 , fant jeg ut at han hadde drasset med seg karakterbøkene , som var skrevet av foreldrene , overalt hvor han hadde flyttet i årenes løp .
En grunn til at han fulgte med i hva kritikerne hadde å si om hans scenekunst var at det var " hyggelig å få gode karakterer " .
Og selv om han i hele sitt liv brukte bokmål i sin dagligtale , satt han som representant for nynorsken i Norsk Språkråd .
Der representerte han altså målet hennar mor og luse kofta hans far .
Med karakterbok på baklommen .
Her bør det allikevel skytes inn at i 1964 , da min far var sjef for Den Nationale Scene i Bergen , spilte han professor Henry Higgins i André Bjerkes mesterlige oversettelse av My Fair Lady .
Denne oppgaven fikk han et meget stort utbytte av angående nyansene , rikdommene og mulighetene i norsk riksmål .
Til tross for at jeg begynte på folkeskolen i 1950 - årene , ble jeg skånet for samnorskpolitikkens verste livsvarige skader takket være flaks med norsklærere .
Det var pedagoger som verdsatte godt norsk , dvs. godt riksmål eller moderat bokmål .
Selv om to av dem var nynorskfolk .
Den ene av disse , senere stortingsmann Oddleif Fagerheim , mente at " Enten skal det være bokmål , eller så skal det være nynorsk . "
Fagerheim var imidlertid en av dem som praktiserte menings - og oppfatningstyranni når han rettet norske stiler .
Spesielt forarget ble denne politisk religiøse Arbeiderpartimannen da jeg skrev at skatt var tyveri og at ligningsvesenet var et monster med klør .
Lite visste han at myndighetene hadde gjort en feil med hensyn til min fattige mor som utelukkende livnærte seg av sang - og klaverundervisning i sin leilighet .
Ligningsvesenet kom for å ta pant i flygelet hennes , som var hennes eneste levebrød , selv om hun ikke eide nåla i veggen .
Denne episoden var en medvirkende faktor da jeg skrev den stilen som opprørte Fagerheim .
Også blant andre norsklærere fikk jeg etterhvert erfare at mine anarkistisk farvede meninger representerte en større trussel mot gode karakterer enn de forbudte riksmålsformene .
Det frie ord , hva er nå det ?
Kan ordet være fritt når selve tanken dikteres av Departementets politiske interesser ?
Når det blir forbudt å skrive at " skatt er tyveri " fordi " skatteunndragelse er tyranni " er en obligatorisk tanke som man ikke har lov til å sette seg opp imot , hva hjelper det da om man får lov til å bøye verb og substantiver som man vil ?
Spørsmålet om skatt er for komplisert til å besvares med denslags slagord og klisjéer .
Poenget er at skoleungdommen må innvilges total tanke - og ytringsfrihet hvis " det frie ord " skal ha noen som helst mening .
Bjerkeriset hadde innprentet de tradisjonelle tallordene i meg så sterkt at et atten års opphold i England og i USA måtte til før jeg innså den matematiske og praktiske fordelen med å si tieren før eneren , selv om dette avviker fra både tysk , dansk og norsk riksmål .
Da jeg hadde flyttet tilbake til Norge , falt det meg naturlig å bruke den fornorskede tellemåten for første gang uten å assosiere den med bestefars tåpelige bjerkekvist , spesielt ved oppramsing av siffere på telefonen ..
Det samme gjelder alt som har med matematikk , regnskap og denslags å gjøre .
" Se side femti- fire . "
Den fornorskede tellemåten er mindre høytidelig og mer dagligdags : " Hun blir toogtyve i juli . "
" Vi var treogfemti gjester . "
Osv .
Med andre ord :
Den fornorskede tellemåten med tieren foran eneren signaliserer presisjon og effektivitet , mens den tradisjonelle tellemåten er mer muntlig og hjemlig .
Den tradisjonelle tellemåten virker litt tungrodd i matematikkspråket , selv om vi forlengst har sløyfet danskegodset " halv tress " og alt det der .
Språklig sett har den allikevel en meget sterk livsdyktighet : " Vet du at bestemor har blitt niogåtti år gammel ? " Å si " åtti-ni " her virker som om hennes prestasjon er utregnet ved hjelp av kalkulator .
Min farmor presterte imidlertid å lande presist på det nøytrale tallet nitti som en slags siste gest til forsoning .
La oss derfor si at hun ble halv fems .
Enhver bruk av ris , enten i form av en bjerkekvist , en politikølle , et forelegg , en bot , en irettesettelse i rødt blekk eller en dårlig karakter , vil kun styrke opprøret enten det dreier seg om tallord eller skatt og tyveri .
Fagerheims reaksjon på min stil førte til at jeg ble bevisst anarkist som syttenåring , elleve år etter at bestefars bjerkeris hadde gjort meg språkpolitisk bevisst .
Nå er det et paradoks at riksmålsbevegelsen , som var intet mindre enn en sivil ulydighetskampanje og et folkeopprør , fikk en del støttespillere i politisk reaksjonære og konservative kretser som Aftenposten var et talsrør for .
Mennesker som slo ned på enhver form for ulydighet , ikke minst militærnekting og ordrenekt i krig , støttet allikevel litterær og verbal kriminalitet mot vårt lovgivende organ , Stortinget .
De varmeste forsvarere av politiets køllevold mot tenåringer på hjemmefronten og Pentagons folkemord ute i den store verden , opponerte samtidig mot Departementets språkpolitiske vedtak , mot Læreboknormalen og mot lærerstabens røde blekk .
Det ville være en stor glede for leserne hvis noen av disse autoritære riksmålstilhengerne bidro med en aldri så liten rasjonell forklaring på sin åpenbare schizofreni .
Tarjei Straume
By now , you ’ve probably read about the gadget blog Gizmodo ’s prank at CES , in which they used TV - B - Gone devices — universal remotes designed to shut off any TVs in their range — to shut off display models of TVs on the showroom floor and even to shut off TVs that were being used in live presentations .
Here ’s a YouTube video of their pranks :
I ’m of the opinion that shutting off display models on the showroom floor might be an acceptable prank , but interfering with a live presentation by shutting off the TV being used for slides crosses the lines of etiquette and ethics .
A number of people agree , and the flak that Gizmodo has received led editor Brian Lam to write an article defending their reporter ’s actions .
Here are a couple of excerpts :
But bloggers and trade journalists , so desperate for a seat at the table with big mainstream publications have it completely backwards :
You do n’t get more access by selling out for press credentials first chance you get , kowtowing to corporations and tradeshows and playing nice ; you earn your respect by fact finding , reporting , having untouchable integrity , provocative coverage and gaining readers through your reputation for those things .
Our prank pays homage to the notion of independence and independent reporting .
And no matter how much access the companies give us , we wo n’t ever stop being irreverent .
That ’s what this prank was about and what the press should understand .
…
Many of our harshest critics have done far worse than clicking off a few TVs .
I ’m talking about ethical lapses such as accepting paid junkets to Japan by Nikon , or free trips to Korea by Samsung .
Turning a blind eye to Apple ’s mistakes when they did n’t make an iPhone SDK and sought to lock down the handset .
Stock prices torn downward by publishing incorrect leaked info .
Writing about companies that also pay you for advertorial podcast work .
All of these examples are offenses from the last year .
And I consider those offenses far worse than our prank , because it ultimately it puts the perpetrators on the wrong team .
As one reporter put it while chiding me , “ Journalists are guests in the houses of these companies . ”
Not first and foremost !
We are the auditors of companies and their gadgets on behalf of the readers .
In this job , integrity and independence is far more important than civil or corporate obedience .
Every tech journalist has to decide whether or not he ’s writing for companies or for readers .
When they start writing for the companies , covering all their press releases and regurgitating marketing jargon , you do no one any favors ( not even the companies , which already hire press release machines ) .
To borrow a quote from Tom Waits :
Get off the cross ; we could use the wood .
There ’s a difference between “ civil disobedience ” and “ asshole ” .
The “ I ’m keepin ’ it real ” defense is the resort of idiot rappers and performance artists who ’ve come under fire for going too far ; it ’s the mark of a mind that lacks the will or the wherewithal to get past those unresolved “ rebelling against Mommy and Daddy ” issues .
As far Lam ’s implication that if you ’re not rude to “ the companies ” , you ’re kowtowing to them , that ’s a lame high school debating tactic called a false dichotomy .
In his weak defense of their use of the TV - B - Gone device , Lam seems to have forgotten Gizmodo ’s earlier stance on the device .
Here ’s their October 2004 review of TV - B - Gone : ( thanks to Webware and Zoli Erdos for pointing this out ! )
Mitch Altman is an asshole .
And not just any asshole , but one of those snotty holier - than - thou types who has nothing better to do with the money he made as a founder of 3 ware than to develop a device with the sole purpose of imposing his viewpoint on others .
See , Altman hates the television and its encroachment into public space .
Rather than just doing what most everybody else has done — which is either not really caring or , failing that , getting the fuck over it — Altman has invented a device called the ‘ TV - B - Gone ’ ( obviously having expended every last vapor of his creative ability developing the product , he was left to co-opt the most obvious name schtick ever ) .
Essentially a universal remote that cycles through every possible code , the TV - B - Gone has a single purpose : to power off televisions whenever the user feels like being a dick .
Read the Wired News profile , where Altman wanders through a city , turning off other peoples ’ televisions , peppering his behavior with such gems as , “ We just saved him several minutes of his life . ”
Maybe after making his tens of dozens of dollars on the TV - B - Gone , Altman can invent a gadget that transports self - important cocks who think they ’re waging a subversive culture war to a log cabin coffee shop where they can reassure each other how awesome they are for hating television .
Free berets for the first 100 pricks to use the word “ Sheeple ! ”
“ Power off televisions whenever the user feels like being a dick ” ?
“ Self - important cocks who think they ’re waging a subversive culture war ” ?
How eerily prescient , yet unaware !
I ’ll leave the last word to Josh Catone of ReadWriteWeb :
It 's almost two years since the debut of Chris Paine 's documentary Who Killed the Electric Car ?
The movie has been a success in US theatres and often comprises one half of a double bill with Al Gore 's An Inconvenient Truth .
But what the success of the movie tells us is more alarming than any conspiracy it purports to unveil : a disdain for engineering , for technological innovation , and most of all a disdain for us , the consumers .
It 's the story of General Motors ' ill - fated EV1 electric car .
A hundred years ago , Who Killed ?
observes , General Motors bought up trolley car firms just to close this source of competition down .
Today , it suggests , a covert alliance of Big Oil , Big Auto and corrupt regulators , both in California and in the federal government , has killed the electric car .
Vogueishly , Who Killed the Electric Car ? makes transparent all the evil personalities connected around these three forces .
In legal style , it finds them guilty of murdering General Motors ' two - seater Electric Vehicle 1 ( EV1 ) .
It shows the usual nauseating network of silver - haired execs , lobbyists and politicos , but gives some emphasis to George W Bush ( a quack salesman for hydrogen cars ) and Alan Lloyd , chairman of the California Air Resources Board ( CARB ) , 1999 - 2004 .
Hand made
The story starts in 1996 , with GM putting EV1s ' all over California ' - or at least that 's the claim with which the film opens .
In fact , GM made a total of just 800 , which does n't say much for the machine 's real ubiquity .
GM's Saturn division built four a day , by hand .
Each cost $ 250 - 500 a month to rent , which is by no means exorbitant .
Quite a few EV1s were lent to celebrities , including Mel Gibson , Ted Danson .
Indeed , Tom Hanks told the David Letterman show that a single charge for a range of 70 - 80 miles a day was all he needed personally .
Anyway ,
Hanks proclaimed somewhat tongue in cheek , " I'm saving America " .
GM's EV1 electric car
But GM 's heart was n't in it , the movie explains .
From its smoked glass HQ in Detroit , the company failed to promote the EV1 .
GM's ad campaign - shock , horror !
- failed to feature good looking men and women .
GM pointed up the car 's limitations , and Gibson and Danson were asked to make deeply bureaucratic ' case statements ' about it .
Then oil firms campaigned against the state of California spending public money on roadside electrical charging stations .
Soon , too , Mobil mobilised editorials hostile to the electric car in the pages of USA Today and Newsweek .
Some time after 1987 , when GM chief Roger Smith first challenged his company 's designers to come up with an electric vehicle , the California Air Resources Board became interested in the project .
CARB had seen GM 's first prototype of the EV1 , the fatefully misnamed Impact .
In 1990 , CARB passed the Zero Emission Vehicle Mandate , requiring a rising percentage of California 's cars to be free of emissions .
Not too long after that , however , US car manufacturers negotiated a Master Memorandum of Agreement with CARB ensuring that the mandate require them to build the electric car only to the extent that there was consumer demand for it .
[ erlang - questions ]
My biggest beef with Erlang
Sorry , I think you are wrong there .
You have a number of problems when detecting / handling safe functions and calling user defined functions in guards : -
It is relatively easy to work which local functions are safe , but when you call another module you suddenly leaping without a safety net .
Yes , you could analyse that functions within modules but that would not guarantee that at run -time this was so .
It has nothing to do with if I explicitly call a module or through a variable , at * run - time * I have no guarantees .
This would mean that you would either have to tag functions at compile time and check at run -time or trap unsafe system calls .
- dict ( and sets , gb_trees , array , etc ) is actually safe as it does no destructive updates .
- if you were to detect unsafe functions / system calls then what would it actually * mean * when you hit one .
The guard is neither true nor false , just unprovable .
Today with only simple type and value tests this is not a problem , for example " when 2 * A > 4 " contains an implicit type test of A. - it would make it difficult to functions from " unknown " modules as I would not know if they were safe or not .
- it would mean that many tests which seem perfectly reasonable and used in code would not be allowed in guards , and this would create confusion to the poor user .
Seriously .
- the semantics of error handling is different in guards from in expressions ( normal function calls ) .
In a guard an error is handled as false while in a normal function call it generates an error .
That would mean you have to keep track of where you are in a call - stack and know how to handle errors in this case .
For example the ( trivial ) function : is_even ( I ) -> ( I rem 2 ) == 0 . would have to know if it called from a guard or expression .
You could wrap user function calls in guards with a try but then I think it is getting a bit heavy in the implementation .
- as Joe mentioned guards are just extensions of pattern matching and really should n't be considered as anything else .
- allowing users to do dangerous thing like removing the is_guard_bif checking would be very unsafe and seriously compromise the robustness of the emulator .
- really all that is left are functions which just contain expressions which are allowed in guards .
If you are going to come up with a definition of guards which contain calls to user defined functions then you have cover * every * possible case .
Just doing for reasonable usage is not the problem , users are usually unreasonable and will dream up cases which the poor language designer and compiler writer never thought anyone would ever consider doing .
We have had this problem before .
It would probably be better to define a ' cond ' which is an extension of ' if ' ( i.e. lisp cond ) which allows user defined functions in tests but does not have the special error handling in guards .

The White Rose was a student resistance group in Nazi Germany .
Their 4th leaflet talked about the need to put Hitler on trial .
Not that the members of the White Rose felt that any punishment given to Hitler could restore justice ; but that such a trial would serve as a warning for tyrant wannabes ( http://www.jlrweb.com/whiterose/leaffoureng.html).
If only the peace movement of the 60's and 70's had insisted on the same course of action for Presidents Johnson and Nixon , then we could have ended the war with a precedent rather than a condition .
It was n't too long after the end of that war that Presidents Reagan and Bush I looked at the " Vietnam Syndrome " as a weakness to overcome .
Today 's peace movement must follow the example of the White Rose rather than the Vietnam War 's peace movement .
We cannot afford to be satisfied with the mere withdrawal of all troops from Iraq .
We must demand from current government officials and all candidates that they promise to put President Bush on trial for his invasion of Iraq .
This is necessary so that potential scoundrels can be given a moment for pause .
The call for this trial is because Bush ’s War has very possibly violated international law .
The international law that President Bush may have broken is that of conducting a War of Aggression , a crime that Nazi Germany was found guilty of at the Nuremburg trials .
In our case , we claimed that Iraq could attack us with WMDs and thus the Bush Administration decided to strike first .
This is part of an overall national strategy of using preventive war ( what Ferencz refered to as " pre-emptively " here ) that reminds former Nuremburg prosecutor Benjamin Ferencz , of a Nazi defense for some of their atrocities in WWII ( http://www.benferencz.org/arts/85.html).
Our invasion of Iraq is often mistakenly called a pre-emptive war than a preventive war .
Chomsky describes the difference between the two by noting that a pre-emptive attack interrupts an ongoing or imminent attack while a preventive attack thwarts an anticipated attack that might occur farther into the future ( http://www.ccmep.org/2003_articles/Iraq/040203_iraq_is_a_trial_run_chomsky_inte.htm).
The question becomes , is putting President Bush on trial for war crimes worth it ?
The answer is YES !
First , by insisting that our country follows international law rather than act as an international dictator would show that we are more dedicated to principle over partisanship and more committed to equality over national " interests . "
Now our government often proclaims its dedication to international law by pointing out the sins of others — particularly when the transgressor is an adversary .
But how does charging an antagonist with violating international law show that we believe in the rule of law ?
Often , such charges are based on selective or filtered information .
The trial of Saddamn Hussein serves as a perfect example .
Certainly , Saddamn Hussein was guilty of horrific crimes of using WMDs .
But it was not until his invasion of Kuwait that we became concerned about his crimes .
Proof of this is that for most of his crimes , we were providing him with materials to build WMDs .
When we helped put Saddamn on trial , we only showed our contempt for Saddamn .
If we had put his accessories on trial , including our former leaders , then it would mean that we were truly interested in principle .
Allowing others to hold us accountable would mean that we are pursuing equality over self - interest .
Being more committed to principle and equality even when it costs us would give us a unique position in the world .
It would give us the kind of moral authority which we assume to have when we accuse others of doing wrong .
For example , what if we effectively objected to our friend Israel 's oppressive occupation against the Palestinians ?
Would we not have more credibility in demanding the cessation of atrocities in Dafur ?
But since we overlook Israel 's crimes , how can we show that we are truly interested in law and justice in Dafur ?
Finally , the more we allow international law to limit our own actions , the more we can call on other nations to do the same .
The more self - restraint employed by all , the less the need for a strongman to push others around .
We should note that strongmen often see the law as something that gets in the way of what they want to do .
By acting as a strongman , we have put the whole world in danger .
This is because control causes conflict .
And in a world where an ever advancing and promiscuous technology has put us on the eve of proliferation ; the more control that is exercised by anyone , the more likely worldwide catastrophic attacks will occur .
We see this growing probability when we note the renewed arms race between the U.S and both Russia and China .
We see this growing probability when we note that since our invasion of Iraq , both worldwide terrorism and the number of terrorist recruits have increased .
So if acting as the world 's strongman is not working , why not act as an equal ?
And the first step in acting as an equal is to treat President Bush as we would treat any other world leader who has broken international laws .
Put him on trial !
Poll : Iraqis say surge has failed , 45 % want immediate US withdrawal David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Monday September 10 , 2007
Print This Email This General Petraeus is expected to testify on Capitol Hill today that the surge is working and that he needs more time .
However , both Congress and the American public are already skeptical about his evaluation , with a new CBS News - New York Times poll showing that 57 % believe the surge has either had no impact or made things worse and that 65 % want some or all of US troops to be removed from Iraq .
ABC
News reports also that a new poll commissioned by ABC and BBC shows that 65 - 70 % of Iraqis say that security conditions are worse since the surge and 45 % want an immediate American withdrawal .
Most strikingly , in Baghdad and even in Anbar -- touted as the area of greatest US success -- attitudes towards the surge were 100 % negative .
Baghdad correspondent Lara Logan told CBS
News that Iraqis do n't feel any safer as a result of the surge and doubt that any reduction in violence will be permanent .
Even American soldiers who are trying to make a difference say that the Iraqi commanders they work with are being undercut by their own government .
There are no signs that either Shia or Sunni leaders have any interest in a unified , secular Iraq .
The following video clips are from CBS 's Early Show and ABC's Good Morning America , broadcast on September 10 .
President Bush has defended his decisions on Darfur and stood by his actions in Iraq in an interview with the BBC .
This is the full version of the interview .
Matt Frei interviewed President Bush for BBC World News America .
Momentum against the Iowa first - in - the - nation caucus is sure to explode after Thursday , as many people get their first real close - up look at its undemocratic nature .
First , a look at how the caucuses work :
As in years past , voters must present themselves in person , at a specified hour , and stay for as long as two .
And if these caucuses are anything like prior ones , only a tiny percentage of Iowans will participate .
In 2000 , the last year in which both parties held caucuses , 59,000 Democrats and 87,000 Republicans voted , in a state with 2.9 million people .
In 2004 , when the Republicans did not caucus , 124,000 people turned out for the Democratic caucuses [...]
While the Republican caucuses are fairly simple — voters can leave shortly after they declare their preferences —
Democratic caucuses can require more time and multiple candidate preferences from participants .
They do not conform to the one - person , one - vote rule , because votes are weighted according to a precinct ’s past level of participation .
Ties can be settled by coin toss or picking names out of a hat .
So what does this mean , in practical terms ?
Jason Huffman has lived in Iowa his whole life .
Lately he has been watching presidential debates on the Internet , discussing what he sees with friends and relatives .
But when fellow Iowans choose among presidential candidates on Thursday night , he will not be able to vote , because he is serving with the National Guard in western Afghanistan .
" Should n’t we at least have as much influence in this as any other citizen ? "
Captain Huffman wrote in an e-mail interview .
Nope , Cpt. Huffman is out of luck .
As are these folks :
" It disenfranchises certain voters or makes them make choices between putting food on the table and caucusing , " said Tom Lindsey , a high school teacher in Iowa City .
Mr. Lindsey plans to attend this year , but his neighbors include a cook who cannot slip away from his restaurant job on Thursday night and a mother who must care for her autistic child [...]
But many Iowans have been dutifully watching presidential candidates all summer and fall only to find themselves unable to participate on caucus night .
Take Sally Kreamer , a single mother in Johnston , outside Des Moines , who says she cannot escape the pull of her children ’s dinner and homework .
" I would love to participate , " Ms. Kreamer said .
Or Carrie Tope , who works at a hospital emergency room in Ames and cannot find anyone to take her shift .
She particularly wants to vote this year , she said , because things are so close .
Even some campaign volunteers " have bosses who say , ‘ We really need you at work that night , ’ " said Jennifer O’Malley Dillon , state director for John Edwards .
" Unfortunately , they just are n’t going to be able to participate , " she said .
And the Iowa Democratic Party response to what is a hideous way to conduct an election ?
Scott Brennan , chairman of the Iowa Democratic Party , said the party had no responsibility to ensure that voters can caucus .
" The campaigns are in charge of generating the turnout , " Mr. Brennan said , and the voters who truly care will find their way to their local caucuses .
As for Ms. Tope , the emergency room worker , " there ’s always the next cycle , " Mr. Brennan said .
What an elitist asshole .
Yet this ridiculous process he defends will disenfranchises thousands of Iowans as it disenfranchises millions of voters around the country who would like a chance to vote for their favorite primary candidate but will never get the chance .
There 's an entire nation out there -- 48 states plus D.C. -- who have tired of this ridiculous calendar and undemocratic way of choosing our nominee .
Iowa and New Hampshire will fight like hell to retain their lofty status -- it 's worth prestige points and a crapload of money for those states .
But no matter what those states may think , they do n't have a god - given right to hold our nomination process hostage to their whims ( and parochial concerns like ethanol ) .
They should enjoy these next two weeks , because this is likely their swan song .
If you 've ever " dreamed of writing for a living " and love BioWare games , you may want to take a gander at BioWare Austin 's job board .
Here 's a bit more information about what they 're looking for , straight from the folks themselves :
What we 're looking for is what BioWare is always looking for : that strange mix of passionate writer and giant BioWare fan .
Industry experience is n't that big a deal since no other company really trains writers the way we do .
We 've had successful candidates come straight from college , from the film industry , it 's pretty unpredictable – one of our writers up North was working as a gift wrapping clerk in Singapore .
What unites all of our writers is that they love BioWare games and they have a passion for creating the kind of stories they 'd want to play through .
If you 're interested in taking a crack at it , BioWare suggests you " pick up a copy of Neverwinter Nights " and try writing some characters .
Do n't worry about the scripting part of the toolset , they say , just use the dialog editor to showcase your skills .
Now get to work on crafting those scenes of hot alien chick on alien chick action !

Israel has admitted its jets attacked a Syrian target on September 6
In one of the fictional detective Sherlock Holmes ' most famous cases , the crime was solved by a vital clue - the dog that did not bark in the night .
And in the real - life drama of the Israeli Air Force 's raid on a target in Syria last month , there are two particular " dogs " that have not barked .
For all of its protests the Syrian government has done as little as possible to play up the incident .
There have been no trips for journalists to visit the bomb craters , no orchestrated campaign to condemn Israel for what in any other circumstances would be seen as an unwarranted act of aggression .
In the United States the diplomatic effort to engage North Korea and roll back its nuclear programme has remained on track , despite all the suggestions that what the Israelis actually hit was a North Korean - supplied nuclear research facility in Syria .
Wall of silence
Indeed there are indications that North Korean scientists and technicians may have been killed or wounded in the attack .
North Korea 's involvement in spreading nuclear technology and know - how might , in most circumstances , be expected to draw strong condemnation from Washington .
More than four weeks after the air strike during the early hours of 6 September , hard facts about the operation remain scarce .
There are indications that North Korean scientists may have been killed in the attack
In Israel the episode has been surrounded by an unusually high degree of military censorship .
Pundits and military experts who profess to know many of the details of the operation are saying nothing .
The leader of Israel 's conservative Likud opposition party , Binyamin Netanyahu , was the first to break the wall of silence .
His apparent confirmation of an Israeli operation against a Syrian target drew considerable criticism from his political opponents .
At the end of last month Syrian Vice - President Farouk Ashara said the target attacked by the warplanes was " an academic research centre for the study of arid soil " .
Subsequently Syrian President Basher al - Assad had a different story , telling the BBC that the target was " an unused military building " .
This acknowledgement that an attack really did take place seems to have opened the way for a partial lifting of the censorship restrictions in Israel , with confirmation of the raid but still no details about the target , the nature of the forces involved , or any assessment of its success .
American leaks
There have been suggestions that Israel delayed the operation at Washington 's request and reports that Israel sent soil samples from the location to the US for analysis , as proof of their contention of a nuclear connection .
These reports amplify earlier suggestions that elite Israeli troops were present on the ground as part of the operation .
Most recently , reports in The New York Times speak of divisions within the Bush administration , with contrasting views as to the significance of the intelligence the Israelis had provided .
The administration , says the report , was divided along predictable fault lines with Vice - President Dick Cheney and " conservative hawks " in the Administration believing that the Israeli intelligence was credible and should prompt a reassessment of Washington 's opening to North Korea .
US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Defence Secretary Robert Gates were said to be much more cautious .
Deterrent capability restored
Either way the operation clearly went ahead .
That it did so at a time of escalating Israeli - Syrian tension is indicative in itself .
Either the Israelis believed that the stakes were so high and the intelligence so strong that the risks were worth it .
Or alternatively they may have taken the view that such an operation was the best way of reminding President Assad that Israel 's military reach had not been stunted by its failures in southern Lebanon last year .
Some days after the operation , Israeli Defence Forces Intelligence chief General Amos Yadlin made a statement to the effect that Israel 's deterrent capability had been restored .
Or maybe he did not , because an official denial of his comments was subsequently released .
Did he bark or maybe should he have remained silent ?
BREAKING

Contributor , [ GAS ]
UPDATE : Op - Ed News reports that the N.H. Sec. of State has recieved a check for $ 55,600 from a single anonymous doner to the Howard campaign , and the both the Democratic and Republican N.H. primary recount will proceed .
[ GAS ] has not yet independently verified this information .
The future of a recount in N.H. ’s Republican Primary is uncertain – possibly because of PayPal , Inc .
By now , most people have heard of the drive by Dennis Kucinich ’s campaign that is raising funds for a recount of the New Hampshire Democratic Primary , which has been marred by accusations of electronic voting fraud from the AccuVote optical ballot scanners , made by Premier Election Solutions ( formerly Diebold . )
But few know about Republican candidate Albert Howard ’s call for a recount of the New Hampshire Republican Primary .
A quick rundown of the issue for the uninitiated :
It turns out that voters in New Hampshire whose votes were counted by the AccuVote system were more likely to vote for Clinton than Obama , where in hand - counted precincts , the reverse was true .
The prevailing theories are A ) Larger cities in New Hampshire were both more likely to use voting machines and more likely to vote Clinton , or B ) The voting machines screwed up .
However , the voting machines in New Hampshire are only vote scanners , not touchscreen voting machines .
That means that there is a paper trail , and it is this paper trail that will be getting the recount .
In order for there to be a recount in New Hampshire , candidates were required to , essentially , put $ 2000 down and pay for a significant portion of the full cost of the recount by the 15th of January – yesterday , so that the recount can happen today .
According to workers in the New Hampshire Secretary of State ’s office , Kucinich has paid about $ 27,000 – a little less than half of the total projected cost of the recount .
Albert Howard has also paid $ 2000 down , and through the work of a number of groups , including the “ Granny Warriors , ” a group nominally supporting Ron Paul , it looked like Howard had raised at least $ 40,000 for the recount via the PayPal service .
However , PayPal froze the account , and they have not been able to get the money out of the account before the January 15th deadline , according to a spokesman for the Granny Warriors .
Though details are sketchy at this point , an unconfirmed report states that PayPal froze the account when a $ 1000 donation came through the service .
This does n’t seem that farfetched , as there have been previous occasions in which PayPal arbitrarily froze funds for obscure reasons .
The Granny Warrior spokesman who I talked to urged me to quickly get off the phone because they were busy waiting for a phone call on the line to resolve this situation .
Speaking with the same worker at the NH Secretary of State ’s office , I was told that a Democratic recount was likely to occur , and that the fate of the Republican recount was uncertain .
This is a breaking story and we ’ll try to have more updates with more detail as more information becomes available .

We all want these
By Finlo Rohrer
BBC News Magazine
MPs are being asked , so are police officers , so are prison officers .
Across the public sector workers are being urged to accept modest pay settlements , but would you take an effective pay cut because society needs you to ?
Gordon Brown wants you to do something .
He'd be really happy if you would accept a pay rise of , say , 2 % .
With the Consumer Price Index - one of the key measures of inflation - standing at 2.1 % that would be a small real pay decrease .
If you take the Retail Price Index measure of 4 % it is a big cut .
VOTE RESULTS
Would you take a pay cut to help keep inflation down ?
Yes 14.71 %
No 77.68 %
Do n't know 7.60 % 15325 Votes Cast Results are indicative and may not reflect public opinion
And if that 's really too much of a privation for you , could you certainly keep it under 2.5 % ?
It would really help the economy at a time when things are not looking too rosy .
Anything over that really would be rather imprudent .
Mr Brown 's not the first prime minister to urge pay restraint , particularly among public sector workers , to provide a brake on inflation .
High prices for oil , food and other commodities are among the main drivers of inflation , but public sector salaries are one of the few parts of the economy that Brown can have a direct effect on .
If there are big pay settlements across the whole of the UK workforce then it might contribute to inflation , and as we all know , too much inflation is bad .
In one newspaper last month , Gordon Brown was said to have described MPs who desired an above - inflation pay rise as " selfish " .
That kind of emotive language is hard to square with the image of the prime minister , but there is no doubt that many of the protagonists in the current rows over pay take the matter personally .
WHAT IS ' MONEY ILLUSION '?
Where a worker on £ 10,000 a year getting a £ 1,000 pay rise at a time of 11 % inflation feels less hard done by than ... ... a worker who gets no pay rise at a time when there is negligible inflation MPs should be setting an example , Brown thinks , to encourage the rest of the public sector to accept their 2 % or thereabouts without trying to force the government 's hand with protests and strikes .
For some there may even be a moral as well as a practical argument .
Could you accept a pay cut or a low pay rise for the greater good ?
And should you ?
According to Parantap Basu , professor of economics at Durham University , we are not very good at accepting a reduction in the figure we earn , even if we are not losing out in real terms .
" People wo n't accept a wage cut of 10 % even if prices go down 10 % and so you have the same purchasing power .
Workers attach more importance to nominal wage not real wage , " Basu says .
We want an increase in the numbers , whatever the circumstances .
A drop in our nominal salary accompanied by a rise in our real salary , say at a time of heavy deflation , makes us unhappy .
Economists call this " money illusion " .
INFLATION Consumer Price Index : 2.1 % Retail Price Index : 4 % RPIX : 3.1 % ( RPI excluding mortgage interest )
Different measures of prices of goods and services
And where workers do accept a drop or a minimal rise in their nominal wage , there tends to be a simple trade - off .
Some time ago tanker drivers at the British Oxygen Company were told that they needed to work longer hours for no extra money so the company could fight off competition .
The change helped and within two years the drivers had negotiated a 20 % pay rise .
It shows people are quite capable of accepting short - term privation for medium - term gain .
A moral case ?
But the situation for public sector workers is more complicated .
There will be no chance of a big payday in the medium term .
Besides , many workers in the private sector will be getting pay rises markedly above inflation .
Economists think of people as rational agents pursuing maximum utility
Those who get plump rises would then benefit from inflation being under control while at the same time enjoying their rises .
Those who accept restraint will have helped others who are not contributing .
So is there a moral case ?
Are those who accept pay restraint making a contribution to society , discharging an obligation ?
Philosopher Julian Baggini says he has every sympathy for those who are pressing for higher wages , but suggests that restraint is really all about practical considerations rather than our duty to our fellow man .
" In the long run it is to their benefit if the economic argument is right .
If inflation is stoked their money will be worth less .
The burden is n't being spread evenly , but the burden is never being spread evenly " People do n't protest if their wealth increases at a faster rate than anyone else 's .
They only complain when it's they who have to suffer . "
Roger Crisp , a fellow of Oxford Uehiro Centre for Practical Ethics , says it 's possible to make a case that the appeal for pay restraint is an appeal to our moral sense .
150's your limit " There is a difference between asking people to make some sacrifice and saying we are going to impose some sacrifice on you .
It is entirely reasonable to ask for it .
It is entirely reasonable to say no . "
It 's possible but it requires some kind of grand project , by creating a sense of community among 60 m people
Robin Dunbar
And if we do n't acknowledge that there is a moral element to accepting lower pay , it may be because we have problems with the scale on which we are being asked to act .
Gordon Brown 's appeal is for individuals within the public sector to see sense , on the basis their claims will affect the entire British population .
Anthropologists say we can comprehend the need to co-operate on a small - scale ; understanding the need to work with a family or a team to achieve a common goal .
But can we inspire co-operation in a society of 60 million ?
Prof Robin Dunbar , director of Oxford University 's Institute of Cognitive and Evolutionary Anthropology , thinks it is n't easy .
" The group sizes that are our natural environment are extremely small - the limit is about 150 people .
This 150 seems to set the limit on the number of people you can know as persons , you know how they fit into your social group and how you fit into theirs .
" It is defined really in terms of those people to whom you owe obligations and from whom you can expect obligation .
The people you expect not to cheat you . "
Rational agents
Thus it is very hard for us to do something for a group of 60 million people , all of whom are making different levels of sacrifice and enjoying different levels of reward .
The police say they have had a real terms pay cut " To create what you are having to do is to create almost a fiction that really all these other people are part of the group of 150 .
It 's possible but it requires some kind of grand project , by creating a sense of community , " says Prof Dunbar .
But the good news is that the assumptions of economists is not that we will all do our bit for the collective good .
Instead many assume that we as individuals are rational agents attempting to maximise our utility - the amount of happiness we can gain from material things - in the prevailing economic climate .
On our own we can do nothing to affect the broader sweep of the economy .
" Even if you understand your actions ' effects on inflation you cannot influence others actions , " says Prof Basu .
Person
A might demand an above - inflation pay increase , while person B meekly accepts a pay cut .
Even with larger groups , such as unions , they may act in different ways , often cancelling each other out .
But while there may be some who prefer to think of Brown 's appeal in terms of pure take - it - or - leave - it pragmatism , there will always be some who equate it with a question of duty .
Below is a selection of your comments : I would gladly accept a pay rise of 2 % providing it was 2 % of the MP 's wages and not 2 % of mine .
Colin , Isle Of Wight Public sector wages DON'T contribute to inflation in any direct way .
Public sector wages always react to inflation retrospectively .
The irritating thing in the " public vs. private " wage argument is that apparent increases in headline average salaries in the public sector are mainly caused by middle and senior managers and specialists having to be recruited from the private sector , and having to be offered private sector salaries to attract them .
The cost of this then comes out of the paybill for the rank - and - file .
And then , to add insult to injury , often these managers are no more competent than the public sector ones they replace .
Robert Day , Coventry , UK
It seems we are running a duel economy , with those in the public sector , still being shielded from the harsh realities of the ' global market ' .
I have an engineering degree and postgraduate degree , I have no savings , no pension , I have not had a pay rise for six years , and I know that there are others like me .
The public services should wake up .
We are all not facing in the same economic direction .
Mark , Yorkshire
Its easy for Brown to say there should be restraint , when he earns over £ 100,000 .
Tim , UK
Those professors you mention above and the MPs can probably afford to accept a minimal or zero percent increase .
The majority of us however , will need that increase to pay the higher cost of the fuel , the food and the council taxes that are being imposed on us month after month .
It is about time inflation was measured using real commodities .
Gordon Browns argument is flawed - he wants us to accept minimum increase to help their description of inflation - but it is the real inflation that drives our need for real rises .
Andrew , Lancaster
There is nothing new in this - very time the government feels inflationary pressure the pleas go out for " restraint " - under MacMillan , under Wilson , under Heath - same issue , same cure .
it 's particularly obscene given the lack of restraint in pay in the top quartile , and the conspicuous lack of any redistributive policies from the " Labour " government .
the objective is to shaft the PAYE sector at all costs .
I 'd be much happier if you focussed on the con game that is going on with the use of indices here .
For most of my life the RPI was the accepted index for inflation .
The decision to move to the CPI hides the fact that real cost of living ( shown by the RPI ) is accelerating MUCH more rapidly than pay for over 50 % of the population .
Geoff Cathcart , Farnborough
There is no mention in the above discussion of productivity gains , which is another factor in the equation .
If you are living in a country which is enjoying growth , ie its GNP is increasing , which is the case in the UK , and inflation is low , then you still might reasonably expect a pay rise because the growth must be fuelled by increased productivity .
If you are not sharing in the benefits of increased productivity , then all those benefits are being funnelled into profits and only management and shareholders are benefiting , which is unreasonable .
John Marsh , Fairfax , Virginia , USA
Yes , I 'd be happy to forego a pay rise and why not ?
Unless you 're on the poverty line then what 's the problem ?
The fuss some people make over a few quid is utterly beyond me - small - minded , selfish little homo - sapiens .
Wake up people - there are much more important things in life than money .
James , Bristol , UK Reading this makes me feel really proud to work for a company that only gives an inflationary pay rise , once every four years on average .
At least the company I work for , is doing its part in trying to hold back inflation .
It 's so refreshing to think I 'm effectively taking a pay cut each year , when all the hard working civil servants are only receiving a miserable inflationary pay rise .
Did I mention the pension they get or the above average , annual leave allowance ?
The poor things , they are so hard done by .
But who am I to complain , as I read the headlines of council tax rising by a mere 4 % while I take yet another annual inflationary pay cut , service bills are only going up by about 10 to 15 % , I 'm sure my annual inflationary pay cut will cover them !
Clive Carter , Plymouth Following the Agenda for Change pay system introduced into the NHS , I already AM taking a pay cut for the greater good .
Eleanor , Glasgow I can see the fiscal arguments for this , but for a low paid teacher / nurse / policeman to accept a small increase to then see lawyers , bankers and property developers boasting of huge bonuses must be galling .
Maybe the government should tax private sector pay increases above inflation at a higher rate to pay for a decent living wage for public servants .
Adam , London I work in the private sector and me and my senior colleagues & directors suffered a business disaster a few years back due to market conditions .
We all took a 40 % pay cut for the company to survive and we are still well below contracted salaries by about 25 % - and working 50 hour weeks .
Pensions are shot to hell , family life has taken a pounding - and no we are not on high salaries .
Public sector workers are " safe " whereas private company workers take far more risks in the main .
Ken , Glasgow
The problem is that it is always the same people who fall on their swords for the benefit of the others .
How about private industry taking a hit on their bonuses and perks so that the public sector can have a breath of air for a change ?
I 'm working in the public sector and for many people this time around , it is meaning a serious impact on the core parts of life , food , heating and a roof over the head ... it has become that serious .
The government can force the public sector in ways which they can't force the private sector .
We are always the easy targets .
No more , Mr Brown .
No more .
Michelle Knight , Haywards Heath , UK Oh , please !
Welcome to the real world .
In the private sector , many of us have been receiving small increases or none at all for the last several years , while watching public sector groups striking until they receive comparatively huge increases .
Now the boot's on the other foot - and that 's just life .
If you do n't like it , leave , and get a job somewhere else , like the rest of us have to .
Maria , Farnborough , UK With council tax expected to rise between 4 % and 6 % in most UK counties , do you really believe that we will swallow the idea that accepting a pay award below the rate of inflation is fair , moral and for the greater good ?
Perhaps parliament should be paying more attention to the out - of - control spending by local government ( whilst , I may note , our social amenities and service standards steadily decline ) in order to seek to curtail inflation .
Disposable income in Cardiff is down to an average of 3 % , with over 90 % of salary being consumed by cost of living and taxation .
You do the math !
Steve Swann , Cardiff , Wales I think it needs to be clarified that in general , Public Sector workers have not had pay increases equal or even slightly above inflation for many years .
I worked in the Public Sector between 1986 & 1999 , the last time I recall having an inflation equalling or higher increase must have been around 1993 .
Paul Melvin , Fife , Scotland I am a public sector worker , and as such am one of the people having to take a real term pay cut .
It is getting to the stage where it is uneconomical for me to continue to work .
I have no spare cash after all my basic bills are paid .
My electricity has just gone up 15 % , petrol is rising continually , my carparking has gone up 3 % , my childcare has gone up by 5 % , food costs are going up too .
All this on a wage rise of 2 % - the ends are ceasing to meet .
Jo , Leicestershire I work for a medium sized engineering / manufacturing company that has had a difficult time over the last three years .
As such we have been taking below inflation pay rises each year .
In late 2006 the workforce was more than halved and through - out 2007 we have produced more with less staff than ever before and this year we feel the need for a little payback from the company .
Our Union representative is suggesting we target a 5 % pay deal .
This makes little difference to me as I earn £ 14.000 pa pre-tax and have a young family so I receive tax credits which increase my annual income to around £ 24.000 .
Any pay rise I get will be offset by the reduction in tax credit but I feel the firm owes us more as a sign of appreciation and they have a moral obligation to reduce my burden on the state .
Richard Kay , Leigh
No mention here of the huge , life changing pay cuts that many hardworking local government staff are facing in order to fund Single Status Equal Pay increases for low paid workers .
It 's a case of robbing the poor to pay the poorer .
Local authorities have known about this for at least six years but little provision has been made to fund inevitable higher salaries of traditionally low paid eg care workers , cleaners .
Maid Marion , Bassetlaw , Nottinghamshire I am a local government officer and my dispute is that the government keeps breaking its word .
I joined the public sector from the private for two reasons - job security and the pension scheme .
My job is no longer secure , possibly less secure than the private sector .
But it is my pension that upset me post .
I thought I had a contract and did not realise that the government can just change the law and effectively tear up the agreement .
Duncan Warmington , Maidstone
If the government wants us to accept a below inflation pay rise , then they should equally ' ask ' all essential service providers , such as food , gas , petrol , electricity , water etc to stick to below inflation rises in the cost of their services too .
After all , why do all companies demand ever rising profits , no matter what the economy is doing ?
Why is n't any ' profit ' , even a very marginal one good enough in lean years ?
Free markets only work for non-essential services ..
Wil , London I 'll take a pay cut for the greater good sure .... when all the politicians , hereditary peers , and royals lead the way by also taking a cut in their income that 's big enough for them to notice , relinquishing their free loading lifestyles , put their children in state school and get in line with the rest of the working population waiting for NHS treatment .
Philip Hill , Bristol , England I 've not received a pay rise of any kind for over 4 years , in real terms I now earn around 20 % less than I did 4 years ago , am I doing something about it , yes , looking for a new job .
Steve , Aberdeen
The public sector would n't mind taking effective pay cuts if the arguments to support them were sound .
Mr Brown stated that inflation had run at 16 % over the last decade but police officers had a 39 % increase .
What he did n't say was that this was in line with a median based on non-manual workers in the private sector .
This had been negotiated in recognition that police officers had no rights to take industrial action and had massive restrictions on their private lives .
If Gordon Brown were to continue his policy of paying what he felt was appropriate policing will no longer be seen as a long term career .
Experience will be lost and the ability of the police to properly respond to their rapidly increasing workload effectively will be lost .
Peter Thomassen - Clarke , Alresford England
I wonder how much the inflation rate is relevant as everyone will have seen their utility , fuel and council tax bills go up substantially .
These large rises must reduce disposable income .
But the reaction to the inflationary pressure is to increase the interest ( mortgage ) rate restricting further .
Can we hope to keep up or actually does fuel , power and heating now cost more and so we must accept this ?
Nick Phillips , Plymouth I anticipate with relish the obvious next step , for central government to cap council tax rises at 2 % .
With such a constraint on public sector spending I 'm sure inflation would remain under control .
Diogenes , Nephelococcygia
The issue , in my opinion , is n't inflation but in the private industries - profitability .
If an employer is running a profit as a result of his employees productivity then it seems reasonable to expect to share in that .
Peter Douglas , Billericay , Essex I am an IT engineer employed by a contract agency with offices worldwide and have n't had a pay rise in approx the last 10 years .
So those being offered 2 % + should stop moaning and get on with it .
Ian , Warrington
It is stupid to give everyone an across the board percentage wage rise .
Those on lower wages will need a higher rise and those on higher salary less of a rise .
Why should the poorer paid keep subsidising the better paid year in year out .
In general terms pay £ 1,000 to a worker on £ 15,000 and £ 500 to a worker on £ 50,000 .
Robin Bate , Edinburgh , Scotland
Any chancellor worth their salt would know it 's relatively easy to claw back any pay rise via taxation .
It would n't surprise me if tax goes up whilst government spending goes down .
Darren Weekes , London Working within the public sector and having already accepted a modest pay increment settlement , why should I further erode my position ?
Call my argument simplistic , but surely should n't the government be looking to the private sector volunteering for this pay - rise cap ?
( This would of course only be applied to incomes above a certain income threshold ) .
Harry A Barnett , Norfolk Brown might well want all of us to take a pay cut - but so long as the rest of us in the private sector are subsidising lavish pension funds for public sector workers - at a rate of £ 2 for every £ 1 we invest in our own - the onus is most definitely not on us to pay the price of measures to mitigate inflation .
Brown is now having to realise the price of excessive borrowing during the golden economic upturn he was bequeathed by his Treasury predecessors .
James , Blackpool , UK
This is not the issue .
The public are being duped into believing its their wages that can affect inflation .
Tosh .
There 's a much greater problem with the way business is financed and governments are run .
Take a wage cut so that the city can keep making obscene profits ?
No way .
Time for a change in corporate law for the benefit of all and not just for the grossly rich .
Bill , Glasgow
At the beginning of 2007 I was given a 2.5 % annual pay rise - nice .
Then at the end of March I was told that myself and colleagues would have to accept a 10 % pay cut or risk losing our jobs .
It was n't really an option , but that 's life in the private sector .
Needless to say I am waiting for the right opportunity to come along so that I can get my career back on track .
Lynnzal , Herts Council tax = Up
Rail fares = Up
Petrol prices = Outrageous !
Energy prices = Up
Housing costs = See " Petrol Prices "
Personally , given the contempt that the Prime Minister has shown us by hiking taxes , I 'm glad I 'm not alone in thinking he can go and take a running jump .
Paul , London I work for an international company in the private sector and no - one has had a pay rise for at least 5 years .
It is a great mis-conception that the private sector are better off with pay rises that the public sector .
In fact , the public sector have the influence by weight of numbers , unions , sympathy and publicity .
Where will my pay rise come form to meet the rising costs of everything ?

I started out nervous with the idea of adding closures to Java , and I think I ’ve slid firmly into the “ contra ” camp .
One reason is that it seems increasingly a bad idea to add anything to the Java language .
On a related subject , my brief sojourn in Ruby - land has changed my thinking about closures entirely .
Java and Closures · A good place to start is Bharath ’s BGGA closures :
The end of many Java careers .
Clearly he ’s a contra too , but he links to both sides ’ arguments .
My argument is simple : Java worked so well because it hit the 80/20 point ; for my money one of the loudest , cleanest 80/20 technology victories ever .
Subsequent attempts to fill in the 20 % were , well , mostly harmless .
Until generics , which are a disaster ; they have made Java harder to learn and to understand , and you ca n’t avoid them .
So I ’m really scared about trying to chip away any further at whatever ’s left of the 20 % .
Also , I look at the motivating examples for closures and I think that the conventional alternatives are n’t that bad .
Also , I look at the proposed code and I think that on balance it ’ll make Java harder to read .
Also , as Bharath points out , if you really need closures and and functional - programming goo and suchlike , there are at least two excellent Java - platform languages that have elegant , well - tested designs : Scala and JRuby .
But you know , I could be wrong .
Maybe there ’s a way to build closures into the Java language in a way that ’ll add power smoothly with no real downside .
If that ’s true , we need to discover it and prove it , and the JCP is n’t about discovering things ; it ’s about the worst possible place to approach this problem .
Now that Java is Open - Source , anyone can go cook up whatever loony closure facility they want , and if it ’s good enough , people will start using it whether the binary build has “ Java ” stamped on the outside or not , and then start shouting that it should be in the standard distro , and only then should the JCP consider going near this tar - pit .
My favorite place to start improving Java would n’t be with the language at all , it ’d be the Multi -Language VM project .
The motivating use - cases for that are n’t theoretical in the slightest , they have names and addresses and are screaming for love .
Ruby and Closures · Ruby calls ’em “ blocks ” and you basically can’t write any code without ’em .
When you first see how they ’re used , you think “ Hey , that ’s a nice clean way to do iteration ” .
Then when you want to write one of those functions , you dig in and find out about yield , and you nod your head “ of course ” .
They have to be closures because they look like ( and are ) chunks of code embedded in your classes and methods , which can naturally use those classes ’ and methods ’ variables .
So there ’s nothing in the slightest strange or surprising .
Later on , when you get a little deeper into Ruby , you find out about &block arguments and procs and lambdas , but by that time you ’ve internalized the notion that a few lines of code have an independent life even if they do n’t have a name , so the mental effort in figuring it all out is about zero .
But even in Ruby , to my eyes the most readable of languages , code that uses procs and lambdas is often hard to read .
( Code that uses ordinary blocks is trivial to read , the closure - ness is implicit and invisible ) .
And at the end of the day , the number of times an application programmer is going to really need a proc or a lambda , to the extent that it ’s a win to suck up the readability cost , probably is n’t that high .
Yes , it happens ; I ’ve done it myself .
But as I said , not often .
Conclusion · Sorry , I do n’t have one .
Ruby proves that it ’s possible to get closures right and make them accessible to grunt programmers .
But if they ’re going into Java , they need to earn their way and be field - tested in the open - source ecosystem first .
Microsoft plans next month to roll out the first major update to its Windows Vista operating system , which was introduced in January 2007 .
There have been a number of smaller patches to Vista , but this one , called Service Pack 1 , is pretty large , a 65 - megabyte download , and includes hundreds of small fixes and improvements , including some performance gains .
The arrival of a large update like this is n’t a sign of trouble , or even unusual .
Microsoft has routinely issued these large “ service packs ” periodically for Windows .
And just this week , its competitor , Apple , unleashed an even larger update for its new operating system , Leopard .
Even though they can take a long time to download and install , such updates are generally a good thing for consumers .
Microsoft will automatically deliver SP1 , as the company calls it , through its normal updating mechanism , built into Windows .
The update is free .
However , based on my tests of Vista SP1 , I believe that for most average consumers , it will likely be a nonevent , and for others it will be disappointing .
Many of its benefits are aimed at corporations and power users , or are under - the - hood fixes that are hard to discern .
For mainstream users , it adds no significant , visible features to Vista , and changes little or nothing about the way the operating system looks and works .
Also , SP1 does n’t resolve some of the most annoying flaws in Vista , including slow start - ups and reboots , and a security system that nags you too much and requires add - on anti-virus software .
I guess these problems will either never be fixed fully or will have to wait for SP2 .
While Vista SP1 does deliver some performance improvements in certain scenarios , it can actually temporarily degrade performance — including making reboots even slower — because of a quirk in the update process .
This slowdown should go away in a few days , the company says .
On balance , the update is probably worth installing , especially since Microsoft will deliver it automatically .
But I would n’t rush to grab it and I would n’t expect much from it .
One note : you ca n’t install SP1 until you have installed a couple of other patches first .
These will also be distributed automatically .
I installed Vista SP1 on two computers that had come with the original Vista preinstalled : a 10 - month - old Sony Vaio SZ laptop and a two - month - old Dell XPS One desktop .
Because the automatic download distribution is n’t yet in place , Microsoft sent me the update on a disk , which also included the prerequisite patches .
In each case , the upgrade took a little over an hour and went smoothly .
During the process , the computers rebooted multiple times , but it was all automatic and did n’t require user intervention .
After the installation , the computers functioned normally .
I tested three of the performance improvements Microsoft claims for SP1 .
The first involved speeding up the copying of hefty folders containing large numbers of files .
On both machines , copying a folder containing over 700 files totaling almost 700 megabytes took less than half as long with SP1 as it had with the original Vista .
I also tested how long it took both machines to awaken from a hibernation or sleep state and be ready for work .
For these tests , I began with each machine running Microsoft Word , Microsoft Outlook and the Firefox Web browser , then I forced them into sleep and hibernation mode .
By my definition , “ ready for work ” means that Vista ’s circular delay indicator has gone away , the software that loads at start - up has finished launching and the computer has fully reconnected to its wired or wireless network .
On both of my test machines , SP1 improved the recovery time from sleep or hibernation , shaving one to 10 seconds from the procedures .
Microsoft does n’t claim SP1 will improve the speed of cold starts and reboots under Vista , but I tested these anyway .
To my horror , I found that SP1 actually made rebooting — already slower than on comparable Windows XP computers or Macintoshes — even slower .
Microsoft explained that this was due to the fact that installing SP1 erases certain data used by Vista to speed up program launching .
It takes the system a few days to build this data back up , the company says .
Until then , it says , overall performance , including reboots , can be slower under SP1 than under original Vista .
Microsoft provided me with a method that would rebuild this program - launching data more quickly , at least for the common programs I was using in my tests .
Once I followed that method , rebooting time returned to its former state — still too slow for my taste , but at least not worse .
In briefing me on SP1 , Microsoft made a big point of saying that great progress had been made in the past year in making Vista work properly with add - on devices , such as printers .
I tried my 2003 - vintage Hewlett - Packard printer , which had n’t worked properly with the original Vista .
It still did n’t work well with SP1 .
So , Vista SP1 is a step forward , at least after a few days of use .
But it ’s not a big step .

Here is a simple rule for life : the food you eat is only as safe as the environment it comes from .
This is narrowly true , in that food from a dirty kitchen is likely to be unsafe .
But it ’s also true in the broadest sense .
A good example is the tuna in sushi .
Many New Yorkers have come to love the convenience , taste and aesthetic appeal of sushi .
But as The Times reported Wednesday after testing tuna from 20 Manhattan stores and restaurants , sushi made from bluefin tuna may contain unacceptable levels of mercury , which acts as a neurotoxin .
Every piece of that tuna , glistening on its bed of rice , is a report on the worrisome state of the oceans .
Bluefin tuna contain higher levels of mercury than other species of tuna because they live longer and , like humans , accumulate more mercury in their body tissues .
The trouble for sushi-lovers is that it is very hard to tell what kind of tuna you ’re getting , whether you ’re dining at an exclusive restaurant or picking up some sushi at the market on the way home from work .
The owners of the establishments whose tuna was tested , including some very familiar names , said they would talk to their suppliers , and the suppliers will no doubt talk to their fishermen .
For all this talk , no one is going to be able to find a mature bluefin tuna that is mercury - free , at least not until the oceans are mercury - free .
It ’s easy enough to understand the transfer of mercury from fish to diner .
If you regularly eat as few as six pieces of tuna sushi a week , you may be consuming more mercury than the levels considered acceptable by the Environmental Protection Agency .
What is harder to keep in mind is how mercury is transferred from the environment to the fish themselves .
If you 've seen one video game movie , you 've seen them all , right ?
Yeah , I get where you 're coming from .
All of them , from Final Fantasy : The Spirits Within to the mess that was the Mortal Kombats were total disasters ( except maybe Silent Hill , send hate mail to [ email protected ] ) , always missing the mark and leaving us disappointed .
There is still hope .
One more golden franchise of gaming remains , but it 's not what you 're thinking .
It 's not a first - person shooter , and it 's definitely not The Sims ( kill me now ) - it 's a bit more casual than that .
Grandmas , soccer moms , and bored office workers rejoice : Minesweeper : The Movie is coming .
The brilliant minds at College Humor bring us the trailer to the movie based on the classic Microsoft Windows timewaster .
This is certain to be the first video game blockbuster .

BERLIN ( Reuters ) - German academics believe they have solved the centuries - old mystery behind the identity of the “ Mona Lisa ” in Leonardo da Vinci ’s famous portrait .
A 2007 handout photo shows a page from a book at the University of Heidelburg Library with a handwritten note on Leonardo da Vinci 's Mona Lisa portrait .
German academics said January 14 , 2008 , they have helped to solve the centuries - long mystery behind the identity of the ' Mona Lisa ' in Leonardo da Vinci 's famous sixteenth - century portrait .
Experts at the Heidelberg University Library say dated notes scribbled in the margins of a book by its owner in October 1503 confirm once and for all that Lisa Gherardini , the wife of a wealthy Florentine merchant , Francesco del Giocondo , was the model for one of the most famous portraits in the world .

Lisa Gherardini , the wife of a wealthy Florentine merchant , Francesco del Giocondo , has long been seen as the most likely model for the sixteenth - century painting .
But art historians have often wondered whether the smiling woman may actually have been da Vinci ’s lover , his mother or the artist himself .
Now experts at the Heidelberg University library say dated notes scribbled in the margins of a book by its owner in October 1503 confirm once and for all that Lisa del Giocondo was indeed the model for one of the most famous portraits in the world .
“ All doubts about the identity of the Mona Lisa have been eliminated by a discovery by Dr. Armin Schlechter , ” a manuscript expert , the library said in a statement on Monday .
Until then , only “ scant evidence ” from sixteenth - century documents had been available .
“ This left lots of room for interpretation and there were many different identities put forward , ” the library said .
The notes were made by a Florentine city official Agostino Vespucci , an acquaintance of the artist , in a collection of letters by the Roman orator Cicero .
The comments compare Leonardo to the ancient Greek artist Apelles and say he was working on three paintings at the time , one of them a portrait of Lisa del Giocondo .
Art experts , who have already dated the painting to this time , say the Heidelberg discovery is a breakthrough and the earliest mention linking the merchant ’s wife to the portrait .
“ There is no reason for any lingering doubts that this is another woman , ” Leipzig University art historian Frank Zoellner told German radio .
“ One could even say that books written about all this in the past few years were unnecessary , had we known . ”
The woman was first linked to the painting in around 1550 by Italian official Giorgio Vasari , the library said , but added there had been doubts about Vasari ’s reliability and had made the comments five decades after the portrait had been painted .
The Heidelberg notes were actually discovered over two years ago in the library by Schlechter , a spokeswoman said .
Although the findings had been printed in the library ’s public catalogue they had not been widely publicized and had been received little attention until a German broadcaster decided to do some recording at the library , she said .
The painting , which hangs in the Louvre in Paris , is also known as “ La Gioconda ” meaning the happy or joyful woman in Italian , a title which also suggests the woman ’s married name .
Favourite answer
There where a lot of minorities that where not given land in all of the Colonies , not only British but French , Dutch , German , Belgium , Spanish , Portuguese , Italian , American , etc,etc.
Reason ?
Well the voices where not heard at the time , or they where happy to be included in the agreements made at that time , or the controlling independant parties did not think to make the land seperate from the state being formed .
If every tribe or racial group opted for an independant state where do you stop ??
I would campaign for a seperate Kingdom of Sussex to be reformed , if I felt that it would get somewhere .
Portaland Indymedia , Mollie —
Well over 100 people filled Hearing Room 2 and an overflow room in the Cherberg Building today to hear statements in support of SJM 8016 calling for impeachment investigations .
Only a handful of people got to speak but those who did spoke eloquently on their desire to see the Constitution restored .
The seriousness of the debate was disturbed when the lone Republican on the Committee , Senator Pam Roach , showed up late .
Abandoning any pretense of civility , she sat down with a look of pure disgust as the last person on the panel was speaking .
After the panel finished , she took over the microphone and challenged the legitimacy of the hearing .
She shouted that she was going to complain to the ethics committee because this committee was engaged in political campaigning on state time and using state resources .
Roach argued that this hearing was political because this was an election year ” ” her assumption being , I guess , that impeachment would be good for the Democrats .
Of course , the Democrats in DC , under Pelosi ’s assumptions , believe impeachment would be bad for Democrats .
It was bizarre .
Curiously , however , Roach neither defended the actions of the Bush / Cheney nor did she refute the allegations listed in the memorial .
She just vented .
Whipping out a picture of her son who serves in the military , she argued that she supports the war and will pray for her son when he goes to Iraq to help those people .
She was , she said , proud of her son who volunteered to serve .
It was an emotional ploy to change the discourse from the Consitutional issues and make it all about her .
Her pugnacious attitude drew a reaction from the crowd .
A few reminded her that citizens have a right to speak and others pointed out that she was not the only person in the room with family in the military .
There were many veterans among the impeachment crowd , so her point was misguided .
As the Chair tried to regain order , Roach left the room as if her hissy fit was of some importance .
I hope someone posts it to YouTube ” ” it is a laughable performance !
On the plus side , her inappropriate behavior did not stop the hearing nor diminish the serious issues being discussed .
Over 39 people signed up to speak but only 5 people plus Representatives Chase and Hasegawa ( co-sponsors of the companion bill HJM 4027 ) made statements because of the very limited time available .
The Chair did ask if anyone wished to speak against the SJM 8016 .
No one in that packed hearing room stepped forward .
Senator Oemig made the opening statement at the meeting that started at 3:30 with only the Democratic members of the committee present : Fairley ( chair ) , Pridemore , Kline and McDermott .
He said it was unfortunately necessary for the state legislature to act .
Since he first introduced the bill ten months ago , there are more abuses , he said , the most recent being the White House destruction of emails .
“ We can no longer hope and pray that these abuses will stop , ” he said .
The state legislature must act .
“ If we fail to pass this memorial , we will tell Washingtonians that we are as unwilling as Congress to take a stand to protect the Constitution . ”
Impeachment is not about getting rid of the President or Vice President , Oemig pointed out .
Neither is it about politics .
It is about restoring the Constitution and ensuring that the actions of this Presidency do not become a permanent change in power for all future presidents .
Both Representatives Chase and Hasegawa , the co-sponsors of the companion bill HJM 4027 , echoed his sentiments .
Representative Chase had anticipated Roach ’s argument .
“ Some people we say that what we are doing today is political , ” she said .
“ But I say it is our Constitutional duty . ”
She warned against the evil that comes from refusing to do what is right , when good people do nothing .
Representative Hasegawa said impeachment is the most important issue facing our country today .
“ We all took an oath of office , ” he said .
But it was more than that .
“ How can I face my children if I do not act on this to restore our fundamental principles of truth and justice , the values that hold us together ? ”
Carole Waller , Richard Behan and Linda Boyd echoed the themes of the necessity to restore the Constitution and to hold the President and Vice President to account for their actions .
“ Nothing is more important than the Constitution , ” said Linda Boyd .
Her voice broke as she contemplated the idea that our government is “ illegitimate . ”
“ We are turning to you , ” she told the committee , ‘ to magnify our voice . ”
The crowd cheered and applauded throughout the hearing , showing the strong emotion about restoring the Constitution .
This was a wonderful start to this process .
But there are many hurdles to clear .
If the Senate Government Operations and Elections committee votes in favor of the memorial , it will go the Rules Committee .
This Committee can decide whether or not to send the memorial to the floor for a vote .
Similarly , the House Memorial needs support .
A full court press has to be made on the House Democratic leadership to get a hearing scheduled before the cut - off of February 8th .
Contact Representative Frank Chopp , House Speaker , and Representatives Grant , Kessler , Morris , and Tomiko .
The next big deadline in February 19th , which is the cutoff for bills to pass out of their house of origin .

Rest assured , we 've seen a fair amount of totally sexy music makers in our day , but Peter Bennett 's BeatBearing has instantly become one of our favorites .
The project is described as a " simple tangible user interface that uses ball bearings to program a sequencer , " and it enables the user to create a myriad melodies using sounds from the basic components of a drum kit .
As with most musical things , this truly is better appreciated through video , so do yourself a favor and click on through to see it in action .
And yes , we too are waiting in tense anticipation for this thing to go commercial .

Errata
This is deferred to its own Errata page .
A big batch of malware - infected ads are circulating on a slew of popular sites including MLB.com , NHL.com and the Australian site , www.whitepages.com.au.
The ads were apparently bought and paid for by rogue antivirus software sellers , who posed as legitimate advertisers .
They typically paid for the ad space with wire transfers or credit cards , according to Alex Eckelberry of Sunbelt Software .
The likely distributor of the malware , Eckelberry suspects , is AdTraff a shady " online marketing " outfit that is believed to have ties to the Russian Business Network , a notorious ethically - challenged Internet Service Provider .
Eckelberry adds that although the malware is indeed malicious – it will hijack your computer and bully you until you pony up the $ 40 to buy the antivirus software – it's not " going to steal your data or kill your dog .
It 's extortion .
You have to imagine that you 're dealing with people who have absolutely no morals .
We 've even seen these guys make up their own viruses , " Eckelberry says .
DoubleClick unwittingly distributed the ads through its DART program .
( DART is an online ad platform used by publishers to manage and track ads . )
In the meantime , DoubleClick has implemented a new security monitoring system that has thus far captured and disabled
100 ads .
Says Sean Harvey , senior product manager at DoubleClick DART :
This is an industry - wide challenge ; unfortunately , there are bad actors who misrepresent themselves and purchase advertising as an avenue to distribute malware .
This has the potential to affect all businesses and consumers in the online environment .
If you 've seen any of the ads , you may have experienced something like this :
You 're on a regular web site that you may have visited many times before .
Your browser window closes down .
A new browser window comes up , redirecting you to an anti-virus site and a dialog box comes up that suggests your computer has been infected and your hard drive is being scanned .
The malware tries to download software to your computer and scans your hard drive again .
( See the below demonstration on YouTube . )
The malware is apparently being disguised as a Flash file that has a redirect function encrypted in the file , so that when publishers upload the ad file the malware is not detectable .
Once deployed on a site , the Flash file launches the malicious redirects , perhaps triggered at certain times or in certain locations .

Unpacking Internet Explorer 8 's multiple rendering modes
Internet Explorer 8 is going to be the most standards - compliant IE yet , but it 's going about it in a way that has some people scratching their heads .
With Internet Explorer 8 , you have a choice in standards compliance modes .
Sound oxymoronic ?
Should n't there be one standards mode by default ?
Heck , should n't the only mode be standards mode ?
Ah , idealism .
One of the nastier things about being a web developer , I 'm told , is the existence of Internet Explorer .
Massively popular , but full of " quirks , " coding around IE can be a real pain .
When IE7 shipped , many web developers recoiled in horror as sites that worked fine in IE6 broke .
The problem , as is so often the case , is backwards compatibility .
IE5.5 ( and below ) was decidedly nonstandard in its rendering behavior .
Hundreds of millions of web pages were written to look " right " in IE5.5 's broken rendering .
The result was something of a quandary for Microsoft when it came to release IE6 .
They wanted to improve the standards conformance in IE6 , but could n't afford to break pages dependent on the older behavior .
The solution was the " doctype switch " .
The doctype switch allowed IE6 to support both the old IE5.5 behavior — " quirks mode " — and new , more standards - conforming behavior — " standards mode . "
Doctypes are an optional part of HTML pages , which specify which version of the HTML spec a page is using .
In the olden days of the web , most web pages did n't bother to specify — they barely heeded the mandatory parts of the standards , let alone optional parts .
So the presence of the doctype could be used to pick between modes — if someone used a doctype , they probably knew what they were doing , and wanted " standards mode . "
No doctype ( or a doctype specifying an old version of HTML ) and they were probably assuming nonstandard behavior , and " quirks mode " would be picked .
At least , that was the theory .
The thing about IE6's " standards mode " is that it was n't all that standard .
Although it fixed some of the bigger issues IE5.5 had , it still had plenty of its own .
With IE7 , MS tried to fix a few more of the nonconformance problems .
The intent was to keep " quirks mode " the same as it always had been , and to further improve " standards mode . "
What the company discovered when it did this was that people using the doctype were n't actually expecting " standard " behavior .
Rather than writing pages to target the HTML specifications , these pages were written to work with IE6's still - not - standard - but - better - than - before behavior .
So , they did n't work with full - blown " quirks mode " rendering — but they did n't work with 100 % - standard rendering either .
Sometimes this was deliberate — developers taking standard pages ( that work properly in , say , Safari ) and adding hacks to them in order to get an acceptable appearance in IE .
Other times , it was accidental ; developers added the doctype because it was fashionable to do so , or because their design tools added it automatically , without fully understanding the consequences of the switch .
Whether by accident or by design , most pages using " standards mode " are expecting IE6's own unique take on " standards mode " , and not true standard behavior .
The upshot of this is that IE7 broke pages that used to work in IE6 .
Both business - critical intranet apps and the Web in general stopped working — not normally fatally , but enough to throw out layouts and make pages look wrong .
This undoubtedly hurt IE7's uptake , and that has Microsoft concerned .
IE7 is finally going to be put out as an automatic update in the next few weeks , and the reason it has taken so long is this reluctance from businesses .
If the standardization changes were made to " standards mode , " using the doctype switch , all those pages demanding not - really - standards - mode will break .
That 's a lot of pages , and they 'll break even more badly than they broke with IE7 .
Which brings us to IE8 .
With IE8 , Microsoft wants to further improve the standards conformance of the browser , to bring it up to a level that 's comparable to Firefox 3 , Opera , and Safari .
Experience with IE7 and the doctype switch leaves the software giant concerned that further fixes to " standards mode " will , in the company 's words , " break the Web . "
The IE8 solution : add another layer
When IE8 eventually ships , it will have three rendering modes , two of which are the already familiar " quirks mode " and " ( not so ) standards mode . "
In an IE team blog entry , IE Platform Architect Chris Wilson revealed a third mode that can be invoked by developers :
" Quirks mode " remains the same , and compatible with current content .
" Standards mode " remains the same as IE7 , and compatible with current content .
If
you ( the page developer ) really want the best standards support IE8 can
give , you can get it by inserting a simple < meta > element .
This third mode will use a < meta > tag to specify that a page should use the behavior of a specific browser version .
To get IE8 really - standard - this - time - we - mean - it behavior , a page will include an element like < meta http - equiv= " X - UA - Compatible " content = " IE=8 " />.
That says that a page should use IE8's behavior — and should use it even in IE9 , IE10 , or any future version .
The first two modes will continue to use the doctype switch to choose between them .
This should solve the problem that so hurt IE7 .
The developer expectation that IE 's " standards mode " should remain the same indefinitely should be met .
As long as a page works in IE7 , it should continue to work in the same way in IE8 .
The idea for this new tag was not developed by Microsoft in isolation .
The company worked with the Web Standards Project ( WaSP ) to devise this mechanism , to allow the existing web to work , and the future web to be standards compliant .
Aaron Gustafson , one of the members of the WaSP - Microsoft task force who devised this scheme , published an article on A List Apart further detailing the specifics of the declaration .

A Galaxy is not a Comet
Credit & Copyright : Emiel Kempen
Explanation :
This gorgeous galaxy and comet portrait was recorded on December 30th , in the skies over Hoogeveen , The Netherlands .
The combined series of 60 x 60 second exposures finds the lovely green coma of Comet 8P / Tuttle near its predicted conjunction with the Triangulum Galaxy .
Aligning each exposure with the stars shows the comet as a streak , slowly moving against the background stars and galaxy .
An alternative composition with exposures centered on the comet , shows the background stars and galaxy as streaks .
The alluring celestial scene would also have been a rewarding one for the influential 18th century comet hunter Charles Messier .
While Messier scanned French skies for comets , he carefully cataloged positions of things which were fuzzy and comet - like in appearance but did not move against the background stars and so were definitely not comets .
The Triangulum Galaxy , also known as M33 , is the 33rd object in his famous not - a - comet catalog .
The modern understanding holds that the Triangulum Galaxy is a large spiral galaxy some 3 million light - years distant .
Comet 8P / Tuttle , just bright enough to be visible to the unaided eye in dark , northern skies , is about 40 million kilometers ( 2 light - minutes ) away .
The big bad amazing extraordinary awesome incredible Real opened its gates for Bucharest yesterday !
Hurray !
Ok , now that we said it from a commercial point of view , you might even want to go there , right ?
Well , I did .
I went there at 5 pm and saw aabout 50 people waiting in a queue to get in .
I thought it was a promotion or something , so I waited a bit and a miracle happened .
All those people were allowed to get inside , so I was one of the lucky ones that got in without having to wait !
Why do I say lucky ?
Well , take a look at the photo I took when I got out half an hour later :
Yes !
All those people wait in that queue to enter a hypermarket !
They wait for an hour to get inside and buy some damn sugar and oil !
And this happens in … no , not in Africa , in 2007 in Romania , member of the European Union .
Of course , you might think products are at half price , or that they give stuff for free perhaps ?
Actually , the biggest discount I found was for about 50 cents .
Yes , that ’s half a dollar “ discount ” .
It ’s simply incredible how some people think , or better said , do n’t .
And for those that have no idea where Bucharest is , Real is not the first hypermarket or anything , there are at least 10 more only in Bucharest .
So .. yeah , next time you feel like laughing , take a trip there , it will pretty much feel like a trip though time .
Geltec Corporation has been working on its shock - absorbing gel , and now has improved upon its Alpha Gel with this Beta Gel , shown here protecting an egg from its untimely demise as it plummets from a dizzying height of just over 72 feet .
Remarkable .
It just seems to defy the laws of physics .
We want some of this stuff installed in our walking shoes for the next trade show .
We also got quite a kick out of the frantic enthusiasm of these Japanese TV personalities .

So is it really true that any parent who values their child 's education and actively contributes to it is , by default , pushy and therefore A Bad Person ?
Hands up , that 's me and my wife , we value education .
Specifically our son's education .
After all , it 's too late for us , but not too late for him ...
My son is seven .
What he learns about the world today , what he 's learned up until now , and what he will learn in the next few years will fundamentally shape not just what he knows but what he values , how he behaves , what he enjoys and how he spends and makes the most of his life .
That is a definition of education in the widest sense , encompassing every kind of learning that a child can enjoy .
Intellectual learning , physical learning , musical learning , artistic learning , social learning .
Learning how to learn , to play , to engage , to contribute , to perform , to create .
School search
So as parents my wife and I love helping him to learn , by sharing with him our understanding and enjoyment of everything from starfish to Star Wars , from business to burial mounds .
We pay for specialists in music , gymnastics , swimming , fencing , drama and dance to help him learn to enjoy those activities .
And we worked hard to find a school where a broader education , beyond a simple checklist teach - to - test regime , is the ethos .
Of course , this kind of attitude to education mostly went out of fashion in the 19th Century .
I have a fascinating educational textbook from the middle of the 18th Century which describes the above , nearly word for word ( except for the Star Wars bit ) as providing the basis for an excellent upbringing .
It starts with a nature ramble and expands ( pretty quickly ) to the great scientific , mathematical and artistic questions .
Fabulous stuff .
Consequently our approach to our son's education appears not only to spectacularly outdated but deliberately contrarian .
Sharing
We do not subscribe to the opinion that school is the only education a child needs .
How much of what you value now did you learn at school - and how much of it could and should you have learned at school ?
Nor do we believe that parents are best ignoring their progeny until they are old enough to leave home .
We want to share our experience and learning with our son , and provide him with the opportunities that we did not have as children .
So , will my son become a new Renaissance man ?
Will he become a concert pianist or an Olympic athelete ?
That decision is utterly out of our hands .
It is for him and his natural potential and interests to discover where his future will lie .
All we can do is to provide him with opportunities , support and enthusiasm and the belief that to get the best out of life and himself he needs to get involved .
So the next time someone throws the " pushy parent " label at you , or uses it as a way of forcing you to accept mediocre education , or to try and guilt - trip you into not sending your child to that extra-curricular class because they do n't value it but even so they do n't want your child to have some kind of unfair advantage over theirs , push back .
Hands up .
That 's us .
We value education .
Via The Huffington Post :
At least four major firms have pulled advertising from Michael Savage 's nationally syndicated radio show following a campaign highlighting his inflammatory rhetoric .
One other company , Geico insurance , is expected to follow suit .
The campaign , launched recently by Brave New Films , generated thousands of calls urging advertisers on the Savage Nation show to sever financial ties to the widely popular ( and frequently offensive ) talk host .
" We are thrilled at the amazing response of the true patriots all over the blogsphere who responded to our NOSAVAGE campaign , " Robert Greenwald , head of the film company , said in a statement .
" People have called and emailed and the responsible sponsors have responded by pulling their ads and asking that their ads not be on this racist and hateful show . "

Bionic Cat Bounces Back After Two Falls Baby , a 6 - year - old cat from South London , has fallen twice off the building .
LONDON . Nov. 27 , 2007  --
Legend has it that cats always land safely on their legs -- well , not always .
Baby , a 6 - year - old cat from South London , has become a celebrity pet in England after she fell twice off a three - story building .
Blue Cross Hospital has dubbed her the bionic cat , because her four legs are so full of pins .
" She is lucky to be alive , " Caroline Powley , nurse manager at Blue Cross hospital , told ABC News .
" She was brought to us in September after multiple fractures in her back legs , " said Powley .
" We checked for other injuries .
The X - ray showed that she had had previous metal implants in the front legs . "
Baby fell first when she was about 2 months old , her owner Sue , who does not want her last name used , told ABC News .
" The first time , I thought it happened because she was a kitten , " said Sue .
" I never thought it would happen again . "
Sue said Baby was never a nervous kitty .
" She 's lovely , very friendly , " said Sue .
" She never goes out , except for when she fell off the window .
She is always on the window . "
Sue recalls vividly the moment when she found Baby on the concrete pavement in front of her house .
" She was really bad , " said Sue .
" Baby was lying on the floor , crying .
one of her legs was bleeding .
She was still breathing , but she was in shock . "
Sue brought her Baby to the hospital .
The broken - legged cat spent an entire week at the hospital .
" I would visit her every day , " said Sue .
The surgery Baby went through is very complex , said Powley , two hours for each leg .
The vets had to fit the cat with metal plates and screws .
" Their bones are so small , " said Powley .
" We have to use small equipment . "
The operation is also expensive .
Sue was lucky that Blue Cross is a charity hospital and performs advanced surgery at a subsidized price , said Powley .
Sue paid about $ 1,000 , according to Powley , but she would have paid five to ten times as much for a private vet .
Two months after the incident , the bionic cat has started to recover the use of her legs .
" She is walking well on both her back legs , " said Powley .
" She is absolutely fine , " said Sue .
" I also have a big dog , and she walks on him . "
To recover fully , Baby will have to undergo further surgery to take out the metal implants in her legs .
To prevent her cat from falling again , Sue intends to fix a net on her window .
There are only so many times a cat can fall off a three - story building and live , said Powley .
" She would probably not survive another fall .
Her four legs are pinned .
We might not be able to fix her legs if she breaks them again , " Powley said .
In Britain , as in the U.S. , some people believe cats have nine lives .
In Italy and France , cats are thought to have seven , and in Japan , only one .
It looks like Baby still has seven to spare .
As you obviously know , the Writers Strike started this week .
And it looks like it ’s going to be a long , hard slog that may not be resolved for months — maybe not even until the Actors and Directors contracts are up next June .
That ’s a long time , and while there are any number of articles discussing the anticipated consequences of the strike , what about the unanticipated consequences ?
By definition , of course , those are impossible to predict .
Which is why I ’m going to predict them .
So , without any further ado , here are six unanticipated consequences of the writers strike .
Your DVR is going to lie to you – Mine started Monday night : it grabbed “ The Daily Show ” and “ The Colbert Report ” as if they were first - run episodes , but they were dirty filthy stinking rotten repeats .
Of course , I was n’t surprised , but my TiVo had no clue , and spent nearly 15 minutes abjectly apologizing after I pointed out its mistake .
I forgave it , of course .
As the networks scramble with shows that fail to meet their anticipated production schedules , you are going to get more and more repeats that your DVR thinks are first - run episodes .
For those of us who are continually running our DVRs on the edge of it ’s hard drive capacity , this is a bit of good news , but it ’s also a pain in the ass .
DVD Player Sales Spike –
As interesting first - run TV shows trail off , people will be working their DVD players more and more as they catch up on the stockpile of DVDs that they ’ve acquired but have n’t found the time to watch .
A natural consequence of this is that a lot of older DVD players finally give up the ghost , necessitating their replacement .
Interestingly enough , this might actually be a tipping point for either HD DVD or Blu - Ray : people might take a chance on one or the other — especially the models that promise to upconvert SD DVDs — just because the prices have dropped so much recently .
The End of This Golden Age of TV – It ’s no secret that in the past few years , we ’ve been living in an era with the best Television ever created .
And while I think that era actually peaked in 2004 - 2005 ( since then , we ’ve lost The Sopranos , Deadwood , Veronica Mars , The West Wing ) ( and we are on track to lose The Wire , Battlestar Galactica , Scrubs ) , the Writers Strike will hasten the demise .
And not just because the networks will flood the airwaves with reality shows .
I think that the it is going to be a matter of momentum .
Creative momentum .
You can also watch a TV show gather steam over the course of a season : it happened last year to Heroes and 30 Rock as the writers got on top of their ideas and the actors got inside of their characters .
You saw it this year with Mad Men , and you were beginning to see it with Pushing Daisies .
And now , all of that momentum is gone .
Poof .
All of the ideas piling on top of each other that would have happened just because of the need to create under deadline and the immediate link to the previous ideas that worked — that ’s all gone .
Is momentum important ?
Ask the Colorado Rockies .
Ask nearly every single band who has ever broken up and reunited .
Ask any fan of the first three Star Wars films if they would have rather George Lucas follow his original plan of making a new film every three years or waited 20 years for the next installment .
It ’s going to take a toll on quality .
The End of Reality TV – Forget the fact that Reality TV is essentially scripted by the Producers .
( Which , of course , says a lot about — well , everything . )
And forget the fact that it continues to be a viable genre .
If the networks think that they are going to flood us with nothing but Reality TV , we will rebel .
It ’s that simple .
And it will affect the bottom line .
I have a shitload of DVDs that I can watch .
This last summer , I did not watch a single episode of a single Primetime TV show on NBC , CBS , ABC , FOX or CW .
I am fully prepared to do that again , and I guarantee that I ’m not the only one .
It ’s entirely possible that by the end of the strike , the only show that is still getting good numbers is American Idol .
Everything else in the Top Ten will be wayy down from the scripted shows that they replaced .
More bad movies –
Or worse , movies that could have been pretty good with just a few tweaks on - set .
The studios have been stockpiling scripts .
That ’s what we have been told .
And , of course , every single one of those scripts will be perfect when filmed .
Not a single one of them will require a rewrite .
Yeah , surrrrrrre .
Obviously , the production schedules will need to be kept , the films will need to be made .
But they ’ll probably suck a little bit more .
Of course , it ’s entirely possible that does n’t matter : as the quality of highest - quality American Television has pretty much surpassed the quality of all but the highest highest quality American Film ( possibly because TV has become a writer - driven medium ) , box office still remains strong .
So maybe it wo n’t matter : the big screen will continue to be about whizz - bang and spectacle and nothing much else , and as long as the people come , who cares ?
I mean , besides the people who care about the quality of films in the first place .
FEELING a little less mentally quick than you did a few years ago ?
Maybe you are among the many people who do “ brain exercises ” like sudoku to slow the cognitive decline associated with aging .
We ’ve got a better suggestion .
Computer programs to improve brain performance are a booming business .
In the United States , consumers are expected to spend $ 80 million this year on brain exercise products , up from $ 2 million in 2005 .
Advertising for these products often emphasizes the claim that they are designed by scientists or based on scientific research .
To be charitable , we might call them inspired by science — not to be confused with actually proven by science .
Environmental enrichment does improve mental function in laboratory animals .
Rodents and monkeys that get playmates or toys learn to complete a variety of tasks more easily , at all ages .
They also have larger brains , larger brain cells and more synaptic connections than animals raised alone in standard cages .
But here ’s the rub : standard laboratory environments are tremendously boring .
Lab animals rarely need to search for food or avoid predators .
In contrast , most of us get plenty of everyday stimulation in activities like finding a new address , socializing with friends or navigating the treacherous currents of office politics .
Animal enrichment research may be telling us something important not about the positive effects of stimulation , but about reversing the negative effects of deprivation .
Another line of evidence cited by marketers comes from studies of elderly people who improve certain skills by practicing a challenging computer - based task .
Although most programs work to some extent , the gains tend to be specific to the trained task .
Police say Kazmierczak 's behaviour had become erratic recently
The head of police at Northern Illinois University , Don Grady , said Kazmierczak had studied sociology there in 2007 .
Mr Grady said it was not known why Kazmierczak , 27 , who was armed with three handguns and a shotgun , opened fire in a crowded lecture hall .
Another 15 people were injured before Kazmierczak killed himself .
Student Desiree Smith , who was in the hall , said the gunman suddenly appeared 10 minutes before the end of the lecture .
She said : " He was dressed all in black , he had a black ski cap on and then I saw him shoot .
" He aimed at our professor and I did see our professor shot in the arm . "
There were no red flags
Don Grady
University mourns Eyewitnesses speak
Mr Grady said there had been nothing to suggest Kazmierczak would commit such an act , but added he had become erratic in recent weeks after he stopped taking some unspecified medication .
" Actually , there were no red flags , " the police chief said .
" He was someone that was revered by the faculty and staff and students alike .
The police chief said it was still unclear how many shots had been fired , but 48 bullet casings had been found as well as six shotgun shells .
He praised the actions of the emergency services , saying police had been on the scene within minutes .
Counselling
The gunman 's tearful father , Robert Kazmierczak , told reporters outside his home in Lakeland , Florida , that it was a " very hard time " for him , but was too upset to say more .
The gunman 's father wept outside his Florida home
The university 's president , John Peters , said the police had rehearsed for such an eventuality .
Mr Peters said there had been an outpouring of support from around the United States and the world following the attack .
US President George W Bush expressed his sorrow at the shootings , saying : " Obviously , a tragic situation on that campus , and I asked our fellow citizens to offer their blessings . "
As the university tries to come to terms with killings , counsellors have been arriving from neighbouring colleges to assist in the grieving process .
A candlelit vigil is planned for this evening on the campus .
The shooting comes 10 months after 32 students and staff were killed by a student at Virginia Tech in one of the worst shootings ever at a US school .
Harwell 's Unfortunate Laws of Human Organizational Behavior [ Note : I wrote this on one of my more cynical days when my tongue seemed to be stuck in my cheek .
For a newsletter article offering advice for new managers on how to minimize the effect of these laws on your own organization , click here . ]
In the spirit of the Peter Principle and Parkinson 's Law , I 've created my own set of laws that show how managers behave in organizations unless you explicitly take steps to prevent the behavior .
The laws are deliberately extreme to make a point : human motivation is a funny thing , and you have to be very careful to align motivation and reward with the behavior you want .
Here are the laws : People always try to use their experience even if it does n't apply to the current situation .
If someone is brought in as the new manager of an organization , then the new manager will feel obligated to change the organization .
Otherwise , what value is the manager contributing ?
If a manager does n't know how to improve an organization , then he / she will change it to look like the last organization that he / she remembers .
Either things in an organization will get better or things will get worse .
If things get better , then the manager will be rewarded , regardless of whether the manager is responsible for the improvement .
If things get worse , then the manager will move on to another organization to try again .
Sometimes things in an organization get a little better before they get a lot worse .
If the manager is lucky , then he / she will be promoted to a better job before things start to get worse .
Of course , then the cycle will start all over again .
Rarely , a new manager will actually ask the employees what should be improved .
If the employees understand how their organization contributes to the company 's overall performance , then they will undoubtedly provide a better answer than the manager 's experience .
Sometimes the manager will hire a consultant .
The consultant will then ask the employees what should be improved , and the result will be put into a PowerPoint® presentation , then ignored by the manager .
Good organizations will continue to get better until someone in higher management decides they 're not good enough .
Then they 'll get worse .
Bad organizations will continue to get worse until a new manager tries an idea which should have been obvious from the beginning .
If a company contains multiple similar organizations , then they will always be compared , but the true differences will not be discovered .
The good organizations will get worse as a result of the comparison , and the bad organizations will get worse as well .

Internet Reducing American Energy Use
February 14th , 2008 by Sarah Lozanova
The internet is saving 10 times the energy required to run an internet - linked computer .
Remember when renting a movie required a trip to the video store or checking a bank balance required a visit to the bank ?
Now , anything from used books to driving maps are just a click away .
Telecommuting is common and taxes can be submitted electronically to the IRS .
The internet is shaping our lifestyles , allowing us to save energy .
A recent study by the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy ( ACEEE ) discovered that every kilowatt - hour of electricity used to power communications and information technologies is resulting in a 10 fold increase in energy savings .
“ Acceleration of information and computer technology across the US landscape post 1995 is driving much of the nation ’s energy - productivity gain , ” says John Laitner of the ACEEE and coauthor of the study .
“ Had we continued at the historic rate of prior years , we would today be using the energy equivalent of 1 billion barrels of oil more [ per year ] than we were ” in the early 1990s .
Energy intensity is a measurement of the quantity of energy required to produce one dollar of output and is a good indicator of overall energy efficiency .
After the oil embargo , the energy intensity in American fell sharply .
From 1986 to 1996 however , energy efficiency improvements fell to under 1 % annually .
Around 1995 , the use of the internet began to increase significantly .
Remarkably , from 1996 to 2001 , energy intensity fell by an average of 2.9 % annually .
This trend has continued since 2001 at a pace of 2.4 % annually , with half of it being attributed to technology gains .
The energy saving impacts of information and communications technology can expand through mindful use .
Purchasing models that consume less energy , selecting optimal energy settings , and using a laptop instead of a PC all save electricity .
I am happy to know that my beloved computer is helping me to reduce my energy use and studies such as this remind me of how technology can be used as a tool for a greener lifestyle .
The future potential is staggering as energy costs increase , concern of climate changing mounts , and the use of the internet expands over time .

The Dangers of the “ Thought Crimes ” Bill -- Interview with Law Professor Peter Erlinder revolution.sfbureau [ at ] gmail.com )
Monday Dec 24th , 2007 12:01 PM by Revolution Newspaper
On October 23 , with very little notice in the media , the U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill called the “ Violent Radicalization and Homegrown Terrorism Prevention Act of 2007 ” ( HR 1955 ) .
This bill is an amendment to the 2002 Homeland Security
Act which authorized the most massive re-organization of the federal government since World War 2 and dramatically increased its repressive powers .
The bill is now in the Senate .
Revolution recently interviewed Peter Erlinder , law professor at the William Mitchell College of Law in St. Paul , Minnesota and past president of the National Lawyers Guild , about this bill and its implications .
Revolution :
You and others have been sounding the alarm about the “ Violent Radicalism and Homegrown Terrorism ” bill .
Tell us what is so dangerous about this bill .
Peter Erlinder : A Congressperson named Harman , who is a conservative Democrat from California , promoted her draft of the bill , and it was taken up by the House leadership as something non-controversial .
So the Democrats and the Republicans in Congress passed it 404 to 6 without much discussion and debate .
It ’s understandable why that would be , because it is called the “ Prevention of Violent Radicalism and Homegrown Terrorism ” bill , and it does two things .
One is that it funds the Department of Homeland Security to carry out sort of academic research into “ violent radicalism and homegrown terrorism . ”
And perhaps that is something that is within the ambit of government .
But the problem is that the way that it defines “ violent radicalism and homegrown terrorism ” is so broad that it subjects nearly any political activist or group of political activists to investigation by a legislative commission that is also established by the bill .
Now the problem with the legislative commission , at least as it ’s described in the bill , is that the face of the bill does not make clear what the inherent powers of this legislative commission are .
And without that , the real danger in the bill is not apparent to someone who would read it for the first time and who does n’t remember history .
The bill defines “ homegrown terrorist ” as anyone who “ intimidate (s ) or coerce (s ) the United States government , the civilian population … or any segment thereof , in furtherance of political or social belief . ”
This would , or could very well , include Americans who organize mass marches on Washington for the purpose of coercing changes in government policy .
It defines “ violent radicals ” as Americans — and this applies to citizens as well as non-citizens who are in U.S. territory — as those who “ promot ( e ) extremist belief system (s ) for the purpose of facilitating ideologically based violence to advance political , religious or social change . ”
In other words , this applies to Americans who have n’t done anything illegal , but who the commissioners believe have thoughts that might lead to violence .
The bill does n’t target all thoughts or all belief systems that might result in violence , but only those in which force or violence might be used to promote political or religious or social beliefs .
And that ’s exactly the kind of violence that might result whenever people gather to demonstrate for or against important issues .
For example , the World Trade Organization demonstrations in Seattle would fit under this definition .
The commission that is set up is supposed to last for 18 months and have hearings around the country , and then report every six months as to what they ’re finding about these “ dangerous ” people in our midst .
What that means is that virtually any politically , socially , or religiously active person or group can be targeted by this commission to find out who is and who is not the “ hidden enemy . ”
The problem is that witnesses who refuse to testify can be held in contempt of Congress , as former members of the Bush Administration , Harriet Miers and others , are finding out now .
And if witnesses do testify and say things that the commissioners and the staff think are not true , they can be charged with perjury or lying to a federal official , like Scooter Libby was .
In either case , it requires people to talk about their political associations and their beliefs on pain of jail if they do n’t comply .
Revolution : You ’ve compared these commission hearings to the House Un- American Activities Committee .
Peter Erlinder : The HUAC , yeah .
It ’s very much the same thing , because when HUAC was set up in 1938 , it was originally supposed to investigate who the “ dangerous ” Americans were at that time .
The Ku Klux Klan was mentioned as one , but once HUAC got rolling , it began to call before it people who the House Un- American Activities Committee thought knew something about communists or communism .
And for 40 years , HUAC investigated all sorts of groups and individuals , and jailed people like the Hollywood 10 when they refused to talk , blacklisted other people like Arthur Miller , Paul Robeson , Pete Seeger , Richard Wright .
And it required people to either inform on those they knew , or face ostracism , which is precisely what this commission has the power to do .
George Santayana , the 20th - century American philosopher , said , “ Those who ca n’t remember the past are condemned to repeat it . ”
It seems like the members of Congress who voted for this thing have forgotten history .
Another great American philosopher , Yogi Berra , put it best when he said , “ It seems like déjà vu all over again . ”
And of course , it is .
Revolution : Can you speak more to what the powers of this commission would be ?
Peter Erlinder :
The powers that are inherent in any legislative investigative body .
Which means — and these are inherent in any committee investigations undertaken by Congress — they have the power to subpoena people to come to testify , and if they do n’t come to testify they can be jailed for contempt of Congress , which is what is facing Harriet Miers now and the other members of the Bush administration who refuse to appear before Congressional committee .
In addition to that , if someone swears to tells the truth and does n’t , they can be charged with perjury .
And even if they are n’t sworn to tell the truth , there ’s a statute that has actually been enforced after HUAC was disbanded in 1975 that makes it a crime to lie to a federal official — or to say anything that a federal official thinks is a lie .
So the general structure that exists inherently in this commission is the ability to compel attendance and testimony on pain of contempt — and if one does testify , facing prosecution for either perjury or lying to a federal official if the commissioners or their staff think the person is not telling the truth .
But in any case , if the commission follows through on the mandate given it by the Congress , it will of necessity have to call people before it people who might have information about Americans who the commissioners think have these “ extremist belief systems ” or who might be connected with people or organizations that might have folks with “ violent thoughts ” in their circle .
So for example , anyone in a mosque could be called to testify about what they know about everybody else in the mosque — or a church , or a social activist group , or a political group .
Revolution :
This bill does n’t specifically change existing laws or set up new punishment .
But could this be a basis for repressive new laws ?
Peter Erlinder :
What it does is it creates a target for investigation .
And the target it creates is so broadly defined that any person on American territory who does more than watch TV and go into the ballot box is subject to being investigated .
Revolution :
You mentioned at the beginning the role of the Democrats and in particular Jane Harman , who has been in the news recently because it turns out she knew about the CIA torture tapes back in 2003 .
Can you talk a little about the role of the Democrats in this ?
Peter Erlinder :
The reason that the vote was so lopsided , according to a couple of Congresspeople from Minnesota that I ’ve talked to , is that this was promoted by the House leadership as something that did n’t require much attention because it was n’t controversial .
And for people who have not studied HUAC , which was disbanded only in 1975 , but still that ’s 30 - odd years ago , for people who are n’t familiar with what HUAC did and the damage it caused , and because the bill itself does n’t mention the inherent powers of this commission , people who should have been concerned about this allowed it to slide through , apparently .
But this is plainly a Democrat - sponsored bill pushed by the House leadership , Nancy Pelosi and Company .
Revolution :
How do you see this bill in the context of the overall repressive climate in this country , the laws and actions of Bush like Patriot Act , wiretapping , legitimizing torture , and so forth ?
Peter Erlinder :
Well , I think a lot of people are familiar with the famous quote from Pastor Niemoller : “ First they came for the Communists , and I was n’t a Communist so I did n’t speak up … ”
And then they came for the labor organizers , and then they came for the Jews .
And then they came for me and there was no one left to speak up .
That is a description of a political reality that ’s playing itself out , and we can see it happening .
And it occurs whenever one group is targeted as being the “ enemy . ”
Inevitably the boundary of that stain begins to blur .
And we ’ve seen it time and again in our history that once the process gets started , it requires conscious political opposition to turn it back .
I am African - American .
We are a sentimental people in the main and we tend to track our own .
We are aware of others of colour who cross our spaces .
We look around asking : " How did she / he come to be here / there ?
Is his / her story extraordinary , coincidental or totally banal ? "
At 80 years old , my dentist father has been a desegregator all of his adult life , both professionally and domestically .
Although raised in Richmond , Virginia , he chose to rear his family up north , first in Boston , then in a Connecticut suburb of New York .
When I call him to ask how things are going during the first week of the US Open , he tells me that the Williams sisters are doing fine , as is James Blake , and there are a young boy and girl playing in their first Open who wo n't get too far this time but are looking mighty good .
Unsaid , I know the nature of the report he 's going to give ; unsaid , he knows what I want to hear : stories about black people coming on to traditional white fields of play and not just holding their own but kicking ass and taking names .
Smiles , pride , a fist in the air .
So why the viscerally negative reaction , my gut literally roiling with distaste and disappointment , when I look at Condoleezza Rice , the first African - American female to be secretary of state of the world 's one remaining superpower ?
She is a powerful woman , often coming first in lists of the world 's most powerful women .
Unlike Hillary Clinton and Oprah Winfrey , she is seldom referred to by her first name only : as with Angela Merkel and Margaret Thatcher , she gets both her names .
Her eyes , intelligent , usually veiled , often glittering hard , give up nothing .
Her hair is now less iron - solid than it was but , as with Thatcher and Merkel , it is generally unmovable .
And there is the posture : ramrod straight .
The chin is held high even seemingly when notes are consulted , but that is very seldom , because Rice functions in public almost invariably without notes .
A woman of impressive intellect - vast , profound and / or well - trained - holding her own , be it among or before the most powerful white men in the world .
Again and again , she is generally the only non-secretarial black woman to be seen in such environments .
Mercilessly kicking ass , taking names .
Ready .
( A cultural footnote : back in the day , before any kind of mixing , before even Motown was heard on white radio stations , African - Americans had a play on the word " ready " .
If someone acted a fool , the jibe was : " He / she ai n't ready . "
Not ready for responsibility or integration , ie interaction with white folks . )
So why am I so loth to look in her direction ?
She is not unattractive ; our ages and backgrounds are reasonably similar .
Yet I must force myself to look at her .
She is family , attenuated family , deplored family maybe , but family none the less .
I do not have to condone or even explain family misdeeds .
But I take her complicity in what I consider the most disastrous US administration in modern times very personally .
I want to take her by the shoulders and shake , if not throttle her .
But very much more , I want to know , why ?
Why the Republicans and these Republicans ?
Why the rigidity ?
Why the hubris ?
Why so little compassion for those less blessed than yourself ?
So intelligent , so capable ... how could you get it so wrong ?
It is with these questions in mind that I came to Marcus Mabry 's biography of Rice .
A graduate of Stanford University during Rice 's time there , like her a student of Soviet Russia , later a fellow of the Council on Foreign Relations , Mabry - formerly chief of correspondents at Newsweek magazine - is supremely equipped to examine his subject .
He is also African - American and so gained access to family and friends who would have been far more circumspect with a white person .
Not unexpectedly I learn that Rice seemed to have popped " ready " from the womb .
She was born in Birmingham , Alabama in November 1954 , her parents coming from two families of strivers .
Of modest financial means , but fierce pride , discipline and determination , her kin had made their mark and way in a city known for some of the most virulent racism in the old South .
When John Rice
Sr decided to abandon the cotton fields for book learning , he converted from Methodist to Presbyterian when he learned that the nearby Stillman Institute in Tuscaloosa , Alabama , offered scholarships for black men wanting to become ministers in that faith .
His son followed in his footsteps .
On gaining his degree in 1949 , Condoleezza 's father , John Jr , moved to Birmingham , and met and married Angelena Ray , a teacher of music , science , maths and oratory at a local black high school .
John Rice
Jr was a huge bear of a man , gregarious and warm .
The lighter - skinned Rays were proud and clannish , needing no one but their own .
An only child because her mother could n't imagine dividing her love , Condoleezza was her family 's perfect legacy .
Reading music from the age of three , never fidgeting or dreamy , she was initially home - schooled and not allowed to play with the girl across the street unless her mother could watch her though open doors .
The US edition of Mabry 's book is entitled Twice as Good .
I expect that this was discarded for its lack of cultural resonance here in the UK , but among striving African - American families " twice as good " was the order of all days .
We knew that good was n't enough to achieve in the white world and many of us were reared with what Mabry calls the " affection of expectation " .
I myself did well in school .
I knew this was expected of me , but I was also enjoying myself .
However , when at 13 I learned that many of my ( white ) classmates were getting paid for their A grades , I ran this by my father .
His response was : " You do n't get paid to do your best .
That 's your job . "
I was n't surprised ( though I would n't have minded the extra quarters ) .
In Rice 's upbringing things went far further .
An accomplished classical pianist who spent hours practising every day , when she wished to play one of the Supremes in a school talent show , her father dismissed it as common .
She would tap dance instead , and although Condoleezza had never tap danced before , she got by .
She was being trained for solo stardom .
These were the years when the civil rights movement was at its height and particularly lethal in what was dubbed " Bombingham " .
In addition to the bombings , beatings , dogs , water hoses and mass arrests were all too frequent , but although John Rice was known for mentoring the youth of his community , neither he nor the Rays held with the collective mass protests led by Martin Luther King and his lieutenants .
They were practical people , realists who believed in the power of diligently applied individual will to change one 's situation and improve one 's lot , and had no desire to be seen as part of a group - at least not this group .
Participants in marches were lower class , in their opinion and , most particularly , John Rice could not condone the morality of the city 's famous children 's crusade , when hundreds upon hundreds of black children left school and were jailed for marching against civic directive .
He would not allow his daughter to participate , but he drove her downtown to observe from the safety of their car .
He perched her on his shoulders outside a fenced outdoor detainment camp .
These are images to be reckoned with , the treasured special child insulated from harm within the considerable steel of a 1960s American automobile and observing world - challenging turmoil from the eyrie of her father 's high and ample shoulders .
Via her father 's hard work , the Rice family 's prospects improved , and in 1968 they moved to Denver , Colorado , where John 's graduate studies at the University of Denver resulted in an administrative appointment at that school .
For the first time the family were living , working and going to school in a white environment .
After a period of readjustment , Rice continued her familiar pattern of academic excellence combined with the solitary disciplines of piano and now figure skating training as well .
Then , in the summer after her second year at Denver , came her first crisis of confidence , when she attended the music school of the Aspen Music Festival .
Up to that point , Rice had been dedicating countless hours of practice toward her career goal of becoming a classical pianist , but at Aspen she encountered students far younger than she who could read by sight things that had taken her an entire year to master .
Not wanting to be mediocre , she decided to change course .
Her teacher was not surprised .
He had recognised early on that although Rice was technically competent , she was too emotionally detached to be a great musician .
Rice 's later reaction to queries about losing the dream of her early years were words that had by then become her mantra : " I do n't do life crises .
I really do n't .
Life 's too short .
Get over it .
Move on to the next thing . "
That next thing was disciplined study of the Soviet Union , first at Denver University , then at Notre Dame University for a masters degree , then back to Denver for a brief interlude , and finally on to Stanford with a predoctoral fellowship .
She charmed all whom she encountered .
She was competent , tireless and a pleasure to be around .
She was also an African - American woman shining in an unexpected field , something that worked very much to her advantage during a time of affirmative action .
A pause to consider what Rice 's years of higher education were and what they were not .
Nothing in her educational progress seemed to diminish her family - inculcated feeling of distinction , but why was there no impulse to push the educational envelope by attending more competitive schools ?
Yes , she was young when she entered Denver , with all the sheltering , probably younger than her years , and after the loss of her musical dreams and the finding of a political science mentor at Denver University ( Madeleine Albright 's father ) , one can understand why she chose to complete her undergraduate studies at home .
But with all this academic self - confidence , why was there no desire for graduate study in the Ivy League or Berkeley or the University of Chicago , to hone her intellectual skills via challenge from those at least her equal ?
Her father was a university administrator concerned with affirmative action .
She would have known that elite institutions were welcoming qualified African - American students .
Did she eschew the possibility of being just another smart black girl whose gifts might not stand out so magnificently with other smart black girls about , black girls from equally , far more and far less supportive environments - the academic equivalent of Aspen , in fact ?
Rice 's university years were a time of tumult on elite American campuses , anti-Vietnam war and pro-Black Nationalist strikes , teach -ins and demonstrations .
It was chaotic , time - consuming and , yes , I can attest , time - wasting to some degree .
For one programmed for ordered perfection , such an environment might have been repellent ; but in the unruly hair and dogmas , the disorderly passions , was a provocative creativity as students probed the meaning of being American and human in changing times .
From her eyries in Denver and South Bend , Indiana , where the greatest passion was for football and most black students were on sports scholarships just trying to hold their own , Rice was above that messy fray , undistracted , not having to justify her decision not to be part of any group to folk who would have kept on asking , not having to defend her ideas before those of a similar background who had the abilities to question her worth .
She was thus able to reinforce her steely belief that nobody was her intellectual equal , certainly no person of colour in her peer group .
Time and again in interviews , Rice maintains that despite the manifold physical threats to black people in Birmingham - and even the death of one of her school friends in the infamous church bombing of 1963 - it was not rabid racists who struck the most fear into her heart ( at age eight ) but the Cuban missile crisis the year before .
In 1968 , when she was 13 , it was not the assassination of Martin Luther King that tore at her soul but the Soviet suppression of the Prague Spring .
Nothing Mabry or any other questioner has suggested has ever induced her to sway from this stance .
True to his journalistic calling , Mabry does not editorialise inordinately on this point , but he is far younger than Rice ( and me ) .
I am sure he has done his homework , and he is bound to have heard many tales of those horrible weeks in 68 during the course of his young life , but not having been around then he cannot know in his gut how the death of Dr King had such a visceral impact on Americans , both black and white , who were n't spawn of the devil .
To claim more concern for an unknown foreign people thousands of miles away when , regardless of your family 's political notions , you have heard this man 's eloquence in defence of your freedom and personhood , when all around you people are heaving with grief , anger and despair , bespeaks a dishonesty of colossal dimensions .
Rice was not alone in her desire to stand out from the rank and file of a debased minority .
Many of us did this .
We studied Chinese , Arabic , European painting , Indonesian architecture , Hindu cosmogony and mushrooms .
We were well aware of our exceptionalism - you could n't not be with white professors and students wondering what you were doing in unusual places , often to our faces - and eager to push wide the bounds of what people thought we could do .
But by and large we felt it unnecessary to go to Rice 's lengths to shore up our exception .
Or maybe she is being truthful and thus displaying a lack of human empathy that is even more disturbing , indeed smacks of the sociopathic .
Rice 's appointment to Stanford in 1981 ( as an assistant professor in political science ) was affirmative action in the best sense .
She was not , on paper , the most qualified for the appointment - her colour and gender had tipped the scales in her favour - but once in situ she ran so fast , far and well that she left her peers in the dust .
She was a dynamic and well - liked teacher , an ever - prepared and charismatic speaker .
In 1984 , she was noticed at a conference on the future of the cold war by Brent Scowcroft , the former general who was soon to be National Security Council advisor to President George Bush Sr. In 1989 , he brought her to Washington as the National Security Council director of Soviet and east - European affairs in Bush Sr 's administration .
In so doing , Rice became an integral player in the reunification of Germany and the denouement of the Soviet empire , distinguishing herself on the international stage .
Though Stanford 's campus felt small upon her return in 1991 , her professional life continued as one success after another .
She wanted corporate experience and , via her Republican contacts , was appointed to the executive boards of Chevron , Hewlett Packard , Transamerica and the International Advisory Council of JP Morgan .
She became a paid consultant for ABC News on Soviet affairs , and in 1992 was appointed provost of Stanford University , the youngest in its history and , of course , the first to be African - American .
In 1952 , when Alabama 's Democratic party was not allowing black voter registration , its Republican party had welcomed John Rice into its fold , and he had always told his daughter to think Republican .
Each Republican was an individual , not part of a group , while in 1980 the Democratic presidential nominee Walter Mondale was still characterising black people as hapless victims , at least in Rice 's eyes .
Infuriated and repelled , she voted for Ronald Reagan , attracted by his strength , and saying : " I 'd rather be ignored than patronised . "
While she never seemed an ideological Republican prior to her time with Bush Sr , upon her return to Stanford , many of her friends - who , interestingly , are in the main far more leftwing than she is - detected a hardening in her approach to issues such the affirmative action that had greatly assisted her own rise .
She was also extremely autocratic .
She was intelligent ; she was always right .
She believed deeply that she was God 's instrument , guided by His will .
Despite her inexperience as a manager , she felt that compromise and coalition - building were an unnecessary waste of time .
She could be ruthless .
She accomplished much , was also feared - and , of course , she was exceptional .
There had never been much room in Rice 's life for relationships , but she was something of a flirt in her first years away from home .
She was partial to football players and most attracted to the bad boys among them .
This is not so surprising .
For someone loth to share the inner workings of her heart and mind , bad boys are ideal .
Bad boys titillate , make you feel daring by following their leads , but with their tendency towards narcissism they are n't going to probe very deep beyond what they see .
They are not worrying about the truth in themselves so they are not going to search for the truth in you .
In 1998 , accepting an invitation from Bush to come to Kennebunkport , Maine , to meet his son George W , Rice encountered the quintessential bad boy , with a near - direct avenue to the heart of American power .
They clicked .
They more than clicked .
They both considered themselves outsiders .
He admired her brains , she his leadership instincts and " compassion - ate conservatism " .
They shared a sense of humour and a love of sports .
And the rest is our current history .
Originally drafted in to school the second George in foreign policy and to manage the coterie of advisors dubbed the Vulcans , Rice and her exemplary exceptionalism became a key weapon in the overall campaign .
Crowds loved her , her charm , her charisma , her life 's example of the power of individual will .
When the election in 2000 was finessed in his favour , it was only natural that Bush would want Condi by his side .
During the first term she was National Security advisor ; in the second she is the secretary of state .
As with his subject 's earlier life , Mabry details the progress of Rice 's involvement with Bush Jr with cogent application - her varying levels of success in outmanoeuvring the administration 's behemoths of malice , Donald Rumsfeld and Dick Cheney ; her continuing and steadfast belief in God and in herself and in the man to whom , say family and friends , she can't say no ; the continuing and steadfast refusal even now , after four years of Iraqi debacle , to concede misguided decisions , let alone failure .
The question that can be asked is this : is this continuing and steadfast refusal to go off script because she wo n't , or because she is not able ?
Having always been insulated from the chaotic mix of the world by her family and then through her own choices , having never cultivated the virtues of spontaneity and creative thinking beyond the goals of careerism , Rice formulated her ideas of power through a very narrow prism .
She is not alone in this .
Regrettably , few foreign policy advisors in many governments have taken the time to learn the workings of hearts and minds operating on bases other than their own .
Unfortunately for Rice , her time at the helm has coincided with the splintering of political theories of what works and what does not .
Because of this , she was ill - equipped to guide her feckless leader through so shape - shifting a time .
In reaching so high , her exceptionalism could no longer be judged by the mere fact that she had reached such a pinnacle , but by how she performed when she got there .
The working consensus at this point in 2007 is that she is working more efficiently at the State Department than at the National Security Council , no longer in such physical and symbiotic closeness to her employer , but that these will be looked upon as embarrassingly tainted years and in this she will have been an integral factor .
One could ask , why the moral outrage ?
Rice has become a politician and this is said to be the way politicians behave .
But that would be forgetting the holy shroud of morality that drapes about the shoulders of American society .
We are meant to be a nation conceived in liberty via the blessings of God .
Is not one of the first tenets of America 's God , and Rice 's Christian belief , to protect the common welfare and give succour to the less fortunate ?
I may be sentimental , but African - American sentimentality is but American sentimentality .
Creating and trading on her exceptionalism , Rice has gone far further than most of us .
Is this proof of her superiority , her willingness to adapt , or both ?
Despite her disassociation from the life and messages of Martin Luther King , she is the epitome of his wish for his children that they be judged " not by the colour of their skin but by the content of their character " .
In this , most certainly , if not in all that she might have imagined , Condoleezza Rice has succeeded .

This newspaper and its editorial staff  both current and former  are the targets of unprecedented grand jury subpoenas dated August 24 .
The authorities are also using the grand jury subpoenas in an attempt to research the identity , purchasing habits , and browsing proclivities of our online readership .
It is , we fear , the authorities ' belief that what you are about to read here is against the law to publish .
But there are moments when civil disobedience is merely the last option .
We pray that our judgment is free of arrogance .
These are the issues as we understand them .
In a breathtaking abuse of the United States Constitution , Sheriff Joe Arpaio , Maricopa County Attorney Andrew Thomas , and their increasingly unhinged cat 's paw , special prosecutor Dennis Wilenchik , used the grand jury to subpoena " all documents related to articles and other content published by Phoenix New Times newspaper in print and on the Phoenix New Times website , regarding Sheriff Joe Arpaio from January 1 , 2004 to the present . "
Every note , tape , and record from every story written about Sheriff Arpaio by every reporter over a period of years .
In addition to the omnibus subpoena , which referred to our writer Stephen Lemons directly , reporters John Dougherty and Paul Rubin were targeted with individual subpoenas .
More alarming still , Arpaio , Thomas , and Wilenchik subpoenaed detailed information on anyone who has looked at the New Times Web site since 2004 .
Every individual who looked at any story , review , listing , classified , or retail ad over a period of years .
The seemingly picayune matter of Sheriff Arpaio 's home address getting printed at the bottom of an opinion column on our Internet site  and the very real issue of commercial property investments the sheriff hid from public view  have now erupted into a courtroom donnybrook against a backdrop of illegal immigration disputes , Mexican drug cartels , the Minutemen , political ambition , and turf disputes between prosecutors and the judiciary .
And given the diva - like drama that Arpaio attaches to even the mundane , you can add to the grand jury tension the paranoia of a Keystone Kops assassination " plot " against " America 's toughest sheriff . "
Behind these operatic and public developments , an ethical stain has spread over the secret proceedings of the grand jury .
Special prosecutor Wilenchik has sabotaged the integrity of the investigation .
Not content with using the hidden power of sweeping grand jury subpoenas , the government 's lawyer attempted to get the ear of the sitting judge  out of earshot of New Times ' attorneys .
Special prosecutor Wilenchik used a politically potent emissary in a behind - the - curtain attempt to set up a meeting between the judge overseeing the grand jury and Wilenchik .
In a hastily called hearing October 11 , the judge labeled Wilenchik 's attempt to set up an ex parte discussion " absolutely inappropriate . "
In our humble opinion , Wilenchik 's clumsy intervention behind the scenes with the judge was well beyond " inappropriate . "
Wilenchik 's behavior raised the issue of an attempt to rig a grand jury already veiled in official secrecy .
In our deliberations , we faced the obvious : A grand jury investigation is a fearsome thing ; a tainted grand jury is a tipping point .
We intend now to break the silence and resist .
This is hardly the first time  even if the scope here is breathtaking  that law enforcement attempted to use a grand jury to get at the confidential records of reporters or editors .
But the contemptuousness of this troika of ambitious politicos is reflected in their attempt to target the readers of New Times .
In a grandiose insult to the Constitution , Arpaio , Thomas , and Wilenchik used the grand jury to subpoena the online profiles of anyone who viewed four specific articles on the sheriff .
The pertinent section of the secret grand jury subpoena reads , in part : " All internet web site information for the Phoenix New Times internet site related to the web pages . . . [ four specific articles on the sheriff ] .
The information should include , but not be limited to : The Internet Protocol addresses of any and all visitors to each page of . . . [ four specific articles on the sheriff ] . . . "
Energized , perhaps , by this mugging of Constitutional safeguards , Arpaio , Thomas , and Wilenchik then shot the moon .
The grand jury subpoena also demands
Web site profiles of anyone and everyone who visited New Times online over the past two and a half years , not merely readers who viewed articles on the sheriff .
The subpoena demands : " Any and all documents containing a compilation of aggregate information about the Phoenix New Times Web site created or prepared from January 1 , 2004 to the present , including but not limited to :
A ) which pages visitors access or visit on the Phoenix New Times website ;
B ) the total number of visitors to the Phoenix New Times website ;
C ) information obtained from ' cookies , ' including , but not limited to , authentication , tracking , and maintaining specific information about users ( site preferences , contents of electronic shopping carts , etc. ) ;
D ) the Internet Protocol address of anyone that accesses the Phoenix New Times website from January 1 , 2004 to the present ;
E ) the domain name of anyone that has accessed the Phoenix New Times website from January 1 , 2004 to the present ;
F ) the website a user visited prior to coming to the Phoenix New Times website ;
G ) the date and time of a visit by a user to the Phoenix New Times website ;
H ) the type of browser used by each visitor ( Internet Explorer , Mozilla , Netscape Navigator , Firefox , etc. ) to the Phoenix New Times website ; and
I ) the type of operating system used by each visitor to the Phoenix New Times website . "
Special prosecutor Wilenchik wants this information on each and every New Times reader online since 2004 .
New Times attorneys Tom and Janey Henze responded to the grand jury subpoenas with a motion to quash the overwhelmingly intrusive effort by authorities to seize the newspaper 's confidential records , and a motion to make the subpoena public .
While this motion is under consideration by the court , the paper 's attorneys asked that the subpoenas be stayed  that is , held in check  until a decision is rendered .
The Henzes further asked the court to remove Wilenchik from the case for conflicts of interest , including disparaging e-mails he wrote about New Times and writer John Dougherty .
This would not end the grand jury probe , but merely compel County Attorney Thomas to find a prosecutor without a recent history of gross bias , conflict of interest , and inappropriate behavior .
Attorney Michael Meehan , also representing New Times , filed briefs in federal court challenging the constitutionality of the state statute prohibiting publication of home addresses of law enforcement officials on the World Wide Web .
Wilenchik resisted these efforts and filed a countermotion to strike presiding Maricopa County Criminal Court Judge Anna Baca from the case .
He also filed paperwork asking for a hearing to show cause why New Times should not be held in contempt for our refusal to turn over any records .
While these motions were pending , Wilenchik , in a wildly inflammatory move , had an intermediary phone Judge Baca on October 10 to suggest a meeting .
" I have no idea why Mr. Wilenchik wanted to speak to me , " Judge Anna Baca told a rapt audience of attorneys and grand jury targets from New Times at a hearing inside a locked - down courtroom on Thursday , October 11 .
The judge called the hastily convened hearing within hours of receiving the call at her home .
Clearly agitated , the judge characterized the contact as " inappropriate . "
Political operative Carol Turoff phoned Baca at the judge 's residence the Wednesday evening before the hearing .
According to Baca , Turoff said special prosecutor Dennis Wilenchik wished to speak with the judge .
Baca quickly put an end to the conversation with Turoff explaining that she refused to listen to any such proposal .
" I was taken aback that I got such a call , " said Baca .
Indeed .
Within hours , the judge notified all parties that she wanted an immediate status hearing in her closed courtroom .
Carol Turoff , who phoned Baca , is a recent two - term member of the Commission on Appellate Court Appointments .
During her eight years of service , she helped select four of the five sitting Arizona Supreme Court justices .
Additionally , she deliberated on the selection of 17 judges of the Arizona Court of Appeals .
While her term expired in 2004 , she has remained highly active politically and was an early supporter of County Attorney Andrew Thomas .
Larry Turoff , her husband , was appointed a senior member of County Attorney Thomas ' management team following the election .
Faced with the judge 's declaration from the bench that she 'd been contacted by a seasoned political operative whose very fields of influence were judicial appointments  not to mention pillow - talk insight into the prosecutor 's office 
Wilenchik was equal parts insulting , evasive , and defiant .
The special prosecutor said initially that since he had not participated in the conversation between Turoff and Baca , he could not say that it was an accurate recounting .
" It is , counsel , " countered the judge , who pointed out that she had taken notes .
" I did not order or tell Carol Turoff to do anything , " said Wilenchik .
Baca pointed out that Turoff revealed that the idea of a meeting between the special prosecutor and the judge was not Carol Turoff 's idea but , in fact , originated with Wilenchik .
The special prosecutor rambled a bit as he attempted to suggest that he really had not wanted to discuss any of the grand jury proceedings with Judge Baca .
He was more interested , he claimed , in " a global conversation " about relations between the courts and the County Attorney 's Office .
Even if he 'd suggested as much to Turoff , such an implausible alibi would hardly have laundered his attempt to have a private huddle with the judge .
The relationship between the Superior Court , Wilenchik , and the County Attorney was itself the subject of sensitive motions , making Wilenchik 's approach to Baca unethical , no matter which explanation he selected .
And the fact of the matter is that the subject in front of Judge Baca was New Times .
Already facing unprecedented grand jury subpoenas that threatened the newspaper 's independence , those of us present in the courtroom now faced the obvious conclusion that special prosecutor Wilenchik attempted to subvert the process by getting to the judge .
Wilenchik 's attempt to contact the judge outside the presence of our attorneys is not a gray area .
Lawyers have a term for this behavior : ex parte , or " . . . one side only , as in a controversy ; in the interest of one party . "
The Arizona Rules of Professional Conduct are unequivocal : " A lawyer shall not communicate ex-parte with such a person ( judge , juror , prospective juror ) during the proceeding . . . "
Were it not for Judge Anna Baca 's impeccable character , her willingness to short - circuit the conversation with friend Carol Turoff at the same time that she made a record of the approach , Wilenchik 's brazen tactic would never have surfaced .
And yet he remains the special prosecutor .
There will be many questions about our decision to make public the secret machinations of the special prosecutor armed with grand jury powers .
Consider this :
When the wife of a senior member of County Attorney Andrew Thomas ' management team feels free to contact the sitting judge , and when the special prosecutor who initiated this idea of an ex-parte meeting sees nothing wrong with conduct his own profession prohibits , we feel compelled to shed light upon these remarkable proceedings .
And make no mistake : Special prosecutor Wilenchik sees nothing wrong with what he did .
Judge Baca told the prosecutor that it was " absolutely inappropriate . "
" With all due respect , " argued Dennis Wilenchik , " it was absolutely appropriate . "
It is little wonder that special prosecutor Wilenchik found nothing inappropriate about his ex parte contact with Judge Baca ; his instinct to engage in subversive tactics underscores his lack of professional ethics .
On October 3 , precisely one week before Turoff phoned Judge Baca , Wilenchik smeared Superior Court Judge Timothy Ryan in an orchestrated campaign that is part of County Attorney Thomas ' anti-illegal immigration strategy .
National media are now writing about GOP efforts to mount a Rovian campaign to embarrass Democrats who are not strident enough in their willingness to crack down on illegal aliens .
But County Attorney Thomas mounted such attacks from the earliest moments of his initial campaign for office .
The latest outburst directed at the Maricopa County Superior Court is widely recognized as part of Thomas ' preliminary salvos in an anticipated bid for the governor 's office .
The attack on Judge Ryan , in which Wilenchik labeled the justice " a danger to public safety , " grew out of the courts ' efforts to deal with a recently enacted proposition that requires denial of bail to illegal aliens charged with certain felonies .
Ryan and other judges are attempting to instill standards that law enforcement must meet in order to establish that a defendant is indeed an illegal alien .
It is hardly a trivial matter .
This summer , Arpaio 's jail denied admittance to Ramon Delgadillo , who 'd worked 25 years as a court translator .
Despite his extensive track record , the Sheriff 's Office demanded papers that proved he was a naturalized citizen .
Although Arpaio was forced to change jail policy , the confusion underscored the need for coherent and reasonable guidelines while considering bail for suspected illegal aliens .
Wilenchik addressed the issue with such outlandish hostility that there were immediate calls for complaints to be filed against him with the state Bar .
Although Wilenchik 's role as hired gun was highlighted by his inability to answer questions from Judge Ryan about the cases in dispute , he nonetheless attacked the judge 's questions as " self - serving . "
Tellingly , County Attorney Thomas , though unhappy with certain rulings and conduct of Judge Ryan , neither appealed the decisions in question nor asked for judicial review , which are the legal routes for redress .
Instead , members of the news media were notified in advance that they should attend a hearing in Judge Ryan 's court .
At the hearing , Wilenchik made the incredible demand that Ryan step down from all cases .
Rather than proceeding through normal legal channels , Wilenchik 's ad hominem attack marked the beginning of a three - day public assault on the courts by Thomas , highlighted by the grandstanding demand that all 93 judges in Maricopa County be replaced by out - of - county judges .
The presiding judge of the county Superior Court , Barbara Mundell , denied the motion , noting that " no facts to establish bias or prejudice of any , and certainly not all of the 93 judges " was put into evidence .
Still pending , as we went to press , was the effort to remove Judge Ryan individually .
Lost in Wilenchik and Thomas ' tactics were the people involved in the cases .
As Judge Mundell noted , all the victims , witnesses , and defendants would have suffered unnecessary hardships and delays under Wilenchik 's preposterous motion .
Of course , the idea to strike Judge Ryan and his 92 colleagues in Superior Court was pursued with little regard for legal victory but maximum regard for publicity value .
And the execution of this media ploy was both heavy - handed and vicious , playing fast and loose with anti-immigrant prejudices .
The same kind of heavy - handed unscrupulousness by Wilenchik was reported by New Times reporter Paul Rubin in the lawyer 's recent defamation defense of Sheriff Joe Arpaio ( " Below the Belt , " September 20 ) .
In the 2004 election , Arpaio 's office leaked the accusation that the sheriff 's opponent , Dan Saban , now Buckeye 's police chief , had raped his adoptive mom 30 years earlier .
In fact , the accusation was leaked to a television reporter before the Sheriff 's Office actually investigated the charge .
The rape report aired before it was subsequently discredited .
Despite the sleazy behavior of Sheriff Arpaio 's henchmen , Saban had little in the way of actual damages and sued only to clear his name .
He made a point of not asking for financial compensation .
Rubin's story noted that Wilenchik went well beyond merely defending the sheriff .
" Newsworthy are the extralegal machinations Wilenchik employed outside the courtroom to try to ruin Saban 's life , " wrote Rubin .
" In recent months , Wilenchik sent virulent anti-Saban letters to several authorities , including Governor Janet Napolitano , Attorney General Terry Goddard , the Buckeye Town Council , the Mesa Police Department ( Saban 's longtime former employer ) and the Arizona Peace Officer Standards and Training Board , the state police - certification agency known as POST .
" The missives are filled with malevolent innuendo and , in many instances , outright misinformation and disinformation . "
The story goes on to detail the content of Wilenchik 's letters , which have nothing to do with the defense of Sheriff Arpaio in the courtroom and everything to do with destroying Police Chief Saban .
Citing public documents , Rubin also detailed Wilenchik 's employment by the county , as well as his recent hiring to pursue the investigation of New Times ' putting Sheriff Arpaio 's home address on the Internet .
The article never mentioned the existence of the grand jury .
While it recounted the nearly three - year - old controversy over Arpaio 's address , it did not state the address .
Though Saban lost his quixotic suit , he told Rubin , " I still think it was very important to shine the light on this sheriff and what he and his people are capable of doing . "
Twenty - four hours after this article appeared , special prosecutor Wilenchik obtained a grand jury subpoena for Paul Rubin , too .
The subpoena demanded " All document , records and files " associated with the writing and editing of this story , as well as conversations and meetings related to the publishing of it .
It is impossible to view Rubin 's grand jury subpoena as anything other than what it was : an act of vengeance by Wilenchik .
Elected in 1992 , Joe Arpaio , " America 's toughest sheriff , " drew the attention of our writers and then - columnist Tom Fitzpatrick right from the start .
Over a cup of coffee , the newly elected Sheriff asked how he might " get next to " Fitzpatrick , who had resurrected Arpaio 's old nickname from when he served with the Drug Enforcement Agency : " Nickel Bag Joe , " a reference to Arpaio 's fondness for penny - ante busts .
In fact , neither Sheriff Arpaio  nor anyone else  could get next to Fitzpatrick .
Sheriff Arpaio had no better luck with any of our other writers .
While voters lapped up the sheriff 's harsh approach to inmates in his jails  from forcing them to wear pink underwear , to feeding them oxidized , green bologna , to working them in chain gangs , to housing inmates in tents 
New Times writers pointed out that the cruelty and violence in Arpaio 's lockups prompted Amnesty International 's first investigation in America .
And people continued to die under Arpaio 's care .
Crippled people , blind people , people out of their minds .
Local attorney Michael Manning has collected nearly $ 20 million in damages from the county over inmates killed in Arpaio 's custody .
When Arpaio stood yet again for election in 2004 , New Times ' relationship with the sheriff was 12 years old .
Sheriff Arpaio hid nearly $ 790,000 in cold hard cash in three real estate investments that former New Times staff writer John Dougherty discovered in July 2004 , in the middle of a heated primary election .
Arpaio stashed an indeterminate amount of cash in another six parcels of commercial and residential real estate .
With more than a million dollars invested , how could there not be questions ?
Columnist Dougherty wondered how a public servant surviving on a $ 78,000 sheriff 's salary and a government retirement check could afford such an investment portfolio .
It was not a pointless query .
In 12 years overseeing ( at the time ) a $ 140 million law enforcement empire , Arpaio had never suffered a thorough audit by the county .
Perhaps the sheriff inherited a fortune from a distant relative .
A paper trail that should have been public would have reassured voters .
But the normal public real estate records maintained by the government were not available when it came to Sheriff Arpaio .
He used an arcane statute meant to conceal home addresses of law enforcement officials to shield his investments .
Sheriff Arpaio petitioned the court and obtained an order , but rather than merely delete his home address , he removed all the information about all his commercial properties .
The redacted records covered such data as deeds , mortgages , affidavits of value , and conveyances of title .
" It 's because of all the death threats , " Arpaio explained to Dougherty in the summer of 2004 .
Of course , that 's what America 's toughest sheriff says about most things , though it hardly explains how hiding commercial real estate transactions created safety .
During the same time the sheriff 's commercial property records were hidden from the public , his home address was there for anybody interested to see on the County Recorder 's , county Elections Department and the Arizona Corporation Commission Web sites .
The address was also on myriad other sites on the Internet .
To underscore just how far the sheriff had perverted the law , Dougherty included Arpaio 's home address , which he had learned from the other Internet sites , at the end of the second item of his column .
There is another fascinating aspect to all this .
There is a second arcane Arizona law that put us at odds with Sheriff Arpaio .
That law says you cannot publish a law enforcement officer 's address on the World Wide Web .
Yet it is perfectly legal to publish an officer 's home address in your newspaper , or on a billboard .
You can broadcast that address on radio or television .
Like every other news organization we are aware of , the content of our newspaper goes up on our Web site automatically .
Now almost three years after the fact , this criminal law , a Class 5 felony , provided a tool for special prosecutor Dennis Wilenchik to serve our organization with a total of three grand jury subpoenas .
Because we 've been no less critical of County Attorney Andrew Thomas ' policies than we have of Sheriff Arpaio's , the top prosecutor declared a conflict of interest and initially shipped out the alleged Class 5 felony to Pinal County , where it languished for nearly two years before it was punted back to Maricopa County .
At one point , prosecutors in Pinal County agreed that perhaps the best solution was for New Times to file a Constitutional challenge to the Web site statute .
Then the cockamamie card was played .
A Mexican drug cartel acting on behalf of the Minutemen through the intercession of a pro-immigration rights radio talk show host intended to assassinate Arpaio , according to a sheriff 's office investigation detailed on the front page of the Sunday , October 7 , edition of the Arizona Republic .
Now just think about this for a second .
The Minutemen hate Mexicans sneaking across the border .
They are even less fond if the Mexicans are smuggling drugs .
And we are supposed to believe that the Minutemen , seldom associated with unexplained stashes of bling , agreed to a $ 3 million assassination fee and put 50 percent down ?
And that this was brokered by Elias Bermudez , a talk radio host , former mayor of Mexican border town San Luis Rio Colorado in Sonora , and an outspoken critic of Sheriff Arpaio  and , obviously , no fan of the Minutemen ?
And a key linchpin in this comic book farce was a teenage girl in a prep school in Hartford , Connecticut , who was an exchange student at one point in San Luis .
If the drug cartel needed to contact the Minutemen " for any reason , " they could use a particular e-mail address . . . which , as the officers discovered , belonged to a kid in a private school .
Sheriff 's deputies combed the poor child 's computer , as well as her prep school .
Nothing .
Did we mention that the genesis of this fantasy was a confidential source from the border who failed the pivotal polygraph question about whether he was telling the truth about a plot to off Sheriff Arpaio ?
The thread to all this was that the Minutemen wanted to stir up hostility to immigrants for shooting Arpaio .
It was never clear how this was going to be blamed upon mojados , but that was hardly the most glaring question .
Or as Chris Simcox told the morning newspaper , " Look , Joe Arpaio is like a hero to us as Minutemen .
Why would we want to go against the toughest sheriff in the country ? "
When quizzed by the Republic , Chief Larry Black  in charge of the unit that works threat assessment and evaluates the wave of fist - shaking directed at Arpaio  admitted that not a single , factual lead from the confidential source checked out .
" No , it did n't , " Black told the newspaper .
" And it was killing us . "
No doubt .
Just like it was killing Arpaio 's threat - assessment boys in 2003 when prosecutors took hapless James Saville to trial for " plotting " to kill Arpaio .
Jurors wound up deciding that deputies set up the assassin , coaxing and entrapping him .
Saville was acquitted ( " The Plot to Assassinate Arpaio , " August 5 , 1999 ) .
Then there was the time Arpaio identified a threat upon his life that turned out to be an art student 's sculpture of a spider left upon his lawn .
Half a million dollars and almost 17,000 hours later , the latest investigation of the Minutemen / Bermudez caper has gone nowhere , but yet the case remains open .
Coincidentally , we guess , New Times ' alleged Class 5 felony bounced out of Pinal County and back into County Attorney Thomas ' office at just about the time Arpaio was putting on his helmet and moving from one hotel to another to avoid the reputed gunslingers from the Mexican drug cartels .
According to the disappeared confidential informant , none of whose claims could be verified , Los Zetas , the enforcement arm of Mexican drug smugglers , knew where Sheriff Arpaio lived .
As these coincidences began to congeal : Los Zetas knew where Arpaio lives , New Times knows where Arpaio lives , conceivably New Times readers know where Arpaio lives . . .
BAM .
GRAND JURY .
Or maybe these events are not related at all .
Maybe Dennis Wilenchik and Andy Thomas and Joe Arpaio just believe that even though the sheriff 's home address is all over the Internet , is readily available on several government Web sites and is not much of a secret at all , that New Times and its readers should be keelhauled before a grand jury .
Could be .
Dennis Wilenchik recently filed papers with the judge arguing against our motion to open up the proceedings .
We are told to trust the process .
In 2004 , John Dougherty filed public - records requests in the middle of the sheriff 's contested election .
He wanted public information in nine separate areas , from the death of a prisoner to the accounting for the millions of dollars that flowed through jail vending machines .
Arpaio 's office refused to produce any records until we filed a lawsuit .
None of the information was produced in time for the election .
But we worked with the system and stayed with the lawsuit , and today , three years later , we are still waiting for the resolution within the courts .
The election is long over .
Special prosecutor Dennis Wilenchik argued in his paperwork that if we did n't like the intrusiveness of the subpoenas , we had choices within the system .
When Dennis Wilenchik surreptitiously contacted the judge presiding over our grand jury , he argued that we should not be alarmed .
" If there is prosecutorial misconduct in the proceedings , petitioners have remedies for that .
Just ask Mike Nifong , the Duke [ University ] lacrosse players ' prosecutor , " wrote Wilenchik in his response to our motion to remove him from the case .
That 's our remedy ?
Look to Duke ?
Look to the case where the defendants ' lives were ruined , jobs lost , educations canceled , fortunes squandered on attorneys , reputations smeared , and the landscape scorched with the due process of the law ?
When Dennis Wilenchik does n't understand that his behavior is " absolutely inappropriate , " we want to take our chances  not with the process but with the public .
In 1970 , we started this newspaper because we believed in the public 's right to know .
Nothing has changed .

The poet Robert Burns , watching a louse crawl around a rich woman ’s head , was inspired to write a poem that contains a line to the effect that we need to see ourselves as others see us .
I just read a blog by an Arab woman , obviously educated , that is livid with hatred for us for the destruction of Iraq .
She dismisses the excuse of those who say they did n’t vote for the present administration .
What follows is a summary .
She says : " My problem is you .
Your character , your behavior , your haughtiness , arrogance , false pride , denial , collective stupidity and ignorance , your way of life , which I find boring , distasteful and empty .
You are ogres of consumerism , greedy , covetous , gluttonous , voracious , jealous , envious .
You are nothing , and your nihilism contaminates everything else .
You destroy and self - destruct . "
She closes by saying : " Iraq is going down with its past and its future .
I can only promise you one thing .
However long it may take , we are going to take you down with us . "
We Americans are very good at dismissing critics and criticism .
We have such a high opinion of ourselves , we simply can’t believe that normal people can dislike us , much less hate us .
We can destroy whole countries , kill millions of people and then navely expect that the survivors will welcome us as friends .
The old saying that one reaps what one sows is just an accurate observation of the way human history plays out .
We have sown and we are continuing to sow a lot of hatred for ourselves .
War is the most horrible thing one group of people can inflict on another .
War destroys lives , homes , families , economies , cultures and the future .
It kills and maims and impoverishes .
The fallout from war is hatred , and like radioactivity its poison can linger for generations .
The victorious always think their victory will last forever , but the truth is that all victories are temporary .
I would not take the lady ’s vow of vengeance lightly .
She has an ally in that very collective stupidity and ignorance she criticizes .
Anyone who looks at the present leadership , both those in office and those aspiring to office , and feels good about the future is a heck of a lot more optimistic than I am .
Corruption , both monetary and intellectual , is so deep and entrenched in our society that it will take a miracle for us to survive it .
Surveying the world , I see very few countries where the people have any reason whatsoever for liking us .
They may be powerless at the moment to express their hatred , but power , like victory , is also ephemeral .
" Be careful who you step on , on the way up , because you ’re going to meet the same people on the way down . "
A character actor and semigangster said that in the 1930s .
One of our faults is that we have been conditioned by television and short political cycles to think in the short term .
The truth is we have been players on the stage of history only for an instant .
We have won the sprint , but the story of mankind is a marathon .
Should you ever visit Palestine , some Palestinian will almost surely point to the ruins left by the Romans and the Crusaders and say : " Where are they now ?
It took 200 years to get rid of the Crusaders , but they are gone and we are still here . "
Ask yourself if you would fly to Iraq and , unarmed and unescorted , take a walk through Baghdad proudly displaying an American flag on your lapel .
Hatred has a twin brother , and it ’s fear .
We should stop harming other people so we can live without hatred or fear .

Newlywed wo n’t tolerate ‘ overt racism ’ by Louisiana official – CNN.com

Last updated at 08:30 01 February 2008
In April 2007 , foster mother Eunice Spry was sentenced to 14 years in prison for her sadistic abuse of children in her care .
The details of her cruelty - beating youngsters with metal bars , forcing sticks down their throats and forcing them to eat lard , bleach and vomit - were so appalling that they shocked the country .
Here one of her victims speak out ...
Panic is bubbling up through my body .
My tongue is dry and my stomach is churning horribly , although I 'm not hungry .
To distract myself I start fiddling with my pretty bead bracelet .
I like the feel of the smooth chunks of coloured glass as they roll between my nervous fingers .
I do n't know if I can go through with this .
I steal a glance at the face of the female detective who is sitting next to me in the back of the police car .
She looks very determined , while I feel extremely wobbly .
Scroll down for more ...
" You look nice , Alloma .
Very smart . "
DC Martell is smiling encouragingly , as the car nudges through the heavy morning traffic towards Bristol Crown Court , where I will shortly be giving evidence in a child abuse case against my foster mother of ten years , Eunice Spry .
The detective is a reassuring presence .
But in my mind I am still remembering Eunice 's scrawny hands around my throat , trying to stop me from speaking out , squeezing the very breath from my body .
Then I remember that the owner of those terrifying hands is now safely in police custody , and I finally find my voice .
" Thanks , " I say to the detective .
" But are you really sure there 'll be a screen ? "
DC Martell 's face softens .
" I 'm sure , Alloma .
She 'll be brought into court after you 've arrived , so you really wo n't see her face .
I promise . "
I nod slowly , trying to take this in .
God I hope you 're right , I think , because if she can see me , she can get me .
The minute I 'm skewered by her gaze , by those hard , grey eyes that bore into my very soul , then I 'll be lost .
The car pulls up outside the imposing court building and I 'm hastily shepherded inside .
An official brings me a cup of tea and tells me I might have to wait several hours to be called .
To be honest , after so many years of suffering in silence , I do n't suppose another few hours will make a huge difference .
For me , the real issue is whether or not other people - in this case , a jury of 12 complete strangers - will believe the extraordinary story that I am going to tell them .
We can only wait and hope .
That story begins , for me at least , back in the spring of 1991 , when I was still living with my real mum and dad in the genteel spa town of Cheltenham .
As a little girl I knew absolutely that my parents loved me .
That security is the greatest gift you can give a child and is something most of us are lucky enough to take for granted .
I do n't .
I am grateful to my mum and dad for showing me warmth and affection , for every hug and kiss and kind word .
Without the memory of being loved once , I might not have survived my horrific years with Eunice Spry .
My parents had met very young and although they adored their children , our home life was somewhat chaotic .
My mother 's health was fragile and both my parents had experimented as teenagers with drugs , leaving them with problems for which they were still bravely seeking help when I was a little girl .
Every day they would go to a local drug rehabilitation centre , often taking me with them .
They'd do their best to make it a fun outing for me , taking me for lunch in the canteen and going to the park on the way home .
But by the time I was six , they were struggling to cope .
My father forgot to pick me up from school one day , then again , and then quite regularly .
My teachers started to get worried .
Some days my parents did n't manage to get me to school at all .
It was at this point that Eunice Spry came into our lives .
My parents already knew her because she had looked after me briefly as a baby while my mother recovered from an operation .
Now , at this difficult period in their lives , they turned to her for help again .
How could they ever have foreseen the dreadful consequences of their decision ?
My parents were Eunice 's victims , too .
Eunice Spry had originally come to them recommended by Gloucestershire Social Services as a registered childminder and foster carer .
She was in her 40s , a pillar of the community and a devout Jehovah 's witness , as well as being the mother of two children .
Her credentials seemed perfect .
By the time I met her as a six - year - old , Eunice 's children had grown up and she had adopted two young girls : Charlotte , who was a couple of years older than me , and Sarah , who was about the same age .
She readily agreed to help take care of me as well .
Looking back now I can see how I must have seemed like the sweetest little ripe cherry , ready for the picking .
With her gimlet eyes , which missed nothing , Eunice must have entered our house and seen the disorder that pointed unmistakably to a family in trouble .
She was kindness itself on her first visit to our house , chatting to us all in a friendly , lively way .
She taught me to knit with needles and wool she 'd brought specially , and before she left she invited us to her house for Sunday lunch .
Eunice 's semi- detached house in Tewkesbury , around 15 miles from ours , was a revelation .
It was warm and cosy and packed with games , toys and videos , not to mention her five cats .
From the very first time I went there , I loved it .
Before long I began staying overnight , and then for whole weekends .
I now know from the evidence gathered for the court case that Eunice was " grooming " my mum .
She bribed her with presents , offers of washing and cooking and the promise of a good life for her child , so that Mum would entrust me to Eunice 's care .
For a year I shuttled back and forth between my house and Eunice 's until the inevitable day when my father called me into the living room and said he had something important to tell me .
" You know you like going to Eunice 's for the weekend ? " he said .
" Well , " my dad paused and looked at the floor , " you 'll be living there from now on . "
My mum was in floods of tears .
I crawled over to her and she put her arms around me .
I felt sad and scared because I loved my mum , but I also felt a twinge of excitement , if I am totally honest .
" It 's all right , Mum , " I said .
" I 'll be fine .
I will be OK . "
" Yes , love , I 'm sure you will , " said Mum , through her tears .
What she did not know , and what would later emerge in court , was that Eunice had by now been struck off as a carer by Gloucestershire Social Services , because they thought she already had too many children to look after .
Eunice had made a private arrangement with my mum after she had been de-registered .
How the funding was arranged I have no idea , although I came to understand how clever and devious Eunice was when it came to playing officials off against each other .
By the time I was seven - and - a - half , I had moved to Eunice 's full - time and the pattern of my life had reversed .
I would visit my parents for an occasional weekend or evening , and Eunice 's house was now to be called " home " .
I quickly settled in to my new routine , however , and I liked my new school and classmates .
I was a chatty and sociable little girl and not afraid to ask questions .
Like most children , I simply accepted the new situation .
Only now do I realise that almost from the moment I got to her house Eunice wanted me to forget about my past life .
She made it clear , for example , that I was to think of her as my real parent .
" Call me Mummy , " she insisted , and as Charlotte and Sarah did , I did too .
However , she stressed that during my occasional visits to see my parents I had to remember to call her Auntie Eunice .
The second thing we had to do was to change our names .
I was upset about this , as I loved my name , Alloma - it had been chosen by Mum after she 'd read it in a book about fairies and mystical people .
But Eunice did n't like it .
In her eyes it was a " magic " name and therefore , according to a curious expression she used , " demonised " .
This came to light one day as I was sitting at the table with Charlotte and Sarah .
Eunice gave a book to Charlotte and said mockingly : " Pass this to the Devil 's child next to you . "
This , apparently , was me .
I blushed and felt very embarrassed .
I looked up and Eunice showed no emotion at all .
Charlotte smirked and looked at Eunice , who said maliciously : " Yes , she 's the Devil 's kid all right . "
Eunice put a piece of paper in front of me .
" There 's a better choice of names for you , " she said .
" Better than your demonised name , anyway . "
Tears stung my eyes .
My name was a link with the family I loved .
But I looked up at Eunice 's stern face and I knew I had to choose .
No question .
From that day I became Harriet , not Alloma .
It was all very confusing .
I was seeing a new , bad - tempered side of the kind lady who had taught me to knit , which was really rather scary .
I did n't like it at all .
Several curious events from that time stick in my mind .
One of them is the day I went swimming with Charlotte and we met by chance two of her biological siblings , from whom she 'd been separated when she went to live with Eunice .
When we got home I was full of the news .
" We 've just met Charlotte 's brother and sister ! " I blurted out .
Eunice 's reaction was extraordinary .
She stopped what she was doing and strode towards me with a terrifying look on her face .
She seemed to have grown in size and was towering over me , her face white and taut with barely suppressed rage .
" Oh , no you did n't , " she snapped .
" They were just friends . "
Charlotte said nothing and looked down .
She obviously knew not to quibble .
But I did n't know any better .
" But we did - we saw her brother and sister . "
Eunice suddenly leant forward and tapped me sharply on the mouth .
I was totally taken aback .
It hurt a lot , and I had n't the slightest idea why she had done it .
It was the mildest taste of what was to come .
I had stepped into dangerous territory .
All these years later I 'm still trying to understand whether Eunice 's cruelty was born of a religious belief that she needed to teach us a lesson , or whether she sincerely felt that what she made us do , or what she did to us , was improving our characters .
Either way , her outlook was punitive and extreme , with everything divided into black and white , good and evil , and with her as the judge .
When I look back on living with Eunice 's regime I think of it as going down a flight of steps to a basement .
On the first few steps , I had to get acclimatised to the drop in light and temperature .
As I went on , it began to feel damp and uncomfortable , until finally I descended into a cold , rat - infested , stinking cellar where I was tortured sadistically until I screamed for mercy .
But no mercy came .
After the tap on the mouth , Eunice began to mistreat us - although not so much Charlotte , whom she seemed to adore - on a regular basis , starting with flicks and hits on the mouth and then clouts to the head .
I was beginning to get a clear idea of what life with her was going to be like : an endless succession of rules , punishments and bizarre rituals .
One of the very worst of these was the daily toilet check .
After breakfast we were marched to the toilet where we were required to perform , and not allowed to leave the bathroom until we 'd done so .
It was terrible , and I was petrified .
Of course , the more anxious I got , the less I was able to deliver .
We were also forbidden to go to the toilet at any other time of day .
But the torture did n't end there .
If we did n't come up with the goods in the morning , Eunice would administer an enema .
The big syringe would come out , filled with green washing - up liquid mixed with water .
Eunice would bark at me to pull my pants down .
She would then shove in the syringe , push the plunger in and order me to hold on to the soapy liquid for as long as her whim dictated .
When it was over I would go to school feeling utterly horrible , hoping no one would ever find out what had been done to me at home .
Unbelievably , this appalling regime continued day in , day out until I finally escaped from Eunice when I was 17 - years - old .
With Eunice , we discovered , you were either in her good books or her bad books .
Charlotte was generally in her good books .
The rest of us were almost invariably in some sort of trouble , especially if we did n't go to sleep when we were supposed to .
I found this out the hard way one evening when I became aware of Eunice standing in the doorway watching me as I pranced round my bedroom in my nightie after lights out .
" Right , " she said .
" You 're obviously not tired .
So I 'm going to make you tired . "
With that she yanked me out of the room and pulled me to the top of the stairs .
Was she going to push me down ?
" You 're to walk up and down these stairs all night , " she told me .
" I mean all night .
Right the way through . "
I looked up at her mean , hard face .
She had to be joking .
It was dark and cold , and I had bare feet and no dressing gown .
But she was n't joking .
" Go on , what are you waiting for ? "
I started walking down the stairs to the bottom , Eunice watching my every step .
At the bottom I turned , I suppose half hoping she 'd relent .
" Come back up , this instant , " she said .
I went back up the stairs , my little legs already aching .
At the top Eunice simply gestured silently for me to go back down again .
I could n't believe this was happening to me .
What would my mum and dad say if they knew ?
Or my teachers ?
Eventually Eunice went to bed and the house fell silent , but I knew I had no choice but to keep going .
As the night wore on I started to trip up because I 'd lose concentration , even consciousness , from time to time .
Then I 'd come to , having fallen momentarily asleep , and find myself standing up in the hall , wondering what on earth I was doing there in my nightie in the dead of night .
This punishment happened more times than I can remember .
One of the most terrifying things about Eunice 's discipline was that it was never doled out in temper .
It was always done in a cold , hard , calculating way , often hours and sometimes even days after the misdemeanour had been committed .
Then , when she was ready to let rip , she would grab me by the arm , drag me into the living room and close the door .
While I stood trembling , she would fetch a piece of wood that she kept under the stairs with her Jehovah 's Witness books .
It was about two feet long - I think it was the handle off an old copper saucepan or something .
" Take your shoes and socks off , " she would command , tapping the stick on her left palm , as if testing its weight .
I remember the first time this happened .
I had no idea exactly what she was going to do and just stood there trembling in my bare feet .
Suddenly , Eunice bent over and I felt a most enormous " clunk " across the toes of my right foot .
The pain seared through my bare feet , and I screamed out loud .
" Be quiet , " said Eunice .
" Do n't fuss .
You 'll make it worse for yourself . "
How could it be worse ?
I was shaking and crying , but Eunice was bent double again , raising the stick and now she was going at my toes with great , unrelenting clunks .
Clunk , clunk , clunk ... on and on , five , ten , 15 times .
Then she changed foot .
" Stand still , you 'll make it worse , " she said again .
By now I was beside myself , yelping and screaming .
But there was no let - up until the punishment was finally done .
A few times after being beaten like this I 'd ask Eunice for a hug and she would briefly put her arms round me .
For a moment I would feel comforted .
It was twisted and makes me feel sick now , but children need affection so much that they will ask for it even from their abuser .
After these beatings my toes would be black and blue all over .
I remember once at the swimming baths - before Eunice eventually put a stop to such outings - one of the dads noticed my bruised toes and asked : " How did you do that , then ? "
I just said : " Something fell on my feet . "
Young as I was , I knew somehow that I was not supposed to tell the truth about Eunice 's behaviour .
In 1994 our lives took a strange and new twist .
Unknown to us , Eunice had befriended an elderly man named John Drake , who owned a huge farm near the affluent , pretty market town of Pershore , north of Tewkesbury .
John had never married and was now living alone .
He was also suffering from lung cancer and needed nursing care .
There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that Eunice had spotted an opportunity to inherit the farm and make herself a lot of money .
In the autumn of that year , without any explanation from Eunice , we went to live with John full - time .
For me yet another new life had begun , although not everything had changed .
The bizarre regime of daily rituals and punishments went on as usual - washing - up liquid down the throat for lying or answering back , strangleholds to teach us a lesson , daily clouts around the head .
Slaps on the mouth and punches continued as before , albeit well out of John 's sight and hearing .
As for school , it soon became clear that commuting back to Tewkesbury every day was impractical .
Instead , Eunice applied to be our home tutor .
By doing so , she succeeded in removing us from any sort of normal life and contact with the outside world , as we now no longer saw our parents .
We slowly but surely became trapped on the farm , our only outings being to Jehovah 's Witness meetings or the local shops to run her errands .
It was shortly after we moved to the farm that Eunice decided to get a dog .
He was a lovely black labrador puppy called Jet , and I was given the job of house - training him .
As I was only about nine at the time , I knew nothing about how to do this , and of course he would make a mess all over the place , which enraged Eunice .
One morning she came into the kitchen and found that Jet had done his business in the night by the back door .
She was furious .
" Come here , " she snapped .
It was me , not the dog , she was commanding .
Eunice was glaring at me with her dead , grey eyes , her thin mouth clamped in a mask of disapproval .
I crept over to stand next to her , head down , my legs feeling weak .
What was she going to do now ?
Suddenly she grabbed me by the back of my hair and forced me to my knees , which hurt as they hit the unforgiving tiled floor .
Inches from my face was the pile of dog mess .
Slowly , Eunice pushed my head further down .
The stench entered my nostrils , turning my stomach and then , with a sudden further push , my face was in it .
The wet , stinky mass was going up my nostrils and over my cheeks and eyelids and I had to fight it from going into the corners of my mouth .
Eunice pushed my face into the mess and rubbed it back and forth , round and round .
After about a minute she stopped and released me .
" That 's how you teach dogs not to poo , " she said .
" You rub their faces in it .
Got it ? "
Telling me that I was not to wipe it off until she said so , Eunice marched out of the kitchen , leaving me shaking with revulsion .
Meanwhile , John Drake 's health was deteriorating quite rapidly .
One morning , as I was playing with Charlotte , Eunice burst into the room and told us he had died .
She showed no emotion whatsoever as she took us to see him , stroking his hands and , bizarrely , encouraging us to do so too .
When the will was read a few days later , we discovered that the farm had been left in trust to Charlotte , Eunice 's favourite adopted daughter .
There was some money for Eunice as well .
She had triumphed .
She had set her sights on her goal and had attained it .
While John was alive a pretence of normality had been kept up , but all that now ended .
Eunice started to keep the curtains closed permanently , so no one could see in from the outside and , of course , we could n't see out .
It really did feel as though we were her prisoners .
Only on the rare occasions when a school inspector came to see us were things any different .
Then Eunice would put on a show worthy of Mary Poppins , buying us all new books and getting us cleaning the place until it sparkled .
When the inspector came we'd be sitting at the table , writing , with clean hair and scrubbed faces .
As soon as they had gone , things returned to normal .
One day , I was in the kitchen when Eunice appeared , looking very angry .
It was the third day in a row I 'd forgotten to buy some throat sweets she 'd asked me to get from the village shop .
I knew I was in for it .
" Where are those throat sweets I told you to get ? " she demanded .
I knew that saying anything at all would inflame the situation , so I stayed still , hoping the storm would pass .
" Cat got your tongue , has it ? " she said .
" Well , I 'll give you a sore throat , then you 'll know how it feels . "
Next , I was being dragged unceremoniously out of the kitchen by my arm and into the living room , where I prepared myself for the usual beating .
I noticed , however , that this time there were two sticks , not one .
" Open your mouth , " said Eunice .
Coming towards my opened mouth was a long piece of wood , wedge - shaped and about a foot long .
To my horror , Eunice thrust the wood into my mouth , past my new front teeth , until it hit the soft tissue at the back of my throat .
I retched hard , tasting the wood .
I could hardly breathe .
In response , Eunice pushed the wood in further .
This time she is going to kill me , I thought .
Then I felt the familiar , sickening thwack on the soles of my feet .
Whack .
Whack .
Whack .
Whack .
Whack .
I was being hideously assaulted on two different parts of my body , and if I protested , the wedge would be driven further down my throat .
Afterwards I lay on my side in a foetal position , shaking from the shock , moaning and weeping while holding my throat with both hands .
" You wo n't forget those throat sweets now . "
And with that , Eunice swept out of the room to get on with the rest of her day , satisfied at another sadistic , soul - saving job done .
Ten years later , in court , I would hold one of the sticks she routinely used to thrust down our throats and show the world the two inches of dried blood still staining the end .
It was shortly after this appalling incident that something inside me finally snapped .
I was 11 by now and had been enduring Eunice 's terrible physical and psychological cruelty for nearly five years .
It was all to do with a piece of cheese that had gone missing from the larder .
You 'd think someone had stolen the crown jewels from the fuss Eunice made .
She was absolutely convinced I had taken it .
To this day I believe Jet was probably responsible , but Eunice refused to believe it , and set out with ruthless determination to pin the crime on somebody else .
But this time I 'd had enough .
I do n't know whether it was my outrage at all the previous punishments , or just growing older and more defiant , but I utterly refused to admit to something I had n't done .
" It was n't me , " I said .
Eunice stared hard at me and came and bent over me .
" Answering back , are we ? " she said .
" Well , you can starve . "
I wanted to say " Fine ! " but I did n't .
I knew better than that .
I knew when to stop .
I just stared back at Eunice , making my eyes dead and blank .
She stared back and we were locked together like that for a few moments .
This was the first moment I had ever really stood up to her and although it was only a small thing , and I knew I was going to be hungry afterwards , I felt a tiny edge of triumph .
And so I starved .
For a week she gave me nothing - not a single scrap to eat .
It was a real battle of wills , and I became so weak and sick that I was hallucinating .
In my desperation , I resorted to the pig bin and feasted greedily on mouldy boiled potatoes , vegetable peelings and pig nuts .
It was revolting , but I just hoped it would give me the energy to survive .
Eventually , maybe after a week , Eunice handed out some food at a mealtime to me , as well as the other children .
There was no apology , no explanation , no making up .
I was suddenly just included .
I guess she felt she had to feed me something or I would die .
Whatever the explanation , the rebellion had begun and battle lines had now been drawn .
There was a long way to go before I 'd finally be free of her clutches , as I 'll explain on Monday .
But at last I had hope .

This report is from " Gisha , " ( Hebrew for " access " and " approach " ) , an Israeli not - for - profit organization , founded in 2005 , whose goal is to protect the freedom of movement of Palestinians , especially Gaza residents .
Gisha promotes rights guaranteed by international and Israeli law .
It is one of the plaintiffs in a suit before the Israeli Supreme Court challenging the fuel cuts to gaza .
Israel 's " Relief " :
Fuel Cuts of Up to 81 %
New Electricity Cuts Beginning
February 7
Monday , January 28 , 2008 : After more than a week of near - total ban on fuel supplies , Israel said yesterday that it would resume permitting Gaza residents to purchase fuel � but would limit the amount they could buy by as much as 81 % and would cut the electricity supplied directly to Gaza beginning February 7 .
The state made the announcement in advance of yesterday 's hearing in Israel 's Supreme Court , as part of its response to a court petition filed by 10 Israeli and Palestinian human rights groups challenging punitive cuts in fuel and electricity supplies to Gaza residents .
The court has yet to issue a decision .
After almost totally blocking fuel supply last week , Israel through the State Attorney 's Office told the court it would resume permitting Gaza residents to purchase diesel , petrol ( gasoline ) and industrial diesel but would only allow them a small percentage of what they need .
The State Attorney 's office also told the court that it would reduce the electricity that Israel 's Electric Company sells directly to Gaza by 5 % on three lines ( a total of 1.5 MW ) , beginning February 7 .
At the hearing , the human rights groups , represented by Gisha and Adalah , asked for an order preventing the state from restricting supply .
The rights groups claim that the fuel and electricity cuts constitute illegal collective punishment .
The shortage of industrial diesel has crippled the functioning of Gaza 's power plant , whose reserves ran out on Jan .
5 . Since then , the plant reduced production and even shut down for two days .
Currently , the power plant is producing 45 MW electricity � instead of the 80 MW it could produce , were it allowed enough industrial diesel .
Gaza currently has an electricity deficit of 24 % , and rolling blackouts across the Strip are as long as 12 hours per day in some areas .
The electricity shortage has increased the dependence on diesel - powered generators � just as Israel cut diesel supplies .
Without electricity and without diesel for back - up generators , Gaza 's sewage treatment pumps and treatment plants are pumping as much as 40 million liters untreated sewage into the sea each day , and clean water supply has fallen by 30 % .
Hospitals have reduced services and denied care to non-urgent cases , as the power outages continue , and their fuel supplies run dangerously low .
According to Gisha 's Director , Sari Bashi : " Israel 's ' relief ' is just further punishment .
Israel continues to deny Gaza residents the fuel and electricity they need to power hospitals , pump sewage , access clean water , and heat their homes .
Israel has a right to defend itself against Qassam rocket fire targeting its civilians .
But further cuts to Gaza 's electricity , as Israel plans , will only make more innocent people suffer . "
Facts about Israel 's fuel cuts to Gaza :
Israel began instituting fuel cuts to Gaza on October 28 , 2007 , as part of a governmental decision calling for punitive measures against Gaza 's 1.5 million residents .
The new levels of fuel announced yesterday are significantly lower than the quantities being purchased by Gaza residents prior to the Oct. 28 , 2007 cuts � and significantly lower than what they need now .
Before the cuts , Gaza residents were ordering approximately 1.4 million liters ordinary diesel per week � yesterday the state announced it would allow only 800,000 liters / week � a reduction of 43 % .
This is particularly detrimental , because the rolling power outages have increased dependency on diesel - powered generators .
Before the cuts , Gaza residents were ordering approximately 350,000 - 400,000 liters petrol ( gasoline ) per week � yesterday Israel announced it would allow only 75,400 liters per week � a reduction of 78% - 81 % .
Israel also announced it would allow Gaza residents to purchase 2.2 million liters industrial diesel / week , needed for Gaza 's power plant , but the plant now needs 3.5 million liters / week plus at least 2 million additional liters to replenish reserves .
Gaza needs 240 MW electricity in the current peak winter season .
Israel supplies ( before the planned cut ) 120 MW , Egypt supplies 17 MW , and Gaza 's power plant is currently producing only 45 MW � meaning that there is a deficit of 58 MW , or 24 % - even before the February 7 cuts are scheduled to take place .

BBC News , Moscow
Andrei Lugovoi has said the charges are " politically motivated "
The first time I met Andrei Lugovoi in his Moscow office he offered me a cup of tea .
I hesitated .
He laughed .
Lugovoi was relaxed , amused by my discomfort , not at all on the defensive .
A month later I met him again , this time at a petrol station on the Moscow ring road .
He jumped out of his large Toyota four wheel drive a cheeky grin on his face .
" How are you ? " he said reaching out to shake my hand .
Andrei Lugovoi is quite a charmer , and quite a showman .
Thick snow was still on the ground as we pulled up at his walled compound deep in the forest outside Moscow .
We entered a large building that looked like a gymnasium .
Inside stood a group of men in military fatigues with thick necks and close - cropped hair .
Performing for the camera
" How about some shooting ? " suggested Mr Lugovoi .
" This is the only private shooting range of its type in Moscow " he told me proudly .
Guns and boxes of ammunition appeared on a large table .
Quickly and silently the guns were loaded .
The thick set men sprang in to action : running , crouching , firing , reloading .
It was an impressive show .
But what about Lugovoi himself .
Would he perform for the camera ?
Andrei Lugovoi is a former KGB bodyguard , not an ex-spy
It is not the sort of thing I would do if I were under investigation for murder .
But then there are lots of things about Mr Lugovoi that do not make sense .
For a start , Andrei Lugovoi is not an obvious assassin .
Much of the Western media has dwelt on his background in the KGB , suggesting he is some kind of ex-spy .
But Andrei Lugovoi has never been a spy .
He is , and always has been , a bodyguard .
Strange company
The next peculiar thing about Mr Lugovoi is his list of friends and clients .
If Mr Lugovoi is an agent of the Russian state , as some have suggested , then he keeps pretty strange company .
His oldest client , the man who first hired him as a bodyguard after he left the KGB , is none other than Boris Berezovsky .
For those who are not familiar with Mr Berezovsky , he is the Russian billionaire who was once close to President Vladimir Putin , but is now his most avowed critic and enemy .
From his base in London he runs a vocal and visceral campaign against Putin 's Kremlin .
Mr Berezovsky was also the closest friend and benefactor of a certain Alexander Litvinenko .
Alexander Litvinenko died in hospital from radiation poisoning
The subject of their meeting ?
A contract for Mr Lugovoi to protect the billionaire 's daughter .
Andrei Lugovoi is , in other words , a man who was well trusted by both Mr Berezovsky and Alexander Litvinenko .
Indeed Boris Berezovsky told British police that when he first heard that Lugovoi was suspected of Litvinenko 's murder , he did not believe it .
Polonium trail
There seems little doubt that British police have compelling evidence pointing the finger directly at Andrei Lugovoi .
Although it has not been made public , it is well known that the most crucial evidence is the trail of radioactive Polonium 210 that seems to have followed Mr Lugovoi across Europe and around London .
It was even found on the seat he used while watching an Arsenal football match at the Emirates Stadium in London .
Each time I have met Andrei Lugovoi I have asked him to explain the trail of Polonium .
He has never been able to do so .
But the one thing he has repeated insistently is that he had no motive to kill Litvinenko .
" Why would he kill someone he was hoping to do business with ?
Why would he jeopardize his business operations that stretch from Moscow to London , to Tel Aviv ? "
It is a good question , and one I have no answer to .
Another is how someone like Lugovoi could have got hold of Polonium 210 .
Even in Russia , it is not something you can get on the black market .
Polonium is extremely rare , very expensive and very difficult to handle .
Secret service
In Moscow conspiracy theories abound about what really happened to Alexander Litvinenko .
One of the latest , and most compelling goes something like this ; Lugovoi and Litvinenko were working for the British secret service .
At some point last year Andrei Lugovoi got caught and turned by Russia secret service agents .
They then forced him to betray and ultimately to kill his friend .
It is pretty far fetched , but then so is everything about the Litvinenko case .
While the evidence may point towards Lugovoi as the killer , it seems highly improbable that he acted alone .
Only one thing seems fairly certain , that we will never find out who really ordered the killing of Alexander Litvinenko .

Tap water is the source for Coca - Cola 's Dasani product
It says the source for its new Dasani bottled water is the mains supply at its factory in Kent .
The company says Dasani is " as pure as bottled water gets " due to a " highly sophisticated purification process " .
But the UK water industry is worried that the marketing of the product implies tap water is impure , which experts say is not the case .
' Reverse osmosis '
Coca - Cola is investing £ 7 m in launching Dasani , which has become the second most popular bottled water in the US following its launch there in 1999 .
We would never say tap water is n't drinkable .
It 's just that Dasani is as pure as water can get - there are different levels of purity
Coca - Cola
Coca - Cola says " reverse osmosis " , " a technique perfected by Nasa to purify fluids on spacecraft " , is then used to filter the water further before minerals are added to " enhance the pure taste " .
Finally , " ozone " is injected to keep the water sterile , the company says .
But water industry representatives say consumers do not need to buy Dasani to get " excellent quality , healthy water " .
' Tap water pure '
Barrie Clarke , spokesman for suppliers ' representative Water UK , said : " We do n't think there are any impurities in tap water .
" If people like the bottle , the convenience , the style , then fine , but I do n't think that is the way they are marketing this product .
Dasani is the second biggest selling bottled water in the US
" Tap water is pure , and that 's the opinion of the drinking water inspectorate , which carries out three million checks a year . "
Judith Snyder , brand PR manager for Dasani , confirmed " municipal " water supplies were used but said the source was " irrelevant " because it " does n't affect the end result " .
She said : " We would never say tap water is n't drinkable .
" It 's just that Dasani is as pure as water can get - there are different levels of purity . "
Research published on Wednesday shows that UK consumers drank more then two billion litres of water in 2003 - up 18 % on 2002 .
Video gamers , the Democratic presidential candidates have a simple message for you : " We are not afraid to regulate the sex and violence right out of your consoles .
Do n't make us do it . "
With the new year still shiny and filled with that fresh - from - the - dealership scent , it 's a perfect time to kick back , pop that Orange Box disc into the drive , and let off a little steam with Gordon Freeman 's crowbar .
But it 's also worth taking ten minutes to ponder what gaming might look like after 2008 's US presidential election ( hint : that crowbar could be under increased scrutiny ) .
To do that , let 's turn to Common Sense Media , which sent questionnaires last autumn to the leading candidates of both parties .
Now that Hillary Clinton 's campaign has responded , the Democratic slate is well - represented ( Mitt Romney was the only Republican to respond ) .
The questions covered several media issues , but the most important one for our purposes was the question about violent video games .
Would the POTUS contenders use legislation to " keep violent video games out of kids ' hands " ?
The Democrats ( except for Clinton ) all paid lip service to the idea of parental responsibility and industry self - regulation as the first , best hope for solving the problem .
" The ESRB is a good example of industry responsibility , " said John Edwards .
Barack Obama said that there 's " a golden opportunity for the industry to do this on their own " and that he wants to " improve the voluntary ratings system we currently have . "
Bill Richardson stressed parental involvement and ( somewhat oddly ) pledged to give all federal employees eight hours of paid one - on - one time with their kids .
But none of this precludes legislation .
Consider the responses :
Obama : " But if the industry fails to act , then my administration would . "
" But if the industry fails to act , then my administration would . "
Richardson : " I would consider this legislation . "
" I would consider this legislation . "
Edwards :
" If the industry does not continue to make progress in keeping video games with intense violent and adult content away from children , we will need to consider further steps . "
" If the industry does not continue to make progress in keeping video games with intense violent and adult content away from children , we will need to consider further steps . "
Clinton : [ After long discussion of her support for the Family Entertainment Protection Act ]
" When I am president , I will work to protect children from inappropriate video game content . "
Since Romney was the only Republican to weigh in , it 's hard to sum up general Republican attitudes .
It 's possible to sum up Romney 's , though : Get Tough on Filth .
" I want to restore values so children are protected from a societal cesspool of filth , pornography , violence , sex , and perversion , " he said .
" I 've proposed that we enforce our obscenity laws again and that we get serious against those retailers that sell adult video games that are filled with violence and that we go after those retailers . "
Some of this is obviously election - year saber - rattling , but the ESRB can't afford too many more GTA : San Andreas sex debacles or Manhunt 2 ultraviolence - restoring - hacks .
After a couple more such incidents , any of the current candidates sounds willing to sign legislation that would take the ratings and compliance out of the industry 's hands and plop it down somewhere within the FTC .
Whether or not something like that would ever survive a constitutional challenge is up for debate , but we 've explained our position on this before , and we do n't think it 's likely .
Debbie Foster 's battle with the RIAA appears to be finally over .
Today , a federal judge in Oklahoma closed the book on Capitol v. Foster by awarding her $ 68,685.23 in attorneys ' fees , a ruling first reported by Ray Beckerman 's blog .
Foster was sued by the RIAA in November 2004 for copyright infringement .
She denied infringement and began a legal fight against the music industry .
In July 2005 , the labels added her adult daughter Amanda Foster to the suit .
Instead of dropping the action against Debbie Foster , the record labels continued to press claims of secondary copyright infringement , saying that she was liable for infringement since the ISP account allegedly used for sharing music was in her name .
Judge Lee R. West was unmoved by the argument and in July 2006 , dismissed the case with prejudice , making Foster the prevailing party and eligible to recover attorneys ' fees .
This past February , Judge West awarded Foster attorneys ' fees , citing the RIAA 's insistence on pressing the secondary infringement case and saying that he could find no case " holding the mere owner of an Internet account contributorily or vicariously liable for the infringing activities of third persons . "
The RIAA 's followed its usual strategy throughout its legal assault on file - sharing , digging in its heels against the judge 's decision .
Two weeks after the award , the RIAA appealed the ruling , a request that the judge denied in April .
Foster 's attorney , Marilyn Barringer - Thompson , submitted a bill for $ 105,680.75 .
After taking into account the amount of time spent on the case , how the time was billed , and costs of expert witnesses , Judge West decided that $ 68,685.23 was adequate to compensate Barringer - Thompson and her legal staff for the time spent litigating the case .
He also rejected the RIAA 's argument that Foster was not entitled to fees incurred after " some point when she allegedly ' could have avoided [ fees ] altogether but chose not to do so , ' " reiterating that she was fully entitled to fight the RIAA 's charges and as a result , eligible for an award of attorneys ' fees .
An RIAA spokesperson told Ars Technica that they do n't see any disturbing trends developing .
" We respectfully believe that this ruling is in error and is an isolated occurrence , " said the spokesperson .
" In the handful of cases where the person engaging in the illegal activity in the household is not the person responsible for the ISP account , we look to gather the facts quickly and do our best to identify the appropriate defendant . "
So far , the RIAA has found itself on the losing end of only a handful of cases , none of which have gone to trial .
Resistance to the RIAA on the part of defendants is increasing , however , and other , recent setbacks such as judges refusing to allow the RIAA to conduct ex parte discovery in two John Doe cases .
As a result , the price of litigation is going up for the RIAA ( although it does enjoy the considerable financial backing of the music industry ) at the same time that it continues to take a beating in the court of public opinion and alienate its fans .
But hey — at least the RIAA made a cool $ 300 last week .

DIGG THIS
As the conditions prevailing in the Western countries do not yet permit the liquidation of such offenders in the Russian way , they insult them and vilify them , cast suspicion upon their motives and boycott them .
Conservatives know psychologizing .
Well , we might not actually " know " it in the academic sense , but we certainly recognize it in practice due to our foes psychologizing as an auto - response to whatever arguments we make .
Sadly , in the present politically correct era , merely questioning the necessity of affirmative action or the effectiveness of public housing can cause an otherwise high - functioning person to be accused of racism by those who purportedly possess liberal sensibilities .
The same is true when one illuminates the counter - intuitiveness inherent to government taking over the healthcare business .
Identifying the waste , coercion , and deleterious impact upon public health that nationalization would bring will be of no avail due to our opposition knowing our psyches better than we do .
To them questioning the efficacy of federal interventions evidences an unmistakable need to oppress others along with a desire to trample upon the backs of the poor ( those same benighted citizens who , it must be pointed out , receive " free " healthcare from the government under the status quo ) .
Psychologizing is rarely initiated by those on the right , however .
Conservatives generally hold politics to be an objective , rather than subjective , endeavor so they are reluctant to descend into the muck of personalization as a means to advance their cause .
This is highly admirable but ultimately a pity as , without counter - attacks , irrationality seems to thrive and multiply within the confines of our sound - bite culture .
Occasionally though , the empire strikes back , or emperor , in the case of Ludwig von Mises .
Over fifty years ago , the famous economist whose career " showed that government intervention is always destructive , " penned The Anti-Capitalistic Mentality .
This short book marked his official venture into psychology .
We should be grateful today for its insight .
His deconstruction of those opposed to free markets indicates that he had a far better understanding of humanity than do the majority of psychologists .
What impresses most about The Anti-Capitalistic Mentality is just how prescient a work it is .
The failures of socialism were evident in the 1950s but not as glaring as they are in 2008 .
Yet this truth does not prevent our politicians from continuing to push for more and more government expansion .
The concomitant disruption and diminution of the private sector is discounted entirely .
The experiences of Soviet Russia , the Warsaw Pact countries , and the vivid and ongoing failures of communist starvation zones like Cuba and North Korea are pooh - poohed by those desirous of further empowering the Leviathan .
In light of what America has become , von Mises ' elucidation of the enemies of capitalism is more pertinent than ever .
Alienation regarding capitalism remains popular among politicians all over the political spectrum .
Recall Mr. Bush 's cacophonous assumption " that when somebody hurts , government has got to move " and his ardent belief that fiscal expansion in some way correlates with " compassion . "
Such stances are reflective of the view that the people cannot be trusted to fend for themselves .
This condescension was highlighted by von Mises who summed up the presupposition with , " … the masses are too stupid and ignorant to know what would serve best their u2018 true ' needs and interests and badly need a guardian , the government , lest they hurt themselves . "
How reminiscent these words are of those who forever express bewilderment should minorities decline to " vote for their interests "  which they inevitably define as supporting and enhancing statism .
Elitists of all stripes disdain capitalism for its leading to the success of people whom our ambrosia - drinkers deem unworthy .
Von Mises saw this as being particularly reflective of western intellectuals such as university professors who sneer at rich alumni along with those who propel themselves into affluence by plebian , and non-esoteric , means .
The achievements of those they dismiss as their inferiors brings about feelings of inadequacy .
As well it should .
Indeed ,
" The truth is that the entrepreneurs and promoters display more intellectual faculties and intuition than the average writer and painter . "
Academics condemn divergence of outcomes more than anything else and assess correctly that disparities are endemic to free markets .
The unfairness [ read : fairness ] of it all causes them much consternation .
Yet inequality of outcome is intrinsic to having equality of opportunity ; a state of affairs which is only possible within a capitalist system .
Von Mises ' advice , should intellectuals ever encounter it , would undoubtedly infuriate them .
He recommended that those who pine for opulence should resolve to listen to the public in the hopes of finding out what they like .
Social strivers should then find a way to sell those cherished goods at a cheaper rate or create superior goods to sell .
Sensible words and a prescription for ambition realization condensed as if it were a basket trade .
Yet , by definition , intellectuals cannot and will not heed his counsel .
Listening to the masses is something they simply cannot do .
It would be beneath them .
Treating barbarians as equals is as unpalatable as sitting though a football or hockey game .
The endemic transparency of capitalism is another cause for concern .
In a society rooted in economic freedom , when a person fails to flourish the explanations for his floundering are generally evident .
When his acquaintances and relations surpass him it never fails to rankle and there are few excuses which can be concocted .
An entirely different fate awaits those trapped within a socialist system , however .
The state 's domination of the economy produces no similar anxieties .
The government 's eradication of opportunity yields equality as it results in poverty for everyone .
It is the common man who benefits most from capitalism .
He profits from those who save , who invest , and who engage in entrepreneurial activities .
These individuals expand the economy , elevate wages , and employ him directly .
More importantly , there are no structural barriers which prevent him from joining the ranks of such persons .
The free market automatically eradicates caste .
Not everyone can rise from their birth station in America but plenty of people do , and some even manage to become fabulously rich .
What traits are intrinsic to the anti-capitalist mindset ?
Envy and ignorance are two of the more flagrant ones .
The latter causes leftists to draw distinctions between communism and socialism even though no such dichotomies exist .
The same can be said of central planning and the welfare state as both are directed by government bureaucrats and fueled by citizen - confiscated capital .
Those who understand economics to be a " what I make must be stolen from someone else " phenomenon will never appreciate the free market nor comprehend the nature of economic growth .
Yet one of the few things these folks are able to do is to get elected to public office .
Regrettably , the fomenting of jealousy and the perpetuation of a cult of blameology remain saleable characteristics in 2008 .
The law of unintended consequences may well be the only law that these opportunists do not wish to enforce .
The deleterious effect on art and literature is often cited by critics of capitalism .
Granted , our culture is awash with voluminous amounts of low - grade materials .
This would not be the case if the availability of artistic creations and publications were culled by Leviathan censors , but von Mises argues convincingly that the ubiquitousness of low - brow works does not preclude the creation of high - brow ones .
The sea of schlock may confuse us but it is far preferable to the imposition of state - sponsored criteria such as " socialist realism " as a determinant of what the public should be allowed to appreciate .
In the final analysis , to hate capitalism is to hate liberty , as only within the framework of personal choice can one choose an education , a vocation , and course of life that suits them .
The laissez - faire philosophy is what put an end to slavery and serfdom .
Nobody born poor in a free society is destined to poverty .
How ironic it is that so many anti-capitalists describe themselves as being " liberal " when there is nothing liberal about stealing the dreams and futures of those you regard as nothing more than wards or mascots .
Psychologizing proved a very elementary feat for Ludwig von Mises .
His deconstruction and refutation of the anti-capitalist outlook was a noble undertaking .
He flamboyantly paraded its irrationality for all to see over fifty years ago , but it is now up to us to popularize his forgotten , but exquisite , argumentation .

Visit Lobelog.com for the latest news analysis and commentary from Inter Press News Service ’s Washington bureau chief Jim Lobe .
â€ œThis October 22 - 26 , I am declaring Islamo - Fascism Awareness Week , â€ declared David Horowitz Tuesday in a friendly interview on FrontpageMag.com , one of Horowitzâ€™s many front groups .
â€ œI will hold demonstrations and protests , teach - ins and sit-ins on more than 100 college campuses .
Our theme will be the Oppression of Women in Islam and the threat posed by the Islamic crusade [????] against the West.â€
Horowitz , who , along with Frank Gaffney , James Woolsey , and Rick Santorum has played a truly vanguard role in the â€œIslamo - Fascismâ€ movement , apparently has few doubts about his impact .
â€ œDuring the week of October 22 - 26 , 2007 , the nation will be rocked by the biggest conservative campus protest ever â€ “ Islamo - Fascism Awareness Week , a wake - up call for Americans on 200 university and college campuses.â€ 
The event will confront the two â€ œBig Lies of the political left : â€ that â€ œGeorge Bush created the war on terror and that Global Warming is a greater danger to Americans than the terrorist threat.â€ 
In fact , according to Horowitz , Islamo - fascism constitutes â€ œthe greatest danger Americans have ever confronted .â€ 
Horowitz , president of the David Horowitz Freedom Center ( previously the Center for the Study of Popular Culture ) editor - in- chief of FrontPageMag.com , and founder of Students for Academic Freedom , is , of course , a former leading New Leftist who has found fame and fortune â€ “ he made $ 352,647 in 2005 , according to tax records â€ “ on the extreme right and has done particularly well since 9/11 when he got in on the â€œIslamo - fascistâ€ ground floor .
â€ œIslamo - Fascism Awareness
Week , â€ according to Horowitz will be a â€œnational effort â€ ¦to rally American students to defend their countryâ€  and will feature â€œmemorial services for the victims of Islamic terror both in America and around the globeâ€ ( the guide suggests putting up crosses to commemorate victims presumably regardless of their religion ) ; sit-ins ( Horowitz suggests the office of the Womenâ€™s Studies Department or the campus Womenâ€™s Centers â€ œto protest their silence about the oppression of women in Islamâ€ ) teach - ins on â€˜â€ ™The Oppression of Women in Islam ; â€ â€ œa student petition denouncing Islamo - Fascist violence against women , gays , Christians , Jews and non-religious peopleâ€  ( and press releases at the ready if Muslim student groups , campus administrators , or student government officers fail to sign ) ; and prominent speakers , such as the American Enterprise Instituteâ€™s ( AEI ) Ayan Hirsi Ali , columnist Mark Steyn , Frank Gaffney , Daniel Pipes , Rick Santorum , as well as Horowitz hims elf .
In addition , participants will distribute pamphlets on Islamo - Fascism , including â€ œThe Islamic Mein Kampf , â€ â€ œWhy Israel is the Victim , â€ â€ œJimmy Carterâ€™s War Against the Jews , â€ â€ œAnd What Every American Needs to Know About Jihad.â€ 
Films to be shown include â€ œSuicide Killers , â€ â€ œObsessionâ€ ( about which my colleague , Khody Akhavi , wrote earlier this year ) , or â€ œIslam : What the West Needs to Know.â€ 
For the films , Horowitz advises campus organizers to invite a â€œlocal radio host or other local figure to introduce the film and possibly moderate a discussion on it afterwards .
â€
Organizers are encouraged to request funding from the student government .
If is not forthcoming , according to the Guide , â€œit will prove the hypocrisy of your universityâ€™s claim to be committed to intellectual diversity and academic freedom.â€ 
Other possible funders and sponsors include Young Americans Foundation , the Leadership Institute , the campus College Republican club and Hillel ,
The program clearly models itself after strategies employed by left - wing radicals in the 1960s and 1970s but is careful to protect the campus rules and local laws that Horowitzâ€™s ideological enemies on the left would blatantly disregard .
Organizers of the sit-ins are explicitly warned not to obstruct university operations or violate university rules .
As my colleague , Eli Clifton noted , it combines some of the hardware of the 1960s student movement with the software of Horowitzâ€™s hard - right â€ “ dare one say it ?
Islamophobic â€ ” ideology .
According to tax records obtained through the Foundation Center , Horowitz has been the beneficiary in recent years of a number of far - right foundations , including the Allegheny ( $ 575,000 since 2001 ) , Carthage ( $ 125,000 ) and Sarah Scaife Foundations ( $ 800,000 ) â€ “ all three are part of Richard Scaifeâ€™s empire and the Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation ( nearly $ 1.3 million ) .
The Harry and Jeanette Weinberg Foundation ( $ 475,000 ) also contributed nearly $ 500,000 to Horowitzâ€™s enterprises over the same period .

Before I start in on this : be aware I ’m mostly writing this to force myself to understand something by writing it down .
If you get anything out of it , consider it a bonus .
I will be deriving Y( ) in JavaScrpit , and giving a version in Ruby .
After stumbling on this article on Raganwald last year ( thoroughly interesting site by the way ) , I was initially intrigued and then totally frustrated by not being able to understand what the hell this Y combinator thing was .
It ’s of limited practical use to me , but it bugs me when I can’t wrap my brain around something .
This is an attempt to remedy said frustration .
You may find this Wikipedia article and Richard Gabriel ’s The Why of Y ( PDF , examples in Scheme ) useful as we go along .
I ’ve cobbled this together from other articles linked from Raganwald and found through Google .
I assume we ’re all familiar with the idea of a function as something that takes some input value and returns some output value .
Say , the function for squaring numbers :
f(x ) = x²
Or in Javascript :
var square = function ( x ) { return x * x ; } ;
The fixed points of a function are any input values for which f(x ) is equal to x .
So , the fixed points of f( x ) = x² are 0 and 1 .
Now , in mathematics and in any language that supports first - class functions ( that is , functions that can be passed around as data ) , we have things called higher - order functions .
These are functions that take another function as input , or return a function as output , or both .
The fixed point of a higher order function f is another function p such that f( p ) = p. ( It may be more helpful to think in terms of functions actually being executed .
The previous statement is equivalent to the statement that f( p ) ( x ) = p(x ) for all values of x. ) Y ( the Y combinator ) is a special function that returns the fixed points of higher - order functions , that is to say :
f( Y( f ) ) = Y( f )
Y is commonly use to allow anonymous recursion without assuming your host language supports it .
Let ’s say I want a function that calculates the factorial of a number :
var factorial = function ( x ) { return x == 0 ? 1 : x * factorial ( x - 1 ) ; } ;
Before we go any further : JavaScript supports anonymous recursion .
The correct form of the above function is :
var factorial = function ( x ) { return x == 0 ? 1 : x * arguments .
callee ( x - 1 ) ; } ;
arguments .callee gives all functions an internal reference to themselves .
This article is about what to do if such a feature is not available in your language .
There ’s a big problem with the above function ( the one without arguments .
callee ) : it relies on the name I ’ve given the function externally .
If I do this :
var bar = factorial ; factorial = " something " ; bar ( 5 ) // -> does not work
My factorial function ceases to work because , inside it , factorial is no longer what it expects .
What we ’re going to work towards here is a function that acts as a factory for factorial functions :
var f = function ( q ) { return function ( x ) { return x == 0 ? 1 : x * q ( x - 1 ) ; } ; } ;
This function f will return a factorial function .
To recurse , it calls a local function ( only defined inside f , not globally ) called q .
We need to pass this function to f to make the recursion work correctly , but what function do we need ?
q needs to be the factorial function for the inner function to work properly , but we ’re back where we started : we ca n’t write a secure factorial function because we ca n’t use anonymous recursion .
But , notice what ’s happened : if we pass the factorial function to f , it will return the factorial function .
The factorial function is thus a fixed point of f , and can be determined using the Y combinator .
So how do we get there ?
To start with , lets make the recursive function local to factorial by passing it in as a parameter :
var factorial = function ( h , x ) { return x == 0 ? 1 : x * h ( h , x - 1 ) ; } ; factorial ( factorial , 5 ) // -> 120
We now pass a function to tell factorial how to recurse without refering to any global variables .
This interface is not really satisfactory though – I want to be able to call functionName ( value ) .
So let ’s create a function that returns another function ( this is called currying our factorial function ) :
var factorial = function ( h ) { return function ( x ) { return x == 0 ? 1 : x * h ( h ) ( x - 1 ) ; } ; } ; factorial ( factorial ) ( 5 ) // -> 120
That ’s all well and good , but there ’s a lot of cruft and duplication and we ’ve got h(h ) ( x ) in the function definition rather than a single q(x ) as above .
So , we create another nested function that creates a single reference to h(h ) :
var factorial = function ( h ) { return function ( x ) { var f = function ( q , x ) { return x == 0 ? 1 : x * q ( x - 1 ) ; } ; return f ( h ( h ) , x ) ; } ; } ; factorial ( factorial ) ( 5 ) // -> 120
This is almost looking like our f function form before .
We just curry the innermost function to complete the transformation :
var factorial = function ( h ) { return function ( x ) { var f = function ( q ) { return function ( x ) { return x == 0 ? 1 : x * q ( x - 1 ) ; } ; } ; return f ( h ( h ) ) ( x ) ; } ; } ; factorial ( factorial ) ( 5 ) // ->
120
Now that inner function f does not contain any references to variables outside it , so we can pull it out and it will work the same :
var f = function ( q ) { return function ( x ) { return x == 0 ? 1 : x * q ( x - 1 ) ; } ; } ; var factorial = function ( h ) { return function ( x ) { return f ( h ( h ) ) ( x ) ; } ; } ; factorial ( factorial ) ( 5 ) // ->
120
Now we have our original f that we want the fixed point of .
The fixed point is the factorial function given by factorial ( factorial ) , so we can write our Y ( ) function to return it :
var Y = function ( f ) { var g = function ( h ) { return function ( x ) { return f ( h ( h ) ) ( x ) ; } ; } ; return g ( g ) ; } ;
This is more generally written as :
var Y = function ( f ) { return ( function ( g ) { return g ( g ) ; } ) ( function ( h ) { return function ( ) { return f ( h ( h ) ) .
apply ( null , arguments ) ; } ; } ) ; } ;
Y( ) will now return the fixed point of any higher - order function , which is just what we wanted :
var factorial = Y ( function ( recurse ) { return function ( x ) { return x == 0 ? 1 : x * recurse ( x - 1 ) ; } ; } ) ; factorial ( 5 ) // -> 120
And presto – anonymous recursion with no dependence on global variables or support from the host language .
If you want to do this in Ruby ( I ’m not sure whether it has an analog for arguments .
callee ) , it looks like this :
def y ( & f ) lambda { | g | g [ g ] } [ lambda do | h | lambda { |* args | f [ h [ h ] ] [ * args ] } end ] end factorial = y do | recurse | lambda do | x | x .
zero ? ? 1 : x * recurse [ x - 1 ] end end
The frustrating thing about Y is that once you ’ve derived it , it ’s totally impossible to tell what it does just by looking at it .
If you made it this far , congratulations .
" willCode4Beer " , a software engineer and blogger in the San Francisco Bay Area , recently posted a comparison of " Ruby on Rails " and Java software developer salaries , using PayScale data .
Noting that the average salary for developers in San Francisco is $ 17,000 higher for Java than Ruby on Rails , he concluded he should stick with Java , at least until the pay for Ruby on Rails catches up .
However , big grains of salt are required when comparing these charts 🙂
In this post , after a brief background on programming languages and their fads , I ’ll look at why , even in the face of these charts , it is not so clear which language willCode4 Beer should use .

What are Ruby on Rails and Java ?
For those who do n’t know , “ Ruby on Rails ” is the latest hot programming language and framework .
Java and related frameworks was the hot new programming language 10 years ago .
For those less technical , programming languages are how software developers tell a computer what to do .
Frameworks are collections of pre-written instructions a developer can use to speed up the application development process .
Computers are notoriously stupid .
By analogy , you cannot simply tell a computer to tie its shoes .
A developer has to explain every step , from grabbing each lace at the end , to looping the laces over and under , etc .
Worse , unlike children , computers do n’t infer based on past experience ; a developer has to explicitly tell all the steps every time s/he writes a new application .
Frameworks ( also called libraries ) are useful , because different applications often instruct computers to do similar things .
For example , having a standard set of instructions ( also called a routine or class ) in a framework called “ tie shoes ” would be very useful , if you writing an application that tells a computer how get dressed .
Programming Languages and Fads
Both languages and frameworks are subject to both evolutionary improvement and fads .
Sometimes these improvements are real , representing major steps forward in developer productivity , at least for some applications .
Sometimes they are not .
Ruby on Rails is the latest silver bullet that promises to make software development simple .
Created in 2004 , Ruby on Rails promises to simplify greatly the creation of data - intensive websites and applications .
Java was the silver bullet of the late 90’s .
Ah , I remember the days back in 1997 , coding in Java and the Swing framework .
They promised to make computer programming simple , and “ applications write once , run anywhere . ”
Sun Microsystems was in ascendency , the dot - coms were just starting really to bubble , and the new economy was going to change everything .
Funny how , 10 years later , the Java programmers are now making the big bucks for writing in the “ hard to use ” old - school language . 🙂
I do not know whether Ruby on Rails will replace Java everywhere , simply take over as the dominant language in some application areas ( as Java did to C++ and other earlier languages ) , or be a fad that never catches on outside a core community , but I can say something about pay .
Java vs. Ruby on Rails Developer Salaries
Let ’s look at slightly different PayScale Research Center charts than willCode4 Beer referenced .
Instead of salary by city , the charts below are by years of experience .
The titles are a little misleading ; the years of experience is in the field of software development , not only with each language .
Obviously , no one has 20 years of experience with Java or Ruby on Rails , since neither existed in 1988 .
Ruby on Rails as a Skill :
Java as a Skill :
Hum , the difference in salaries is no longer so dramatic .
Low experience ( < 5 years ) dev. pros may make more with Ruby on Rails than Java
The statistics for < 1 is too small to say for sure For 1 - 4 years , the salary increase is only 3 % more for Ruby on Rails
For higher experience ( 5 years and up ) dev pros , Java tends to pay a bit more
Only the 5 - 9 range has enough data for Ruby on Rails to really compare the two : salaries are about 10 % higher for Java
None of the differences are as dramatic as the differences in median pay shown for San Francisco or New York in charts in willCode4 Beer ’s post .
The reason for the differences will become clear when we consider what really affects developer pay .
Experienced Java vs. Ruby on Rails Developers ?
The populations of Ruby on Rails and Java developers , in the PayScale research center sample , and in the nation as a whole , are not the same .
The most dramatic difference is in the number of development pros using each skill .
For the US , the PayScale research center sample has 27,300 for Java vs. 131 for Ruby on Rails .
This is for three reasons :
PayScale has only been collecting data on Ruby on Rails for about 5 months : reduces sample by ~ 2X Since Ruby on Rails is not a top 15 most popular skill for developers , it is not a checkbox on our survey .
An employee must it in .
Hard to say precisely the effect , but likely good for ~ 5X fewer profiles ( devs just do n’t mention they use Ruby on Rails ) .
A lot fewer development pros actually use Ruby on Rails than Java on the job : see willCode4 Beer ’s comparisons of job postings , which imply 20X fewer jobs requiring Ruby on Rails .
The other dramatic difference is median years of experience in the field ( not just the language ) .
For Java , the median is about 8 years , and there are a significant number with 20 or more .
For Ruby on Rails , the median is about 6 years , and there are very few with 20 or more .
Switch from Java to Ruby on Rails ?
While I am not a full - time developer now , and never officially was one , I have coded over the years in Fortran - 77 , C , C++ , Java and now C# .
This variety of languages over time is common for most of our senior developers here at PayScale .
While my brain has been getting softer in the last few years , developers generally become significantly more productive between college graduation and ~ 10 years later – assuming they actually learn how to code better during that time 🙂
With greater productivity and skill comes greater pay .
This is shown in both the charts above , and is a general property for professional jobs like software developer .
Given that the most important factor in pay is experience as a developer , not with a particular language , why does anyone ever switch computing language ?
Why am I no longer coding in Fortran ?
There are several reasons :
The potential of a new language to increase productivity for a particular application type exceeds the cost in productivity of learning the new language
Companies for which you want to work stop using the language you know for new projects
The new language is popular at companies in locations where you want to work .
You want to have the latest computer buzz words on your resume 🙂
For example , here at PayScale , we have moved from an site written back in 2000 in ASP ( basically Visual Basic ) to one using the .NET framework and C# .
The gain in maintainability and extensibility made it worthwhile .
Why C# instead of Java ?
Because it is easier to steal C# developers from Microsoft in Seattle than Java . 🙂
By the way , if you want to work in Chicago or Philadelphia , COBOL may be the way to go : more jobs and decent pay 🙂
How does your salary compare , and which skills should you consider adding ?
The PayScale Salary Calculator is a quick and easy way to compare positions .
When you want powerful salary data and comparisons customized for your exact position , be sure to build a complete profile by taking PayScale ’s full salary survey .
Use the “ What If ” features to compare what would happen if you added a skill .

It 's not easy to criticize a game that does so many difficult things right .
In terms of presentation , Assassin 's Creed for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 is a slam dunk : A clever premise , a unique setting , a fully - realized world , beautiful graphics and music , responsive controls .
Having accomplished all that , the team then failed to support their presentation with any gameplay mechanics that go beyond the utterly mundane .
And there 's barely even any of that .
Assassin's Creed innovates in many ways , except for the ones that are unique and crucial to the medium .
Assassin's Creed * is the Martha Stewart Wii cake , filled with cardboard and sticks : Extremely impressive , just as long as you do n't eat it .
The Luckiest , Worst Assassin Ever
__
What It Does Right :__
Every item on the laundry list of things that * Assassin 's Creed * does correctly ends up being vastly outweighed by some major failing .
The big one is the grand promise that the game makes to you in its very title .
Watching the concept video that was originally shown for this game , the hook is revealed :
In this game you get to play an assassin .
You sneak through a crowd to a place where a corrupt official is making some kind of public appearance .
Before he realizes anything , you leap out of the crowd and a hidden blade shoots from your sleeve , through the hole in your fist where your ring finger used to be , and plunges swiftly into his neck , all in one unbroken smooth motion .
Guards pursue you , but you quickly outwit them by disappearing into a group of monks , who not coincidentally are wearing the same clothes you happened to pick out today .
__
Why It Fails : __ Investigate targets , carefully plan , then pull off the ultimate stealth kill ?
This is heavy stuff , and the concept and trailer had me incredibly excited for such a game .
I still am excited at the possibility of maybe getting to play such a game in my lifetime .
Sadly , Assassin's Creed was not it .
Assassin's Creed , when you remove all the presentational trappings , was an unfulfilling , generic collection of boring mini-games and barely passable sword combat .
Before you can kill your target , you have to complete a few " investigation " missions around the city to gather information .
There are only four different types .
They start out incredibly easy , and get a tiny bit more difficult as the game goes on , becoming just " easy " without the " incredibly " modifier .
Interrogation : A town crier will be spreading some propaganda .
Follow him until there are no guards around , then punch him four times and he will start spilling his guts .
These are actually the best of the missions insofar as you get to punch a guy four times .
At first this seems really stealthy and exciting , but within about five seconds you realize there is no way to lose as long as you just walk five steps behind the guy until you do n't see any guards anymore .
Pickpocket : __ __Like Interrogation , but instead of hitting X to punch the guy you 're following you hit B to steal what he has in his fanny pack , which apparently was the height of 12th century Jerusalem fashion .
Somehow manages to be even easier than interrogation .
Eavesdrop:__
__Thinking that perhaps the above two challenges were too difficult , eavesdropping missions literally ask you to sit on a bench and press the Y button to listen to a conversation .
The infinitesimal chance of being caught drops to literally zero .
Informant : For all the ways Assassin 's Creed attempts to craft a more realistic environment than that of the average video game , they sure did n't mind having a guy tell you , " I 'll give you the information you need , but first , let 's see if you can collect the thirty flags that I 've scattered around the kingdom in exactly three minutes .
Three two one go ! "
These missions are notable for actually being a challenge , which is likely why they kept them in even though they obliterate the fourth wall that the team had been so careful to build .
I want to absolutely stress to you that besides the running around from place to place to get to these missions , and the assassination segments that follow , the four improbably basic missions above are the only things you actually need to do in this game .
There are some entirely optional " Save Citizen " moments where you can help a citizen by fighting off the guards that surround them , but there is n't a whole lot of reason to do so – saved citizens help when you 're attempting an escape , but you do n't really need them .
But we 're getting ahead of ourselves .
After you complete a certain number of investigations , the assassination itself will become available .
You 'll travel to one point in the city , where a cut scene will begin and you 'll see your target .
After it 's over , he 'll walk somewhere else and now all you have to do is find him without being spotted , then kill him in secret , then run .
Which is what 's supposed to happen .
Technically , this is entirely possible .
Sure , the guards are everywhere , and they 're on high alert , but if you stealthily take out a few of them without the others noticing , you 'll be able to creep through undetected .
The only problem is , what generally occurs is this :
The guards see you , because they always see you They all start attacking Your assassination target , a huge idiot , joins in the fight
You totally ignore all the guards , who do n't do much damage to you , and end up assassinating the guy anyway , despite yourself , not even knowing which one he is .
I died during a couple of assassination attempts , but more often than not I was able to get the kill in even though I was spotted .
So the game 's Big Promise , that you 'll become this stealthy silent killer who carefully orchestrates his every move , quickly fades away when you realize that more often than not , the game will force you into a situation where the easiest thing to do is just stab the guy right in the middle of broad daylight with a dozen armed guards standing around not doing anything about it .
And then , with one assassination done , eight more await you .
Eight more of the same thing , over and over .
Same cities , same lame investigation missions , same forced anticlimactic , fumbling kill at the end .
Even if you 're into Assassin 's Creed enough to enjoy the first couple of missions , it all falls apart once you realize that the design team only had five ideas total between them and that nothing new is ever going to happen .
A Whole New World
What It Does Right :
The three cities and vast hub world of Assassin 's Creed is quite frankly one of the most impressive open worlds that has ever been created for a videogame .
Drawing off of the sandbox cities of Grand Theft Auto , the Holy Land is not only impressively rendered , with amazing draw distance ( you can scale a high rooftop and see every little thing below ) , it is artistically very pretty to look at .
And it 's filled with thousands of people that give it an organic feel .
It 's also set in 12th - century Jerusalem instead of a war - torn near - future space - marine alien - ravaged planet like every other video game .
I do n't care if you 're one of the world 's most successful game design teams , that takes some balls .
That 's original , that 's daring , that 's praiseworthy .
Why It Fails :
There is shit all to do .
Ubisoft spent an incredible amount of time and energy lovingly crafting this living , breathing world , and then , from all appearances , nearly forgot to actually put a videogame into it .
This might explain why everything even remotely gamelike feels so paper - thin and tacked - on .
In other open - world games , you can wander around and find all manner of things to catch your attention .
But in Assassin's Creed , every part of the city that does not contain a mission is just filler .
In fact , the entire " Kingdom " hub world , a massive expanse of mountains and fields that connects the three cities , has absolutely nothing crucial inside it .
As near as I can tell , the only thing you can do in the Kingdom is climb up watchtowers to complete the map of the area , which is useless because you never need to go there for anything .
There are flags scattered all over creation , but you only need to collect them to get the you - collected - all - the - flags achievement – they have nothing to do with the actual story .
All Dressed Up With No Place To Go
What It Does Right : Main character Altaïr , being an assassin and more importantly being a character developed by the people responsible for the Prince of Persia games , is an incredible acrobat .
He scales walls , runs on rooftops , and leaps great distances with ease .
This is mostly because of the game's
" free - running " system , inspired by parkour .
All you need to do is hold down a button , then hold the direction you want Altaïr to go , and he 'll immediately begin running , climbing , and jumping with perfect precision .
You do n't need to worry about making the jumps or landing right .
It 's a bold game design decision , but it 's pulled off well , making for a very unique feel .
Why It Fails : Early on in the design process , the Assassin 's Creed team must have been faced with the basic question :
How do you make an open - world * Prince of Persi*a ?
Judging from the final product , the answer is apparently that you do not .
While the game 's jumping , hanging , and climbing acrobatics are pulled directly from the previous series , Prince of Persia 's jumping puzzles were intricately designed linear feats that challenged you to come up with the perfect series of acrobatic maneuvers to clear them .
Assassin's Creed has no such thing .
This is intentional – the jumping and climbing is just how you get from place to place .
But since there 's so little to do when you finally get where you 're going , crafting a more interesting and difficult journey would have helped a great deal .
Slightly later in the design process , another key question must have come up :
How do you make an open - world Metal Gear Solid ?
Apparently you do n't do that , either .
Metal Gear 's stealth gameplay is a series of carefully designed scenarios .
You see the guards on your radar screen .
You see where you need to go .
Your job is to read all this information , then interpret it correctly to figure out the proper course of action that will get you through unnoticed .
Assassin's Creed bills itself as a stealth game , but you can't do any of the above .
The city streets are a giant tangled ball of data that you can't legitimately be expected to process .
There are dozens of guards , hundreds of people , and lots of little side streets and blind corners .
Even if you were a math genius and could process it all , it 's still random .
A crazy person might push you into a guard , blowing all of your careful planning .
You will get spotted in Assassin 's Creed .
You will get spotted a lot .
And then you have to run around the city like a jackass hoping that the guards , who were omniscient a minute ago , suddenly become stupid enough to not see you " hiding " on a bench .
All this is to say that the open - world concept does absolutely nothing for Assassin 's Creed 's gameplay .
I simply can't see any reason why they decided to go this route other than the fact that sandbox games are the hip new thing that all the kids are doing these days .
Yes , it 's initially very impressive to look upon and roam about this vast , detailed world .
But a progressive , linear series of deliberate challenges would have suited the concept so much better .
It could have been * Prince of Persia * and Metal Gear Solid all in one .
Be Sure To Drink Your Ovaltine
What It Does Right : I actually kind of liked Assassin 's Creed 's story because I have a soft spot for trashy Da Vinci Code conspiracy theory summer beach reading , God knows why .
Why It Fails :
That infamous pre-rendered trailer that 's stuck onto the attract mode of Assassin 's Creed is the only CG cut scene in the entire game .
I do n't think this is a bad thing per se .
Especially in a game that looks this good , there should n't be anything wrong with just using the in - game engine to do all of the cinematic scenes .
Sure works for Zelda .
But designers should use the in - game engine to show something visually interesting , not have the characters stand stock - still for five minutes explaining big plot points to each other .
Guess which one Assassin 's Creed does .
The great bulk of the story scenes take place in one of two areas : the assassins ' bureau in each city ( which all look the exact same , which is not what I would do if I was trying to run a shadow organization ) and the main assassins ' hideout where you return after each kill to talk to your boss .
Eventually I started to dread going in there , because I never knew how long they were going to keep talking at me for minutes at a stretch with nothing interesting happening on screen .
This even happens when you assassinate someone .
They do n't have the courtesy to just die , they have to lay there and yammer on while you stare at nothing .
By about the third of fifty different times that I had to sit through these scenes , my eyes craved some kind of stimulus .
I was running Altaïr in little circles , rapidly switching through camera angles , and eventually just started looking at other things in the room .
These scenes were so boring that I nearly stopped paying attention to what they were saying altogether .
The only thing that changed was the voiceover .
Eventually I realized that Assassin's Creed might have worked just as well as a radio drama .
I could see Ralphie 's family from A Christmas Story gathering in the living room , lying down on the rug , and turning the dial to Little Orphan Altaïr .
Mashmashin's Creed
__What It Does Right : __Combat in a stealth game is a tough one , because you 're supposed to use it only as a last resort .
So it should n't really be too feature - rich , because you 're not really supposed to be using it that much .
And it should n't be too easy , because then you could just run everybody through with your sword and who cares if they see you because they 're dead .
In that sense , I think Assassin 's Creed 's combat worked fine during the assassination missions .
If you just tried to kill everything , they 'd all block your attacks and you 'd die .
You quickly learn that what you have to do is get into a defensive stance , then use your counterattack ( press the attack button when an enemy 's sword is coming in ) to get in a hit on them without endangering yourself .
It 's difficult to attack , but it 's supposed to be a punishment for being caught , not a reward .
Why It Fails :
And I thought I was disappointed with the last few assassination missions , where things got repetitive and boring .
I could n't even believe what happened in the final hours of the game .
Hey , take a guess . *
Assassin's Creed* , which is , at least ostensibly , a game about assassinating people , decides that its final climactic sequences will :
Comprise one final intricate assassination , which blends interrogation , free running , stealth , and one final hidden blade kill to serve as the culmination of everything that you 've learned before , or Throw all of that crap out the window and make you button - mash your way through an interminable series of fights against increasing numbers of guards , but not making the combat any more fun to make up for it , and making me wish I was still doing eavesdropping missions .
Give up ?
It is of course number 2 .
All the stealth gameplay drops out and suddenly you 're forced into combat literally until the game ends , sometimes against a couple dozen guards at once , just slamming the X button until it's all over , which takes forever .
The combat is still very basic and not much fun , but now you have no choice .
By this point I was absolutely in shock that this was the way they decided to end their game .
Even the final boss battle is a big huge ridiculous fight against like ten enemies .
My friend Andy Eddy called it the " kitchen sink " approach , " where it gets harder and harder until the point that everything gets thrown at you , seemingly in an effort by the developers to keep you at arm ’s length from finishing . "
I call it the Shredder fight from the end of Ninja Turtles , only terrible , and instead of zapping you with a de-evolution ray and turning you into a baby turtle he zaps the entire game with a de-evolution ray and sends it back to 1988 before the invention of subtlety .
Conclusion : Why Pick On Poor Assassin's Creed ?
I 'm sure there are plenty of people who are downright angry having reached this point in the story .
There are probably fifty worse games released this week .
Assassin's Creed does so many things right , so why single it out for such attention ?
Because it 's a massive , high - profile product .
Ubisoft has been hyping it up for nearly two years .
Apparently it 's selling very well .
Also , I 'm personally disappointed .
I was totally into this concept and could n't wait to get my hands on it .
I loved the time - travel plot gimmick and wanted to know what Altaïr 's big secret was .
I was ready to kill some people based purely on my own ability to puzzle out the perfect assassination plan .
I wanted everything that was promised , and not only did I not get it , I did n't even get an average game .
There 's absolutely no doubt ( especially to those who 've completed the game and seen the lurching drop - off of a cliffhanger ending ) that Ubi plans to continue on and on with this series .
If they 're serious about this , I hope they throw out everything that does n't work , and go all the way back to the drawing board for the sequel .
Because I think they could make the game they promised .

Web 2.0 Error Messages
These days , the Web 2.0 companies are very considerate about your blood pressure , they have used their innovation even when it comes to the dreaded “ 404 – File not Found ” , or “ Under Maintenance ” errors .
Listing some of the errors that I stumbled along when I was visiting the sites .
I think everyone has said “ Hello ” to the Bloglines plumber one time or the other .
This was one of the initial Error 2.0 Message that I saw , and I was very impressed .
Not for long though , he gets on my nerves now .
I have found many better error messages than this one .
Although I think this is where the “ cool error message ” thing started ( correct me if I am wrong ) .
Jaiku has a humourous one liner .
Technorati tries too , but apart from “ brb ” nothing can be deemed Web 2.0 classy 🙂
Wish they had tried a bit harder …

That is one swell deal 😀
There was another website where I had seen an error that said “ Out on a coffee break ” or something on those lines …
Seemed to me a direct lift of the Flickr error message and so I did not include that in the list .

Technorati : Web 2.0 , Error Messages
Regular viewers of “ Lou Dobbs Tonight , ” on CNN , might be surprised at the venue that Dobbs chose for lunch not long ago : the Grill Room of the Four Seasons , a midtown bastion of the very same political and business “ élites ” that he denounces daily on his television program .
The Four Seasons is the enduring commissary of the Old Guard , where Henry Kissinger waves to the former Citigroup C.E.O.
Sandy Weill , there is limo - lock at the side door , and the regulars have their checks sent to the office .
Dobbs ’s Town Car left him at the door , on East Fifty - second Street , and the restaurant ’s co-owner , Julian Nicolini , embraced him that day as warmly as when he welcomed , among others , Stephen Schwarzman , the chairman and C.E.O. of the Blackstone Group ; Nelson Peltz , the C.E.O. of Trian Partners ; Edgar Bronfman , Sr. , the former chairman and C.E.O. of Seagram ; and Mortimer Zuckerman , the real - estate developer and publisher of the News .
Nicolini led Dobbs to one of five choice banquettes , and Dobbs settled in , looking very much at home .
Dobbs is sixty - one , and his chubby face has a rosy glow .
His blond hair is lacquered in place , his black wing tips are impeccably buffed .
Other club members having lunch that day — the Nobel Prize winner James Watson , Bronfman , Peltz , the movie producer Harvey Weinstein — stopped at the table to say hello .
It is the kind of welcome that one might have expected for an earlier incarnation of Lou Dobbs — the Harvard - educated anchor of CNN ’s “ Moneyline , ” which in the nineteen - nineties served as a sort of video clubhouse for corporate America .
But , in the past four years or so , Dobbs has been reborn as a populist — a full - throated champion of “ the little guy , ” an evangelical opponent of liberal immigration laws .
His hour - long program , which airs at six , features Dobbs in a role that combines Ralph Nader and Pat Buchanan .
On the air , he boomingly assails the upper management of corporate America for its “ outrageous ” greed , pay packages , and corruption , its opposition to increasing the minimum wage , its hiring of “ illegal aliens , ” its ties to “ Communist China , ” and its eagerness to send American jobs overseas .
The new Lou Dobbs often surprises those who recall the old Lou Dobbs of “ Moneyline . ” Daniel Henninger , the deputy editor of the Wall Street Journal editorial page , wrote , “ Old admirers are aghast .
It ’s as if whatever made Linda Blair ’s head spin around in ‘ The Exorcist ’ had invaded the body of Lou Dobbs and left him with the brain of Dennis Kucinich , ” a reference to the left - wing Ohio congressman and former Presidential aspirant .
After an angry altercation on the show with James Glassman , a former New Republic publisher and current conservative supply - sider , Glassman said of Dobbs , “ How did he transform from a business sycophant to a raving populist ? ”
Glassman ’s answer was that Dobbs had begun to “ demagogue these issues . ”
( In questioning Glassman ’s economic theories on his program , Dobbs accused him of talking “ like a cult member . ” )
As if to answer such critics , Dobbs has recently published a book whose title is almost as long as the menu at the Grill Room : “ War on the Middle Class : How the Government , Big Business , and Special Interest Groups Are Waging War on the American Dream and HOW TO FIGHT BACK . ”
On the cover , Dobbs is standing — hands in pockets , feet apart — like a sentry protecting the boundaries of decency and the nation .
At CNN , alone among the cable network ’s anchors , he is allowed to express his opinions without borders .
“ I ’m never neutral on any issue that affects the common good , our national interest , and working men and women of this country , ” he writes .
In many ways , Dobbs and Bill O’Reilly , of Fox News , who in 2003 wrote a book entitled “ Who ’s Looking Out for You ? , ” are kindred spirits .
Dobbs , who lives on a three - hundred - acre farm in a prosperous part of New Jersey , admires his own capacity for compassion and self - effacement .
His audience , he writes , knows that he cares “ more about them and their lives than about being invited to the White House or playing golf with C.E.O.s and celebrities . ”
For most of its first half hour , “ Lou Dobbs Tonight ” contains more domestic and international news than does each of the three major network ’s broadcasts , and Dobbs fills the role of the well - informed anchorman .
Yet he also teases his audience , with headlines from stories that run in the second half hour , which is dominated by what Dobbs ’s executive producer , Jim McGinnis , refers to as “ brands ” — segments with names like “ Broken Borders , ” “ Homeland Insecurity , ” “ War on the Middle Class , ” “ Exporting America , ” and “ The Best Government Money Can Buy . ”
“ It ’s very different from any program you ’ll see on TV , by intention , ” Dobbs said , as we ordered the fifty - six - dollar Dover sole .
“ What you wo n’t see on our broadcast is ‘ fair and balanced journalism . ’
You will not see ‘ objective journalism . ’
The truth is not ‘ fair and balanced . ’
There is a nonpartisan , independent reality that does n’t give a damn , frankly , what two Democrats and two Republicans think about anything or say about anything . ”
The cable - news universe is relatively small .
About eight hundred thousand people watch “ Lou Dobbs Tonight ” ( about nine million watch the “ Nightly News , ” on NBC ) , and in its time slot it lags behind Brit Hume ’s show , on Fox , which has about a million and a half viewers .
But Dobbs is narrowing the gap , and his news program is one of the handful on cable whose audiences are growing , rather than shrinking .
The highest - rated cable news program is “ The O’Reilly Factor , ” on Fox , which averages about two million viewers , and Fox continues to lead CNN in the ratings , with MSNBC a distant third .
A program ’s ranking is affected by the length of time that viewers stay with it , and news shows that do best tend to have opinionated anchors , like Fox ’s O’Reilly and Sean Hannity ; MSNBC ’s Keith Olbermann , whose audience has increased by two - thirds in the past year ; and Dobbs , whose broadcast has drawn twenty - two per cent more viewers in the past twelve months .
In October , the network announced that “ Lou Dobbs Tonight ” would expand from five nights to seven , and Dobbs was named one of CNN ’s four Election Night anchors .
Dobbs has been with CNN since Ted Turner launched the cable network from Atlanta , in 1980 , and both Dobbs and CNN have changed in the intervening years .
Turner once liked to contrast CNN with the broadcast networks by saying that “ news was the star ” and that CNN expunged opinions from its news .
Today , CNN heavily promotes its star anchors — particularly Dobbs , Larry King , whose show airs at nine , and Anderson Cooper , who comes on at ten .
Cooper regularly travels to trouble spots and shares with viewers his personal responses to situations , and one longtime CNN employee said of his show , “ It ’s almost a fact - free zone .
It ’s a feeling zone . ”
Unlike Fox , whose identity among its core viewers is often described as a celebration of conservatives , CNN seems to have adopted a “ We ’re on your side ” stance as a way to boost ratings .
It was encouraged by Dobbs , but also by Cooper , who expressed his outrage at the federal response to Hurricane Katrina , and by Jack Cafferty , in cranky commentaries on Wolf Blitzer ’s “ The Situation Room . ”
For nine nights in October , CNN ran a series called “ Broken Government , ” as well as two hour - long Dobbs town - hall meetings — the first on the “ forgotten middle class , ” the second on illegal immigration .
CNN ’s ratings improved dramatically , particularly among the most desirable demographic , twenty - five - to fifty - four - year - olds .
Jon Klein , the president of CNN in the United States , told me that when he arrived at the cable network , soon after the 2004 election , there was a perception that CNN would become more like Fox and that news , as he put it , “ had to be glitzy and a diversion ” — a series of tabloid narratives with constant updates .
“ No one wanted to cover Natalee Holloway , but they thought they had to , ” Klein says , referring to the teen - ager who disappeared in Aruba .
“ That ’s not said from some moral high ground .
It ’s business .
If everyone else on television is doing it , do n’t you want to do something else ? ”
With its excitable coverage of these stories , Klein believed that CNN “ was alienating its audience , ” and damaging its credibility .
From the digital world , where he once worked and where he could chart what people watched and when interest waned , he “ learned that people get tired of stories easily . ”
Although CNN hardly ignores the more diverting stories , Klein wanted people at the network to “ decide for ourselves what is important , ” and CNN to distinguish itself through what he called “ differentiation . ”
Klein , who is forty - eight , spent nearly two decades in various capacities at CBS News , where he produced both serious work ( overseeing “ 60 Minutes ” and winning a Peabody Award for “ 48 Hours , ” which is emphasized in his official biography ) and less - serious news ( the softening of “ 48 Hours , ” which goes unmentioned ) .
In 1999 , after leaving CBS , he founded a broadband video company , the FeedRoom , which tells companies how to use video on the Internet .
With a worldwide staff of four thousand , CNN had more reporting resources than any of its competitors .
When the tsunami struck Southeast Asia in December of 2004 , Klein says , he worked with his CNN international counterpart , and “ We gang - tackled the story .
We asked correspondents not to do standups but to find real human stories , to do storytelling . ”
He says that he quickly took note of Anderson Cooper ’s talent for displaying empathy ( Cooper replaced Aaron Brown in November 2005 ) , and also decided that Dobbs ’s program was fine as it was .
“ I committed ‘ benign neglect ’ on Lou , ” Klein told me .
For some years , CNN has billed itself as “ The most trusted name in news . ”
( A recent Pew poll , however , suggested that there is little difference in credibility among the cable news networks ; the poll also noted that the number of Americans who said they believed “ all or most ” of what CNN reported has fallen from forty - two per cent to twenty - eight per cent since 1998 . )
Under Klein , CNN has , once again , placed greater emphasis on its chief international correspondent , Christiane Amanpour , and given more airtime to John King , the chief national correspondent .
After largely abandoning documentaries in recent years , the network plans to produce twenty - four hours in 2007 ; among the topics that the scheduled programs will cover are Iraq and the environment .
After it became clear that CBS would choose Katie Couric to replace Dan Rather as anchor , Klein hired the CBS White House correspondent John Roberts , who had once been in contention for Rather ’s job .
He recruited Time ’s Baghdad bureau chief , Michael Ware , as well as senior broadcast network - news producers : David Doss , formerly of ABC and NBC , to executive - produce Anderson Cooper ; and Victor Neufeld , a veteran of CBS and ABC , to executive - produce Paula Zahn , who anchors the news at 8 P.M.
He also replaced “ Inside Politics ” and the shouting match “ Crossfire ” with the more news - oriented “ Situation Room . ”
The showman in Klein competes with the newsman and , in the atmosphere of cable news , the showman often wins the contest .
“ There ’s no question that Jon Klein wants more edge , ” a senior CNN employee told me .
“ Klein is the most personality - driven manager we ’ve had . ”
This employee respects Klein “ as a leader ” for returning the network to its news roots but worries that Klein is drawing the wrong conclusion from Dobbs ’s improved ratings .
“ When we did the ‘ Broken Government ’ series , ” the senior employee said , “ in the first conference call he said , ‘ I do n’t want preconceived solutions , but , when you reach a conclusion , do n’t be afraid to express it .
I do n’t want ‘ He said , she said . ’ ”
CNN ’s news coverage coexists uneasily with its Dobbs - led populism .
Among the viewers who are less than happy with the network ’s current direction is Ted Turner , who told me , “ CNN in the U.S. is quite a bit different than it was .
They ’ve gone more into emphasizing personality , and to some degree , particularly in the case of Lou Dobbs , they ’ve encouraged him to promote himself and his own ideas to create a cult of personality to increase the ratings . ”
Turner paused for a moment before adding that Lou Dobbs is “ a very talented newscaster , and he ’s personally a friend of mine .
Having said that , I personally think he ’s gone too far inserting his opinions , for my taste . ”
Dobbs often describes himself as “ a kid who grew up poor ” in rural Texas .
He was the younger of two sons , born in September , 1945 , in Childress ( pop. 6,000 ) , not far from Amarillo .
His father was a partner in a small propane business , and his mother was a bookkeeper .
When Lou was twelve , the propane business collapsed and the family , in search of a better livelihood , moved to a farm in Rupert , Idaho , where Lou attended public schools .
His teachers encouraged him to apply to Harvard , from which he graduated in 1967 , with a degree in economics .
His first job was working in federal anti-poverty programs in Boston and Washington , D.C. Dobbs recalls , “ I decided to go out and make some money .
I decided I was n’t changing the world . ”
He then moved to Los Angeles , where he worked as a cash - management specialist for Union Bank , earning what was then an excellent salary of thirty thousand dollars a year to come up with ways for companies to manage their capital more efficiently .
In 1969 , he married a former high - school sweetheart ; in 1970 , the first of their two sons was born .
But Dobbs grew restless at the bank , particularly after spending time with two friends who were journalists , and who , he says , “ seemed to be having so much fun . ”
He had been saving money , and moved his family to Yuma , Arizona , where he ’d heard about a job as a police and fire reporter for a radio station .
His imposing physical presence and booming voice had been quickly noticed , and he soon began working with the affiliated television station .
“ I found what I really loved to do , ” he says .
His starting salary was seventy - five dollars a week .
In the mid-seventies , he was hired as a television anchor - reporter , first in Phoenix and then in Seattle .
At the end of 1979 , a recruiter called to ask if he would be interested in the all - news cable network that Ted Turner was starting .
Dobbs liked the idea of challenging the three broadcast networks , and Turner hired him to anchor a half - hour business newscast .
On the Chicken Noodle Network , as CNN was sometimes called then , Dobbs was the youngest anchor .
He is the only one from that period who is still with CNN .
Dobbs soon became a member of the network ’s executive committee , and eventually supervised a staff of more than three hundred , overseeing all of CNN ’s business coverage .
He was also put in charge of business news on CNN.com , and became the president of CNNfn , a business cable network .
His main job , however , was to anchor the half - hour “ Moneyline ” program , which in 1984 moved to New York .
In 1998 , it was given an additional half hour , and renamed the “ Moneyline News Hour with Lou Dobbs , ” allowing Dobbs to offer a wider range of reports .
Dobbs ’s personal life had undergone a few changes during these years .
In 1981 , he divorced his wife .
The following year , he married Debi Lee Segura , a sports anchor and a reporter for CNN ; in 1988 , Segura gave birth to twin girls .
Dobbs bought his farm in Sussex , New Jersey , a ninety - minute commute to CNN ’s studios in Manhattan , where he raised and rode horses , joined a country club , and collected guns .
( His two sons , both businessmen , live in nearby Sparta ; his daughters were recently accepted at Harvard . )
CHENNAI , India ( Reuters ) - Police arrested the head of the animal rights group PETA for a breach of public peace and insulting religious feelings while protesting against a bullfighting festival in south India , officials said on Friday .

Ingrid Newkirk , president of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals , was held on Thursday after she blindfolded a statue of Indian independence leader Mohandas K. Gandhi to protest against cruelty towards bulls in the ancient sport of “ jallikattu ” .
Organized as part of the January harvest festival of “ pongal ” , jallikattu is India ’s version of the running of the bulls which takes place every year in the Spanish city of Pamplona .
Fighters and muscular wild bulls -- often pepped up with large amounts of homemade liquor -- dash after each other in the streets of the southern state of Tamil Nadu .
Unlike the Spanish version of the sport , the aim is not to kill the bulls but to dominate and tame them , and pluck away bundles of money or other treats tied to their specially sharpened horns .
Police said Newkirk was held on charges of breaching public peace , hurting religious sentiments and damaging statues after she entered a park in Coimbatore town and put a cloth around the eyes of Gandhi ’s statue .
She then hung a placard saying : “ Reject cruel sport jallikattu ” .
She was released on bail .
Newkirk told Reuters she did not mean any disrespect to Gandhi but blindfolded his statue to symbolically shield him from the cruelty of the sport .
“ In the name of taming of the bull , 10 , 20 , 50 people torment the animal and thousands cheer , ” she said .
“ You can see fear and confusion in the eyes of the animal as it tries to flee . ”
India ’s animal welfare board has also criticized the festival saying men beat the animals and throw burning chilli powder in their eyes , ears and mouth to enrage them .
India ’s Supreme Court banned jallikattu last year , saying it was cruel and not in keeping with what it described as the country ’s non-violent traditions .
But that ban was watered down this month , and the court said the popular sport could be held under strict government vigil .
Fighters and spectators have been gored or trampled to death , and the number of injured fighters has often run into the hundreds .
The festival has been marketed as a tourist attraction in recent years .

This article was written by Matt Castle , our brand - spanking - new writer who joins us from across the pond where U's are used liberally and R's and E's are juxtaposed brazenly .
One afternoon in the early 1950s , a young biochemist left his suburban lab bench at Britain ’s Mill Hill National Institute of Medical Research and boarded a tube train to Leicester Square .
His destination was on nearby Lisle Street , in an area which today makes up part of London ’s glittering West End theatre district .
But in the post - war years the sector was better known as a hectic hub for two of humanity ’s oldest professions .
Only one of these was of interest to the young scientist .
The girls hawking their wares seemed to sense his single - mindedness and kept their distance as the greenhorn scientist turned his attention to his true quarry : the vast abundance of second - hand military hardware that could be found in the shops lining Lisle Street .
Specifically , he was looking for war surplus radar equipment .
His intention was to cannibalize a suitable radio frequency transmitter for the purpose of reanimating dead , frozen hamsters .
The purposeful young biochemist was working in an exciting field so new that it did n’t yet have an official name , although eventually the term “ cryobiology ” ⁠— literally meaning “ frosty life ” ⁠— gained currency .
One of his colleagues at Mill Hill was Dr Audrey Smith , the leading light in a series of hamster freezing and reanimation experiments .
These dramatic and oft - quoted experiments have since achieved legendary status among cryobiologists , including researchers of the credible variety and researchers of the we ’ll - freeze - your - head - and - bring - it- back - to - life - attached - to - the - body - of - a - spaniel - when - future - technology - allows variety .
Yet they have never been repeated .
The basic procedure worked like this :
1. Obtain desired number of Golden Hamsters ( Mesocricetus auratus ) .
2 . Place in ice bath at temperature - 5 °C .
3 . Leave hapless rodents to cool until hearts have stopped beating , respiration has ceased , animals are frozen rigid and are - – by any conventional definition of life⁠ — no longer alive .
4 . After 60 - 90 minutes , remove hamsters from ice bath .
5 . If required , cut sections of one or more control animals to determine degree of freezing .
Please note⁠ — animals thus examined should not be used in subsequent reanimation attempts .
6 . Warm the hearts of the frozen hamsters until they start up again , followed by gentle re-warming of the rest of the animal (s ) until miraculous recovery occurs .
7 . Determine number of survivors .
Serves 5 .
In the initial experiments , reanimation of the hamsters was carried out using the crude method of pressing a hot metal spoon against the animal ’s chest until circulation resumed .
The important thing was to warm the heart first - the researchers soon found that simply placing the hamsters in a bath of warm water would lead to an over - rapid resumption of circulation , promptly stopping the heart again due to contact with the freezing cold blood returning from the animals ’ extremities .
By applying heat to the heart first a more gradual and ultimately successful reanimation could take place .
But it was felt that the use of the hot metal spoons was a step too far ; the burning and singing of the skin caused obvious distress to the reanimated animals .
The purpose of the young biochemist ’s visit to Lisle Street was to make this aspect of the re-warming process more humane .
By adapting an old aircraft radio frequency transmitter to emit microwaves , a diathermy device was made which could heat the hamsters ’ hearts externally without damaging the skin in the same way a microwave oven cooks ready meals without melting the plastic container .
The astute scientist who pioneered this technique and later braved the whores of Lisle Street to find suitable equipment was a man named James Lovelock .
In his autobiography Homage to Gaia he describes how his work on hamster - reanimation got him thinking about the meaning of life .
According to conventional definitions of “ life , ” the frozen hamsters were decidedly dead ; the unfortunate rodents were n’t moving , they were n’t breathing , their hearts had stopped , and they certainly were n’t eating , drinking or reproducing .
Yet they could be made almost as good as new with a little bit of hot - spoon or microwave therapy .
He wondered if “ life ” might have a broader meaning .
This set him on the path to the theory for which he is most well known : the Gaia Hypothesis .

Thirteen years after he left the Mill Hill laboratories and the field of cryobiology , he finally published the landmark paper Atmospheric homeostasis by and for the biosphere : the Gaia Hypothesis with his biologist collaborator , Lynn Margulis .
Gaia theory proposes the existence of a system of complex feedback mechanisms that work across the whole of the Earth ’s surface ; these involve both living and non-living parts of the biosphere which act to keep the chemistry and temperature of the planetary surface comfortable for life .
In some important respects this entire system could be considered as akin to ‘ living ’ itself .
Lovelock ’s novelist friend William Golding found an appropriate name from Greek mythology : that of the Earth Goddess , Gaia .
At first the idea was met with disbelief⁠ — then with ridicule .
To this day Gaia theory is still far from being universally accepted among the scientific community .
Although Lovelock was careful to stress that his theory was n’t suggesting that the Earth was actually alive⁠ — only that the Earth system mimics a living , self - regulating entity in some ways ⁠ — many scientists struggled with the analogy .
For a start the Earth does n’t eat or move purposefully , and it has never displayed any discernible interest in mating with neighbouring planets .
It was a difficult concept to reconcile with the traditionalist view that something was alive only if it met certain established criteria , such as being capable of metabolism or growth .
Meanwhile cryobiology research continued .
By the time Lovelock left Mill Hill in the early 1960s the freezing and successful reanimation of hamsters using microwave diathermy was almost routine .
But there were limitations to the technique .
For a start , the temperatures involved never went further than a few degrees below the freezing point of water and only for an hour or so at a time ; although in some cases more than 80 % of the water in the skin and 60 % of the water in the brain had changed to ice , the animals were never 100 % frozen .
Thus most of the hamsters ’ cells were spared the tattering which is characteristic of full ice crystal formation .
The results were certainly dramatic , demonstrating that it is possible to lower complex organisms to below - freezing temperatures and then successfully reanimate them .
The knowledge they gained had clear relevance to the aim of improving human health ; current medical advances that derive from early cryobiology research include techniques for the storage and transport of human tissues destined for transplant , many aspects of low temperature surgery , and experimental techniques for improving outcomes in resuscitation after cardiac arrest .
Though these researchers were not advocating the freezing of dead human bodies or heads for later reanimation , their research did become the basis for just such a movement⁠ — a scandal - tainted offshoot of cryobiology known as cryonics .
A cryonics patient is prepared for freezing in a vat of dry ice .
But attempts to repeat the experiments with larger mammals and at lower temperatures have never been successful .
And neither was the phenomenon entirely original : in the natural world numerous critters have been pulling a similar trick for millennia .
Fish swim in freezing polar seas with antifreeze proteins in their blood , Wood Frogs ’ circulation and breathing stops when they partially freeze during the winter , and even mammals like the Arctic Ground Squirrels can hibernate successfully at temperatures of - 3 °C , with no need to resort to microwave diathermy for reanimation after months , not minutes , spent at subzero temperatures .
Less spectacular but perhaps more significant experiments in cryobiology were also carried out by Smith ’s team .
Attempts to reanimate frozen sperm in 1949 were only successful when a mislabeled bottle of preservation solution was later found out to contain glycerol .
Glycerol , which lowers the freezing point of water , is widely used to this day as a cryopreservative agent and has been found in many cold - loving creatures in nature .
Dr Smith later investigated the phenomenon of supercooling , which involves techniques to prevent the formation of ice crystals in cells despite cooling them to temperatures below the freezing point of water .
Of course Mill Hill did not have a monopoly on ghoulish cryobiology experiments and related research was carried out elsewhere .
Notably a researcher at Japan ’s Kobe University , Isamu Suda , froze cat brains in solutions containing glycerol for extended periods in the 1960s .
When the brains were re-warmed - – up to two and a half years later⁠ — brainwave activity was recorded in some of the specimens .
Suda , however , was unable ascertain whether frozen cat brains dream of electric mice .
These days ethical considerations limit the scope of such research .
Animal experiments still take place at Mill Hill but only under a strict ethical review process which exhaustively balances any possible benefits of the research against actual or potential suffering to the animals involved .
It can safely be assumed that the hamster freezing experiments in their original form would be well and truly off - menu .
The potential demonstrated by frozen - hamster research has yet to be fully realised , but perhaps one day Dr. Audrey Smith ’s groundbreaking efforts will lay the foundation for powerful new medical procedures .
Indeed , a hot over - sized spoon might one day miraculously transform frozen human cadavers back into living , breathing , productive zombies to slave away in the mechanized underworld of the future .
Until that long - hoped - for day arrives , perhaps⁠ — like James Lovelock⁠ — we can console ourselves with the idea that this pioneering work has helped broaden the meaning of life .

6. Articles & Resources
WOMEN often complain that dating is like a cattle market , and a paper just published in Biology Letters by Thomas Pollet and Daniel Nettle of Newcastle University , in England , suggests they are right .
They have little cause for complaint , however , because the paper also suggests that in this particular market , it is women who are the buyers .
Mr Pollet and Dr Nettle were looking for evidence to support the contention that women choose men of high status and resources , as well as good looks .
That may sound common sense , but it was often denied by social scientists until a group of researchers who called themselves evolutionary psychologists started investigating the matter two decades ago .
Since then , a series of experiments in laboratories have supported the contention .
But as all zoologists know , experiments can only tell you so much .
Eventually , you have to look at natural populations .
And that is what Mr Pollet and Dr Nettle have done .
They have examined data from the 1910 census of the United States of America and discovered that marriage is , indeed , a market .
Moreover , as in any market , a scarcity of buyers means the sellers have to have particularly attractive goods on offer if they are to make the exchange .
The advantage of picking 1910 was that America had not yet settled down , demographically speaking .
Though the long - colonised eastern states had a sex ratio of one man to one woman , or thereabouts , in the rest of the country the old adage “ go west , young man ” had resulted in a surplus of males .
Mr Pollet and Dr Nettle were thus able to see just how picky women are , given the chance .
Rather than looking at the whole census , the two researchers relied on a sample of one person in 250 .
They then assigned the men in the sample a socioeconomic status score between zero and 96 , on a scale drawn up in 1950 ( which was as close to 1910 as they could get ) .
They showed that in states where the sexes were equal in number , 56 % of low status men were married by the age of 30 , while 60 % of high status men were .
Even in this case , then , there are women who would prefer to remain single rather than marry a deadbeat .
When there were 110 men for every 100 women ( as , for example , in Arizona ) , the women got really choosy .
In that case only 24 % of low - status men were married by 30 compared with 46 % of high - status men .
As the men went west , then , so did their marriage opportunities .
BERLIN ( Reuters ) - A German man said Thursday he feared he may have built his own tomb after a vehicle ploughed into his house for the 10th time .
“ If we stay , someone ’s eventually going to kill us .
We ’re living in a time bomb , ” Manfred Sedlazek , 59 , told Reuters .
Sedlazek is reluctant to leave the house he built himself , which is on a bend of a busy road , but said it may be his only chance of survival .
Earlier this week , a 40 - tonne truck blasted through the side of the red - brick house in the village of Karlshoefen , in northern Germany .
Sedlazek returned home from shopping to find the shattered vehicle sticking out of his living room .
Police estimated the damage at more than 100,000 euros ( $ 136,100 ) .
Nine previous smashes into the two - storey building Sedlazek shares with his wife have wrecked his kitchen , bedroom and garden , causing damage worth tens of thousands of euros .
Venezuela says it has stopped selling oil to ExxonMobil
AP
The state oil company of Venezuela said on Tuesday that it has stopped selling crude to ExxonMobil Corp in response to the US oil company 's court bid to freeze billions of dollars in Venezuelan assets .
ExxonMobil is locked in a dispute over the nationalization of its Venezuelan oil ventures that has seen Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez threaten to cut off all supply to the US .
Venezuela is currently the US ' fourth largest oil supplier .
Tuesday 's announcement by state - run Petroleos de Venezuela SA , or PDVSA , was limited to ExxonMobil , which PDVSA accused of " judicial - economic harassment " for its efforts to freeze the company 's assets in US and European courts .
PDVSA said it " has paralyzed sales of crude to ExxonMobil " and suspended commercial relations with the Irving , Texas - based company .
" The legal actions carried out by the US transnational are unnecessary ... and hostile , " PDVSA 's statement said .
The company vowed to honor any existing contracts it has with ExxonMobil for joint investments abroad , but reserved the right to terminate them if the terms of the contracts allowed .
It was unclear how much oil PDVSA supplies to ExxonMobil , the world 's largest oil company .
Both Chavez and Oil Minister Rafael Ramirez previously said the company is no longer welcome to do business in Venezuela .
The decision leaves unresolved the fate of a Chalmette , Louisiana , refinery -- a joint venture in which PDVSA and ExxonMobil are equal partners .
ExxonMobil declined to comment .
The company is challenging the Chavez government 's nationalization of one of four heavy oil projects in the Orinoco River basin .
As we ’ve noted in these pages , there is indeed much to admire about Sen .
John McCain , ranging from his courage as a POW to his extraordinary leadership in pushing for the troop “ surge ” in Iraq .
But this has not been the case with his disingenuous blustering on illegal immigration — particularly when his cosponsorship of mass - amnesty legislation with Sen.
Edward Kennedy is raised .
The Arizona Republican now says that , in the wake of last summer ’s defeat of “ comprehensive immigration reform , ” he has “ gotten the message ” that the border must be secured before the status of illegals already in the United States can be dealt with .
That ’s fair enough .
But it does n’t give Mr. McCain the right to shut people up when they ask legitimate questions about his immigration record — which includes cosponsoring legislation to permit illegal aliens to pay lower in - state tuition rates denied to some students that are in the country legally , supporting Social Security benefits for illegals and voting against an amendment last year that would have permanently barred gang members , terrorists and other criminals from the United States .
In a Jan. 5 debate , Mr. McCain declared that anyone who says he supported amnesty is “ a liar , is lying . ”
Several days before he won the New Hampshire primary , Mr. McCain was asked by a voter about criticism of his record .
The senator replied : “ I do not support , nor would I ever support , any services provided to someone who came to this country illegally , nor would I ever and [ I ] never have supported Social Security benefits for people who are in this country illegally . ”
Any assertion to the contrary , he added “ is absolutely false . ”
To be certain , there are some bright spots to Mr. McCain ’s immigration record .
Last year , for example , he voted to permit the sharing of information contained in amnesty applications if requested by a law enforcement or intelligence agency and voted to make it more difficult for illegals to benefit from sanctuary - city policies .
But time and again , he has sided with the pro-amnesty , open - borders crowd .
Following is a partial listing of some of Mr. McCain ’s troubling actions on illegal immigration :
Supporting mass amnesty .
The May 29 , 2003 , Tucson Citizen quoted Mr. McCain as stating that “ Amnesty has to be an important part of ” any immigration solution .
He was part of the bipartisan coalition that tried to pass amnesty legislation in 2006 and 2007 .
In 2006 he voted in favor of S. 2611 , legislation that would reward between 10 and 11 million illegals with amnesty if they apply for legal status and pay a $ 2,000 fine .
Supporting in - state tuition for illegal aliens .
Mr. McCain was a cosponsor of S. 774 , the Dream Act , providing in - state tuition for illegal aliens .
The legislation would have enabled illegal aliens who entered the United States before age 16 to obtain a green card and then use their newly acquired status to obtain green cards for the millions of parents who illegally brought their children with them into the United States .
Mr. McCain missed a Senate vote on the issue in October .
He said that he would have opposed it on the Senate floor had he been there to vote .
Voted to kill border fence .
In 2006 , Mr. McCain voted for an amendment to S. 2611 offered by Sen. Arlen Specter to require consultation with the Mexican government concerning the construction of fencing along the U.S. - Mexican border .
According to Numbers USA , an organization that lobbies against illegal immigration , this amendment would have effectively guaranteed that the border fence was never built .
Voted against permanently barring gang members and terrorists from the United States .
Last year , Mr. McCain voted against an amendment ( Senate Amendment 1184 ) introduced by Sen. John Cornyn , Texas Republican , that would have permanently barred gang members , terrorists , sex offenders , alien absconders , aliens convicted of domestic violence and aliens convicted of at least three DUIs from the United States .
The Cornyn Amendment was rejected on a 51 - 46 vote .
Voted in favor of Social Security benefits to illegal aliens who commit identity fraud .
In 2006 .
Mr. McCain joined with Mr. Kennedy in working to defeat an amendment by Sen. John Ensign , Nevada Republican , that would have barred Social Security credits for work being done prior to their receiving amnesty — in other words , while working under a false Social Security number .
The Ensign Amendment , ( Senate Amendment 3985 ) was defeated on a 50 - 49 vote .

Figure 2 .
If you were born between March 21 and April 19 , your astrological sign is said to be Aries .
But this was only true for a while , back when the system was set up in 600 BC .
Today , the Sun is no longer within the constellation of Aries during much of that period .
From March 11 to April 18 , the Sun is actually in the constellation of Pisces !
It 's a great conversation starter : " What 's your sign ? "
But before you ask or answer that question , consider this :
Your Zodiac sign corresponds to the position of the sun relative to constellations as they appeared more 2,200 years ago !
The science behind astrology may have its roots in astronomy but do n't confuse these two disciplines .
Astronomy can explain the position of the stars in the sky but it's up to you to determine what , if anything , their alignment signifies .
In short , as you 'll see below , your Zodiac sign is not what you think it is , and your corresponding horoscope can't be right .

The constellations of the Zodiac
The ecliptic , or the path of the sun as it's perceived from the revolving Earth , passes through the constellations that formed the Zodiac : Aries , Taurus , Gemini , Cancer , Leo , Virgo , Libra , Scorpio , Sagittarius , Capricorn , Aquarius and Pisces .
Astrologers skip a 13th constellation that also resides on the ecliptic : Ophiuchus .
Babylonian astrologers , and later the Greeks , originally determined Zodiac signs by which constellation the sun was " in " on the day you were born .
Early astronomers observed the sun traveling through the signs of the Zodiac in the course of one year , spending about a month in each .
Thus , they calculated that each constellation extends 30 degrees across the ecliptic .
Ancient astrologers grouped the 12 signs according to the classical elements .
The elements represent certain personality traits and are used in conjunction with the star signs , as well as with the position of the sun , moon and known planets at the time , to determine a horoscope , according to Astro.com :
Fire — Aries , Sagittarius , Leo ( spontaneous and impulsive )
Water — Cancer , Scorpio , Pisces ( imaginative and emotional )
Air — Libra , Aquarius , Gemini ( quick and animated , tendency to intellectualize feelings )
Earth — Capricorn , Taurus , Virgo ( quiet and slow reactions , slow to change emotionally )
However , a phenomenon called precession has altered the position of the constellations we see today and has resulted in a shift of the zodiac constellations .
Precession and astrology
The first day of spring in the Northern Hemisphere was once marked by the zero point of the Zodiac .
Astronomers call this the vernal equinox and it occurs as the ecliptic and celestial equator intersect on approximately March 21 .
Around 600 B.C. , the zero point was in Aries and was called the " first point of Aries . "
The constellation Aries encompassed the first 30 degrees of the ecliptic ; from 30 to 60 degrees was Taurus ; from 60 to 90 degrees was Gemini ; and so on for all 12 constellations of the Zodiac .
Unbeknownst to the ancient astrologers , Earth continually wobbles around its axis in a 25,800 - year cycle .
This wobble — called precession — is caused by the gravitational attraction of the moon on Earth 's equatorial bulge .
Over the past two - and - a - half millennia , this wobble has caused the intersection point between the celestial equator and the ecliptic to move west along the ecliptic by 36 degrees , or almost exactly one - tenth of the way around , to the border of Pisces and Aquarius .
This means that the signs have slipped one - tenth — or almost one whole month — of the way around the sky to the west , relative to the stars beyond .
For instance , those born between March 21 and April 19 consider themselves to be Aries .
Today , the sun is no longer within the constellation of Aries during much of that period .
From March 11 to April 18 , the sun is actually in the constellation of Pisces !
Your ' real sign '
The table below lists the dates when the sun is actually within the astronomical constellations of the Zodiac , according to modern constellation boundaries and corrected for precession ( these dates can vary a day from year to year ) .
You will most likely find that once precession is taken into account , your Zodiac sign is different .
And if you were born between Nov. 29 and Dec. 17 , your sign is actually one you never saw in the newspaper : you are an Ophiuchus !
The ecliptic passes through the constellation of Ophiuchus after Scorpius .
Check out your " real " zodiac sign , based on the sun 's current path , and compare it to the date still used by astrologers ( in parentheses ) :
Capricorn — Jan. 20 to Feb. 16 ( Dec. 23 to Jan. 21 ) Aquarius — Feb. 16 to March 11 ( Jan. 22 to Feb. 20 ) Pisces — March 11 to April 18 ( Feb. 21 to March 19 ) Aries — April 18 to May 13 ( March 20 to April 20 ) Taurus — May 13 to June 21 ( April 21 to May 21 ) Gemini — June 21 to July 20 ( May 22 to June 22 ) Cancer — July 20 to Aug. 10 ( June 23 to July 22 ) Leo — August 10 to Sept. 16 ( July 23 to Aug. 22 ) Virgo — Sept. 16 to Oct. 30 ( Aug. 23 to Sept. 22 ) Libra — Oct. 30 to Nov. 23 ( Sept. 23 to Oct. 22 ) Scorpio — Nov. 23 to Nov. 29 ( Oct. 23 to Nov. 22 ) Ophiuchus — Nov. 29 to Dec. 17 ( not included in the Zodiac ) Sagittarius — Dec. 17 to Jan. 20 ( Nov. 23 to Dec. 22 )

One in eight people over 45 unknowingly has a brain abnormality such as weakened blood vessels , dead tissue or a tumour .
That is the conclusion of a study of 2000 healthy participants , which found that a higher number than expected had an undiscovered brain lesion .
The study by Aad van der Lugt at the Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam in the Netherlands and colleagues was designed to understand the risk factors for dementia in a population of seemingly healthy people aged 45 years and above .
As part of the research the scientists scanned the participants ’ brains using magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) .
The results revealed an unexpectedly high number of abnormalities .
In one case , scientists found a large benign tumour located inside the brain of an otherwise healthy individual .
In another example , the team discovered brain haemorrhaging in a person who felt well , but had experienced minor head trauma a month before .
In total , van der Lugt and his colleagues found that 13 % had some sort of brain lesion .

Ethical dilemma
This included 145 participants ( 7 % ) who had areas of the brain in which cells had died because of blood loss .
The presence of such cell death , known to doctors as ‘ infarcts ’ , has been linked to a doubled risk of dementia and a threefold risk of stroke , says van der Lugt .
But he adds that there are no treatments for infarcts that decrease the chances of developing dementia or stroke .
The study also revealed that 1.8 % of the participants had an undetected aneurysm , and 0.9 per cent had a type of benign tumour known as a meningioma .
“ I ’m surprised that the numbers they found were so high , ” says neuroethicist Paul Wolpe at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia .
Van der Lugt says that his team notified only those subjects who had signs of a brain abnormality with a known risk and treatment , such as cancer and haemorrhage .
He notes that as brain scanning technologies improve , researchers will increasingly encounter unexpected signs of illness in study participants .
“ You have to be aware of the incidental findings and prepare for how you will deal with them , ” explains Van der Lugt .
‘ Waste of funds ’
Experts say that MRI scans are thought to be safe , but caution that screening healthy people for brain abnormalities does not make sense at present .
If the scans show a brain infarct , for example , there is nothing doctors can do to treat it .
Wolpe notes that MRI machines are extremely expensive and that using them to screen healthy people is a waste of medical funds .
“ Those are dollars that would go to an underserved , uninsured population , ” he says .
Judy Illes at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver , Canada , says screening healthy people with MRI scans can create unnecessary anxiety .
A leading expert on the ethical use of scanning technologies , Illes explains that small abnormalities such as infarcts can create needless worry .
This worry , however , can itself pose a health risk .
Ultimately , though , she says the choice lies with the individual : “ If people can afford a medical test , and they fully understand the implications of taking the test , they should not be prohibited from pursuing that desire . ”

Victoria Climbie was tortured to death partly because of witchcraft
The BBC has learned the City Parochial Foundation and the Trust for London are giving the money to help improve child protection and a family support centre .
The practice of accusing children of being possessed and then carrying out often violent exorcisms has followed some migrant communities to the UK .
Last year , a government - funded report identified 38 such cases of abuse .
Major faiths
In Democratic Republic of Congo and surrounding countries , thousands of unregulated churches have been set up mixing traditional beliefs and extreme revivalist Christianity .
In recent years the practice of accusing children of being possessed and then carrying out often violent exorcisms has become commonplace .
In Kinshasa , the capital of DRC , thousands of children live on the streets after being thrown out of their homes following claims of " Kindoki " or " Ndoki " , which means witchcraft .
Government - funded research in the UK has shown that the practice has also followed some migrant communities .
Possession claims
In June 2005 after a trial at the Old Bailey three people were sent to prison for abusing a child they claimed was possessed by evil spirits .
The child , who cannot be named , had been stabbed , beaten and had chilli peppers rubbed in her eyes .
Five years earlier eight - year - old Victoria Climbie was tortured to death - her killers attacked her in part because they believed her to be possessed .
When she died she had 128 individual injuries .
The initiative ... will enable them to contribute to the safety , quality of life and well being of children and to promote children 's rights
Bharat Mehta , City Parochial Foundation chief executive
Last year , the report funded by the Department for Education and Skills , said it was not possible to give an accurate picture of the extent of the problem .
But it concluded belief in spirit possession was common to all the major faiths .
Cases were identified in different racial and religious groups .
Project funding
The BBC has learned that two London - based charitable trusts are now so concerned about the problem they are to give £ 450,000 to four groups working to combat the problem .
The City Parochial Foundation and the Trust for London are giving the money to AFRUCA ( Africans Unite against Child Abuse ) , the UK Congolese Safeguarding Action Group , The Churches Child Protection Advisory Service and The Victoria Climbie Foundation .
The move came after African community groups approached the charities requesting help to fund grass roots projects .
The money should help pay for more education , training and research .
It will fund a support centre for families from the DRC and neighbouring countries .
" The initiative ... will enable them to contribute to the safety , quality of life and well being of children and to promote children 's rights , " according to Bharat Mehta who is chief executive of City Parochial Foundation and the Trust for London .
The charities say they are helping these groups as part of their Safeguarding Children 's Rights initiative .
But they point out that though the money is to help African children , child abuse linked to a belief in possession occurs in a range of different faith groups based in the UK .
Academy member : Sign this legal document .
By breaking this seal you agree to our terms .
If any unauthorized copies are traced back to you , you risk civil and criminal penalties .
FBI .
Prison .
Interpol .
A 17 year veteran of the Academy has had enough of being treated like a criminal .
Enough is enough - he resigns .
Successful actor and Academy member Britt Leach says he was “ so very proud to be a member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences ” when he was accepted over 17 years ago .
How things have changed .
“ I ’ve always been very happy to receive these screeners ; they have made me feel very important . ” says Britt .
“ The Academy Awards !
I would sit in front of our TV and play the tape or DVD and make notes on a legal pad ; I would write the name of a film or actor that might deserve to be nominated .
And then when the ballots came I would vote . ”
He admits to taking his “ responsibility very seriously ” – a great member it seems .
Then people got more paranoid about piracy : “ So a legal document was sent out to members of the Academy that we all had to sign .
By signing it we promised that we would never allow anybody to take possession of our screeners for any reason , and that we would be very careful with them . ”
He continues : “ Anyway , I signed it even though it made me feel strange , like a criminal or something .
Like “ Academy Member ” equals “ criminal . ”
It was insulting , but I signed it . ”
Also , the DVDs and packaging carried threatening messages , mentioning FBI , Interpol “ and detailed how the individual screeners were watermarked and how all their ‘ industry colleagues ’ had better be careful or face severe penalties . ”
Here is the rest of the sad tale , in Britt ’s own , unique words :
Fear Factor
“ I mean what would happen to me and my family if one of my screeners got into the wrong hands and was duplicated and they were able to trace it back to me ?
Would Interpol , the FBI , come and get me ?
What about my wife ?
My cats ?
It made me very worried .
I could go to prison .
I mean what if somebody broke into my apartment ?
Or what if somebody who happened to be working here one day decided to steal one of my screeners ?
I could go to prison . ”
Drastic Anti-Piracy Measures
“ I began to explore security measures .
Here ’s a surveillance camera .
It cost around $ 180.00 .
I thought about putting it above the Ã©tagÃ¨re where I store my screeners .
I would attach it to some kind of video recorder , the kind they have in convenience stores to record robberies .
But then I thought what if the power went out and the camera stopped working and a screener thief got in during the power blackout ?
So it came to me that in those situations I could really use a good guard dog .
The life and tragic death of ‘ Screener Dog ’
“ A really good German shepherd guard dog that is already trained and would kill or seriously maim a screener thief .
Such a dog costs about $ 7000.00 ( seven - thousand dollars ) .
The dog itself is n’t that expensive but the training is , and to complicate things the dog understands only German .
So I would have to learn German in order to communicate with my screener dog .
That ’s even more expenseâ€ ” for the German lessons .
But then I thought that a dog can get sick or even poisoned or made very drowsy .
I mean what if somebody who knew that I had screeners and knew also about my screener guard dog came to my apartment and broke a window and threw something in , piece of meat , with some dog sleeping stuff on it or even worse , poison ?
Put my screener guard dog to sleep or killed it , broke in and stole my screeners ?
So in addition to the trained German Shepherd I thought about a full security system for my apartment . ”
Digital locks re-enforced with physical DRM
“ A company called ADT is very good I hear so I contacted them and found that their service cost $ 850.00 for starters .
plus the safe they recommended for my screeners .
Yes , I forgot to mention that ADT recommended that I buy a safe and keep my screeners in that safe until I wanted to watch one , return it immediately after watching .
And a good screener - sized safe costs between five and seven - hundred dollars .
So that ’s the cost of a surveillance camera , guard dog , German lessons , a safe , plus ADT , making a total of $ 8730.00 as an initial , screener - security investment plus my Academy dues of $ 250 per year .
And who knows how much yearly maintenance of all that would cost .
Dog food , vet bills . ”
DRM Puts Britt on the brink
“ That ’s a lot of money for us , We live on my actor ’s pension and Social Security plus Cathy ’s paycheck .
So I was thinking that maybe I would need to get a job to support screener security and Academy membership .
And it seemed that going back to acting might be a choice , but at my age the only parts open for me are for very sick people or cadavers .
And there are already so many old character actors out there looking for those jobs that I do n’t think that I could make enough money to support screener security and Academy membership , too much competition .
So acting was out .
And anyway we only have one car and Cathy needs it to get to work so it would n’t be available to get me to interviews .
$ 9000.00 for starters plus yearly maintenance .
I just could n’t figure out how to do it .
Even if we moved to a smaller apartment .
Even if took a job managing an apartment building again ; I just could n’t figure how to do it . ”
DRM woes end in misery for Britt , huge loss for the Academy
“ And I have reluctantly come to a decision .
So that I wo n’t contribute to film piracy by inadvertently allowing one of my screeners to fall into the wrong hands , pirating hands , thereby costing the film industry millions of dollars ( not to mention putting me in prison ) , I will not renew my membership in the Academy .
It makes me sad , but I ’m also happy in a way .
Because without those screeners being delivered to my vulnerable little home , with its multiple and human inefficiencies , I know that it will no longer be possible for me to harm the studios , my industry colleagues and the Academy .
Yes , so by resigning from the Academy I will contribute to saving the film industry , and I have to be happy about that . ”
I guessed they dumped DRM just a little too late to keep Britt .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Celebrity bounty hunter Duane “ Dog ” Chapman , whose reality TV show has been pulled from the air indefinitely after he used a racial slur , says he still loves the son who sold the tape of his private remark .
File photo shows Duane ' Dog ' Chapman ( L ) testifying him before the International Affairs Committee of the Hawaii State Legislature in Honolulu , March 7 , 2007 , as he tries to gain support for his fight against extradition to Mexico .

Cable channel A&E took the popular show , “ Dog the Bounty Hunter , ” off its schedule for the foreseeable future after a private phone call in which Chapman used an offensive term to describe his son ’s black girlfriend hit the Internet .
Chapman said his son , Tucker Chapman , had sold the tape of the conversation that dates back to March to The National Enquirer but he did not know why .
“ He will not talk to me , ” said Chapman , who has 12 children and has been married five times .
“ His mother ’s in on it with him .
I have been away from her since the ‘ 80 s so now she is like getting even , ” he told the Larry King Live show on CNN on Wednesday night .
A teary Chapman , who has apologized repeatedly since the tape was made public and promised to make amends , said he had used the epithet “ nigger ” on a heated call with his son while admitting he was probably interfering in his life .
Chapman said Tucker had been sent to prison at the age of 18 and served four years of a 20 year sentence for armed robbery before being released on parole .
“ I tried to take control of his life ( after this ) , ” said Chapman , himself an ex-con .
“ I heard this girl was maybe not being the best for Tucker -- and I ’ll leave it like that -- so I tried to interfere .
“ I do n’t care if she is black at all .
He ’s on parole for a 20 year sentence and if he messes up he goes back . ”
Honolulu - based Chapman , 54 , who says he is a devout Christian , made no comment on reports that his son sold the tape for $ 15,000 .
“ All I want him to know is that I love him very much , ” he said .
A&E has said no decision has been made to cancel the program , which is shown in more than 10 countries , and the network will review the situation again later this month .
Chapman , with his trademark scraggly long blond hair and leather wardrobe , rose to fame after his 2003 tracking and capture of Max Factor heir and serial rapist Andrew Luster in Mexico .
This led to an offer for a reality TV show following him and his “ posse ” tracking down people who jump bail .

A fancy new miniaturized plasma propulsion system being developed at Oklahoma State University promises some exciting new Unmanned Ariel Vehicle spy plane designs for the folks at DARPA .
The engine is about the size of a cigarette , contains no moving parts , and will be build into planes as small as 6 - inches long , which soldiers can carry in packs of six or so and deploy as a swarm of inquisitive Daniel Craigs .
The planes should be able to manage indoors and urban areas .
No word on when these will be spying on a homeland security threat near you , but the project is still in the early stages .

Flowing Liquids on Titan
This synthetic aperture radar image was obtained by the Cassini spacecraft on its pass by Titan 's south pole on Dec. 20 , 2007 .
This image is centered near 76.5 south , 32.5 west and covers an area of 620 kilometers by 270 kilometers ( 385 miles by 170 miles ) .
Abundant evidence for flowing liquids is seen in this image , from sinuous , wide river channels to shorter , more chaotic drainage patterns .
The extremely dissected , rugged terrain in the southern portion of the image has been very eroded by flowing liquids , probably from a combination of methane rainstorms and sapping ( subsurface methane rising to erode the surface ) .
The broad valleys seen in the southern portion of the image are particularly intriguing , as they appear to be flat - floored , filled with smooth material , and in places have sharply defined , relatively straight sides .
Valleys such as this can be formed by tectonic processes , such as rifting , or by erosional processes , caused by flowing liquid or ice .
The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA , the European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency .
NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory , a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena , manages the mission for NASA 's Science Mission Directorate , Washington , D.C. The Cassini orbiter was designed , developed and assembled at JPL .
The radar instrument was built by JPL and the Italian Space Agency , working with team members from the United States and several European countries .

Most people know it from experience :
After so many hours of being awake , your brain feels unable to absorb any more -- and several hours of sleep will refresh it .
Now new research from the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health clarifies this phenomenon , supporting the idea that sleep plays a critical role in the brain 's ability to change in response to its environment .
This ability , called plasticity , is at the heart of learning .
The UW - Madison scientists showed by several measures that synapses -- nerve cell connections central to brain plasticity -- were very strong when rodents had been awake and weak when they had been asleep .
The new findings reinforce the UW - Madison researchers ' highly - debated hypothesis about the role of sleep .
They believe that people sleep so that their synapses can downsize and prepare for a new day and the next round of learning and synaptic strengthening .
The human brain expends up to 80 percent of its energy on synaptic activity , constantly adding and strengthening connections in response to all kinds of stimulation , explains study author Chiara Cirelli , associate professor of psychiatry .
Given that each of the millions of neurons in the human brain contains thousands of synapses , this energy expenditure " is huge and ca n't be sustained . "
" We need an off - line period , when we are not exposed to the environment , to take synapses down , " Cirelli say .
" We believe that 's why humans and all living organisms sleep .
Without sleep , the brain reaches a saturation point that taxes its energy budget , its store of supplies and its ability to learn further . "

To test the theory , researchers conducted both molecular and electro - physiological studies in rats to evaluate synaptic potentiation , or strengthening , and depression , or weakening , following sleeping and waking times .
In one set of experiments , they looked at brain slices to measure the number of specific receptors , or binding sites , that had moved to synapses .
" Recent research has shown that as synaptic activity increases , more of these glutamatergic receptors enter the synapse and make it bigger and stronger , " explains Cirelli .
The Wisconsin group was surprised to find that rats had an almost 50 percent receptor increase after a period of wakefulness compared to rats that had been asleep .
In a second molecular experiment , the scientists examined how many of the receptors underwent phosphorylation , another indicator of synaptic potentiation .
They found phosphorylation levels were much higher during waking than sleeping .
The results were the same when they measured other enzymes that are typically active during synaptic potentiation .
To strengthen their case , Cirelli and colleagues also performed studies in live rats to evaluate electrical signals reflecting synaptic changes at different times .
This involved stimulating one side of each rat 's brain with an electrode following waking and sleeping and then measuring the " evoked response , " which is similar to an EEG , on another side .
advertisement
The studies again showed that , for the same levels of stimulation , responses were stronger following a long period of waking and weaker after sleep , suggesting that synapses must have grown stronger .
" Taken together , these molecular and electro - physiological measures fit nicely with the idea that our brain circuits get progressively stronger during wakefulness and that sleep helps to recalibrate them to a sustainable baseline , " says Cirelli .
The theory she and collaborator Dr. Giulio Tononi , professor of psychiatry , have developed , called the synaptic homeostasis hypothesis , runs against the grain of what many scientists currently think about how sleep affects learning .
The most popular notion these days , says Cirelli , is that during sleep synapses are hard at work replaying the information acquired during the previous waking hours , consolidating that information by becoming even stronger .
" That 's different from what we think , " she says .
" We believe that learning occurs only when we are awake , and sleep 's main function is to keep our brains and all its synapses lean and efficient . "
This research was published in the Jan. 20 , 2008 , online version of Nature Neuroscience .

An Air Canada plane was forced to make an unexpected landing in Ireland on Monday after the co-pilot became ill in the cockpit , the airline said Tuesday .
But Air Canada would not confirm media and passenger reports that the co-pilot had needed psychiatric care , forcing the plane to land at the Shannon airport , west of Limerick .
The plane had taken off from Toronto and was scheduled to land in England .
Canadian passenger Seàn Finucane told CBC
News that the co-pilot started to act distraught about an hour before the flight carrying 146 passengers was scheduled to land at London 's Heathrow Airport .
" He was yelling loudly at times , " Finucane said , explaining that the co-pilot 's voice was clear and he did n't sound drunk .
" When they tried to put his shoes on later , for example , he swore and threatened people …
He was swearing and asking for God , and was very , very distressed . "
Airline spokesman Peter Fitzpatrick said Air Canada can't provide details about personnel issues .
He would only confirm that the captain made the decision to divert to Shannon shortly before 8 a.m. local time .
" The aircraft landed without incident , " Fitzpatrick said .
" At no time were the safety of the passengers or crew in question . "
The Irish Independent reported that the co-pilot of Flight 848 was forcibly taken off the Boeing 767 airplane by fellow crew members and a passenger who is a member of the Canadian Forces .
The newspaper , quoting officials at Shannon International Airport , said the co-pilot was admitted to the psychiatric unit of the Ennis General Hospital in nearby County Clare .
Air Canada confirmed the co-pilot is in hospital , but would not comment on what type of treatment he is receiving or when he might be released .
Passengers taken to hotels
Air Canada said the 146 passengers on board were allowed to disembark shortly after the incident .
Patrick Flynn , a freelance journalist in Shannon , said passengers were taken to local hotels after the plane landed .
A second Air Canada plane arrived at Shannon airport from London 's Heathrow Airport less than five hours later with a replacement crew , said Flynn .
Shannon Airport Authority spokesperson Eugene Pratt said the flight arrived in London about eight hours later than scheduled .
" An Air Canada crew flew in here yesterday and took the aircraft on to London to complete the trip , " he said .
Transport Canada will conduct interviews
Pratt , who called the incident " irregular , " said about a dozen flights end up diverted to Shannon each year because of technical , mechanical or health problems .
He said it was n't an emergency landing , but paramedics and a doctor were called to the airport to meet the plane when it landed and assess the co-pilot .
Transport Canada will be interviewing the flight crew and the airline , spokeswoman Lucie Vignola said Tuesday , noting that it appears proper procedures were followed .
She said commercial pilots must undergo medical checkups every six months under the requirements of their licence .
Ever wonder why Microsoft has n't released an HDMI cable for the Xbox 360 , or whether the AV port was really capable of digital out ?
Well , here 's your answer : we landed pictures of what appears to be the second Xbox 360 -- the Xbox 360 v2 , if you will -- codenamed Zephyr .
( The original Xbox 360 , if you recall , was codenamed Xenon .)
The long rumored about and awaited update to the console wo n't just feature a new , cooler 65nm processor , it 's also finally added an HDMI port for full digital 1080 p pleasure , as well as a 120 GB drive , just what the doctor ordered .
The 120 GB drive may or may not come bundled with the kit , we do n't yet know , just as we also do n't yet know how much a Zephyr 360 is going to run ( we imagine it 'll go for the same price as currently so they can keep up a little on their expanding margin ) .
But our very kind Xbox insider seemed happy to let us know we'd be able to get them " soon . "
If there 's one thing I love , it 's academics who take on the work of investigative journalism , because they are dogged .
This has been a bad week for the SSRI antidepressants .
First there 's the stuff you already know : bad data got buried .
In a cracking new analysis of the " publication bias " in the literature , a group of academics this week published a paper in the New England Journal of Medicine which listed all the trials on SSRIs that had ever been formally registered with the Food and Drug Administration , and then went to look for the same trials in the academic literature .
Thirty - seven studies were assessed by the FDA as positive and , with one exception , every single one of those positive trials got properly written up and published .
Meanwhile , 22 studies that had negative or iffy results were simply not published at all , and 11 were written up and published in a way that described them as having a positive outcome .
You 're a sophisticated reader , so you understand this does n't mean that they 're necessarily rubbish drugs , but you also understand that this is dodgy behaviour , all the same .
That 's the easy one .
The second paper is more interesting .
Over the past few decades , we have been subjected to a relentless medicalisation of everyday life by people who want to sell us sciencey solutions .
Quacks from the $ 56bn ( £ 28.26 bn ) international food supplement industry want you to believe that intelligence needs fish oil , and that obesity is just your body 's way of crying out for their chromium pills ( " to help balance sugar metabolism " ) .
Similarly , quacks from the $ 600 bn pharma industry sell the idea that depression is caused by low serotonin levels in the brain , and so you need drugs which raise the serotonin levels in your brain : you need SSRI antidepressants , which are " selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors " .
That 's the serotonin hypothesis .
It was always shaky , and the evidence now is hugely contradictory .
I 'm not giving that lecture here , but as a brief illustration , there is a drug called tianeptine - a selective serotonin reuptake enhancer , not an inhibitor - and yet research shows this drug is a pretty effective treatment for depression too .
Meanwhile , in popular culture the depression / serotonin theory is proven and absolute , because it was never about research , or theory , it was about marketing , and journalists who pride themselves on never pushing pills or the hegemony will still blindly push the model until the cows come home .
Which brings us on to our second new SSRI study .
Two academics , a lecturer and a professor of neuroanatomy , decided to chase journalists , in the style of this column - or rather , in the style of this column on crack - and fired off multiple emails , demanding unrealistic levels of referencing from doubtless irritated and baffled hacks .
They proudly document their work with an excessive number of examples , and I will pick just a few .
" In the New York Times ( 12/31/06 ) , Michael Kimmelman wrote about the life and work of Joseph Schildkraut , one of the founders of the chemical theory of depression .
The Times reporter stated , ' A groundbreaking paper that he published in 1965 suggested that naturally occurring chemical imbalances in the brain must account for mood swings , which pharmaceuticals could correct , a hypothesis that proved to be right [ italics added ] . ' "
The profs gave chase .
" Emails to the author requesting a citation to support his statement went unanswered . "
A victory for the noble pedantry .
" In another New York Times article ( 6/19/07 ) , ' On the Horizon , Personalized Depression Drugs , ' Richard Friedman , the chairman of psychopharmacology at the Weill Cornell Medical College , stated : ' For example , some depressed patients who have abnormally low levels of serotonin respond to SSRIs , which relieve depression , in part , by flooding the brain with serotonin . ' "
They chased , and they give no quarter .
" For his evidence he supplied a 2000 paper by Nestler titled Neurobiology of Depression , which focuses on the hypothalamic pituitary system , but not on serotonin . "
The serotonin hypothesis will always be a winner in popular culture , even when it has flailed in academia , because it speaks to us of a simple , abrogating explanation , and plays into our notions of a crudely dualistic world where there can only be weak people , or uncontrollable , external , molecular pressures .
As they said in the Pittsburgh Tribune Review ( 4/2/07 ) : " It 's not a personal deficit , but something that needs to be looked at as a chemical imbalance . "
The real world is more complicated than this simple dichotomy .
But when you probe the evidence for simple fables about serotonin stories in popular culture , you 'll find " the quote was attributed to a psychiatric nurse practitioner , the author did not respond to emails , and the nurse 's email was not available " .

The issue of the future , coming down on us now like a steam train , is of course the environment , the double hammer blows of climate change and peak oil .
Energy , weather and human misery are the factors that will define our lives for decades to come .
You can cancel your newspaper , those are the only four words you need to know .
Linked to this , but compounding it in frightening ways , is the imminent demise of the United States economy .
In fact the whisper , the subplot in economist circles , was that this election was one to lose .
That whoever inherited Australia in 2007 inherited a coming economic collapse in globalised trade that would suck Australia and much of the rest of the world down with it .
For two years now the best predictions have been that the subprime meltdown would act as merely the detonator of a much larger explosive charge created long ago by US consumer debt , concealed by Chinese and Arab investment in keeping that great hungry maw that is America sucking in what it could not begin to pay for .
The avalanche - like fall of US house prices will be closely followed by the same in linked economies worldwide , and presage a harsh and very different world than the one we have lived in .
In short , the party is over .
We are a civilisation in collapse .
Labor is the right party to manage this .
Despite the widespread belief after years of cynical politics that politicians are all the same , Rudd and Gillard are not in power for power 's sake .
I am willing to stake my 30 years as a psychologist on this , but I think many observers have also come to this conclusion .
Kevin and Julia , as Australia already calls them , want to make this country a better place for the people in it .
In the coming times of deprivation , they have the value systems that will be needed to care for the sudden rise in poverty , stress , and need .
They also have the unity .
So what will be the new polarity in future elections ?
It 's the ecology , stupid .
The Greens will emerge as the new opposition , though this will take probably two election cycles .
By the 2010 election , 20 per cent will vote Green , simply because peak oil and climate catastrophe will have proven them right , and thinking people will see the need for austerity now for our children 's tomorrow .
The Liberal Party will be lucky to attract 30 per cent , which is the habitual , rusted - on portion of the community that thinks greed is good .
By 2014 , we will have a struggle between a new left and right - Labor and Green - and the issue will be simply how green , how to balance the need for a much simpler and more communal kind of life , with the need to give people comfort and amenity now .
This issue will continue to define life for the rest of this century .
Climate change will bring horrific costs this century unless a global effort is rallied in a way that has never been done before to regulate our gluttonous use of the air and water .
Perhaps a billion lives are at risk , let alone 2 to 3 billion refugees , as agriculture and water supplies collapse across southern Asia and elsewhere , and producer countries , like Australia , find they can barely feed themselves .
The big lie of Liberal supremacy was economic management .
In fact , they knew how to generate income , but not how to spend it .
We could have been building what Europe built in this past decade - superb hospitals , bullet trains , schools and training centres , low cost public transport of luxurious quality , magnificent public housing .
We pissed it all away on tax giveaways and consumer goods .
On bloated homes that we will not be able to cool or heat , or sell , and cars we wo n't be able to afford to drive .
A party based on self interest may evaporate along with our rivers and lakes , and have no role to play in a world where we co-operate or die .

Dem turnout stretches ballot supply in NH
New Hampshire voters were shattering turnout records Tuesday especially in the Democratic presidential primary , sending elections officials scrambling to find enough ballots to meet the demand .
" We 're going to have historic turnout , there 's no doubt about that , " Pia Carusone , communications director for the New Hampshire Democratic Party , told RAW STORY .
Carusone said she was unaware of details regarding reports that polling locations were running out of Democratic ballots .
ABC News ' Political Radar blog reported that officials were concerned about running out of ballots in at least four cities and towns .
Party officials were " just learning as you are about the ballots , " Carusone said by phone Tuesday afternoon .
" I 'm just hearing about it as you are . "
Phones at the New Hampshire Secretary of State 's office were busy Tuesday afternoon .
CNN reported that extra ballots were being sent to several polling locations .
" The towns that are calling now are experiencing heavy turnout , and see their piles of ballots starting to drop at a rate faster than they 're comfortable with , " Deputy Secretary of State Dave Scanlan told MSNBC .
" They 're also stating to us that it 's the Democratic ballots that have them more concerned than the Republican ballots . "
New Hampshire 's secretary of state predicted a half - million voters would turn out Tuesday , breaking previous turnout records .
It was unclear whether even that prediction would be too modest .
" We 're certainly encouraged , " Scanlan told MSNBC 's First Read , " and if it goes beyond what the secretary predicted , that 's great . "

Pay per click is the modern internet marketing tool .
The pay per click is an advertising service offered by online search engines for free of cost , but initially , you have to pay some preset sum , when any visitor of search engine clicks your ads .
In pay per click advertising , the merchant pays a commission each time someone clicks on an ad that directs them to the merchant 's website .
First you need to consider some important factors before deciding on a pay per click advertising contract .
How much it costs varies and depends on several factors , particularly the keywords selected , number of clicks the ad generates and the terms of the contract .
Determine how much you are willing to pay for each click , depending on your advertising budget .
Other factors to consider when selecting a contract is whether you want to pay initial set up fees or not and pay for clicks ahead of time or not .
The requirements vary , depending on the company you select for your pay per click advertising efforts .
Once you have selected the program that best fits your needs , you will need to set up the ads .
For pay per click advertising , you generally have approximately 125 characters to convey your advertising message .
This means you will need to write ads that are concise and convey your message to your target audience , generally with a benefit of your service or uniqueness of your products .
Pay per click service can be expensive for your business , as mostly it depends upon your biding , the higher the biding , the higher will be the rank in search engine , but once anybody else made a bid higher than yours , your position will be lowered in the search engine results , so there is a constant need to increase your bid after some time to stick on your position .
This will surely increase your cost for bearing this service , but one interesting thing about this PPC ad campaign is that , you can chose as many keywords as you like and there will be no extra cost for that , there is no doubt that some keywords are more effective than others , so you should make a significant research to get highest possible efficient keywords .
Enough is enough !
I ’m not a Ron Paul supporter , however I do look upon him as the next best candidate compared to Dennis Kucinich , but these relentless attacks and marginalizing of Ron Paul by Fox News are now bordering on the absurd .
Fox is complaining their vehicles were vandalized in New Hampshire because of “ anti- Fox hatred . ”
The below story appeared on NewsMax , another vocal Republican mouthpiece , and the statements made by Bill O’Reilly are blatant spin and lies , fodder for the rabid right - wing element in America that still consider Faux News to be a reliable news source :
O’Reilly : Fox Vandalized , Attacked Friday , January 11 , 2008 12:10 PM
By : Jim Meyers Bill O’Reilly says all Fox News employees are now “ cautious ” after several run-ins during coverage of the New Hampshire primary that were fueled by “ anti- Fox hatred . ”
In his syndicated column out this week , O’Reilly described attacks on Fox that border on violence .
MUCH MORE
I do n’t condone or advocate vandalism , but let ’s face it , Fox News , and especially Bill O’Riley have been pushing the propaganda and spin machine so hard these past few months that people are tiring of their constant lies and political spin .
Fox News arbitrarily refused to allow Ron Paul the chance to participate in a Presidential debate - and his supporters became angry and sold - off thousands , if not hundreds of thousands of shares of Newscorp , Herr Murdoch ’s coveted empire - and now Fox appears to be out for blood !
O’Riley continues his unsubstantiated rant and made this claim :
O’Reilly says the anger towards
Fox is due to the network ’s ratings success , which has created “ a bitterness unprecedented in the U.S. press .
Excuse me , but O’Lie -ry is actually suggesting people are angry because of the success of the Faux network , and you ’ll notice that he said network , not Fox News itself !
Fox
News is beginning to be the laughing stock of the world , and only those so blinded by propaganda and spin actually believe anything they say - and their success as a network now has little to do with the news department .
Even the success as a network is contrary to beliefs stated on Fox News itself , and Fox survives by airing the raunchiest ( and most popular ) late night entertainment on TV , all the while espousing “ Christian morals ” and talking about “ compassionate conservatism ” , which has proven to be an oxymoron , while they rake in the cash from those that enjoy racy , adult themed late night entertainment .
Can Rupert Murdoch and Fox News spell H Y P O C R I T E ???
O’Lie -ry goes on to add the frosting on the cake by claiming :
O’Reilly also detailed in his column an encounter he had at a Barack Obama rally , which was aired on “ The O’Reilly Factor . ”
O’Reilly described an Obama staffer ’s attempt to block his camera crew “ a blatant assault on press freedom . ”
Boston.com characterizes the event in an entirely different manner , and for all practical purposes , unless you believe the press has a right to manhandle people because they believe they have a right to a certain camera shot , then Bill O’Lie - ry actually committed simple assault on the Obama staff member by daring to exert force in a case when Presidential candidate Obama was under the protection of the Secret Service !
Of course , in keeping with the spirit of spinning and lying their way out of anything they do n’t approve of , Faux News provides an account of the actual events that is light - years from the facts , and their allegations are truly ridiculous to the point of being downright pathetic !
Bill O’Reilly in confrontation at Obama event By Sasha Issenberg , Globe Staff NASHUA , N.H. — Aides to Barack Obama , one of two candidates to travel with Secret Service protection , have a policy of not discussing issues related to the senator ’s security — unless the potential threat is conservative talk show host Bill O’Reilly .
Secret Service officials separated O’Reilly and Obama aide Marvin Nicholson after the Fox News Channel personality grabbed Nicholson on a post - speech rope line in a high - school gym here .
According to a witness , O’Reilly reached with two hands for Nicholson — who at 6 - foot - 8 had a slight height advantage over O’Reilly — because he stood between O’Reilly ’s cameraman and Obama as the newsman called out for the candidate ’s attention .

SANTA CRUZ , CA -- In the race to make solar cells cheaper and more efficient , many researchers and start - up companies are betting on new designs that exploit nanostructures -- materials engineered on the scale of a billionth of a meter .
Using nanotechnology , researchers can experiment with and control how a material generates , captures , transports , and stores free electrons -- properties that are important for the conversion of sunlight into electricity .
Two nanotech methods for engineering solar cell materials have shown particular promise .
One uses thin films of metal oxide nanoparticles , such as titanium dioxide , doped with other elements , such as nitrogen .
Another strategy employs quantum dots -- nanosize crystals -- that strongly absorb visible light .
These tiny semiconductors inject electrons into a metal oxide film , or " sensitize " it , to increase solar energy conversion .
Both doping and quantum dot sensitization extend the visible light absorption of the metal oxide materials .
Combining these two approaches appears to yield better solar cell materials than either one alone does , according to Jin Zhang , professor of chemistry at the University of California , Santa Cruz .
Zhang led a team of researchers from California , Mexico , and China that created a thin film doped with nitrogen and sensitized with quantum dots .
When tested , the new nanocomposite material performed better than predicted -- as if the functioning of the whole material was greater than the sum of its two individual components .
" We have discovered a new strategy that could be very useful for enhancing the photo response and conversion efficiency of solar cells based on nanomaterials , " said Zhang .
" We initially thought that the best we might do is get results as good as the sum of the two , and maybe if we did n't make this right , we 'd get something worse .
But surprisingly , these materials were much better . "
The group 's findings were reported in the Journal of Physical Chemistry in a paper posted online on January 4 .
Lead author of the paper was Tzarara Lopez - Luke , a graduate student visiting in Zheng 's lab who is now at the Instituto de Investigaciones Metalurgicas , UMSNH , Morelia , Mexico .
Zhang 's team characterized the new nanocomposite material using a broad range of tools , including atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) , transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) , Raman spectroscopy , and photoelectrochemistry techniques .
They prepared films with thicknesses between 150 and 1100 nanometers , with titanium dioxide particles that had an average size of 100 nanometers .
They doped the titanium dioxide lattice with nitrogen atoms .
To this thin film , they chemically linked quantum dots made of cadmium selenide for sensitization .
The resulting hybrid material offered a combination of advantages .
Nitrogen doping allowed the material to absorb a broad range of light energy , including energy from the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum .
The quantum dots also enhanced visible light absorption and boosted the photocurrent and power conversion of the material .
When compared with materials that were just doped with nitrogen or just embedded with cadmium selenide quantum dots , the nanocomposite showed higher performance , as measured by the " incident photon to current conversion efficiency " ( IPCE ) , the team reported .
The nanocomposite 's IPCE was as much as three times greater than the sum of the IPCEs for the two other materials , Zhang said .
" We think what 's happening is that it 's easier for the charge to hop around in the material , " he explained .
" That can only happen if you have both the quantum dot sensitizing and the nitrogen doping at the same time . "
The nanocomposite material could be used not only to enhance solar cells , but also to serve as part of other energy technologies .
One of Zhang 's long - term goals is to marry a highly efficient solar cell with a state - of - the - art photoelectrochemical cell .
Such a device could , in theory , use energy generated from sunlight to split water and produce hydrogen fuel ( see earlier press release at http://press. ucsc. edu/ text. asp?pid= 712 ) .
The nanocomposite material could also potentially be useful in devices for converting carbon dioxide into hydrocarbon fuels , such as methane .
The new strategy for engineering solar cell materials offers a promising path for Zhang 's lab to explore for years to come .
" I 'm very excited because this work is preliminary and there 's a lot of optimizing we can do now , " Zhang noted .
" We have three materials - - or three parameters -- that we can play with to make the energy levels just right . "
In essence , the team has been trying to manipulate materials so that when sunlight strikes them , the free electrons generated can easily move from one energy level to another -- or jump across the different materials -- and be efficiently converted to electricity .
" What we 're doing is essentially ' band - gap engineering . '
We 're manipulating the energy levels of the nanocomposite material so the electrons can work more efficiently for electricity generation , " Zhang said .
" If our model is correct , we 're making a good case for this kind of strategy . "

Christine Beatty is Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick 's Secret Affair ( Photos )
Christine Beatty and Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick
Detroit Mayorand his chief of staff , , have been caught red - handed in a lie about the nature of their relationship .
Making matters worse , the two lied under oath , exposing them to felony perjury charges .
After Deputy Police Chief Gary Brown filed suit accusing Kilpatrick of retaliating against him because of his role in an internal affairs investigation of the mayor 's security team that potentially could have exposed an affair , Mayor Kilpatrick and Christine Beatty denied having a sexual relationship during the trial .
After months of investigations , records of text messages between the two prove otherwise .
Examining over 14,000 text messages , the Free Press discovered the mayor and Beatty were exchanging personal messages almost daily .
Both were married at the time .
Beatty has since divorced .
" I 'm madly in love with you , " Kilpatrick wrote on Oct. 3 , 2002 .
" I hope you feel that way for a long time , " Beatty answered .
" In case you have n't noticed , I am madly in love with you , too ! "
Other texts contain sexual content , like this exchange on April 8 , 2003 : Beatty : " And , did you miss me , sexually ? "
Kilpatrick : " Hell yeah !
You could n't tell .
I want some more . "
" I 've been dreaming all day about having you all to myself for 3 days .
Relaxing , laughing , talking , sleeping and making love . "
On Oct. 16 , 2002 , Kilpatrick wrote Beatty
If found to have committed perjury , Kilpatrick and Beatty could face up to 15 years in state prison .
I doubt Mayor Kilpatrick will be running for re-election .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Oil is selling for nearly $ 100 a barrel .
Gasoline is near $ 3 a gallon .
Oil companies are swimming in cash .
But these record - high prices are both a boom and a burden for Big Oil .
Big oil companies refine more crude than they produce .
That means they must buy crude to refine at market prices , which are now at record highs .
Gasoline prices , meanwhile , have only made modest gains .
To be sure , producing the stuff has made big money for big oil over the last few years .
Although it costs a lot less than $ 90 a barrel to pump , it 's still not as cheap as you 'd think .
The world 's cheapest oil to extract comes from Saudi Arabia and costs $ 2 a barrel .
But that oil , over 8 million barrels a day , is pumped mostly by the Saudi national oil company and is largely off - limits to Western oil firms .
For Western firms , it can cost as little as $ 5 to $ 7 a barrel to pump the most easily accessible oil from places like Venezuela or Azerbaijan , said Fadel Gheit , a senior energy analyst at Oppenheimer .
The costs do n't stop there .
On top of the $ 5 - $ 7 production costs , there 's also the the money it took to build the pumping facility .
At several billion dollars a pop , capital costs typically add another $ 5 to $ 7 a barrel .
And that 's the cost of producing oil in the cheapest regions of the world .
Factor in expensive fields like the deep water Gulf of Mexico , the tar sands of Canada or water - laden output of Texas , and the average production and capital cost is somewhere in the low teens to mid $ 20s , said Gheit .
Still not bad , considering the selling price .
Enter government .
Gheit said taxes and royalty payments can range from 40 percent of profits in places like the United States to 90 percent or more in places like Russia or Libya .
" It 's a very complex equation , " he said of trying to figure out just how much it costs oil companies to produce oil .
But if production were just the only concern , big oil companies like Exxon Mobil ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) , Chevron ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) and ConocoPhillips ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) that both pump and refine oil would have seen record profits in the latest quarter .
Unfortunately for these companies , they are also buyers of expensive crude , not just sellers .
In fact , they refine more oil than they pump themselves .
A lot more .
Exxon refined 5.6 million barrels a day in the third quarter 2007 , but only pumped 2.5 million barrels a day .
Chevron sold 3.5 million barrels a day of refined products but only pumped 1.7 million barrels of oil .
Conoco refined 3.1 million barrels but pumped just 774,000 .
These companies do n't get a deal on the extra oil they must buy to refine , analysts said .
" Generally speaking , they have to pay fair market , " said Peter Tertzakian , chief energy economist at ARC Financial , a Calgary - based private equity firm .
" If the refineries need it , they have to buy it . "
Furthermore , Tertzakian said , accounting rules prevent the production side of a big oil company from giving the refining side a deal on crude .
Other rules prevent the movement of crude from one country to another at below - market rates - rules largely designed so oil companies can't skimp on their tax obligations .
" They are subject to market forces , they pay like everybody else , " said Gheit .
That 's party why oil companies saw profits decline so much last quarter , when crude oil costs rose but gasoline failed to keep up .
Crude oil prices went from about $ 71 a barrel at the start of the quarter to more than $ 81 a barrel at the end .
Gasoline prices , meanwhile , fell to a national average of $ 2.81 a gallon from $ 2.95 , according to numbers from the Energy Information Administration .
As a result , Exxon reported at 10 percent drop in profits compared to the same time last year , while Chevron fell 26 percent and Conoco lost 5 percent .
Of course , with Exxon walking away with over $ 9 billion in profit for the last three months , it is unlikely anyone will lose sleep over how much the company must pay for oil .
Ari Derfel leads a trashy life .
He just wants to remind everyone else that they do , too .
The 35 - year - old Berkeley caterer said he has saved every piece of trash he has generated over the past year to see how much garbage one person creates .
In his case , it was about 96 cubic feet .
The experiment began as a way to examine his own consumption habits , Derfel said , but grew into a statement about consumerism and the environment .
" When we throw something away , what does ' away ' mean ? "
Derfel said .
" There 's no such thing as ' away . ' "
The refuse - including every tissue , receipt , food wrapper and plastic bottle - lies in bins in the kitchen and living room of Derfel 's apartment .
He composts his food scraps .
Derfel said he eventually hopes to donate his accumulated waste to a sculptor .

For the red-spotted newt ( Notophthalmus viridescens ) , a protein called nAG could be key in its ability to re-grow limbs after amputation .
Limb loss for a salamander is nothing to get up in arms about — they just re-grow a new one .
But how ?
One molecule could be behind their remarkable limb - sprouting ability , according to a new study that could also grow the field of human regenerative medicine .
The ability to conjure up an arm or leg after amputation works only in Hollywood , like when boy - wizard Harry Potter endures the pain of re-growing arm bones .
Real regenerative medicine lags far behind fiction .
While some political barriers to the stem - cell research required in regenerative medicine have been eliminated and private stem - cell funding has stepped up , the many scientific unknowns of regenerating limbs and organs have hindered progress .
A few years ago , a man in Cincinnati who accidentally severed a fingertip applied a substance made from pig bladder thought to promote tissue regeneration .
The tip of his finger grew back within six weeks , though this is a single case and just a bit of the finger grew back .
The new study , published in the Nov. 2 issue of the journal Science , shows a protein called nAG helps to stimulate the proliferation of stem cells that ultimately form new limbs in red-spotted newts ( Notophthalmus viridescens ) , a type of salamander .
Limb loss
Stem cells have the ability to differentiate , or specialize into various tissues needed to create body parts .
When a newt or other amphibian loses a limb , cells in the region regress to a time when they were just naive cells that had not yet specialized , a process called de-differentiation .
These stem cells grow and divide at the tip of the stump ( where the limb was once attached ) to form a larger mass of cells called the blastema .
" Those cells grow and divide and they give rise to the structures that have been amputated , " said study team member Jeremy Brockes of the University College London .
" So if you amputate at the wrist , those cells will give rise to a hand ; if you amputate at the shoulder , they 'll give rise to an arm . "
Brockes , lead author Anoop Kumar of the University College London and colleagues ran experiments in which they chopped off red-spotted newts ' limbs and the attached nerves .
The nerves are needed to stimulate the production of the nAG protein , so the nerve - severing essentially removed the newts ' source of nAG .
Then they zapped the cells of the now - exposed body region with electrical pulses so they could deliver little bundles of DNA carrying genes for the protein nAG .
Within 30 to 40 days , the newts had regenerated their lost limbs , digits and all .
However , the new limbs had less muscle mass than the original ones .
Further lab experiments revealed the nAG protein — a molecule — works directly on the blastema cells , causing them to grow and divide .
" It essentially tells us that one single molecule is able to support the proliferation of blastema cells right from the start of regeneration all the way through to the formation of the digits , " said biologist David Stocum of Purdue University in Indiana , who wrote an accompanying article in Science .
Stocum was not involved in the current study .
Stocum adds that several other growth factors are known to stimulate the proliferation of blastema cells , though these molecules have n't been tested rigorously like in the recent study .
Growing human limbs
The big question is whether the same regenerative mechanism applies to humans .
" If you can make those cells de- differentiate , then you 've got to make them divide to produce a blastema , and nAG would be a molecule that you could use to make that happen , " Stocum said in a telephone interview .
But that does n't mean human - limb regeneration is right around the corner , by a long shot .
" What everybody is interested in , of course , are things about the extension to humans , " Brockes told LiveScience .
" I 'm really very cautious about that . "
Brockes noted that in order to move human limb regeneration forward scientists need to figure out if there is a human equivalent to the blastema that salamanders form after a limb gets amputated .
" I do n't think we generate those [ blastema ] cells after injury in a way that a newt does , " Brockes said .

Volunteering for a high school for the past half decade has given me a sense of great respect for the small acts of rebellion practiced every day by students .
Whether the students are conscious of them or not , I believe these acts are the seeds of a potential realization that the state school is the very antithesis of liberty .
And , the more state schools use their preferred tools of coercion on their victims , the more I see students awakening to the violence and rejecting the tactics and reacting against it with displays of individuality .
My own awakening took place running high school cross-country .
For the first two years , our coach never showed up for Friday practice , even though we were all supposed to do so .
Our first reaction to this was a reactionary , rebellious " Great !
We do n't have to run today , so let 's just go home .
Screw it . "
This quickly gave way to the irrelevance of the coach as we decided to run practices ourselves — running was as individual as any sport could be , and we saw no need for an appointed teacher when we could challenge ourselves .
The absence of government created a free market where we came together and created solutions with no input from the state .
In the process , our group became friends and the best - performing team in school history .
Not surprisingly , that teacher / coach became one of our great friends , because we had this opportunity and we all treated each other as equals .
More often than not , teachers just need to get out of the way if they want students to get an education .
We did it as teenagers with little school interference , and seriously considered quitting the team to run local races as individuals .
The state beat us there , though , as a number of us were too young to be allowed voluntarily to provide work in exchange for money .
But after realizing that we were not high on the priority list of the coach , we quickly found out that we were not high on the priority list of the school itself .
Not a single teacher came to watch us run , even at home meets , for an entire year , and we were left out of speeches where the principal extolled the virtues of the hard - working fall sports players , while leaving us out completely .
Our one attempt at school spirit , creating our own team shirts , was quickly declared " racist " by the principal and the shirts were banned .
No explanation , just a royal decree and threat of suspension .
Of course , that did n't prevent us from disobeying the order , since we already had the shirts .
" If no one came to watch us anyway , " we argued , " why should we care what the school thinks about what we wear ? "
Yet we were expected to attend official gatherings , like sports banquets and awards nights , and make a show of being a happy part of the larger institution .
Deciding not to show support for having been shown no support , all school events were boycotted by our group .
Remarkably , the school could not force us to go to events outside of regular hours , but it certainly could ostracize us in class after class for not attending events we were not wanted at anyway .
This undeclared battle was pivotal in creating some of the first serious doubts of the state school as anything but an enormous bureaucracy more interested in its own continuance and creating an appearance of treating and educating all students equally well .
I learned early on that school is nothing but a fourteen - year - long FEMA press conference .
The acts of rebellion I see around me when I volunteer now are not on the epic scale of the personal crusade for respect that I ventured upon and ultimately failed at .
But the underlying message has stayed the same : " Leave me alone , let me challenge myself , and I will break the emotional and intellectual dependency your institution is attempting to instill in me . "
I see it in the weight room where the music is so loud that the walls shake and one has to step outside in order to speak or think .
No top - down program can be controlled with a dozen students wandering around and authority figures unable to issue commands over the pounding bass .
I see it when the head coach is not at practice and I give the runners the responsibility of deciding what to run .
I find myself continually impressed with their creativity and ability to work with one another in the absence of an authoritarian figure telling them exactly what to do and how quickly to do it .
The highest quality education is in learning for oneself how to interact with other individuals without the state interpreter .
I see it when runners decide not to come to practice so that they can go see a musical , vacation in Mexico , or visit family in New York .
How can I deny them these important life experiences and ask them to sacrifice for the sake of a school they have bonds with beyond the coercion to attend ?
Of course I can't , but this is the typical reaction of the system to such acts of students having an experience not controlled by the bureaucracy .
There 's little question the quality of education has continued to decline with more government involvement at higher levels .
We do n't need to see this demonstrated through videos of people outside Wal - Mart unable to locate the United States on a map of the world ; schools were never about education to begin with , and memorizing disconnected facts in order to pass a test is nothing more than a behavioral exercise .
Students are not educated ; rather they are schooled into emotional and intellectual dependency , designed to result in a mass - produced , confused , bored society , willing to trust in big government for protection and the mainstream media for approved pre-thought thoughts .
Encouragingly , though , the state school seems to be losing more and more of its influence in the age of the internet .
Without students going from teacher at school presenting pre-thought thoughts to teacher on television reporting pre-thought thoughts , the conditioning begins to break down .
In the short years I have been out of school , I have witnessed the growing disillusionment with the system in my friends , one consequence being their near - unanimous enthusiasm for Ron Paul and the fact that they have discovered and agreed with the principles of liberty on their own .
Every act of rebellion I see from students , whether they understand it themselves or not , gives me hope that one day more of them will have their own awakening to the inherent violence of government .
These small acts against the coercive , intimidating system may one day result in a rejection of the state and its tactics ; and I see more of these acts every day than students are given credit .

The Best of Nick Heeringa
It 's where you get a chance to predict the future of 2008 presidential politics !
Barry Bonds ' trainer , Greg Anderson , was ordered released from prison Thursday by a federal judge after being held in contempt for refusing to testify to a grand jury .
Anderson , who was at the center of the BALCO steroids case , spent most
of the past year in a federal detention center for refusing to
testify before a grand jury .
His release comes on the same day as the federal government 's indictment of the ex-Giants slugger on four counts of perjury and one count of
obstruction of justice .
He was cited for lying when he said he
did n't knowingly take steroids given to him by Anderson , his personal trainer
and longtime friend .
Bonds also was charged with
lying that Anderson never injected him with steroids .
" Greg would n't do that , " Bonds testified in December 2003 when
asked if Anderson ever gave him any drugs that needed to be
injected .
' He knows I 'm against that stuff . ' "
Geragos said Anderson did n't
cooperate with the grand jury that indicted Bonds .
" This indictment came out of left field , '' Geragos said on Thursday .
" Frankly I 'm aghast .
It looks like the government misled me and
Greg as well , saying this case could n't go forward without him . ''
Anderson did not comment as he left a federal prison east of San
Francisco .
Prosecutors promised Bonds they would n't charge him with any
drug - related counts if he testified truthfully .
But according to
the indictment , Bonds repeatedly denied taking any steroids or
performance - enhancing drugs despite evidence to the contrary .
For instance , investigators seized a so - called " doping
calendar '' labeled " BB ' ' during a raid of Anderson 's house .
" He could know other BBs , '' Bonds replied when shown the
calendar during his testimony .
Bonds said at the end of the 2003 season , Anderson rubbed some
cream on his arm that the trainer said would help him recover .
Anderson also gave him something he called " flax seed oil , '' Bonds
said .
Bonds then testified that prior to the 2003 season , he never
took anything supplied by Anderson -- which the indictment alleges
was a lie because the doping calendars seized from Anderson 's house
were dated 2001 .
Anderson was held in contempt of court and ordered to prison in 2006 , a year after serving three months in prison after pleading guilty for his role in the BALCO scandal .
Anderson was initially ordered in March 2006 to testify to the grand jury investigating whether Bonds perjured himself when he testified to the original BALCO grand jury in December 2003 that he never knowingly used steroids or other banned performance enhancing drugs .
In August , Anderson 's close friend and lawyer Paula Canny said that to pass the time in prison , Anderson cut his hair into a Mohawk with dreadlocks .
Canny said Anderson 's access
to television was limited , but he got updates on Bonds ' all - time home run record pursuit by watching " SportsCenter " on ESPN .
Canny said at the time that Anderson said he would never testify and was determined to remain behind bars until the grand jury 's term expires .
Information from The Associated Press was used in this report .

THE movie “ Juno ” is a fairy tale about a pregnant teenager who decides to have her baby , place it for adoption and then get on with her life .
For the most part , the tone of the movie is comedic and jolly , but there is a moment when Juno tells her father about her condition , and he shakes his head in disappointment and says , “ I thought you were the kind of girl who knew when to say when . ”
Female viewers flinch when he says it , because his words lay bare the bitterly unfair truth of sexuality : female desire can bring with it a form of punishment no man can begin to imagine , and so it is one appetite women and girls must always regard with caution .
Because Juno let her guard down and had a single sexual experience with a sweet , well - intentioned boy , she alone is left with this ordeal of sorrow and public shame .
In the movie , the moment passes .
Juno finds a yuppie couple eager for a baby , and when the woman tries to entice her with the promise of an open adoption , the girl shakes her head adamantly : “ Ca n’t we just kick it old school ?
I could just put the baby in a basket and send it your way .
You know , like Moses in the reeds . ”
It ’s a hilarious moment , and the sentiment turns out to be genuine .
The final scene of the movie shows Juno and her boyfriend returned to their carefree adolescence , the baby  safely in the hands of his rapturous and responsible new mother  all but forgotten .
Because I ’m old enough now that teenage movie characters evoke a primarily maternal response in me ( my question during the film was n’t “ What would I do in that situation ? ” but “ What would I do if my daughter were in that situation ? ” ) , the last scene brought tears to my eyes .
To see a young daughter , faced with the terrible fact of a pregnancy , unscathed by it and completely her old self again was magical .
The wbr tag
The < wbr > tag is very useful but unfortunately too little known .
I use it liberally in the great compatibility tables on my site .
< wbr > ( w ord br eak ) means : " The browser may insert a line break here , if it wishes . "
It the browser does not think a line break necessary nothing happens .
I use it a lot in the great compatibility tables .
These tables are very large and very tight , and I wish to avoid horizontal scrollbars , if possible .
These scrollbars are mainly caused by the length of method or attribute names , for instance getElementsByTagName ( ) .
Therefore I do :
< div class = " name " > getElements<wbr>ByTagName()</div >
I give the browser the option of adding a line break .
This wo n't be necessary on very large resolutions , when the table has plenty of space .
On smaller resolutions , however , such strategically placed line breaks keep the table from growing larger than the window , and thus causing horizontal scrollbars .

... they pull a boneheaded stunt .
Okay , we all know that traditional encyclopedia publishers have been taking a beating as people turn to the free Wikipedia for content .
Still , every couple of years I update myCD - ROM .
This year , I opted for the 2008 Ultimate DVD edition because , as it says on the packaging , it includes : " Free ! Encylopaedia Britannica Online 1 - Year Subscription -- a $ 70 Value !
" I mean , heck , the DVD , with over three gigs of quality content was only $ 35 -- and with a year of online access thrown in , it 's a bargain , right ?
Especially if you want signed articles by authorities whoseyou can trace , right ?
( For example , 's article on " Science Fiction " is by none other than Bruce Sterling . )
But it turns out that what 's included is NOT a free one - year subscription to Britannica Online .
No , it 's a free one - yearof Britannica Online that auto - renews at $ 49 if you do n't cancel it before the end of the year .
You have to give a credit - card number to claim your " free " subscription , and if you do n't cancel on just the right day you either ( a ) get charged more than you paid for the effing DVD in the first place , or ( b ) get something less than the year you were promised because you canceled early .
F*ck that noise .
In its quest to beat Wikipedia at its own game , instead of taking lessons in how online access should be done , they 've copied the ploys used by porn sites , Classmates.com , and other shady dealers .
When will they ever learn ?
There areimprovements in the latest CD - ROM / DVD version of , most notably that long articles appear as one continuous scrollable page , instead of in little section - by - section chunks , which does make finding particular facts easier , and you can freely export articles to HTML .
But the largest font size you can select inis still too small for my eyes , and they still use the clunky not -Windows - standard Java engine they 've been using for the last several years , so all the menus and dialog boxes look a bit off .
Also , while the includedis indeed the new 11th edition , it 's actually a stripped - down version , missing proper nouns such as Toronto and Clinton thatin the print and standalone CD - ROM versions .
Sigh .
Mr. T can not be killed by conventional means .
The only known method to destroy him is prolonged exposure to jibba - jabba .
As you may have heard , the famous Battle of New Orleans , won by Andrew Jackson and his troops over the British during the War of 1812 , was fought on January 8 , 1815 , 15 days after the war had ended .
A treaty ending the conflict had been signed in Europe , but the news failed to reach either Jackson or the British troops before the battle .
Moreover , Jackson ’s superiors in Washington were unaware of both the battle and the treaty !
It ’s no surprise that news traveled slowly before the introduction of electronic media and the up to date newspaper .
But before you laugh too hard , you might consider the results of a 1969 poll taken in Morocco , revealing that only 56 percent of those asked knew that a man had set foot on the moon .
And of these , more than half thought the story was a hoax !
The modern newspaper could only be the product of the best printing processes and news - gathering networks , both developments of the twentieth century .
But written news reports , undependable as they were , date back to classical times .
Romans of the fifth century B.C. distributed newsletters with reports from the capital for those residing nearby on the Italian peninsula .
Upon assuming the consulship in 60 B.C. , one of Julius Caesar ’s first acts was to establish a daily bulletin of government announcements , the Acta Diurna , to post in the forum .
Posted proclamations and the announcements of town criers , and the grapevine , provided the news to many city residents for centuries , but it was n’t until the seventeenth century that newspapers proper began to spring up around Europe on a regular basis .
Though the Chinese claim the world ’s first newspaper , a court gazette first published in the seventh century B.C. , Chinese newsletters were actually printed by hand or from blocks until movable wood type was introduced in China in the seventeenth century .
Thus , the printed newspaper can properly be termed a European development .
One of Europe ’s first printed news reports was the work of Englishman Thomas Raynalde who , in 1549 , translated German news pamphlets documenting recent political events , murders , and marvels , a style of journalism not unknown today .
Early English news reports , translated from German or Dutch , came to be known as corantos , a term related to “ current . ”
The early corantos reported news only from the Continent , and were for the most part prohibited , or at least hindered , from relating domestic events .
But , in 1641 , with the abolition of the tyrannical court , the Star Chamber , freedom of the press in England took a major step forward .
That year saw the publication of Diurnal Occurrences ( a title identical to Caesar ’s ) , the first news pamphlet to contain domestic news , written in London by Samuel Pecke .
Most seventeenth - century news publications were partisan , printed with the approval , or direct sponsorship , of either the monarchy or parliament .
Despite their titles , these journals of “ diurnal ” occurrences were published weekly .
The first bona fide daily newspapers in England were not published until 1702 .
Daniel Defoe , best known for his novels , published a weekly entitled The Review between 1704 and 1713 .
At various times a paid political pamphleteer , a secret agent , and a hack , Defoe was wont to take his political point of view from the highest bidder , and often switched tides when it suited him .
The author of Robinson Crusoe once edited a Tory newspaper actually sponsored by the Whigs , and a Whig publication sponsored by the Tories , both at the same time !
Nevertheless , Defoe is considered the first important journalist in England , and the originator of the serial story .
Most early English newspapers were political in nature , devoted mainly to domestic and foreign news and commerce reports .
The famed journalists Sir Richard Steele and Joseph Addison were among the first to introduce social commentary to the newspaper .
The pair began with the Tatler in 1709 , then , beginning in 1711 , brought out the Spectator , a daily .
Between them , they wrote about 90 percent of the papers themselves .
The Spectator eventually ran to some 555 issues , and reached a circulation of over 3,000 .
It was read by many times that number .
Addison and Steele ’s papers were to have many imitators in England , including the Idler and Rambler of Samuel Johnson , brought out in the 1750’s .
By 1753 , English newspapers had passed the 7 million mark in annual circulation ; by 1760 , 9 million ; and by 1767 , 11 million .
In 1776 , there were fifty - three newspapers in London alone , presumably , most of them made reference to a burgeoning conflict in England ’s far - off American colonies .
Most 18th century English newspapers were designed for the well - educated .
Many of the essays from the Spectator or Rambler are considered among the finest English writing in this form .
Taxes kept the newspaper out of the hands of many people until late in the century , when William Cobbett first tried to reach the masses with a cheap weekly paper .
The London Times was begun in 1785 by John Walter , who promised his readers the paper would have no part in political partisanship or scandal - mongering .
Walter spent a few sojourns in Newgate prison for his journalistic independence .
But by the middle of the nineteenth century , the Times was the pre-eminent British newspaper , with a daily circulation of about 50,000 .
Even at that late date , each issue contained but twelve pages .
The first American publication that could justifiably be termed a newspaper was brought out in 1690 by Benjamin Harris , a bookseller who had been forced to flee England after publishing a seditious news pamphlet .
Harris called his Boston paper Publick Occurences Both Foreign and Domestick , and promised it would be issued “ once a moneth ( or if any Glut of Occurrences happen , oftener ) . ”
Harris ’s four - page paper was suppressed after only one issue for certain comments found distasteful by Massachusetts governor Simon Bradstreet .
In 1704 , a postmaster named John Campbell brought out the Boston News - Letter , the first continuously published newspaper in America .
Printed by one Bartholomew Green in a back room of his house , the paper was published in some form right up until the Revolution , and was without competition for fifteen years , reaching the astronomical circulation figure of 3001
By the way , one of the first printers of the Gazette was James Franklin , and his apprentice was a certain thirteen - year - old brother named Benjamin , perhaps you ’ve heard of him ?
Benjamin Franklin later moved to Philadelphia to work as a printer and occasional writer ; and in 1728 , bought a paper begun the previous year by Samuel Keimar .
Franklin shortened the paper ’s eleven - word title to the Pennsylvania Gazette , and published the sheet successfully for nineteen years - by which time Franklin probably had a number of more pressing matters to attend to .
You might have heard that Benjamin Franklin founded the recently defunct Saturday Evening Post in 1728 , for the claim appeared directly on the cover of each issue .
The fact is , Franklin had nothing whatsoever to do with this magazine , which first appeared in 1821 , not 1728 .
The magazine ’s publishers fabricated the claim in 1899 , and never abandoned it even when the claim was proved patently false .
The first New York newspaper was the New York Gazette , brought out by William Bradford in 1725 .
The Gazette was basically an organ of the Colonial government , and gave impetus to patriot Peter Zenger ’s opposing paper , the New York Weekly Journal , which he began publishing in 1733 .
Zenger was eventually jailed for his work .
The court case that followed , exonerating Zenger , did much to establish the principles of freedom of the press in America .
Many claims have been heard for the first daily newspaper to be published in the United States , but it ’s generally accepted that the honor goes to the Pennsylvania Packet and Daily Advertiser , which first appeared as a daily in 1784 .
Newspapers were not widely read here until the 1830 ’s , when the penny press began to appear .
These papers , costing , as you might imagine , one cent , when the going rate was six cents , were the first to be available to people at all economic levels .
The first successful daily in this genre was the New York Sun , launched in 1833 .
In 1841 , Horace Greeley founded a rival paper , the New York Tribune .
Ten years later , three publishing entrepreneurs issued the first copy of the New York Times , today generally regarded as the premier American newspaper .
The paper was failing in 1896 when it was taken over by Adolphe Ochs , previously the publisher of a Tennessee paper .
Och ’s early years saw the adoption of the slogan “ All the news that ’s fit to print , ” along with a slogan that promised : “ It does not soil the breakfast cloth ” - a reference to the so - called yellow journalism of the day .
The term yellow journalism originated in the 1890 ’s when San Francisco publisher William Randolph Hearst invaded the New York market and instituted an all - out rivalry between competing papers .
When the New York World published the first color comic strip in 1893 , “ The Yellow Kid ” by Richard Outcault , Hearst lured the artist away and published the strip in his own New York paper , the Journal .
The continuing rivalry between the various New York papers pandering to lurid tastes soon took on the name “ yellow journalism . ”
Many papers of this era were much like the modern tabloid or scandal sheet , featuring large banner headlines , plenty of pictures , and sensationalist features .
The twentieth century has seen the gradual consolidation of American newspapers and the founding of the newspaper chain .
Hearst himself bought or established some forty daily papers .
The peak year for American papers , in terms of sheer numbers , was 1916 , when 2,461 dailies were published across the nation .
By 1944 , consolidation and bankruptcy had brought that figure down to 1,744 .
New York City once had dozens of papers ; but by the 1950 ’s , most remaining papers were combinations of earlier publications , the New York Herald Tribune and the New York World Telegram and Sun , for instance .
Today , there are but three daily publications that can be called “ New York ” newspapers : the Times , the Post , and the Daily News .
The latter was founded in 1919 by three Chicago publishers .
Within six years , the Daily News had become the largest newspaper in the United States , a title it still holds by virtue of selling some two million copies daily .
Much of the news coverage now provided by the daily newspaper is the work of the wire agencies , which maintain a news correspondent in almost every large or capital city in the world .
The Associated Press was founded in 1848 by six New York papers to divide the cost of transmitting news by telegraph .
By 1950 , the agency had some 300,000 miles of wire in operation in the United States alone .
The other major American news agency , United Press International , was founded in 1907 by E.W. Scripps , uniting three older news agencies .
Close to one - fourth of the newspapers published in the world today are brought out in America - 1,768 in 1975 , with a total paid circulation of close to 62 million copies daily .
But the single newspaper with the largest daily circulation is the Russian Pravda , with a reputed circulation of 10 million copies .
Pravda ( which means “ truth ” in Russian ) was begun in 1912 .
After the 1917 revolution , it became the leading organ of the Russian Communist party .
Izvestia , the official daily newspaper of the Soviet government , is the second newspaper in the world in terms of circulation , with eight million copies sold per day .
Those who believe that the high figures attributed to the Soviet papers are due to the fact that there are no other papers published in that country might be surprised to learn that there are some 7,200 papers published altogether in the Soviet Union , though there are only about 650 dailies .
The Japanese daily Asahi Shimbun ranks third in circulation , at just over seven million copies per day , and two other Japanese papers claim a circulation in excess of five million .
The largest paper in England is now the London Daily Mirror , with some four million copies sold per day , and both the Daily Sun and the Daily Express own circulations close to the three million mark .
And the Evening News , with an average circulation of over a half - million copies , is the world ’s bestselling evening newspaper .
After the New York Daily News , the Los Angeles Times is the nation ’s best - selling newspaper , with about one million copies sold per day .
The New York Times follows in the number - three position .
Rounding out the top ten are , in order , the Chicago Tribune , Detroit News , Detroit Free Press , Chicago Sun-Times , Philadelphia Bulletin , New York Post , and Washington Post .
But the Wall Street Journal , published around the nation rather than in one particular city , officially ranks as the number - two American daily , with a circulation of some one - and - a - half million copies .
In all , American advertisers will spend about eight - and - a - half billion dollars this year on newspaper advertising !
Americans are far from the world ’s greatest newspaper readers , however .
That honor goes to the Swedes , who pore through about 564 papers for every 1,000 persons .
( In the United States , the figure is 300 papers per 1,000 persons . )
And the newspaper that comes closest to total national saturation is the Sunday Post , published in Glasgow , Scotland and read by about four - and - a - half million people each Sunday , more than 77 percent of all Scots of presumed newspaper - reading age .
No one who has carried home a copy of the New York Sunday Times could entertain any doubt as to the world ’s largest newspaper in sheer bulk .
The largest Sunday Times ever published , on October 17 , 1965 , consisted of 946 pages in fifteen sections , and weighed a whopping seven - and - a - half pounds !
Let ’s see , if the Sunday Times has a circulation of about one - and - a - half million copies , we can calculate that the average issue of that paper comprises a total of some 10 million pounds of paper .
Now , that ’s a small forest !
Clinton tells immigrant in Nevada : ' No woman is illegal '
On a campaign visit to a largely - Hispanic Las Vegas neighborhood on Thursday , Hillary Clinton declared ,  No woman is illegal . 
According to the Las Vegas Review - Journal , Clinton spent approximately an hour going door - to - door in the area near Eastern and Washington Avenues .
One woman , a real - estate broker , asked Clinton in accented English :  I have no income at all , so how will I survive ? "
" In my neighborhood , there are brand - new homes ,  the woman said ,  But the value is nothing .
I 'm glad you are here so I can tell you , because you 're going to be the president , I know . "
An unidentified man , from behind a wall , shouted to Clinton that his wife was illegal .
To cheers , Clinton replied , " No woman is illegal . "

AM3 has announced it has partnered with majority shareholder Dai Nippon Printing to establish a Japanese online shop for downloadable movies , books , comics and other media directly to the Nintendo DS .
According to a report from consumer website IGN , the download service , called DSVision , is fully licensed by Nintendo , and set to begin in 2008 .
It will deliver content to flash cards which are then plugged into the DS through a special adapter cartridge .
In 2004 , AM3 began selling movies viewable on the Game Boy Advance .
The company has not announced initial media titles to be made available through the service , which is currently Japan only , but IGN reports the firm expects to have 300 titles available on the service at launch , to reach 10,000 by 2010 .
Neither has pricing for content yet been announced , but the firm expects premium content to cost 1,000 yen ( $ 10 ) .
The service 's first test will reportedly begin in January 2008 , and participants will need to purchase the adapter cartridge , the special 512 flash card and a USB reader .
The cost of the startup package is 3,980 yen ( $ 36 ) , but the firm may offer the adapter for free to encourage widespread adoption .

UNDER the stewardship of Dow Kim and Thomas G. Maheras , Merrill Lynch and Citigroup built positions in subprime - related securities that led to $ 34 billion in write - downs last year .
The debacle cost chief executives their jobs and brought two of the world ’s premier financial institutions to their knees .
In any other industry , Mr. Kim and Mr. Maheras would be pariahs .
But in the looking - glass world of Wall Street , they  and others like them  are hot properties .
The two executives are well on their way to reviving their careers , even as global markets shudder at the prospect that Merrill and Citigroup may report further subprime losses in the coming months .
Mr. Maheras , who left his job as co-president of Citigroup ’s investment bank this fall after being demoted , has had serious discussions with several investment banks , including Bear Stearns , about taking on a top management position , people who have been briefed on the situation said .
And he has also been approached by investment firms willing to back him to the tune of $ 1 billion or more if he decides to start his own hedge fund , these people said .
Mr. Kim , who until this spring was a co-president at Merrill Lynch with oversight of the firm ’s trading and market operations , has been crisscrossing the globe in recent months raising money for his new hedge fund , Diamond Lake Capital .

You 'll be able to download the .NET Framework source libraries via a standalone install ( allowing you to use any text editor to browse it locally ) .
We will also provide integrated debugging support of it within VS 2008 .
Integrated Visual Studio 2008 Debugging Support
The final release of VS 2008 will support the ability to configure the debugger to dynamically download the .NET Framework debugger symbols ( and corresponding source code ) from a web server hosted by Microsoft .
You 'll be able to configure the .NET Framework symbols to be downloaded all in one shot , or manually retrieved on demand :
When you debug a .NET application and hit a breakpoint in your code , you 'll now be able to see a debugger call stack that contains detailed file and line number information for the .NET Framework classes and methods in your application :
In the screen - shot above , you can see that we 've set a debugger breakpoint in my page where we are calling GridView1.DataBind ( ) .
Previously there was no way to drill into this DataBind ( ) method to see how it was implemented .
Now with VS 2008 you 'll be able to press F11 ( " Step Into " ) and drill into the .NET Framework source implementation with the debugger :
VS 2008 will include support to automatically retrieve the appropriate .
NET Framework source files on demand from Microsoft .
This means that the source code for the ASP .
NET GridView and BaseDataBoundControl classes above do not have to already be installed on the machine before we started the debugger .
Instead , when we use F11 to step into their implementation VS can automatically download the source files from Microsoft and open it within the IDE .
By downloading the files dynamically we can also ensure that the matching source files always line - up with the particular version of the .NET Framework on your machine ( for example : if you have a GDR or Service Pack Patch installed on your machine , we 'll make sure to download the source file that corresponds to it ) .
In addition to stepping into .NET Framework code , we can also step back up on the call stack into .
NET Framework source as well .
For example , in our scenario above I could also double click up the callstack and review the private ProcessRequest method on the System .
Web.UI .
Page class :
We could optionally also step further up and into the System .
Threading .
ThreadPool implementation in mscorlib ( which controls the thread our Page is scheduled on ) :
Note in the previous two screen - shots how the VS debugger 's " Locals " and " Watch " windows are fully supported within both your code as well as in the .NET Framework source .
Summary
Having source code access and debugger integration of the .NET Framework libraries is going to be really valuable for .NET developers .
Being able to step through and review the source should provide much better insight into how the .NET Framework libraries are implemented , and in turn enable developers to build better applications and make even better use of them .
To learn more about our source release plans and how the above debugger integration works , please check out this Podcast that Scott Hanselman and Shawn Burke recently recorded .
Shawn ( who drove the source project on my team ) is also going to be publishing a cool Channel9 video later this week that shows using the VS 2008 integrated debugging support with it .
Hope this helps ,

Some 13,000 years ago , the Clovis people wandered North America , hunting ground sloths , mammoths , and other creatures — until hunters and prey both vanished .
What happened ?
A team of scientists now think they know : A miles - wide comet , they announced in May , seems to have exploded just north of the Great Lakes , triggering a 1,000 - year cold spell that helped bring on the extinction of the Clovis and the animals .
For years , the disappearance of the Clovis culture and sudden extinction of 35 genera of animals were explained by two competing theories .
One blamed climate change , although similar change at other times had not resulted in mass extinction .
The other fingered the humans themselves : Newly arrived from Asia , the Clovis killed off everything in a murderous spree and subsequently starved .
“ They would be very strange hunters , if you look at the ethnographic record , to knock out 35 genera that quickly , ” says Douglas Kennett , an archaeologist at the University of Oregon who conducted the research with 25 colleagues .
The key to the new hypothesis is a thin layer of black soil found at more than 50 North American sites .
In it are magnetic grains containing iridium , an element thought to indicate extraterrestrial origins .
The sediments also contain metallic and carbon spherules , as well as melted charcoal , likely the result of forest fires that swept the continent after the impact .
Although no crater has been found , concentrations of these indicators are highest around the Great Lakes .
Perhaps the impact was absorbed and erased by the Laurentide Ice Sheet , which at the time reached from the Arctic Ocean to that point , the researchers say .
Or maybe the comet exploded before it hit Earth .
“ Think about it — people would have seen it coming , ” says Kennett .
“ This was a bad day . ”

Immune Cells Show Off Their Deadly Grip
The 84 - year - old Walt Disney Company has its fair share of detractors , but it also has a sizeable contingent of fervent supporters .
And what do we mean by “ fervent ” ?
They ’re the type of people who , like Irving Plummer , will admit that “ just about everything in my house is Disney , except for the TV . ”
So what happens when these super - fans reach out to Disney , ( specifically , Disney Cruise Lines , or DCL ) to let them know about a problem they ’re having ?
According to Mr. Plummer , the answer in a recent case was , essentially , not much .
Plummer was eager to book a spot on an upcoming Disney cruise , along with many of his fellow participants on the unofficial Disney - related message board Three Circles .
But when he went to make his final payment and complete his reservation , he was shocked by what he found–a link that enabled him to access personal information about his fellow passengers .
But it was n’t just their reservation number , room number or email address–it was sensitive information like home address , date of birth , and even how much each passenger had paid for their rooms and their outstanding balances .
According to Lillie Coney , Associate Director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center ( EPIC ) , a public interest research center in Washington , D.C. , these types of privacy problems are an “ epidemic in the US . ”
A breach of this type could easily lead to identity theft , she said .
Realizing the gravity of the situation , Plummer , an information technology professional who has supported Web sites from UPS to the federal government , contacted DCL immediately .
He pointed out that Disney seemed to be in violation of its own privacy policies .
After trying to convince a supervisor of the gravity of the situation , Plummer said that the supervisor had responded that there was nothing she could do .
In fact , this Disney representative asserted that Plummer had effectively given permission for others to view his information .
Why ?
The reason given was that because members of the Three Circles message board used the DCL site ’s linking feature to sign up for a large private dining room together , they were “ traveling together ” and thus could access one another ’s information .
“ Just because people are linked for dining purposes , does n’t mean their private information should be available to those [ to whom they ] are linked , ” Plummer responded .
Frustrated that he could n’t get this serious issue resolved , he reached out to PeterGreenberg.com .
At first , when contacted by our research team , DCL Director of Public Affairs Rena Langley stated that there had been “ a few problems ” with the site regarding the making of reservations .
She claimed those had already been fixed .
When presented with Plummer ’s assessment of the problems , she denied that Plummer could have accessed other cruisers ’ personal information .
But Plummer was n’t the only Disney fan to see personal information on DCL ’s Web site .
Teresa Whitmore , another Three Circles user , enjoyed two DCL cruises in the past , and was excited to sign up for her next one .
So she was similarly shocked to discover the personal and financial information of other cruisers at her fingertips .
“ It happened every time I made a payment , ” she said .
According to Whitmore , a “ Cruise Summary ” box in the upper right - hand corner of the site revealed the information of several fellow passengers .
“ But what really scared me , ” she says , “ was the kind of information on there –especially the home addresses . ”
Whitmore claimed the safety and security of her family was being compromised by the DCL Web site through the revelation of her information to people she ’d met only through the Internet .
And though Whitmore is still planning on signing up for an upcoming DCL Panama Canal cruise , she says the situation has made her concerned about linking up with any of the folks she ’s met online for upcoming cruises .
These types of privacy violations are widespread , according to EPIC ’s Coney .
This is likely because of the fact that there are essentially no blanket privacy protections for American consumers .
“ What ’s funny is that these same companies go to Europe and ca n’t engage in these [ behaviors ] ” Coney says , explaining that European consumers are protected by European Union laws regarding privacy .
“ And these companies are n’t closing up shop because they ’re not making money … because they ’re all held to the same standard .
It ’s a level playing field . ”
And so we went back to DCL and revisited the issue .
DCL ’s Langley reports that the Disney Web team looked into the situation again , and has finally fixed the problem .
Now , Disney claims that passengers who are linked together will not see each other ’s personal information beyond the barest essentials ( like their name ) .
“ The fact [ is ] that Disney Cruise Line has finally owned up to the issue and corrected it , [ and for that ]
I am thankful , ” passenger Plummer wrote us .
“ I truly believe that had it not been for you …DCL would have just ignored us . ”
Happy to hear we ’ve had a positive impact .
But the more serious question remains :
What can you do when you discover privacy violations like this online ?
“ You have to understand the power dynamic in this relationship , ” says EPIC ’s Coney .
“ This is Disney … you ’re not really in a great position to harness market forces that as a consumer might give you power , since there are n’t a lot of other places you can go for that type of experience ” that Disney provides .
But consumers are n’t totally powerless .
Coney suggests complaining directly to the Federal Trade Commission , online at https://ftc.gov .
The FTC does have the power to both investigate and levy fines against companies .
And as she notes , “ Companies do n’t like being investigated . ”
A few state attorneys general , especially those in New York and California , have also taken up privacy cases on behalf of consumers , using their respective state laws .
If your state does have privacy protections , a call to your state ’s Attorney General ’s office could help .
Communicating your concerns about privacy issues to your state and federal representatives is useful , too ( although in a more long - term sense ) .
But to prevent these privacy issues from arising in the first place , Coney suggests that you approach the problem this way : “ Would you disclose this information to a stranger ?
Because that ’s essentially what you ’re doing with a Web site , even if you ’re familiar with the company . ”
Well known , trusted companies are able to get more information from their consumers , but that also makes them juicier targets for identity thieves .
Further , Coney recommends asking questions before turning over information , such as “ How long is my information stored , who has access to it , and how can I delete it once I ’ve completed my transaction ? ”
She warned consumers to be very leery of any company that could not , or would not , answer these types of questions .
The bigger problem , according to Coney , is that there are almost no laws and regulations on the books that actually protect privacy information .
There are bits and pieces of privacy legislation , such as those protecting health and financial information , or the information of minors , or regulating government - run websites .
But the vague assurances of data protection like Disney ’s are , in Coney ’s words , “ smoke and mirrors . ”
Additionally , Disney provides no clear way to remove personal information once it ’s been collected , a situation Coney likens to your information “ being held hostage . ”
So before you turn over your information , just ask yourself : “ Would I give this information to a perfect stranger ? ”

In Functional reactive partner dancing , I mentioned that ( a ) the partially applied leading and following types have boilerplate Applicative instances , and ( b ) the leading type corresponds to varying ( reactive ) values .
Today I realized that those boilerplate instances are not very useful , and that they do not correspond to the Applicative instance of Reactive .
In this post , I give a useful Applicative instance that does correspond to the Reactive instance .
The instance definition is expressed in terms of the pair editor bot shown at the end of the “ dancing ” post , which seems to have a variety of applications .
The Applicative instance has one awkward aspect that suggests a tweak to the formulation of leading .
I give simplified versions of pair editing and Applicative for the revised type .
This change is in version 0.1 of the Bot libary .
Edit 2008 - 02 - 15 : added FRP tags ; prose tweak .
Oops
The multi-output versions of leading and following are formulated simply as the single - output versions , with a list - valued output type :
newtype a :-> b = Follows ( Follow a [ b ] ) newtype a :>- b = Leads ( Lead a [ b ] )
Partially applied , each of these types is a sort of composition of type constructors .
For instance , ( :->) a is the type composition of Follow a and [ ] .
Since both of those type constructors are applicative functors , there are standard definitions of Functor and Applicative .
instance Functor ( ( :->) i ) where fmap f ( Follows z ) = Follows ( ( fmap.fmap ) f z ) instance Applicative ( (:->) i ) where pure x = Follows ( ( pure.pure ) x ) Follows f <*> Follows x = Follows ( liftA2 ( <*>) f x )
and similarly for ( :>-) i .
In fact , these instance templates are abstracted into instances for the type composition operator ( :. ) found in TypeCompose , so we can get the four instances for free if we define
type ( :->) a = Follow a :. [ ] type ( :>-) a = Lead a :. [ ]
While the Functor instances work fine , the rub ( which I did n’t realize when writing the “ dancing ” post ) is that the Applicative instances are not what I want .
They delegate to the Applicative instances for Follow a and for [ ] .
The result is that each output of lf <*> lx is the list of f x for all f in the ( list - valued ) lf output at that point and all x in the ( list - valued ) lx output .
In particular , the lf <*> lx will have an output only when both lf and lx have simultaneous outputs .
Instead , I ’d like lf <*> lx to have an output whenever either lf or lx has an output .
If lf has an output f , I want to output f x , where x is the most recent lx output .
Similarly , if lx has an output , I want to output f x , where f is the most recent lf output .
This behavior is exactly how Applicative works for Reactive , as described in reactive - normal - form .
A solution and a problem
At the end of Functional reactive partner dancing , I showed a tool that is related to the desired Applicative behavior .
editPairF :: ( c , d ) -> Either c d :-> ( c , d )
Given an initial pair , editPairF accepts replacements of either the first or second element and produces updated pairs , remembering the previous values .
Since memory is involved , editPairL is defined in terms of the generic accumulation combinator accumF .
Let ’s put editPairF to work , to pair up two follows into a pair - valued follow .
A new pair is output whenever either element gets output .
pairF :: ( b , c ) -> a:->b -> a:->c -> a :->( b, c ) pairF bc ab ac = ( Left < $ > ab ) `mappend` ( Right < $> ac ) >>> editPairF bc
We had to supply the initial pair here , because follows do n’t have initial values .
Leads do , however , so the lead - pairing function has a simpler - looking type :
pairL :: a :>-b -> a :>-c -> a :>-( b, c )
The definition of pairL works in terms of pairF .
The extra work involves disassembling and reassembling leads into and from initial values and follows .
ab `pairL` ac = leads ( liftA2 ( , ) bs cs ) $ pairF ( b , c ) abf acf where ( bs , abf ) = splitL ab ( cs , acf ) = splitL ac -- Oh dear .
b & c might not be well - defined b = last bs c = last cs
The awkward bit here is that , as formulated , a multi-lead ( a :>- b ) could have multiple values even initially .
For that reason , I ( a ) use a cross product ( lift A2 ( , ) ) for the initial pairs , and ( b ) extract a single value from each lead to use in the pair - valued lead ’s initial value .
This second consideration is worse than awkward ; it will fail if either initial value list is empty .
Is it really useful for a lead to have an initial list of values ?
Not that I know of .
I allowed the flexibility because it made the type definitions so simple and uniform , which I ’ve found has a decisive impact on the simplicity of code that works on the type .
Placing the initial - list problem aside for now , here is the simple and useful Applicative instance for leads .
The pure method makes a lead with an initial value an no future reponses .
The ( <*>) method uses pairL above to make a lead whose outputs are function / argument pairs , and then maps uncurried function application onto the pairs to get out the results .
instance Applicative ( ( :>-) i ) where pure x = leads [ x ] mempty lf <*> lx = uncurry ( $ ) < $> ( lf `pairL` lx )
What about ( :->) ( following ) ?
I do n’t think an Applicative instance like the leading one can exist , due to lack of initial values .
Perhaps there is an Applicative instance corresponding to the one on Event ( combining all pairs of occurrences over time ) .
A tweak , and we ’re back to safe & elegant
The difficulty with pairL comes from a feature of dubious value , namely having an initial list of values rather than exactly one initial value .
Let ’s consider removing that flexibility .
Replace
newtype a :>- b = Leads ( Lead a [ b ] )
with
newtype a :>- b = Leads ( b , a :-> b)
The pairing combinator for leads is now simpler .
It ’s also bomb - proof , since it has initial single values instead of lists :
pairL :: a :>-b -> a :>-c -> a :>-( b, c ) Leads ( a , fa ) `pairL` Leads ( b , fb ) = Leads ( ( a , b ) , pairF ( a , b ) fa fb )
And we have simple and ( I think ) trouble - free instances :
instance Functor ( ( :>-) i ) where fmap f ( Leads ( b , fol ) ) = Leads ( f b , fmap f fol ) instance Applicative ( (:>-) i ) where pure x = Leads ( x , mempty ) lf <*> lx = uncurry ( $ ) < $> ( lf `pairL` lx )
In Functional reactive partner dancing , I mentioned that ( a ) the partially applied leading and following types have boilerplate Applicative instances , and ( b ) the leading type corresponds to varying ( reactive ) values ....
Justin James had this to say in his weblog post ,
The programming paradigm needs an update :
It is all coming together for me now , the conscious understanding of what I really dislike about programming .
I got into programming because I like solving problems , but solving problems is really only a small fraction of the work .
The rest of it is giving exact , precise details as to how to perform the tasks that solve the problems .
It is like painting the Sistine Chapel by putting a seven - year - old boy on a scaffold and dictating to him every stroke you want him to make .
It is ridiculous .
Back when I flirted with WYSIWYG web design software for a year or so , I started running up against a similar wall in my enjoyment of the craft .
I had many of the same issues with web design that Justin seems to be having with programming — it was tedious , micromanaging work , starting with doing a broad sweeping overall design , then having to subdivide into parts to fix the initial generated code to make it actually do everything I needed .
I found myself wondering what I ’d ever found to enjoy about web design .
One day , I had to do a fair bit of web design work on a machine that did n’t have Dreamweaver installed .
I cracked open Notepad and got to work .
Guess what happened :
I enjoyed myself !
I discovered that the major hurdle in my way is that I was treating the process of web design as something akin to bricklaying — I created a grand design document , I threw together sections of wall mechanically and largely automatically , then I fit individual bricks into the spaces to tie it all together .
Tedious , really .
When I just used an empty text editor as my page , I could compose the code I needed rather than constructing it .
Not only did it become something more like finely detailed art , as though writing a character - driven tale with the plot as something that emerged naturally rather than being hammered into the reader at every turn , as opposed to some kind of boring civil engineering task , but the end result ended up being much higher quality , better suited to the specific task I needed to accomplish .
The end result got better at the same time that my enjoyment grew .
I had up to that point never used an IDE for any actual programming — I had always just used a bare text editor .
I later picked a few up and played around with them for a while , but they never actually accomplished anything any more quickly for me , and worse yet they tended to crush my enjoyment of coding .
I never really made a specific , direct connection to the situation with using a WYSIWYG HTML editor before today , and the effect was n’t nearly as dramatic and notable because I never spent as much time with an IDE as I had with Dreamweaver , but now that I think about it I suspect much the same thing was going on .
Perhaps the problem Justin is experiencing is in large part because he progressed from vi to IDE , rather than from vi to Vim ( or nvi , or whatever advanced successor to vi he ’d prefer ) .
The IDE culture that has grown around Java ’s and Microsoft ’s shared domination of much of the software industry turns programmers into manipulators of automated assembly lines , rather than masters of a craft .
I think the key problem here is in how we think about programming : when using all those code generation tools to produce masses of scaffolding into which we ’ll insert library calls and class APIs , we think of programming as a rote exercise in rearranging pregenerated blocks of reusable atomic substructure ; when we break open a powerful text processing application like Vim and start with a shebang line or header includes , then proceed to typing the first instance of a function or class definition , we are actually thinking in the programming language .
It ’s more like writing a sonnet — structured and guided by rules of a sonnet ’s composition , but in some ways more an artistic expression than a step - by - step execution of the instructions for building a suspension bridge .
I ’ve heard it said many times that the fun programming involves solving new problems , rather than just solving the old problems all over again .
This is why smart programmers usually end up wanting to work in AI , or otherwise pursuing new avenues of applying and expanding their understanding of computational theory .
I ’ve seen some , however , who are just as happy to construct CRUD ( Create , Read , Update , Delete ) applications that are a thousand times as good as the standard Java CRUD app .
I , too , am not terribly bored by solving old problems in a slightly different way to suit my own preferences .
I think the difference for the bleeding edge problems is not necessarily that they ’re problems nobody has solved before , just as real , original , good poetry can still be written in iambic pentameter and about the ages - old topic of lost love .
Rather , the difference is in the tools that are used .
Because bleeding edge problems cannot be solved with code generators and other tools that just rearrange blocks of commonly used code , the programmers “ flex ” their brains and have to really think in the language they ’re using , composing something of an artistic expression of the problem domain in code .
You can do that with any kind of problem — even a largely typical CRUD application .
Enjoyment of the craft is not limited to solving problems nobody ’s considered solving before .
I think that usually just doing a better job on an old problem than anyone else has because you do n’t let yourself become constrained by the code generation tools available to you is all that ’s needed .
Instead of thinking about how to rearrange big blocks of functionality to get the solution you want , think about the problem itself and how to solve it in your programming language of choice — and maybe even think about which language can best be used to express the problem ( and its solution ) in this particular instance .
I find that the best tools for that are those tools that make editing code exceedingly fast and easy once you ’ve mastered them to some degree of competency without masking the language you ’re using behind automated operations like class builder functionality in your IDE .
I ’m talking about tools like Vim , of course .
I think this is also part of the reason that daycoders tend to like their Javas and C#s and other verbose , repetitive , pattern - bound , IDE - requiring languages , while the really eccentric and brilliant hackers in the open source community tend to prefer their Lisps and Perls ( and Rubys and Pythons and Haskells and Erlangs ) and other succinct , flexible , powerful , dynamic languages that do n’t lend themselves to IDE abstraction ( but , instead , lend themselves to tools like Vim and EMACS , aka Esc Meta Alt Ctrl Shift ) : one is for people rearranging pregenerated chunks of functionality to solve a business need quickly but not necessarily well , while the other is for people solving problems they personally want solved — and solved as perfectly as possible for their particular needs .
One set of languages is the toolset for assembly line work , and the other is the artisan ’s carefully chosen set of tools for a craft .
I agree with Justin , that languages like Lisp can be difficult for many programmers .
Lisp is in many ways inherently recursive , requiring one to really grok recursion to use the language to anything even approaching its full potential — and recursion is just the beginning with Lisp .
On the other hand , dynamic languages in general need not be so difficult .
Ruby , for example , is one of the most dynamic of widely known languages , and yet it ’s one of the easiest to grasp .
In fact , while I ’ve long understood what the map operator in Perl does and have explained it effectively to others who , despite years in the Perl biz , never quite grokked it , I always had to think about it for a few minutes every time I used it to remember the specifics of how it ’s used — but working with iterator blocks ( such as when using the Array # collect method ) in Ruby has provided me with a greater understanding of how language constructs like map work at a deeper , more intuitive level , and Perl ’s map operator ( as well as its grep operator , for that matter ) is second nature to me in a way it never was before .
Perhaps better yet , in many ways Ruby acts as a simplified ( yet more flexible and rich ) Java for the Java daycoders , as it ’s a really solid object oriented language that nonetheless eschews much of the repetitive scaffolding and cruft necessary to perform even the simplest tasks in Java ( or C# , or C++ , et cetera ) .
In short , I ’m not sure we really need to move more toward “ intentional languages ” .
I think the key is that programmers must be able to express their intentions in the languages they use — which requires thinking in the language , and not treating the language as bricks and mortar which must be manhandled into place .
A ( good ) programming language is a language — a means of expressing oneself — and not just a pile of raw materials .
If you ca n’t use a programming language as an actual language , you ’ll find it very difficult to express the problem domain and its solution , just as it ’s difficult to express one ’s intent elegantly by tearing pages out of books on your shelf and attaching them to form a new book .
There was no sign of foul play in Mr. Cintron ’s death , he added .
The roommate , James P. O’Hare , and his friend , David J. Dalaia , both 65 and unemployed , placed Mr. Cintron ’s body in the chair and wheeled it around the corner , south along Ninth Avenue on Tuesday afternoon , the police said .
The men parked the chair with the corpse in front of Pay - O - Matic at 763 Ninth Avenue , a check - cashing business that Mr. Cintron had patronized .
They went inside to present the check , but a clerk said Mr. Cintron would have to cash it himself , and asked where he was , the police said .
“ He is outside , ” Mr. O’Hare said , indicating the body in the chair , according to Mr. Browne .
The two men started to bring the chair inside , but it was too late .
Their sidewalk procession had already attracted the stares of passers - by who were startled by the sight of the body flopping from side to side as the two men tried to prop it up , the police said .
The late Mr. Cintron was dressed in a faded black T - shirt and blue - and - white sneakers .
His pants were pulled up part of the way , and his midsection was covered by a jacket , the police said .
While the two men were inside the check - cashing office , a small crowd had gathered around the chair .
A detective , Travis Rapp , eating a late lunch at a nearby Empanada Mama saw the crowd and notified the Midtown North station house .
Police officers and an ambulance arrived as the two men were trying to maneuver the corpse and chair into the check - cashing office .
Seam carving is an image resizing algorithm developed by Shai Avidan and Ariel Shamir .
This algorithm alters the dimensions of an image not by scaling or cropping , but rather by intelligently removing pixels from ( or adding pixels to ) the image that carry little importance .
The importance of a pixel is generally measured by its contrast when compared with its neighbor pixels , but other measures may be used .
Additionally , it 's possible to define ( or autodetect ) areas of high importance ( faces , buildings , etc. ) in which pixels may not be deleted , and conversely , areas of zero importance which should be removed first .
From this information , the algorithm detects seams ( continuous lines of pixels joining opposite edges of the image ) which have the lowest importance , and deletes those .
This shrinks the image by one horizontal or vertical line , depending on which direction the seam ran .
Seam carving can also be run in reverse by adding interpolated pixels along the lowest energy seam .
With this technique , it 's now possible to reduce or enlarge pictures by a wide range , while still retaining details .
In normal image scaling , it 's often not possible to scale about factor greater than 2 or less than 0.5 , without losing much of the images quality .
When you ’re studying for finals , good nutrition often slides way down on the priority list .
It ’s easy to get into the habit of glugging coffee and gobbling take - out pizza , because you do n’t want to waste time on food preparation .
But , actually , good nutrition should be part of your study plan because it ’s going to help you ace those tests .
The better the fuel your brain gets , the better you ’ll study .
It ’s a…well … no - brainer .

Rush To Arms
“ We have 190,000 lost weapons because they were not distributed properly , ” said Maj. Gen. Abdul Karim Khalaf , an Interior Ministry spokesman ... Many of those weapons were distributed when Gen. David H. Petraeus , now the American commander in Iraq , was in charge of training and equipping Iraqi security forces in 2004 and 2005 .
General Petraeus has said that he decided to arm the Iraqi forces as quickly as possible , before tracking systems were fully in place .
French President 's Fact Checker As Accurate as Bush 's Fact Checker
Nicolas Sarkozy made a minor gaffe on his first U.S. visit as France 's president by wrongly suggesting that Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice has recent immigrant roots .

Subject : Bush comments
Hi Lisa ,
I teach middle school social studies and believe myself to be a good teacher , knowledgable about my subject .
In New York , the US Constitution is part of the middle school curriculum .
I was taken back by several comments our resident in chief made yesterday during a press conference with his new best friend , President Nicolas Sarkozy of France , perhaps the only world leader with lower approval ratings than the shrub .
I was left in stitches from laughter when King George was asked if he had spoken with Musharraf and if so what he had told him .
He said he had spoken with Musharraf and had told him the United States believes in free and open elections ( huh ?????? ) and went on to say he told him to take off the uniform .
You can not be the President and the head of the military at the same time .
Every 12 year old in New York is taught that Article 2 , Section 2 , Clause 1 of the US Constitution ( a document I understand Georgie has trouble with ) clearly states that the President of the United States is the Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces .
This duty has been reaffirmed many times by both Congress and the courts including several times during his own administration !

Rudy 's Albatross ?
Federal prosecutors plan to ask a grand jury Thursday to indict Rudy Giuliani 's ex-police commissioner , Bernard Kerik , on a variety of corruption and tax fraud charges .
If the grand jury votes today to indict , the charges would be unsealed tomorrow .
Kerik has made arrangements to surrender , rather than be arrested by U.S. marshals , the sources say .

Internet Spying
It would be difficult to say whose e-mail , text messages or Internet phone calls the government is monitoring at any given time , but according to a former AT&T employee , the government has warrantless access to a great deal of Internet traffic should they care to take a peek .
As information is traded between users it flows also into a locked , secret room on the sixth floor of AT&T's San Francisco offices and other rooms around the country -- where the U.S. government can sift through and find the information it wants , former AT&T employee Mark Klein alleged Wednesday at a press conference on Capitol Hill .
People like the President because he seems like a guy you could have a beer with .

No , the above headline is not deceptive , or meant to be sensational .
I found this alert from Rueters , and in following - up on the USS Enterprise , I found another article posted in the US Navy forum that literally made me feel sick to my stomach :
US Navy says starts naval exercises in Gulf waters 02 Nov 2007 14:17:36 GMT
Source : Reuters LONDON , Nov 2 ( Reuters ) - The U.S. Navy said it had begun a series of exercises in the Gulf and wider Gulf waters on Friday involving a U.S aircraft carrier and two expeditionary assault ships .
In a statement the U.S. Navy ’s Fifth Fleet headquartered in Bahrain said it had begun a five - day crisis response exercise involving amphibious , air and medical forces in the Gulf .
It also said the aircraft carrier USS Enterprise and its strike group and another expeditionary strike group had begun training in wider Gulf waters .

The article above taken at face value means nothing to the casual observer , and at first glance it did n’t impact me that much until I Googled the USS Enterprise , and here is what I found , and since it was posted on the US Navy Forum - I took special note of the extremely sinister allegations that post included :
PREPARE FOR THE SINKING OF A U.S. AIRCRAFT CARRIER - The USS Enterprise CVN - 65 !
JP
Liggett
Carmel , NY Oct 8 , 2006 “ THOSE PLANNING THE ATTACK ARE INSIDE THE U.S. AND ISRAELI GOVERNMENTS and view the loss of the Enterprise crew as a necessary sacrifice to induce Americans to support war against Iran .
Put bluntly , the ship and crew are to be cannon
fodder . ”
IRAN WAR PLAN EXPOSED !
PREPARE FOR THE SINKING OF A U.S. AIRCRAFT CARRIER - The USS Enterprise CVN - 65 !
From : RBOW
The existence of a hideous plan to sacrifice a U.S. Aircraft Carrier as a
pretext for war with Iran is presently being uncovered !
The Hal Turner Show has been told that within the next five ( 5 ) weeks , the
United States will “ suffer ” a missile attack upon the aircraft carrier USS
Enterprise , presently on patrol near the Persian Gulf .
This attack will appear
to be from numerous “ Silkworm ” and / or “ Sunburn ” missiles which will sink the
vessel and kill most of the 5,000 crew onboard .
The “ attack ” will be blamed on Iran and thus provide the Bush Administration
with an excuse to go to war with that nation .
The Hal Turner Show has learned that the missiles used to attack the USS
Enterprise will not be fired from or by Iran , but rather will be a “ false flag
operation ” made to LOOK as though Iran carried out the attack !!

Many of my students — especially a couple of 7th - grade boys — show a great deal of interest in ancient forms of capital punishment .
Today I put together a model to illustrate the Athenian practice of apotumpanismós , or ‘ planking ’ , which is essentially crucifixion without the nails ( paradoxically , that makes it crueler ) :
The text on the lower left reads :
CRUEL , BUT NOT UNUSUAL
Ancient Athenian Capital Punishment Stephen ( Stéphanos ) is a thief , caught in the act .
His punishment is apotympanismós ( ‘ planking ’ ) .
He has been fastened to a wooden plank with five metal hoops and left out in the sun to die of hunger , thirst , heat , cold , and the nibbling of wild animals and birds .
There are guards to keep his friends from releasing him or giving him food or water , but his enemies are free to come and abuse him whenever they like .
If he were a major criminal like a traitor , he would have been thrown in the Bárathron , a deep pit near Athens , his body left there to rot and be eaten by vultures .
Stephen will get a decent burial after he dies , though that may take a week or more .
That ’ll teach Stephen to steal Barbie ’s purse .
It ’s too bad about the hair - style — and the silly happy look on his face .
Next project : the Bárathron .
That will take a bit more money , but will be easy enough .
Take one large - sized plastic garbage can , add a small shelf on one side at the top , line the interior and the shelf with papier - maché to represent bare rock , add a fully - clothed Ken and Barbie throwing a loin - cloth ’d Stephen over the edge , and put the pieces of another Stephen down in the bottom , with the broken - up remains of a couple of plastic skeletons , if I can find them in the right size .
Bushes and vultures are optional , though they would add a bit of atmosphere .
I ’ll probably enlist my students to work on that , since their experience with papier - maché is undoubtedly fresher than my own ( by 40 years or so , I estimate ) .
‘ To me , I confess , [ countries ] are pieces on a chessboard
upon which is being played out a game for dominion of the world . ’
Lord Curzon , viceroy of India ,
speaking about Afghanistan ,
1898
I had suggested to Marina that we meet in the safety of the Intercontinental Hotel , where foreigners stay in Kabul , but she said no .
She had been there once and Government agents , suspecting she was RAWA , had arrested her .
We met instead at a safe house , reached through contours of bombed rubble that were once streets , where people live like earthquake victims awaiting rescue .
RAWA is the Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan , which since 1977 has alerted the world to the suffering of women and girls in that country .
There is no organisation on earth like it .
It is the high bar of feminism , home of the bravest of the brave .
Year after year , RAWA agents have travelled secretly through Afghanistan , teaching at clandestine girls ’ schools , ministering to isolated and brutalised women , recording outrages on cameras concealed beneath their burqas .
They were the Taliban regime ’s implacable foes when the word Taliban was barely heard in the west : when the Clinton Administration was secretly courting the mullahs so that the oil company Unocal could build a pipeline across Afghanistan from the Caspian .
Indeed , RAWA ’s understanding of the designs and hypocrisy of western governments informs a truth about Afghanistan excluded from news , now reduced to a drama of British squaddies besieged by a demonic enemy in a " good war " .
When we met , Marina was veiled to conceal her identity .
Marina is her nom de guerre .
She said : " We , the women of Afghanistan , only became a cause in the west following 11 September 2001 , when the Taliban suddenly became the official enemy of America .
Yes , they persecuted women , but they were not unique , and we have resented the silence in the west over the atrocious nature of the western - backed warlords , who are no different .
They rape and kidnap and terrorise , yet they hold seats in [ Hamid ] Karzai ’s Government .
In some ways , we were more secure under the Taliban .
You could cross Afghanistan by road and feel secure .
Now , you take your life into your hands . "
The reason the United States gave for invading Afghanistan in October 2001 was " to destroy the infrastructure of al - Qaeda , the perpetrators of 9/11 " .
The women of RAWA say this is false .
In a rare statement on 4 December that went unreported in Britain , they said : " By experience , [ we have found ] that the US does not want to defeat the Taliban and al - Qaeda , because then they will have no excuse to stay in Afghanistan and work towards the realisation of their economic , political and strategic interests in the region . "
The truth about the " good war " is to be found in compelling evidence that the 2001 invasion , widely supported in the west as a justifiable response to the 11 September attacks , was actually planned two months prior to 9/11 and that the most pressing problem for Washington was not the Taliban ’s links with Osama Bin Laden , but the prospect of the Taliban mullahs losing control of Afghanistan to less reliable mujahedin factions , led by warlords who had been funded and armed by the CIA to fight America ’s proxy war against the Soviet occupiers in the 1980s .
Known as the Northern Alliance , these mujahedin had been largely a creation of Washington , which believed the jihadi card could be used to bring down the Soviet Union .
The Taliban were a product of this and , during the Clinton years , they were admired for their " discipline " .
Or , as the Wall Street Journal put it , " [ the Taliban ] are the players most capable of achieving peace in Afghanistan at this moment in history " .
The " moment in history " was a secret memorandum of understanding the mullahs had signed with the Clinton Administration on the pipeline deal .
However , by the late 1990s , the Northern Alliance had encroached further and further on territory controlled by the Taliban , whom , as a result , were deemed in Washington to lack the " stability " required of such an important client .
It was the consistency of this client relationship that had been a prerequisite of US support , regardless of the Taliban ’s aversion to human rights .
( Asked about this , a State department briefer had predicted that " the Taliban will develop like the Saudis did " , with a pro-American economy , no democracy and " lots of Sharia law " , which meant the legalised persecution of women .
" We can live with that , " he said . )
By early 2001 , convinced it was the presence of Osama Bin Laden that was souring their relationship with Washington , the Taliban tried to get rid of him .
Under a deal negotiated by the leaders of Pakistan ’s two Islamic parties , Bin Laden was to be held under house arrest in Peshawar .
A tribunal of clerics would then hear evidence against him and decide whether to try him or hand him over to the Americans .
Whether or not this would have happened , Pakistan ’s Pervez Musharraf vetoed the plan .
According to the then Pakistani Foreign Minister , Niaz Naik , a senior US diplomat told him on 21 July 2001 that it had been decided to dispense with the Taliban " under a carpet of bombs " .
Acclaimed as the first victory in the war on terror , the attack on Afghanistan in October 2001 and its ripple effect caused the deaths of thousands of civilians who , even more than Iraqis , remain invisible to western eyes .
The family of Gulam Rasul is typical .
It was 7:45 am on 21 October .
The headmaster of a school in the town of Khair Khana , Rasul had just finished eating breakfast with his family and had walked outside to chat to a neighbour .
Inside the house were his wife , Shiekra , his four sons , aged three to ten , his brother and his wife , his sister and her husband .
He looked up to see an aircraft weaving in the sky , then his house exploded in a fireball behind him .
Nine people died in this attack by a US F - 16 dropping a 500 pound bomb .
The only survivor was his nine - year - old son , Ahmad Bilal .
" Most of the people killed in this war are not Taliban ; they are innocents , " Gulam Rasul told me .
" Was the killing of my family a mistake ?
No , it was not .
They fly their planes and look down on us , the mere Afghan people , who have no planes , and they bomb us for our birthright , and with all contempt . "
There was the wedding party in the village of Niazi Qala , 100 kilometres south of Kabul , to celebrate the marriage of the son of a respected farmer .
By all accounts it was a wonderfully boisterous affair , with music and singing .
The roar of aircraft started when everyone was asleep , at about three in the morning .
According to a United Nations report , the bombing lasted two hours and killed 52 people : 17 men , ten women and 25 children , many of whom were found blown to bits where they had desperately sought refuge , in a dried - up pond .
Such slaughter is not uncommon , and these days the dead are described as ‘ Taliban ’ ; or , if they are children , they are said to be " partly to blame for being at a site used by militants " – according to a US military spokesman on the BBC .
The British military have played an important part in this violence , having stepped up high - altitude bombing by up to 30 per cent since they took over command of NATO forces in Afghanistan in May 2006 .
This translated to more than 6,200 Afghan deaths last year .
In December , a contrived news event was the " fall " of a " Taliban stronghold " , Musa Qala , in southern Afghanistan .
Puppet Government forces were allowed to " liberate " rubble left by American B -52s .
What justifies this ?
Various fables have been spun – " building democracy " is one .
This is especially popular in Australia , where the new Prime Minister , Kevin Rudd , has expressed no interest in withdrawing Australia ’s contingent .
" The war on drugs " is the most perverse justification .
When the Americans invaded Afghanistan in 2001 they had one striking success .
They brought to an abrupt end a historic ban on opium production that the Taliban regime had achieved .
A UN official in Kabul described the ban to me as " a modern miracle " .
The miracle was quickly rescinded .
As a reward for supporting the Karzai ‘ democracy ’ , the Americans allowed Northern Alliance warlords to replant the country ’s entire opium crop in 2002 .
Twenty - eight out of the 32 provinces instantly went under cultivation .
Today , 90 per cent of world trade in opium originates in Afghanistan .
In 2005 , a British Government report estimated that 35,000 children in Britain were using heroin .
While the British taxpayer pays for a $ 2.2 billion military super - base in Helmand Province and the second - biggest British embassy in the world in Kabul , peanuts are spent on drug rehabilitation at home .
Tony Blair once said memorably : " To the Afghan people , we make this commitment .
We will not walk away . . .
[ We will offer ] some way out of the poverty that is your miserable existence . "
I thought about this as I watched children play in a destroyed cinema .
They were illiterate and so could not read the poster warning that unexploded cluster bombs lay in the debris .
" After five years of engagement , " reported James Fergusson in the London Independent on 16 December , " the [ UK ] Department for International Development had spent just [ $ 886 million ] on Afghan projects . ’
Unusually , Fergusson has had meetings with Taliban who are fighting the British .
" They remained charming and courteous throughout , " he wrote of one visit in February .
" This is the beauty of melmastia , the Pashtun tradition of hospitality towards strangers .
So long as he comes unarmed , even a mortal enemy can rely on a kind reception .
The opportunity for dialogue that melmastia affords is unique . "
This " opportunity for dialogue " is a far cry from the surrender - or - else offers made by the government of Gordon Brown .
What Brown and his Foreign Office advisers willfully fail to understand is that the tactical victory in Afghanistan in 2001 , achieved with bombs , has become a strategic disaster in South Asia .
Exacerbated by the assassination of Benazir Bhutto , the current turmoil in Pakistan has its contemporary roots in a Washington - contrived war in neighbouring Afghanistan that has alienated the Pashtuns who inhabit much of the long border area between the two countries .
This is also true of most Pakistanis , who , according to opinion polls , want their Government to negotiate a regional peace , rather than play a prescribed part in a rerun of Lord Curzon ’s Great Game .
The upheaval in Ukraine is presented as a battle between the people and Soviet - era power structures .
The role of western cold war - era agencies is taboo .
Poke your nose into the funding of the lavish carnival in Kiev , and the shrieks of rage show that you have touched a neuralgic point of the New World Order .
All politics costs money , and the crowd scenes broadcast daily from Kiev cost big bucks .
Market economics may have triumphed , but if Milton Friedman were to remind the recipients of free food and drink in Independence Square that " there is no such thing as a free lunch " , he would doubtless be branded a Stalinist .
Few seem to ask what the people paying for People Power want in return for sponsoring all those rock concerts .
As an old cold war swagman , who carried tens of thousands of dollars to Soviet - bloc dissidents alongside much better respected academics , perhaps I can cast some light on what a Romanian friend called " our clandestine period " .
Too many higher up the food chain of People Power seem reticent about making full disclosure .
Nowadays , we can google the names of foundations such as America 's National Endowment for Democracy ( NED ) and a myriad surrogates funding Ukraine 's Pora movement or " independent " media .
But unless you know the NED's James Woolsey was also head of the CIA 10 years ago , are you any wiser ?
Throughout the 1980s , in the build - up to 1989 's velvet revolutions , a small army of volunteers - and , let 's be frank , spies - co-operated to promote what became People Power .
A network of interlocking foundations and charities mushroomed to organise the logistics of transferring millions of dollars to dissidents .
The money came overwhelmingly from Nato states and covert allies such as " neutral " Sweden .
It is true that not every penny received by dissidents came from taxpayers .
The US billionaire , George Soros , set up the Open Society Foundation .
How much it gave is difficult to verify , because Mr Soros promotes openness for others , not himself .
Engels remarked that he saw no contradiction between making a million on the stock market in the morning and spending it on the revolution in the afternoon .
Our modern market revolutionaries are now inverting that process .
People beholden to them come to office with the power to privatise .
The hangover from People Power is shock therapy .
Each successive crowd is sold a multimedia vision of Euro - Atlantic prosperity by western - funded " independent " media to get them on the streets .
No one dwells on the mass unemployment , rampant insider dealing , growth of organised crime , prostitution and soaring death rates in successful People Power states .
In 1989 , our security services honed an ideal model as a mechanism for changing regimes , often using genuine volunteers .
Dislike of the way communist states constrained ordinary people 's lives led me into undercover work , but witnessing mass pauperisation and cynical opportunism in the 1990s bred my disillusionment .
Of course , I should have recognised the symptoms of corruption earlier .
Back in the 1980s , our media portrayed Prague dissidents as selfless academics who were reduced to poverty for their principles , when they were in fact receiving $ 600 - monthly stipends .
Now they sit in the front row of the new Euro - Atlantic ruling class .
The dowdy do - gooder who seemed so devoted to making sure that every penny of her " charity " money got to a needy recipient is now a facilitator for investors in our old stamping grounds .
The end of history was the birth of consultancy .
Grown cynical , the dissident types who embezzled the cash to fund , say , a hotel in the Buda hills did less harm than those that launched politico - media careers .
In Poland , the ex-dissident Adam Michnik 's Agora media empire - worth € 400 m today - grew out of the underground publishing world of Solidarity , funded by the CIA in the 1980s .
His newspapers now back the war in Iraq , despite its huge unpopularity among Poles .
Meanwhile , from the shipyard workers who founded Solidarity in 1980 to the Kolubara miners of Serbia , who proclaimed their town " the Gdansk of Serbia " in October 2000 , millions now have plenty of time on their hands to read about their role in history .
People Power is , it turns out , more about closing things than creating an open society .
It shuts factories but , worse still , minds .
Its advocates demand a free market in everything - except opinion .
The current ideology of New World Order ideologues , many of whom are renegade communists , is Market - Leninism - that combination of a dogmatic economic model with Machiavellian methods to grasp the levers of power .
Today 's only superpower uses its old cold war weapons , not against totalitarian regimes , but against governments that Washington has tired of .
Tiresome allies such as Shevardnadze in Georgia did everything the US wanted , but forgot the Soviet satirist Ilf 's wisdom : " It does n't matter whether you love the Party .
It matters whether the Party loves you . "
Georgia is of course a link in the chain of pipelines bringing central Asian oil and gas to Nato territory via Ukraine , of all places .
Such countries ' rulers should beware .
Fifty years ago , Zbigniew Brzezinski argued that the " politics of the permanent purge " typified Soviet communism .
Yet now he is always on hand to demand People Power topple yesterday 's favourite in favour of a new " reformer " .
" People Power " was coined in 1986 , when Washington decided Ferdinand Marcos had to go .
But it was events in Iran in 1953 that set the template .
Then , Anglo - American money stirred up anti-Mossadeq crowds to demand the restoration of the Shah .
The New York Times 's correspondent trumpeted the victory of the people over communism , even though he had given $ 50,000 and the CIA - drafted text of the anti-Mossadeq declaration to the coup leaders himself .
Is today 's official version of People Power similarly economical with the truth ?

As many of my readers know , we run over 200 recreation facilities across the country , from Washington to Florida .
This experience of serving nearly a million customers a year has yielded some odd insights .
One of the ones I published before is that the far - and - away worst litterers in the country are Southern Californians and LA residents in particular , California - eco - speak notwithstanding .
Another observation we have made is that many times our most difficult customers turn out to be law enforcement officers .
I 'm not talking about all of them - the vast majority of law enforcement officers are friendly , peaceful campers .
But when we have an incident of a customer refusing to follow the rules and wanting privileges no one else gets , like - as - not the customer is a law enforcement officer of some sort .
For example , we have had an off duty law - enforcement officer pay for one campsite , and then spread his stuff out over three , and refuse to limit himself to one site or pay for the other two he was using .
We have had off - duty law enforcement officers who had their car towed because it was parked for four hours in a tow - away zone , and then had their on - duty friends show up ( well out of their jurisdiction ) and interrogate our managers and otherwise harass them in retribution .
Heck , we have biker gangs come through that are more respectful of authority than certain off - duty law enforcement officers .
This irritating little site ( HT : Hit and Run ) possibly explains some things for me .
The site is apparently run by cops and is aimed at criticizing cops who do not extend other officers " professional courtesy " which apparently is a euphemism for " allow them to break the rules with impunity . "
Police officers who actually have the temerity to enforce the rules on other police officers are singled out as " dicks . "
Maybe I understand why some of our police officer customers are not accustomed to having to follow the same rules as everyone else .

The probe is focusing on accounting fraud , securitization of loans and insider trading , among other areas .
The FBI would n't identify the companies under investigation but said it is looking into allegations of fraud in various stages of the mortgage process , from companies that bundled the loans into securities to the banks that ended up holding them .

Facebook NEW YORK 
They went for a fun run Friday .
When Ryan Hall and Ryan Shay ran through Central Park with a group that included their wives , it was like a reunion .
Hall and his wife Sara Hall ( formerly Sara Bei ) were close friends with Shay 's wife , formerly Alicia Craig , from their Stanford days .
All four runners trained together for a few months last year in California .
U.S. MARATHON TRIALS : Hall , Ritzenhein , Sell win Olympic spots
When the two Ryans broke off after about four miles Friday to conserve their legs for the men's U.S. Olympic trials marathon the following day , Sara Hall and Alicia Shay continued for a few more miles .
" We talked about our husbands and nerves , what we do to help calm their nerves , " Sara Hall said .
They never imagined what would happen during Saturday 's race .
Ryan
Hall was one of the favorites to finish in the top three and earn a berth in August 's Beijing Olympics .
Ryan Shay was considered one of the dark horses .
While Hall was running five laps in Central Park , fashioning a trials record of 2 hours , 9 minutes , 2 seconds for the 26.2 miles , Shay collapsed beyond the 5 - mile mark .
Shay , 28 , was given CPR by bystanders and taken by an ambulance to Lenox Hill Hospital , where he was pronounced dead .
An autopsy Sunday proved inconclusive .
Medical examiners plan to examine slides of Shay 's heart tissue later this week .
But Shay 's father , Joe , said his son had been diagnosed with an enlarged heart at 14 but cleared by doctors then and as recently as the spring .
He told the Detroit Free Press that Lenox Hill medical staff told him that Ryan had suffered cardiac arrest and likely died before he hit the ground .
" The thing that made him such a great runner may have killed him , " Joe Shay told The Associated Press .
" He said the doctors told him that because your heart rate is so low , when you 're older you may need a pacemaker to make adjustments on that . "
Joe Vigil , who coaches Shay , said Sunday he did n't learn of the enlarged heart until seeing news reports Saturday night .
" There 's nothing wrong with an enlarged heart if it's the right kind , " said Vigil , a PhD in exercise physiology .
" Sometimes you do n't know why things happen .
" I test my people physiologically , and he has an excellent profile .
All his blood tests — we do three or four blood profiles a year — there was never any indication of any problem .
He is the epitome of health and strength . "
The top three finishers — Hall , Dathan Ritzenhein ( 2:11:07 ) and Brian Sell ( 2:11.40 ) — did n't learn of Shay 's death until after they finished the race .
Hall 's convincing win and Sell 's dramatic late - race surge were overshadowed by tragedy , leaving the race with a surreal atmosphere .
" This cuts a knife through everybody 's heart , " said a tearful Mary Wittenberg , CEO of the New York Road Runners , who put on Saturday 's race and stageed Sunday 's New York City Marathon .
" This casts a cloud over what otherwise was the greatest trials ever seen .
Three guys will be running with extra inspiration in Beijing .
It 's heart - wrenching that this happened . "
Pushing to the limit Deaths in marathons are not uncommon .
There are six to 10 a year , according to Running USA , an organization that keeps road - racing statistics .
But deaths of elite runners are unexpected .
Running experts could recall only one elite U.S. runner who had died while training .
In 1986 , Jeff Drenth died after a workout from irregular heart rhythm .
" They 're not supposed to happen at the height of an athlete 's life and on the biggest day of his career , " Wittenberg said .
USA Track & Field was unaware of another fatality at an Olympic trials .
George Hersh , the retired publisher of Runner 's World , has been around the sport for more than five decades .
" I can't recall anything like this , " he said .
Shay was part of a starting field of 130 .
A five - time U.S. champion on the roads and the 2001 NCAA 10,000 - meter champion at Notre Dame , he was known for his intensity .
Shay had greater desire and will than leg speed .
" He had an incredible ability to push himself , " Sara Hall said .
" I 've seen him collapse on treadmill tests before .
He could push himself to the limit .
I also saw a soft side of him with Alicia .
You could just tell his love for her .
That was a side I got to know more . "
Sell , who trains near Detroit , knew about Shay from their shared Michigan roots .
" He was from East Jordan , " Sell said .
" In Michigan , all the manhole covers are made by East Jordan Ironworks .
I always think of him every time I see one of those .
He 's a tough guy from a tough area . "
Both of Shay 's parents , Joe and Mary , have coached cross country at Central Lake ( Mich . )
High School , where Shay became the first four - time state champ in Michigan history .
His seven siblings are also runners .
Shay had described his professional career as " up and down . "
One of his lows was an 18th - place finish at the 2005 New York City Marathon .
The best part of the weekend was that he met Alicia Craig , who had set an NCAA 10,000 mark .
They began dating a few months later .
" They hit it off right away ; they were inseparable , " Sara Hall said .
Chasing a goal Shay had been training recently in Flagstaff , Ariz . , re-connecting with Vigil .
Shay had abandoned training with the Halls and others in Palo Alto , Calif . , and at altitude in Mammoth Lakes , Calif .
He moved to altitude in Flagstaff , where he could get more individual attention from Vigil .
He had run his personal best of 2:14:08 in finishing ninth at the 2004 New York City Marathon .
The week before Saturday 's trials , he commented on his need to run 2:11 to make the team .
" I know it 's going to be difficult , " Shay said .
" You just hope that you have the perfect day .
What else can I do , sit home ?
You go out there to race .
If you have the qualifying mark , you 've got to go out there .
That 's what makes our system of qualifying for the Olympic team great , because it gives even the biggest underdog a shot at making the team .
" I 've always felt that I could run three minutes faster than my best time , but obviously , I have n't done it yet .
I think I 've prepared to do it in my training .
It just depends on how healthy the body is that day and all the other factors that go into a marathon . "
To Sara Hall , Ryan Shay had shown no signs of trouble during their easy Friday run .
" Alicia expected him to have a good race , " Sara Hall said .
Said Vigil , " From working with him and working with elite athletes , he was ready to run .
His spirits were high .
Recently married .
Extremely happy .
Wonderful wife .
He was on top of the world . "
Shay was with the lead pack at five kilometers ( 3.1 miles ) , officially 21st .
But he never made it to the 10 K mark .
He was pronounced dead at 8:46 a.m. ET , 1 hour and 11 minutes into the marathon , a few minutes before Hall broke open the race , dropping the lead pack that also contained Ritzenhein , 2004 Olympian Dan Browne ( sixth , 2:13:23 ) , Olympic silver medalist Meb Keflezighi ( eighth , 2:15:09 ) and Abdi Abdirahman ( did not finish ) .
During the last couple of miles , Hall did a lot of fist pumping and pointing to the sky , celebrating what had been his dream since he was 13 — a chance to run in the Olympics .
Afterward he was subdued , remembering how Sara had been a bridesmaid at the Shay - Craig wedding in July in Jackson Hole , Wyo .
" The guy 's a workhorse , " said Hall , who stood on the start line next to Shay .
" Nobody ran harder than him .
He had a lot of passion .
I 'll be thinking of him when I 'm out there training .
He trained his butt off every single day .
He was inspiring to be around . "
After Ryan Hall had left the post - race conference , Sara Hall 's thoughts were with her friend Alicia .
Both Sara
Hall and Alicia Shay have qualified for the June 27 - July 6 track trials in Eugene , Ore . " I think it shows how fragile life is , " Sara Hall says .
" The different extremes :
You 're on a high one moment yet something completely opposite can be going on .
It makes us realize that it may seem like the Olympic trials is the end of the world and that it 's the most important thing .
lt 's obviously not .
We have such a short time .
What we do with our life , the people that we impact and the god we serve is the most important thing . "

Ca n’t smell the roses ?
Maybe you ’re depressed .
Smell too much like a rose yourself ?
Maybe you ’ve got the same problem .
Scientists from Tel Aviv University recently linked depression to a biological mechanism that affects the olfactory glands .
It might explain why some women , without realizing it , wear too much perfume .
Scientific research that supports this theory was published this year in the journal Arthritis and Rheumatism .
“ Our scientific findings suggest that women who are depressed are also losing their sense of smell , and may overcompensate by using more perfume , ” explains researcher Prof.
Yehuda Shoenfeld , a member of the Sackler Faculty of Medicine at Tel Aviv University .
“ We also believe that depression has biological roots and may be an immune system response to certain physiological cues . ”
Women who are depressed are also more likely to lose weight .
With a reduced sense of smell , they are less likely to have a healthy appetite , he says .
Prof .
Shoenfeld draws his conclusions from lifetime research on autoimmune diseases , focusing on conditions such as lupus , arthritis and rheumatism .
More Than a Feeling
Affecting about 1.5 million Americans , depression accompanying lupus , Prof .
Shoenfeld has found , is much more than an emotional reaction to being ill .
It appears to have a biological cause .

In lupus patients and those with other autoimmune diseases , a particle known as an “ autoantibody ” attacks the person ’s own immune system , appearing in the human body as an aberrant reaction to autoimmune diseases .
This particle “ is a real novelty , ” says Prof.
Shoenfeld .
“ We have found that , when generated , it weakens a person ’s sense of smell and can induce the feeling of depression . ”
Scientists today widely accept the fact that people with Alzheimer ’s disease lose their sense of smell .
Prof .
Shoenfeld ’s research is the first that links depression to smell in lupus patients , however .
The implications are wide and can be applied to the general population , says Prof.
Shoenfeld .
“ People who are depressed seem to respond well to aromatherapy .
Certain smells seem to help them overcome the effects of the biological factors , suggesting that depression may have a biological cause . ”
This research also raises questions about the cause of psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia .
“ There may be an organic cause to these disorders , and if this is the case , clinicians might have to change their attitude about current therapies they use , ” Prof .
Shoenfeld says .
“ I think that science is able to show that aromatherapy might not be just for quacks .
After all , some of these remedies have been used since the time of the Egyptians to treat organic diseases . ”
Prof .
Shoenfeld also suggests that a standardized “ smell test ” could be used by doctors to help diagnose depression as well as autoimmune diseases .
Retail Therapy and Aromatherapy
He adds that the association between one ’s sense of smell and depression has interesting implications for “ smell marketing , ” used by retailers to encourage shoppers to buy , especially around holiday time .
“ These tactics are already being used by retailers and banks all over the world , ” says Prof.
Shoenfeld .
“ The retail industry has learned that if it splashes good smells around , it can convince clients to buy more and invest more money .
It certainly has an effect on one ’s mood . ”
Prof .
Shoenfeld is an internationally recognized expert in autoimmune diseases and a medical doctor .
He is the head of the Department of Medicine “ B ” at the Sheba Medical Center in Israel and edits four medical journals , including Harefua ( in Hebrew ) , The Journal of Autoimmunity , Autoimmunity Reviews and the Israel Medical Association Journal .
Work on this recent study was done in close collaboration with Prof.
Joab Chapman , the head of the Neurology Department at Sheba Medical Center , and a professor at Tel Aviv University .
Fox & Friends livid at report that Olbermann ' runs MSNBC ' David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Wednesday January 16 , 2008
del.icio.us |
Print This Email This Round 172 of the war between MSNBC and Fox News commenced early Wednesday morning .
In a recent article on Keith Olbermann , a senior executive at MSNBC was cited as saying , " Keith runs MSNBC .
It 's been an amazing turnaround , because two years ago they were going to cancel him .
Because of his success , he 's in charge .
Chris Matthews is infuriated by it . "
As interpreted by the hosts of Fox & Friends , this statement means that " the truth according to Keith Olbermann at MSNBC is that he runs things .
He 's essentially running the news department . "
The Fox hosts took turns finding reasons to disparage Olbermann 's success , beginning with Gretchen Carlson , who stated insinuatingly , " Keith Olbermann has invented himself several times .
He never played sports , but he ended up being a popular sportscaster on ESPN .
He 's never really had a political background , but now -- in a surprising move , I think , if you 're trying to be objective -- he sits in on the political coverage with Chris Matthews . "
Steve Doocy then accused MSNBC of violating truth in advertising standards , saying , " Keith Olbermann 's show , while they consider it and they categorize it as a news show -- it 's not a news show .
It 's a commentary show .
It 's clearly commentary , and how they get away with that , I do n't know . "
Brian Kilmeade continued the same line of attack , quoting two classic Olbermann lines from December 2006 , when he called the Republican party " the leading terrorist group in this country " and said to President Bush , " You , sir , have now given us chaos and called it order .
You , sir , have now imposed subjugation and called it freedom . "
" That , I believe , " said Kilmeade triumphantly , " is an opinion . "
" And should we be concerned about the next quote ? " Carlson chimed in .
" ' Fox News is worse than Al - Qaeda . ' "
Doocy concluded by attempting to draw a contrast with the situation at Fox , saying , " Sean Hannity is a partisan .
... [ He and Alan Colmes ] do n't do our political coverage , they do commentary .
And it 's just extraordinary that MSNBC has got a partisan sitting in the chair , and not only that , he 's running the network . "
Fox 's Bill O'Reilly has engaged in a battle with Olbermann over who 's more " unfair and unbalanced " for a year or so , but the sniping between the cable news networks goes back almost five years .
In 2003 , the New York Times reported , " The nascent battle between the Fox News Channel and MSNBC for the hearts and minds of American television viewers has spilled over from news coverage to network promotions and jabs at each other . "
But unlike the Hatfields and McCoys , there does appear to be a clearcut reason for the enduring war .

This video is from Fox 's Fox & Friends , broadcast January 16 , 2008 .
Plate tectonics , the geologic process responsible for creating the Earth 's continents , mountain ranges , and ocean basins , may be an on - again , off - again affair .
Scientists have assumed that the shifting of crustal plates has been slow but continuous over most of the Earth 's history , but a new study from researchers at the Carnegie Institution suggests that plate tectonics may have ground to a halt at least once in our planet 's history -- and may do so again .
A key aspect of plate tectonic theory is that on geologic time scales ocean basins are transient features , opening and closing as plates shift .
Basins are consumed by a process called subduction , where oceanic plates descend into the Earth 's mantle .
Subduction zones are the sites of oceanic trenches , high earthquake activity , and most of the world 's major volcanoes .
Writing in the January 4 issue of Science , Paul Silver of the Carnegie Institution 's Department of Terrestrial Magnetism and former postdoctoral fellow Mark Behn ( now at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution ) point out that most of today 's subduction zones are located in the Pacific Ocean basin .
If the Pacific basin were to close , as it is predicted to do about in 350 million years when the westward - moving Americas collide with Eurasia , then most of the planet 's subduction zones would disappear with it .
This would effectively stop plate tectonics unless new subduction zones start up , but subduction initiation is poorly understood .
" The collision of India and Africa with Eurasia between 30 and 50 million years ago closed an ocean basin known as Tethys , " says Silver .
" But no new subduction zones have initiated south of either India or Africa to compensate for the loss of subduction by this ocean closure . "
Silver and Behn also present geochemical evidence from ancient igneous rocks indicating that around one billion years ago there was a lull in the type of volcanic activity normally associated with subduction .
This idea fits with other geologic evidence for the closure of a Pacific - type ocean basin at that time , welding the continents into a single " supercontinent " ( known to geologists as Rodinia ) and possibly snuffing out subduction for a while .
Rodinia eventually split apart when subduction and plate tectonics resumed .
Plate tectonics is driven by heat flowing from the Earth 's interior , and a stoppage would slow the rate of the Earth 's cooling , just as clamping a lid on a soup pot would slow the soup 's cooling .
By periodically clamping the lid on heat flow , intermittent plate tectonics may explain why the Earth has lost heat slower than current models predict .
And the buildup of heat beneath stagnant plates may explain the occurrence of certain igneous rocks in the middle of continents away from their normal locations in subduction zones .
" If plate tectonics indeed starts and stops , then continental evolution must be viewed in an entirely new light , since it dramatically broadens the range of possible evolutionary scenarios , " says Silver .
Interview with Prof. Ted Loder From : Tony Craddock < webmaster@cseti.org >
Date : Sun , 10 May 1998 17:54:36 - 0800 Interview with University of New Hampshire Professor Dr. Ted Loder : UFOs are not only real , they 're already here By AMANDA MILKOVITS Staff Writer Foster 's Sunday Citizen DURHAM -
An interstellar war and a covert military - industrial group that 's brainwashing Earthlings - it 's not a Hollywood feature , it 's reality , says Professor Ted Loder of the University of New Hampshire .
Loder , a full - time professor of chemical oceanography at UNH , has spent more than a year studying UFOs and alien reports , and says he 's convinced they 're no joke .
Now the 57 - year - old Seacoast man says he wants to " wake up " everyone else .
Loder represented the state of New Hampshire in a closed congressional briefing last summer , where those who claim to have seen UFOs requested a hearing with representatives from the White House , from the Joint Chiefs of Staff , and congressmen .
Loder became interested in UFOs more than a year ago , after his cousin , who had worked under President Eisenhower , told him that he'd seen material from a UFO that allegedly crashed in Roswell , N.M. , in 1947 .
The military has said the material was from an experimental spy balloon - and not a UFO .
Shows produced by Disney about UFOs , advertisements using aliens , crop circles , confidential military reports of UFO sightings - Loder sees all those as proof that aliens are here , and a secret covert organization is trying to condition Americans into thinking it 's all a myth .
And hoaxers who build crop circles and debunk UFO sightings are actually paid off by the covert organization , he says .
Loder is a member of The Center for the Study of Extraterrestrial Intelligence ( CSETI ) and works with its director , Dr. Steven Greer .
He says he 's seen UFOs , and so have astronauts and top military officials who are finally coming forward .
Loder realizes that much of what he believes sounds " out there " to casual observers , but believes he 's playing the role of Cassandra by talking about the implications of the disclosure of extra-terrestrial realities - and the possibilities from using alien technology .
He 'll speak about the implications on May 12 from 4:10 to 6 p.m. in James Hall , room 303 , on the UNH campus .
Professor Ted Loder :
Our planet is being visited by alien craft and it's about time that people know this .
This is the most important thing there is .
... I think the aliens who are visiting this planet are fed up with our monkey business .
I mean , look at this planet .
Look at this place .
We 're polluting ourselves to death ....
But I think the pressure is being put on by extra-terrestrials because there are more and more sightings going on .
Foster 's Sunday Citizen : Except , here 's the other side .
The Mutual UFO Network says of all the sightings they get , 90 percent are false .
Loder :
There is some of Venus and swamp gas ; it 's so laughable it 's ridiculous .
But if you see a large metallic disk hovering over your house with lights shining down on you , totally silent , it 's not going to be Venus , it 's not going to be swamp gas .
It 's a real thing .
FSC : The standard line from the military is we do not investigate UFOs ; we do not believe in UFOs .
And in a way , you can also hear they are probably sick to death of these reports .
...
And , come on , the military is not that good at covering stuff up .
Loder :
That 's why we know it 's out there .
They 're trying to pull it over on us .
Most people believe that .
FSC : Why bother covering something up ?
This is a capitalist society .
If there 's a great ( alien technology ) energy out there , we 'd jump on it and make some money .
Loder :
That 's where we get into a diabolical nature of things .
...
There 's a cadre of military , covert military and industrial groups that have been working on this technology for 50 years .
...
What happens when this stuff really comes out , not just you writing an article , but it finally makes people 's consciousness ?
They leave their football game , their beer bottles and say , `Holy cow .
This stuff is really , really real .' ... ( But ) the message is , This is not real .
...
That is the message the media has been putting out for 50 years .
And you guys have been orchestrated by the people who are jerking your chains .
FSC : So you think the media is being controlled ?
Loder : Absolutely .
FSC : Who are they being controlled by ?
Loder : I do n't know who 's pulling your chains .
Look at the history of this whole thing .
Back in the ' 50s , there was a very tight group put together by President Truman and some others .
I do n't know the historical details ... but there 's a group called the Majestic 12 .
...
Those were the initial cover - up people who were appointed to look into this thing and come up with strategies for keeping it undercover because we were at war with Russia at the time .
FSC : There 's a lot of talk about that , and you 're going to have other people say , " what cover - up ? "
Loder :
That 's fine .
They can just go their way .
( Loder quotes from an e-mail sent by a UFO watcher to Greer , saying a " Home Improvement " episode with an alien - bent was evidence that Disney was selected as part of the government 's plan for " conditioning a nd subsequent disclosure " ) ...
I 'm just going to make a point that this stuff is getting more and more into the media .
See the Volkswagen ad for the Volkswagen Bug .
The Bug comes flying in like a UFO , and it comes flying across the screen and they say , " reverse engineered from alien technology . "
FSC : Do n't you think the media is just having fun and making fun of it ?
It 's just a big , fat spoof .
Loder :
Of course it is .
That 's part of the point , is n't it ?
Semi-diabolical , people are being conditioned by this , whether the media is doing it consciously or unconsciously .
...
FSC : How do you personally decide what 's real and what 's too way out there ?
Loder : ( Holds up " The Day After Roswell " book by retired Col. Philip J. Corso ) .
...
His job in the '60s behind the scenes was to plant the material and technology from the Roswell crash , the UFO crash , to take the technology ... into industry within the United States so they could take this stuff and then they could develop stuff we could use .
...
It 's people like that with solid military credentials who are coming out and saying this stuff .
You 've got to pay attention .
This is not some guy who 's trying to make a quick buck .
FSC : Except what 's very conflicting is you 'll believe this military person , but you wo n't believe that military person .
What are the standards that you 're using to measure evidence so you know that you can back it up ?
LODER : That 's a very solid question .
When I first started looking into this , I had the knowledge from my cousin , who I trusted , who gave me solid references and stuff .
I could n't believe everything he was telling me either .
...
However , I 'm not going to throw it out because you get more into this thing and there 's a lot of stuff that you initially did n't believe , that 's real .
... One of the things that 's going on , hard to believe it , is that we 're basically at war with E.T. craft .
STAR WARS was developed to shoot down UFOs ; there 's a lot of evidence about that if you start digging .
STAR WARS was developed to shoot down Russian ( missiles ) - that 's the line we were given - but the side venue was to be able to shoot down UFOs , using this advanced technology .
...
And you talk to other people , whom I trust , and they talk to people in the military who have told them , yes , we have shot down UFOs .
We are fundamentally at war with these guys , and you and I do n't know about that .
We 're just going along , buying our groceries , drinking a beer and watching TV .
And the country , and the world , is at war with a bunch of intelligence that are so far ahead of us , it 's just ridiculous .
...
All kinds of people have seen them ( UFOs ) , and nobody talks about it , unless they get into an environment where they can talk , because of the giggle factor .
Because we have been programmed through the media and everything else .
Watch the things on TV .
FSC : They have these Jerry Springer guests on talking about their alien abductions ...
Loder : Yeah .
They get the weirdest guys , and they say , " man , I was outside and this thing came down . "
And you look at these guys and say , Oh yeah , there 's another one .
Whether it 's true or not , you do n't believe them .
And it 's purposely done that way to put a spin on it so you do n't truly believe it .
We 're being - I do n't want to appear diabolical - but we 're being slowly conditioned .
... It 's going to take more and more of our tax money to keep this under cover .
FSC : But this is n't appearing in any budget anywhere .
If I pick up the federal budget , where am I going to find the cover - up line ?
Loder : The National Security Agency ... last year admitted that they could n't find $ 2 billion in the budget .
So you ask about the $ 150 toilet seats .
Cost them $ 10 .
What did they do with the other $ 140 ?
You can figure it out .
Yeah , it does n't show up in the budget or it shows up in some budgets 10 layers down ... I do n't know how it works .
But it works .
...
FSC : The reaction I 've heard is it 's not possible .
There 's probably life , but that spaceships are swinging over trailer parks and abducting people for experiments - No . I know you 've heard that .
Loder :
That 's some of the wacko stuff and it 's put out there .
Some of that 's probably happening .
A lot of the abductions are done by the military .
FSC : No , come on ...
Loder : I can't even guess why the military does what it does .
To put fear into people , perhaps .
...
FSC : But that people have been abducted by aliens - you can't confuse that with the military .
Loder :
This is the military projecting things in your mind , so you think it 's aliens .
These technologies that they have , that are reverse engineered - I 'm not going to say any more because I 'll just blow you away .
I 'll just leave at there are technologies that are purely magic to what you and I know .
...
There 's still a lot of information available at the CIA .
( Holds up a thick book of 200 - plus pages of federal documents ) .
If you go through there , it 's pretty bloody obvious that the military has known about this stuff and has been covering up this stuff for 50 years .
FSC : How will you answer those people who say , " no way ? "
Are you afraid for your job ?
Loder : Listen , I went to a congressional briefing .
There were senators and representatives there , OK .
This is from a high level .
This is n't from the tabloids .
...
But I 'll tell you one thing here , in order to understand the whole phenomena of UFOs , you have to understand the government 's role , the military role , and some of this other fringe stuff .
Because without it , the picture is incomplete .
And the whole story makes up one of the most incredible , diabolical , strange , weird , whatever stories you 've heard .
I 've heard so many things that I cannot believe when I first heard them , but six months later I 'm saying , This is the way it is , guys .
That 's why you can't handle all the stuff I 'm telling you , because I 'm telling you stuff that 's taken me a year and a half and hundreds of hours to learn , and I 'm leaving out 80 percent of it .
FSC : What scares you now ?
Loder : ... What scares me is that this information is not going to get out to the people of this world who should know it .
That it 's going to continue to be kept under cover .
I do n't believe it 's going to happen because I think there are more and more UFOs being sighted , and after a while , somebody 's got to pay attention to this .
... I 'm majorly concerned that our government will continue to be at war with the E.T.s , will continue to try to cover the thing up , spending our money to do so , keeping this knowledge from the human population .
And in doing so , continue to pollute and degrade the planet .
...
The alien technologies include such things as anti-gravity and other non-polluting sources of energy .
It does n't take a rocket scientist to know if you have anti-gravity at your disposal and it can be created using relatively clean energy , this has an impact on our transportation issues .
... You wonder why it 's been kept under wraps ?
It 's pretty obvious .
FSC : No , I do n't understand why it 's been kept under wraps .
You can make a lot of money from anti-gravity , but no one 's done that .
Loder :
Well , I do n't know the reasons for this .
Part of it is , if they admit we have these technologies , question number one is , Gee , where did you get it .
Answer :
We can't tell you where we got it , but we got it .
But it will become obvious real quick that we did n't develop this on planet Earth :
It came from extra-terrestrials .
Now the government , which has been covering this up for 50 years for their own reasons , has to admit that they 've been covering the biggest secret there is from the world population .
...
FSC : What do you think about the recent proliferation of alien and UFOs in the popular media ?
Loder :
It 's a raising of the awareness that the control group , the people who run the world behind the scenes - I do n't want to get into that because it 's fringey stuff .
FSC : Except that you 've mentioned the control group an awful lot .
Do you believe there is a control group or not ?
Loder : Yes , I do .
But it 's very segmented , and whether it's one group or several groups , I do n't really know .
Dr. Greer is watched , his phones are tapped ... mine may be tapped , I do n't know .
...
FSC : Are you concerned about ridicule from students or any serious problems ?
Loder : I talked to a number of students in my classes .
I talked about the carbon dioxide , fossil fuel burning , the greenhouse warming , and all these things are real .
...
That 's the bad news .
The good news is we have buried away , waiting in the wings , technologies reverse engineered from alien craft that have flown in or been shot down , and these technologies are non-polluting and include anti-gravity and other stuff .
And it 's going to be available to all of us .
And I think that 's going to save our butts .
So , I try to put this in some sort of a context and furthermore , I tell them I 've been to a congressional briefing .
And then a lot of students came up and said , When are you going to give the talk ?
FSC : So you 're not concerned ?
LODER : I would be concerned if I was the lone person from the planet talking about this ....
The reason I decided to do something about this , is because this is probably the most important thing there is in terms of how it affects our planet , how it affects our philosophy , how it affects our religion , how it affects our environment , how it affects the people 's view of themselves as a race , how it affects our political wars .
When suddenly , we as a planet are being asked to join the interstellar blah , blah , blah organization , we 're going to have to get our act together .
" Oh my God , things are bigger than we thought they were .
We 'd better clean up our act . "
I think this is going to change things dramatically .
... I 'm trying to make people aware .
It 's , " hey , guys ( whistles ) heads up ! "
There 's some interesting things going on that you may want to be aware of .
It 's going to affect all of us down the line .
And whether it happens in 1998 , 1999 , 2000 , 2001 , 2002 , it 's going to happen in that time frame .

RELEVANCE OF THIS MESSAGE : UFO personalities Index : Ted Loder ( #3 ) Created : May 10 , 1998
The FBI today said it wants to install 150 digital billboards in 20 major U.S. cities in the next few weeks to show fugitive mug shots , missing people and high - priority security messages from the big bureau .
The initiative is made possible through a partnership with Clear Channel Outdoor , the advertising company that ’s providing the space as a public service .
The billboards will let the FBI highlight those people it is looking for the most : violent criminals , kidnap victims , missing kids , bank robbers , even terrorists , the FBI said in a release .
And the billboards will be able to be updated largely in real - time — right after a crime is committed , a child is taken , or an attack is launched .
The FBI said it tested its first billboard in the Philadelphia area in September , with crystal - clear images of 11 of its most violent fugitives on eight billboards and a 24 - hour hotline for the public to call .
The billboards paid quick public safety dividends .
In October , two fugitives were captured as a direct result of the publicity , the FBI said .
Chicago , Las Vegas , Los Angeles and Miami will be among those cities provided with the new billboards , along with Milwaukee and Philadelphia .
The FBI said Atlanta , Cleveland , Indianapolis , Memphis and Minneapolis will also get the billboards , as will Akron , Ohio ; Columbus , Ohio ; Albuquerque , N.M. ; El Paso , Texas ; Des Moines , Iowa ; Newark , N.J. ; Wichita , Kan. ; and the Florida cities of Tampa and Orlando .
Using digital billboards to put pressure on criminals is not an entirely new concept .
According to a CNN report , in September , Florida authorities arrested a drug suspect two weeks after his photo was displayed on a billboard in Daytona Beach .
A tipster who saw the suspect 's picture found him sitting in a McDonald's .
The billboards have also been useful in disasters .
When an interstate bridge collapsed in August in Minneapolis , billboards displayed an emergency message within 15 minutes , the report stated .
The downside is that only a small fraction of U.S. billboards are digital – 500 or so out of estimated 450,000 total signs , according to published reports .
Plouffe :
She can't catch us
As we wrote last night , Obama has begun to make his own inevitablity case , and David Plouffe made it explicit on a conference call this morning , telling reporters that it's now " next to impossible " for Clinton to surpass what he says is a 136 - person lead among pledged delegates .
" The only way she could do it is by winning most of the rest of the contests by 25 to 30 points , " he said .
" Even the most creative math really does not get her , ever , back to even in terms of pledged delegates . "
" This is not about votes -- it 's about delegates , " Plouffe said .
The other half of this case , of course , is that superdelegates will and / or should follow the pledged delegates .
The censored version of the body map images
The state - of - the - art body maps have been developed for the NHS Choices website .
The maps , to be launched next month , allow users to strip away the dummies ' skin to explore information about diseases and treatments .
The public will be able to vote on the issue via the website .
I 'm all for the genitalia , anything else would just be an overly prudish Victorian approach
Professor Sir Muir Gray
Professor Sir Muir Gray , chief knowledge officer for the NHS , is opposed to any censoring of the images .
He said : " I 'm all for the genitalia , anything else would just be an overly prudish Victorian approach .
" It 's completely bonkers : the edited versions resemble space aliens .
People have to accept this is the 21st century . "
Sir Muir conceded that some parents might not want their children to see anatomically correct naked images .
But he said the evidence suggested the straightforward approach was more effective with young people .
The debate over how the human body is depicted is goes back thousands of years .
Ancient Greeks
The ancient Greeks believed that heroes and gods should be depicted in a state of " heroic nudity " .
This became the norm for most depictions of the human form in art and science until the middle of the 19th century when the public began to demand more modest portraiture .
Even today , body maps on health websites worldwide appear with their genitalia masked or pixelated .
Paul Nuki , editor of the NHS Choices site , said : " I think it 's an American modesty that has set the tone for this sort of thing on the net and , for some , it 's now become a worry to let it all hang out .
" On the other hand , we 've got some very strong internal advocates for the full monty .
In the end we thought it best that our users have a proper say . "
Sir Muir is proposing an optional ' drag and drop ' fig leaf for the NHS virtual Adam and Eve , so visitors have the option keeping the body - maps covered up .
The White House struggled to portray the estimate as a validation of Mr. Bush ’s strategy , a contention that required swimming against the tide of Mr. Bush ’s and Mr. Cheney ’s occasionally apocalyptic language .
The national security adviser , Stephen J. Hadley , said the estimate showed that suspicions about Iran ’s intentions were warranted , given that it had a weapons program in the first place .
“ On balance , the estimate is good news , ” Mr. Hadley said , appearing at the White House .
“ On one hand , it confirms that we were right to be worried about Iran seeking to develop nuclear weapons .
On the other hand , it tells us that we have made some progress in trying to ensure that that does not happen .
But it also tells us that the risk of Iran acquiring a nuclear weapon remains a very serious problem . ”
Mr. Hadley insisted , as he and others have , that the administration had hoped and still hoped to resolve the outstanding questions about Iran ’s nuclear programs using diplomacy , not force .
But the nuances of his on - this - hand - on - the - other argument will probably make it much harder to persuade American allies to accept the administration ’s harder line .
One official pointed out that the chief American diplomat on the Iran question , Under Secretary of State R. Nicholas Burns , had just met with counterparts from Europe , Russia and China , and had seemed to make some headway on winning support for a third round of sanctions by the United Nations Security Council .
The official said Mr. Burns could not divulge the intelligence findings at that meeting on Friday because Congress had not been briefed .
The immediate task for Mr. Burns and other administration officials is to untangle the confusion caused by its own statements and findings and to persuade skeptics that this time , the United States has it right about what Iran was doing before 2003 and what that means for what it might do in the future .
Is Microsoft the Great Satan ?
This article was given a major rewrite in 2009 .
The old version is also available .
Many people think of Microsoft as the monster menace of the software industry .
There is even a specific campaign to boycott Microsoft .
This feeling has intensified since Microsoft expressed active hostility towards free software .
In the free software movement , our perspective is different .
We see that Microsoft is doing something that mistreats software users : making software proprietary and thus denying users their rightful freedom .
But Microsoft is not alone in this ; many other companies do the same thing to the users .
If other companies manage to dominate fewer users than Microsoft , that is not for lack of trying .
This is not meant to excuse Microsoft .
Rather , it is meant as a reminder that Microsoft is the natural development of a software industry based on keeping users divided and subjugating them .
When criticizing Microsoft , we should not focus so narrowly on Microsoft that we let other proprietary software developers off the hook .
When we reject Microsoft 's proprietary software , that is not a boycott .
The word “ boycott ” means rejection , as a protest , of products that are otherwise acceptable .
Rejecting a product because it hurts you is not a boycott , just ordinary rationality .
To maintain your freedom , you need to reject the software that takes away freedom , regardless of who developed it or who distributes it .
There is no need to reject Microsoft non -software products , or services that you can use without proprietary software .
( When you use a web service , whether Microsoft 's or not , watch out for non-free JavaScript programs that it may try to slip into your browser . )
When Microsoft releases free programs , which it occasionally does , they are acceptable in theory .
Alas , most of them depend fundamentally on Microsoft proprietary software , which we do need to reject , and that makes them useless for anyone that chooses to live in freedom .
In the “ Halloween documents ” , leaked in October 1998 , Microsoft executives stated an intention to use various methods to obstruct the development of free software : specifically , designing secret protocols and file formats , and patenting algorithms and software features .
These obstructionist policies were not new : Microsoft , and many other software companies , had been doing them for years .
Secrecy and patents have obstructed us greatly , and they may be more damaging in the future .
For the most part , the companies ' main motivation in doing these things is to attack each other ; now , it seems , we are specifically targeted .
Microsoft is using its patents directly to attack the free software community , and our community is fighting back .
But Microsoft 's patents are not the only patents that threaten us ( and software developers and users generally ) — consider the harm that the MP3 patents have done .
Thus , defending against specific attacks is necessary but not sufficient .
The only full solution is to eliminate software patents .
Other Microsoft practices specifically harmful to the adoption of free software are the ones designed to build up social inertia that obstructs migration to GNU / Linux .
For instance , when Microsoft “ donates ” copies of Windows to schools , it converts these schools into tools for implanting a dependence on Windows .
There are indications that Microsoft systematically plans these activities as a campaign against the adoption of GNU / Linux .
Each Windows “ upgrade ” augments Microsoft 's power over the users ; Microsoft plans it that way .
And each one is a step forward in malicious features , which include Digital Restrictions Management and back doors .
So the FSF runs campaigns to warn users against “ upgrading ” to Windows Vista and Windows 7 .
We aim to reduce the amount of inertia they will create .
We do n't hate Microsoft , and we do n't consider it the Great Satan .
But we do recognize it as the company that has separated more users from their freedom than any other , and a powerful avowed enemy of computer users ' freedom .
We act accordingly .
Buying of the President : Website a ' one - stop source ' of eyebrow - raising info for 2008 election Mike Sheehan

An independent research organization has unveiled a website that examines " how big money and special interests influence the path to the Oval Office . "
The Center for Public Integrity states in a press release obtained by RAW STORY that an award - winning team of researchers and journalists has built " The Buying of the President 2008 " on its behalf .
It is the latest in a continuing series that began in the 1996 election year .
The site , www.buyingofthepresident.org, is described as " a one - stop source of information about the 2008 election , featuring profiles of the candidates , their donors , and advisers , as well as the latest fundraising news . "
An executive director for the Center further states that the website " is a quintessential must - read for journalists , policy makers , and political enthusiasts alike who want to broaden their curiosity and pursuit of the purse strings behind presidential campaigns . "
One feature of " Buying of the President , " entitled " The Auction Blog , " focuses on how money is shaping the '08 White House race , the release notes .
The site also boasts interviews with dozens of presidential candidates , campaign strategists , consultants and other notable figures ; among the names dropped are such political luminaries as George McGovern , Bob Dole , Michael Dukakis , Geraldine Ferraro , Carol Moseley Braun and Ted Kennedy .
The Center was founded in 1989 by reporter and former ' 60 Minutes ' staffer Charles Lewis to investigate corruption in the nation 's capital .
It has come under fire from some critics who charge that funding for its various projects originates from wealthy liberal activists like George Soros , but the criticism is tempered by praise from such icons of American journalism and scholarship as Walter Cronkite , Bill Moyers , and the late Arthur Schlesinger , Jr. , who described the Center as " an indispensable truth - teller in a treacherous time . "
* Illustration : Christian Northeast * Sometime in the 1990s , the concept of better living through chemistry turned a corner , thanks to drug companies ' efforts to synthesize antidotes for every possible mood swing .
So writes
Yale lecturer Charles Barber in his new book , Comfortably Numb : How Psychiatry Is Medicating a Nation .
An OCD sufferer himself , Barber spent a decade working in places like New York City 's Bellevue Hospital .
He knew something was wrong when he discovered that his colleagues ' perfectly functional , $ 300 - an - hour Upper West Side clients were taking the same potent pills as his own schizoid , homeless , crackhead patients .
" I would spend part of the day in shelters dealing with seriously ill people , " Barber says .
" Then I 'd go to cocktail parties and find out that the people there were on the same medications . "
He proposes that we just say no to multinational drug peddlers and heal ourselves with cognitive and dialectical behavioral therapies — " talk therapy " techniques that minimize pill pushing , dispense with Freudian dream analysis , and engage patients in actively reprogramming their own brains .
It 's like " a highly selective carpentry of the soul , " Barber writes — therapy as self - engineering .
He does acknowledge the need for medication in the hardest cases .
Just like cancer , severe mood disorders can be life - threatening and should be treated as such , Barber says .
But we need to distinguish between real depression and just being bummed out .
The vast majority of the 227 million prescriptions for antidepressants in 2006 , he notes , were for people in the second category .
Barber lambastes the drug industry for its attempt to turn " the worried well " into customers ; he also takes aim at the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders for according disorder status to conditions like social anxiety and adjusting to a cross-country move .
" Nonsense , " Barber writes , " anger , greed , laziness , impulsivity , as well as jealousy , lust , anguish , and so on , are simply part of the human predicament .
They are not medical conditions . "

Marion Jones Going to Prison for 6 Months
Three time Olympic Gold Medalist Marion Jones was sentenced to six months in prison today .
The sentence stems from Jones admitting to using steroids and a check - fraud scam .
Marion will have to surrender by March 11 to begin her 6 month prison stay .
The judge in this case said he is handing out the maximum sentence to make sure it sends a message to all athletes that this will no longer be accepted and athletes will have to pay the consequences .
Not only will Jones have to go to jail but she will also be sentenced to 800 hours of community service and two years probation .
Jones commented , " I respect the judge 's order , and I truly hope that people learn from my mistakes . "
The runner will be leaving behind her two small boys , one a baby she is still nursing .
Commenter Brian makes an observation " No one is talking about how the polls actually nailed Obama 's number .
Obama did n't lose this election .
He stayed steady and Hillary surged ahead . "
That seems to be true .
Here 's a chart comparing the actual results to the most recent Pollster.com current standard estimate polling average .
Just as Brian says , the difference between the Obama poll level and the Obama vote total level seems to just be your basic statistical variance .
The pollsters underestimated Clinton 's level of support .
People who were undecided as of the last round of polling seem to have gone overwhelmingly in her direction .
[ also note the relevance of this to Wilder / Bradley effect speculations ]

* Illustration : Rodrigo Corral * Recently I read a novella that posed a really deep question :
What would happen if physical property could be duplicated like an MP3 file ?
What if a poor society could prosper simply by making pirated copies of cars , clothes , or drugs that cure fatal illnesses ?
The answer Cory Doctorow offers in his novella After the Siege is that you 'd get a brutal war .
The wealthy countries that invented the original objects would freak out , demand royalties from the developing ones , and , when they did n't get them , invade .
Told from the perspective of a young girl trying to survive in a poor country being bombed by well - off adversaries , After the Siege is an absolute delight , by turns horrifying , witty , and touching .
Technically , After the Siege is a work of science fiction .
But as with so many sci - fi stories , it works on two levels , exploring real - world issues like the plight of African countries that can't afford AIDS drugs .
The upshot is that Doctorow 's fiction got me thinking — on a Lockean level — about the nature of international law , justice , and property .
Which brings me to my point .
If you want to read books that tackle profound philosophical questions , then the best — and perhaps only — place to turn these days is sci-fi .
Science fiction is the last great literature of ideas .
From where I sit , traditional " literary fiction " has dropped the ball .
I studied literature in college , and throughout my twenties I voraciously read contemporary fiction .
Then , eight or nine years ago , I found myself getting — well — bored .
Why ?
I think it 's because I was reading novel after novel about the real world .
And there are , at the risk of sounding superweird , only so many ways to describe reality .
After I 'd read my 189th novel about someone living in a city , working in a basically realistic job and having a realistic relationship and a realistically fraught family , I was like , " OK .
Cool .
I see how today 's world works . "
I also started to feel like I 'd been reading the same book over and over again .
Here 's my overly reductive , incredibly nerdy way of thinking about the novel : Consider it a simulation , kind of like The Sims .
If you run a realistic simulation enough times — writing tens of thousands of novels about contemporary life — eventually you 're going to explore almost every outcome .
So what do you do then ?
You change the physics in the sim .
Alter reality — and see what new results you get .
Which is precisely what sci - fi does .
Its authors rewrite one or two basic rules about society and then examine how humanity responds — so we can learn more about ourselves .
How would love change if we lived to be 500 ?
If you could travel back in time and revise decisions , would you ?
What if you could confront , talk to , or kill God ?
Teenagers love to ponder such massive , brain - shaking concepts , which is precisely why they devour novels like Philip Pullman 's His Dark Materials , the Narnia series , the Harry Potter books , and Ender 's Game .
They know that big - idea novels are more likely to have an embossed foil dragon on the cover than a Booker Prize badge .
Adults and serious intellectuals used to love ruminating over this stuff , too .
Thought experiments formed the foundation of Western philosophy — from Socrates to Thomas Hobbes to Simone de Beauvoir .
So , then , why does sci - fi , the inheritor of this intellectual tradition , get short shrift among serious adult readers ?
Probably because the genre tolerates execrable prose stylists .
Plus , many of sci - fi's most famous authors — like Robert Heinlein and Philip K. Dick — have positively deranged notions about the inner lives of women .
But the worm is turning .
For whatever reasons — maybe the reality fatigue I 've felt — a lot of literary writers are trying their hand at speculative fiction .
Philip Roth used a " counterfactual " history — what if Nazi sympathizers in the US won the 1940 election ? — to explore anti-Semitism in The Plot Against America .
Cormac McCarthy muses on the nature of morality in the Hobbesian anarchy of his novel The Road .
Then there 's the genre - bending likes of Michael Chabon , Jonathan Lethem , Susanna Clarke , and Margaret Atwood ( whom I like to think of as a sci - fi novelist trapped inside a literary author ) .
Those are n't writers whose books are adorned with embossed dragons .
But that does n't mean they do n't owe that dragon a large debt .

Answers in Genesis is excited to announce the launch of its online technical journal called Answers Research Journal ( ARJ ) .
Hosted at answersresearchjournal.org ( but linked to AiG ’s website ) , this is a professional peer - reviewed technical journal for the publication of interdisciplinary scientific and other relevant research from the perspective of the recent Creation and the global Flood within a biblical framework .
Addressing the need to disseminate the vast fields of research conducted by creationist experts in theology , history , archaeology , anthropology , biology , geology , astronomy , and other disciplines of science , Answers Research Journal provides scientists and students the results of cutting - edge research that demonstrates the validity of the young - earth model , the global Flood , the non-evolutionary origin of “ created kinds , ” and other evidences that are consistent with the biblical account of origins .
The newly expanded research effort at Answers in Genesis , with the establishment of its Research Department , facilitates this further venue for publication and dissemination of the results of creationist research .
Answers in Genesis appointed Dr. Andrew Snelling , its director of research , as the ARJ editor - in - chief .
Dr. Snelling , formerly a professor of geology at the Institute for Creation Research ( ICR ) , was the founding editor of the Creation Ex Nihilo Technical Journal , now the Journal of Creation , and served as the editor - in - chief for the Sixth International Conference on Creationism , co-sponsored by ICR and the Creation Science Fellowship of Pittsburgh .
Other PhD scientists and theologians , both on AiG ’s research staff and in AiG ’s large network of well - qualified resource people , serve as contributors , reviewers , and editors .
The Papers
Steps for Submission Read the Instructions to Authors Manual ( PDF ) Email papers , diagrams , tables , etc. to the email address listed in the Manual .
High - quality papers for Answers Research Journal , sponsored by Answers in Genesis , are now invited for submission .
Interested authors should download and read the Instructions to Authors Manual ( PDF ) for all details of requirements , procedures , paper mechanics , referencing style , and the technical review process for submitted papers .
Papers should be no more than 10,000 words long .
Color diagrams , figures , and photographs are encouraged .
Papers can be in any relevant field of science , theology , history , or social science , but they must be from a young - earth and young - universe perspective .
Rather than merely pointing out flaws in evolutionary theory , papers should aim to assist the development of the Creation and Flood model of origins .
Papers should be submitted in a plain text , single - spaced Word or RTF file .
Formatting should be kept to an absolute minimum .
Do not embed graphics , tables , figures , or photographs in the text , but supply them in separate files , along with captions .
Papers , diagrams , tables , etc. should be emailed as attached files to ARJ to the email address listed in the Instructions Manual , and other requirements should be followed as per the Author Checklist in the Instructions to Authors Manual .
There is no strict publication schedule .
As soon as they are ready , successful papers are posted in sequence in the ARJ volume for each year .
We aim to publish submitted papers within three ( 3 ) months of receipt .
Answers in Genesis hopes that the online publication of its Answers Research Journal encourages Christians globally with the results of the latest creationist research , providing them with new resources for use in their research and education , and in their witnessing to the truth and authority of God ’s Word .
During today 's White House press briefing , the subject of a circulated early draft of Bush 's United Nations speech came up :
MS . PERINO : On the speech -- your question about the speech , the drafts are circulated , and there was an error made in trying to make sure that interpreters had what they needed .
I do n't know how the draft of the speech -- it was not final -- was posted , but it was , and it was taken down .
There 's really nothing more to say about it .
Q And they were phonetic spellings of various countries -- as well , we understand .
MS. PERINO : That 's not unusual .
We do that for many speeches .
Q Does the President have a hard time pronouncing some of these countries 's name ?
MS. PERINO : I think that 's a offensive question .
I 'm going to just decline to comment on it .
Stuart Witt , a former test pilot who runs the airport in this weathered desert town , was working at his desk when he heard the explosion .
“ I turned and looked out the window , ” said Witt , 54 .
“ There was a trace of dust in the air over by the east - side test area . ”
His assistant suggested it was a sonic boom , a frequent occurrence in the desert airspace near Edwards Air Force Base .
But Witt knew better .
Sonic booms come in pairs .
This was one loud explosion , so powerful it was heard in Palmdale , 30 miles away .
The blast , which killed three men and injured three others , occurred during a fuel - flow test in July at Scaled Composites , the famed aerospace company that is building a suborbital rocket plane for Richard Branson ’s Virgin Galactic space line .
For this desert hamlet of 3,700 , located , as they say , “ a full tank of gas and a full bladder north of Los Angeles , ” it was a space - age wake - up call .
Fifty years after the Soviets launched the satellite Sputnik 1 into space , Mojave has found itself at the center of a private space race that boosters say is as important -- and risky -- as the nationalistic race between the Soviets and the United States .
This time , a group of ambitious entrepreneurs is leading the competition to launch regular Janes and Joes into space .
“ Mojave is the place to be , ” said Jeff Greason , a co-founder of Xcor Aerospace Inc. , one of the larger rocket companies that has sprouted in the desert .
“ This is the Silicon Valley for the new industry . ”
Half a dozen companies , from big - time operations like Scaled Composites to lemonade - stand - scale business with a handful of engineers working in stifling warehouses , dot the barren landscape around the Mojave Air & Space Port .
Each company has its own remote testing site in the midst of the chaparral .
“ The same things bring people to Mojave that brought Orville and Wilbur to Kitty Hawk , ” Witt said .
“ Freedom from encroachment , industrial espionage , the press and a steady breeze . ”
Dave Masten , the head of Masten Space Systems Inc. , a bootstrap firm with five employees , has another explanation for the rocket boom in Mojave .
The vastness of the landscape has inspired a high level of tolerance for dreamers and wayfarers .
Masten made a chunk of money in software development , then moved from the Bay Area to Mojave to join the private space race .
He has spent a million dollars but has yet to launch anything more than a few feet above the surface of Earth .
He likes the camaraderie he ’s found in the desert .
“ People come by to beg a cup of lox , ” he joked , referring to the liquid oxygen used for rocket fuel .
Besides , testing rockets in the Bay Area would be considered antisocial .
“ Here , we can do it anytime , anyplace , and nobody cares , ” Masten said .
Atrip to Mojave is in one sense a journey to a place out of another time .
Though the dim , low - ceilinged bars that once dotted the coast have been replaced by jazz clubs , the desert northeast of Los Angeles looks as stingy and friendless as it did before the arrival of the railroads .
At the end of a long drive out Highway 14 -- beyond the boom - and - bust desert metropolises of Palmdale and Lancaster , beyond the once - secret test facilities at Edwards Air Force Base -- the desert resolves into a crouched , narrow strip of fast - food establishments and motels still boasting of private showers and a TV in every room .
Yet Mojave ’s isolation has made it “ an optimistic place , ” said Bill Deaver , a town historian and the brother of Michael K. Deaver , the recently deceased deputy chief of staff to President Reagan .
Deaver , a gruff - voiced man of 71 , arrived in 1948 .
His father , Paul , was a gasoline distributor ; his mother , Marion , wrote for the Bakersfield Californian , covering experimental aircraft flights at Edwards in the 1950s and 1960s .
According to Deaver , publisher of the Mojave Desert News , the town was founded by Southern Pacific Railroad in 1876 as a stopover on the line between San Francisco and Los Angeles .
It became a watering hole for parched miners who flooded into the area after gold was discovered on nearby Soledad Mountain .
While some dug for gold at the Elephant - Eagle , Yellow Dog and Golden Queen mines , others dug out borax , a mineral used in detergents .
The trip by 20 - mule team from Death Valley to the railroad station at Mojave took 15 days and covered 160 miles .
In modern times , the airport has developed into a focal point of local industry .
It was used to train military pilots during World War II and the Korean War .
More recently , it ’s been largely known as a boneyard for decommissioned passenger jets .
What has persisted through good times and bad is the vast emptiness of the place .
It ’s the reason the Air Force ’s flight test center is at Edwards , along with NASA ’s Dryden Flight Research Center .
The first space entrepreneur in Mojave was inventor Gary Hudson , who started Rotary Rocket Inc. in the late 1990s .
He wanted to build a rocket with helicopter blades that would lift the craft into the atmosphere .
Rockets would then ignite , sending the craft into space .
The craft was built by Scaled Composites , which was started by pioneering aircraft designer Burt Rutan .
Rutan came to the desert in the 1960s to work at Edwards , and later broke away to build experimental aircraft on his own .
But the rotary rocket managed only a few test flights before Hudson ran out of money , a common problem that still haunts private rocketeers .
Rutan latched on to the rocket idea and decided to build his own .
He was driven in part by a $ 10 - million competition sponsored by the X Prize Foundation to create the first privately funded manned spacecraft .
In 2004 , Rutan ’s ungainly looking SpaceShipOne and its pilot , Mike Melvill , journeyed to an altitude of 100 kilometers , winning the Ansari X Prize .
It was a milestone in spaceflight .
Virgin Galactic has already started booking flights aboard a Rutan - built craft for $ 200,000 a trip .
The company hopes to begin launching in 2009 .
Today , the private space industry makes up about 10 % of the business at the airport , Witt said .
People “ have a sense of pride ” over the airport ’s role as a birthplace of private spaceflight , Deaver said .
The town is facing increasing competition in becoming the center of private space travel .
In addition to Mojave , the Federal Aviation Administration has licensed five other private spaceports , including Narrow Cape , Alaska ; Wallops Island , Va. ; and Burns Flat , Okla .
A variety of rocket companies , such as Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos ’ Blue Origin in Texas , and PayPal co-founder Elon Musk ’s Space Exploration Technologies Corp. in El Segundo , have sprouted around the country .
But Mojave has its advantages , including experience , history and battle - hardened nerves .
After the demise of the rotary rocket , some of the engineers continued working on rockets .
Greason co-founded Xcor Aerospace in 1999 , and today it is the second - biggest space company in the area after Scaled Composites .
It has 35 employees and was recently named to Inc. magazine ’s list of the 500 fastest - growing companies in America .
“ I ’m not an Internet gazillionaire , ” Greason said .
“ We had to claw our way up .
Not taking salaries the first couple of years helped . ”
Xcor is building a vehicle for the Rocket Racing League , a proposed venture pitting rocket - powered planes against each other .
After that , the next milestone is a suborbital vehicle that would compete with Virgin Galactic .
Instead of eight passengers , Xcor ’s vehicle would carry one pilot and one passenger .
Land is cheap and rents are low , Greason said .
Also , “ nobody complains about making noise , or sending plumes into the sky . ”
Indeed , Mojave has taken the explosion at Scaled Composites in stride .
In some ways , it ’s nothing new to a town built on mining and experimental aircraft .
The town ’s history with big explosions dates to 1884 , when 90 cases of gunpowder stored at the railway depot ignited .
The resulting fire destroyed much of the town .
Vicente Rodriguez , a cook at Mike ’s Roadhouse Cafe , said he worried sometimes about what was going on at the airport .
“ But I think they know what they are doing . ”
Deaver , the newspaper publisher , said he had n’t “ heard a peep ” of protest from anyone in town over the rocket projects .
“ We do n’t want to interfere with the creativity here , ” Deaver said , “ but we want to know who ’s on the site and what they are doing . ”
Greason said all the spaceflight companies knew there would eventually be an accident like the one at Scaled Composites .
“ It was inevitable , ” he said .
“ It was a regrettable thing , but it is a fact of life .
There are hazards and risks ” to building rockets .
The explosion took place at 2:30 p.m. July 26 as workers were conducting a flow test of the propellant system for SpaceShipTwo , the successor to Rutan ’s X Prize craft .
A tank of nitrous oxide , often used by hot rodders to boost horsepower , ignited .
The test was conducted at room temperature and did not involve lighting the rocket motor .
“ We felt it was completely safe .
We had done a lot of these [ tests ] with SpaceShipOne , ” Rutan said at the time .
“ We just do n’t know ” why the explosion occurred .
Through a spokeswoman , Rutan declined a recent request to talk about the accident that claimed the lives of Charles Glen May , Todd Ivens and Eric Dean Blackwell .
After the accident , Witt hired a consulting firm to review the airport ’s procedures and training .
He has also told the half - dozen other rocket companies at the airport that he wants to know in advance of tests with dangerous chemicals .
Because the accident occurred on the ground , rather than in flight , it is being investigated by Cal / OSHA , the state agency charged with monitoring workplace safety .
Greason has n’t changed any of Xcor ’s practices yet , and other rocket builders said they doubted the accident would have a major effect on operations .
“ The fallout is going to be negligible , ” said Peter Diamandis , chief executive of the X Prize Foundation and a guru of the private spaceflight revolution .
“ These people gave their lives pursuing a dream .
. . .
But accidents on the ground do not relate to the safety of vehicles in flight . ”
The accident has not slowed the entrepreneurs ’ enthusiasm for space .
Hudson , despite his failure with the rotary rocket , is back in town with a new business model .
A company he co-founded , T / Space , is part of the new contingent of rocket companies .
He recently bought a house in town to be closer to the space work .
As with the occasional retiree in a battered pickup still searching the hills around Mojave for gold , the solitude of the desert seems to breed an unreasonable gumption .
“ Two types of people come out here , ” said Jonathan Goff , an engineer with Masten Space Systems .
“ Some are chasing dreams , and some are running from reality . ”
Masten , his boss , added sardonically : “ Or both . ”

This time their target is not an incoming warhead or a dummy test target , but a doomed experimental satellite the size of a school bus and weighing 5,000 pounds .
It went dead shortly after being launched in December 2006 .
It contains a half - ton of hydrazene , a rocket fuel that officials said can burn the lungs and even is deadly in extended doses .
The fuel tank is believed sturdy enough to survive re-entry , based on studies of the fuel tank that fell to earth after the shuttle Columbia disaster in 2003 .
Officials said that the slushy frozen fuel would have then been released wherever it came down .
The military and NASA have calculated that the best opportunity to shoot down the satellite with an interceptor missile is just before it re-enters the atmosphere and starts to tumble and break apart on a random path toward the surface , an opportunity that begins in three to four days , and extends for eight days after that .
At that point , its debris would quickly be dragged out of orbit .
In many ways , the task resembles shooting down an intercontinental nuclear missile , although in this case the target is larger , its path is better known , and if a first shot misses , it will continue to circle the earth for long enough to allow a second or even a third try .
The weapon of choice , after modifications that are still under way , is the Standard Missile 3 carried by the Navy ’s Aegis cruisers , originally fielded for use against airplanes , cruise missiles and the like .
The defensive missiles and supporting radar were already being modified and tested to shoot down enemy warheads , so the software is now being reprogrammed to home in on the radar and other signatures of a large satellite instead of a ballistic missile , officials said .
Although White House , military and NASA officials described the president ’s decision as motivated solely by wanting to avoid a spread of toxic fuel in an inhabited area , it has implications for missile defense and antisatellite weapons .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Democratic presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton has double - digit leads over Barack Obama in Ohio and Pennsylvania , both crucial states in upcoming primaries , according to Quinnipiac University poll released on Thursday .
Clinton , a New York senator , has lost eight straight nominating contests to Illinois Sen.
Obama , but leads him 55 percent to 34 percent among likely Democratic primary voters in Ohio , the poll found .
Among Ohio Democrats , women back Clinton , 56 percent to 30 percent for Obama , while men back Clinton 52 percent to 42 percent , the poll found .
White Democrats favor Clinton 64 percent to 28 percent , while Obama leads 64 to 17 percent among black voters , according to the survey .
“ Ohio is as good a demographic fit for Sen. Clinton as she will find , ” Peter Brown , an Quinnipiac University Polling Institute official , said in a statement .
“ It has blue - collar America with a smaller percentage of both Democrats with college educations and African - American than in many other states where Sen. Obama has carried the day . ”
Ohio , Rhode Island , Texas and Vermont hold nominating contests on March 4 .
Pennsylvania voters will select presidential nominees in a primary election on April 22 .

The survey found that among likely Democratic primary voters in Pennsylvania , Clinton leads Obama 52 percent to 36 percent .
In a general election matchup with Republican front - runner John McCain , Ohio voters give the Arizona senator 44 percent support to 43 percent for Clinton and 40 percent for Obama .
In Pennsylvania , Clinton leads McCain 46 percent to 40 percent in the general election , Obama has 42 percent to McCain ’s 41 percent , the poll said .
The Quinnipiac University poll was taken February 6 through 12 , after the “ Super Tuesday ” contests in which McCain all but wrapped up the Republican nomination with coast - to - coast primary victories .
The Ohio poll of 1,748 voters has a margin of error of plus or minus 2.3 percent , including 564 Democratic likely voters with a margin of error of plus or minus 4.1 percent .
The Pennsylvania poll of 1,419 voters has a margin of error plus or minus 2.6 percent , including 577 Democratic likely voters , with a margin of error of plus or minus 4.1 percent .
Here 's the quote from California Democratic Party strategist Bob Mulholland :
" It is going to be thrown out and rejected , " said Bob Mulholland , a veteran party strategist in Sacramento .
" Sometimes people can't anticipate or can't understand the big picture . "
Now , here on DailyKos , you 've had the misfortune of meeting Bob Mulholland before -- he was the consultant who changed dday 's mind on impeachment , based on a " conversation " he had with the two of us at the most recent Executive Board Meeting of the California Democratic Party in July after my resolution to impeach Gonzales was commuted in committee .
As dday tells it , the main lesson to be learned from that conversation was this :
This is not some Johnny - come - lately .
This is a 30 - year strategist who consistently spouted the " play not to lose " line of attack over the " play to win . "
And he appeared to be going around the room making this argument to people .
I can only conclude that he 's scared .
Progressives within the party have had a late start in California , but they are far more organized and growing in strength .
Before long this is going to translate into results at the candidate level ( maybe from our mystery man in CA - 42 ) , and THAT , more than a continued Republican takeover of government , is the most anathema thing to Consultant X . Living in the bubble , he 's convinced himself that he 's never wrong , and that any move to create a politics of contrast based on defined principles would amount to a death rattle , not just for the party but for HIS gravy train .
So instead we get this cautiousness , this mushiness , this willingness to fold in the face of pressure , this concerted effort to be Republican - lite instead of Democratic .
And so , my new calculation is that any action abhorrent to Consultant X would be one that I wholeheartedly endorse .
And so I want to thank him for turning someone skeptical of the political value of impeachment into someone who can't wait to call the House Judiciary Committee and demand it .
But is n't that the oldest charge in the book ?
We just do n't understand political reality .
Well actually , Bob , I believe that I and my fellows who are sponsoring the resolution calling for censure of Senator Feinstein do understand political reality .
See , the reality is this :
The American Constitution has been so trashed by this administration that an Attorney General who actively says that torture is okay and that the President is above the law can receive a majority vote in the Senate ;
This President is so extreme that he will appoint known and avowed racist bigots to Federal Circuit Judgeships ; and ,
The highest levels of government and corporate America have become so lawless that we 're now debating retroactive amnesty for telecommunications giants who conspired with Bush to break the law .
And Dianne Feinstein has not only allowed this , she has actively aided and abetted it .
But I 'm sure you 're curious as to what " political reality " the insiders like Bob Mulholland are working with that enables them to say that the California Democratic Party supports Dianne Feinstein 100 % .
Well , I 'll leave it to Steve Maviglio , who works in the office of California State Assembly Speaker Fabian Nunez ( who has had ethical difficulties of his own , I dare say ) , to explain :
just received a great email from the head of the CDP 's enviro caucus opposing the censure of DiFi .
Like me , he does n't agree with her positions on the two issues cited .
But also like me , he knows she 's a terrific Senator who has done amazing things for our state .
And she 's an amazing vote getter in places like the Central Valley .
Well , I 'll say two things in response to this : first , the fact that Bill Clinton did fantastic and amazing things for our country during his eight years in office did n't immunize him from being censured by our very own Dianne Feinstein for his affair with Monica Lewinsky .
So there 's a lot of precedent out there .
But that little piece of hypocrisy notwithstanding , what is Steve claiming ?
That she can get votes in California 's conservative Central Valley ?
This rationale makes very little sense , given the fact that a )
The margin of victory for Barbara Boxer , California 's progressive Senator , has increased in each election cycle , and b ) it's not likely to matter how good Dianne Feinstein does in the Central Valley if she acts like a Republican to get those votes !
A Republican would do even better in the Central Valley , if that 's the direction you want to go .
Memo to Bob Mulholland : we are dealing with
the most unpopular administration in history .
And it 's high time -- especially in a progressive state like California -- that we started expecting our Democrats in Congress to send a strong message of opposition to the agenda of President Bush , rather than consistently cowering in fear that someone is going to accuse us of being unpatriotic or weak on national security .
Those days are over .
And moreover , here in California , we do n't even have the " Ben Nelson " problem of being lucky to have a Democrat in office in the first place .
The campaigns we wage here on the blogosphere are n't just about electing Democrats -- they 're about electing better Democrats .
And it 's time to send a message to the insider consultants and incumbent protectors who are trying to save their own skins , and that message is a simple one :
The time for a bunker mentality of shellshocked defense , triangulation and capitulation must end if our system of American governance is to survive .
If we , as we do , value government responsibility , the traditional separation of powers , and even , dare I say , the rule of law , we must stand together and say proudly , not just here in California , but nationwide , to our elected Democrats :
the time for appeasement is at an end .
now is the time for reform .
And yeah , I get the big picture .
Thanks .

Scientists from The University of Manchester have pioneered new ways of tweaking the molecular structure of antibiotics -- an innovation that could be crucial in the fight against powerful super bugs .
The work was led by chemical biologist Dr Jason Micklefield in collaboration with geneticist Professor Colin Smith .
Scientists working in The School of Chemistry and the Manchester Interdisciplinary Biocentre have paved the way for the development of new types of antibiotics capable of fighting increasingly resistant bacteria .
Micklefield , Smith and colleagues were the first to engineer the biosynthesis of lipopeptide antibiotics of this class back in 2002 .
They have now developed methodologies for altering the structure of these antibiotics , such as mutating , adding and deleting components .
This innovation provides access to thousands of lipopeptide variants that cannot be produced easily in any other way .
Dr Micklefield said : " The results from this work are essential in the development of the next generation of lipopeptide antibiotics , which are critical to combat emerging super bugs that have acquired resistance to other antibiotics .

" The potent activity of this class of antibiotics against pathogens that are resistant to all current antibiotic treatments makes them one of the most important groups of antibiotics available .
" Our work relies on interdisciplinary chemical - biology , spanning chemistry through to molecular genetics .
It follows the tradition of pioneering work in natural product biosynthesis and engineering that has come out of the UK . "
Scientists in Manchester have been doing work on calcium dependent antibiotics ( CDA ) , which belong to the same family of acidic lipopeptides as daptomycin .
In 2003 daptomycin became the first new structural class of natural antibiotic to reach hospitals in more than 30 years .
But researchers say there is already evidence that bacteria are evolving and becoming resistant to daptomycin -- leading to the emergence of dangerous new super bugs .

Dr Micklefield added : " If we are to successfully fight and control potent new super bugs in the future , we need to be developing the next generation of antibiotics now . "
The research carried out by Dr Mickelfield and his colleagues is part of a larger £ 650,000 project called ' Combinatorial biosynthesis of lipopeptide antibiotics ' , which is funded by the BBSRC and supported by drug discovery company Biotica .
It is concerned with elucidating and engineering biosynthetic pathways leading to complex nonribosomal lipopeptide antibiotics .
' Engineered biosynthesis of non-ribosomal lipopeptides with modified fatty acid side chains ' was published online December 5 and will also appear a forthcoming print issue of the Journal of the American Chemical Society .
Funding was provided by the UK's Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council .
Free jacket restores " ANAL " acronym logos from boys - love manga 's Japanese cover
Not -So -Daily Link of the Day : North America 's Digital Manga Publishing is offering Kei Azumaya's Rakuen Sanman Feet - All Nippon Air Line boys - love manga with two covers : a cover that simply reads " All Nippon Air Line : Paradise at 30,000 Feet " ( pictured right or below left ) , and a free dust jacket ( pictured below center ) that restores the " ANAL " acronym logos from the original Japanese cover ( pictured below right ) .
According to the company 's Juné Manga imprint , the story follows All Nippon Air Line , an air carrier that happens to be staffed by gay men " highly encouraged " to fraternize among themselves or the passengers .
Magazine Magazine , a publisher in Japan , released this manga with the airline 's " ANAL " logos in the cover illustration and on the cover 's top right corner .
Juné Manga 's jacketless English - language cover removes the logos because “ the bookstores did n't want to actually see ANAL written on the cover . "
Instead , the imprint is offering free dust jackets that restore the cover illustration 's logos and even make one logo more prominent than it was in the Japanese cover .
Juné Manga will be giving away the dust jacket upon request at its convention booth , through Akadot Retail , or by postal mail .
TechEd , Barcelona Microsoft partners are now free to extend Visual Studio to target non-Microsoft platforms according to Microsoft 's developer division corporate vice president S. Somasegar .
" We never had any licence restriction on the product itself , " he told El Reg .
" Individual developers have done whatever they wanted to do .
We had a restriction on the Visual Studio SDK , which is what we give to our partners to build additional stuff . "
Microsoft came under particular pressure from embedded developers to change its policy .
" One of our mobile operator partners has a big market share , and uses different platforms as well as the Microsoft platform .
They 've been talking to us for a while now . "
The change raises interesting possibilities for cross-platform .
NET .
" If you want to target the Mono runtime , you can do that , " said Somasegar .
Another Visual Studio announcement relates to the sharing of the source code for the IDE .
" This is the next step in our effort to share source , " Somasegar said .
" Most recently we opened up source code access to large parts of the .NET Framework .
Now , for people building on top of the Visual Studio tools platform , giving them access to the source code for Visual Studio will be beneficial to developers designing and debugging their add - in .
That 's why for our VSIP [ Visual Studio Industry Partner ] premier partners we will do that .
The win for Microsoft is that more developers use our tools . "
Somasegar claimed that Visual Studio is " the most widely used toolset around the world , " but at the same time admitted " developer tools is not the most profitable business . "
The IDE business is commoditized , as vendors such as IBM , Oracle and Sun Microsystems give away tools to promote their platforms .
Microsoft joined them by making its Visual Studio Express series free , and now reports that over 17 million copies have been downloaded .
Even so , Somasegar said Microsoft does not intend to give away its high - end editions , adding that sales have actually increased since the Express family was launched in November 2005 . ®

After turning out the lights for Bush , Israel turns up the ' hip hop '
President George W. Bush 's first visit to Israel has been notable for both its unprecedented level of security -- said to be costing $ 25,000 an hour -- and ceremonial moments marked by a zeal for perfect planning .
The lights in the Old City of Jerusalem were even turned out so Bush could enjoy a picture - perfect sunrise from his $ 2600 - a- night suite in the King David Hotel .
During a ceremony at Israeli President Shimon Peres ' official residence , Bush was welcomed by schoolchildren waving US and Israeli flags and singing a pop-styled medley of " Hava Nagila " and " Sholem Aleichem . "
The two men then moved to another room , where Bush signed a visitor 's book and they were serenaded by a girl singing " Over the Rainbow " in Hebrew and English .
A folk dance by performers in Russian outfits completed the welcome .
While one press account labeled the newer version of " Hava Nagila " as " a hip hop version , " another media outlet ' potato - potatoed ' it as " disco . "
One thing 's for sure , although he could be seen swaying slightly to the music , Bush appeared less carried away than he did on last year 's visit to Brazil , when a samba number possessed him to hit the dance floor and ' get jiggy ' with his wife , children and Secretary of State .

The world of high finance , already shaken by the imprudent greed of some of its biggest corporate names , was stunned yesterday by the largest ever fraud by an individual " rogue " trader .
Jérôme Kerviel , a Frenchman aged 31 , working for Société Générale , one of the world 's most reputable banks , lost almost € 5 bn ( £ 3.7 bn ) in a series of complex , concealed deals on European stock derivatives .
The relatively junior bank employee , who earned less than € 100,000 a year , managed to evade supposedly fraud - proof safeguards to stake an estimated € 50bn – which is more than the GDP of Slovenia , Uganda or Cuba – on the future direction of European stock markets .
France 's second largest bank had to scramble desperately to abandon his concealed trades on Monday and Tuesday , against the calamitous background of sharply falling European stock exchanges .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
According to one , unconfirmed , report , M. Kerviel was on the run last night after admitting his actions last weekend .
Senior officials of SocGen said they " knew nothing " about his whereabouts .
They admitted they had let him " go home " last Saturday and had kept the fraud secret until they had closed down his illegal deals .
Officials said M. Kerviel was in a " fragile " mental state after family problems and had possibly acted out of " malevolence " .
The massive fraud came at the worst possible time for the global finance industry .
It will renew doubts about the stability , and ruling morality , of leading banks in the wake of the global recession threatened by the sub - prime crisis in the United States and beyond .
The French bank 's president and chief executive Daniel Bouton , described the trader 's behaviour yesterday as " totally irrational " .
He said there was no evidence of self - enrichment through embezzlement of funds .
M. Kerviel was an expert on the bank 's computerised , anti-fraud protections from his previous work in another , junior managerial post .
He was promoted to the bank 's financial futures desk , Delta One , in the La Défense business district , west of Paris , two years ago .
In the space of the past year , he is believed to have set up an independent , " virtual " company at the heart of SocGen .
He created a morass of larger and larger , unauthorised trades .
He disguised them by seeming to cancel them on the computer and replacing them with , other , more reasonable but fictitious deals .
Unnoticed by his superiors , M. Kerviel bet huge sums – much larger than he was authorised to commit – on stock market " futures " .
He is also suspected of hacking into the bank 's computers to alter data and cover his tracks .
The scale of M. Kerviel 's losses dwarfs any previous fraud by any individual " rogue " trader .
Société Gé*érale , a pillar of the French financial establishment since the 19th century , estimates its losses as € 4.9bn or $ 7.2bn .
That is almost five times as much as the $ 1.38 bn blown by the British trader Nick Leeson on the Asian futures market in 1995 : losses that destroyed the British merchant bank Barings .
The money lost by the French bank approaches in dollar terms the $ 10bn wiped out by the world 's biggest banking scandal , the collapse of the fraudulent Bank of Credit and Commerce International in 1991 .

Société Gé*érale , the French government and the banking world sought yesterday to portray the disaster as the results of the deranged and inexplicable behaviour of a single individual .
However , the calamity generated awkward new questions on the reliability of the anti-fraud defences erected by banks since the Leeson affair and similar rogue trading scandals in the US and Japan ,
" We get the feeling that the financial markets have become a big casino which has lost control .
It seems incredible that Société Gé*érale can lose € 5bn through one operator , " said Alain Crouzat , a portfolio manager at Montsegur Finance in Paris .
Centre - left French politicians asked if there was any moral difference between a single employee carried away with a desire to make a financial killing and the large US , and other , banks who had been swept along by the profiteering craze for " sub - prime " or unsound loans .
François Hollande , leader of the Parti Socialiste , called for new legislation to enforce more " transparency " in large transactions by French banks .
France has , until now , been relatively sheltered from the sub - prime crisis .
Société Gé*érale had been a European leader in investing in new forms of financial instruments .
It admitted yesterday , it had also lost € 2.2bn on bad US investments , infected by the sub - prime virus .
The bank , nonetheless , managed to record a profit of € 800 m in 2007 ( compared to € 5bn in 2006 ) .
Unlike Barings , SocGen , the 13th largest bank in Europe , is not in danger of collapse .
It has already raised over €5bn on the markets to help replace its losses .
The bank 's shares were at first suspended yesterday but then fell more than 4 per cent when trading resumed .
A group of 100 shareholders in SocGen then began a civil lawsuit against unnamed bank officials for " fraud , breach of trust , use of forged documents , complicity and receipt of stolen goods " .
M. Kerviel also faces criminal action .
The bank has begun legal proceedings against him for " forgery " and " intruding " into its computer hard disks .
He and all the managers responsible for him have been fired .
M. Bouton , offered to resign earlier this week but was asked to carry on by his board .
M. Kerviel worked for a division of the bank that traded in stock exchange " futures " .
More specifically , he worked on so - called " plain vanilla " futures – bets on the direction of European share prices .
Plain vanilla futures are relatively simple financial instruments that take out a position on the upwards or downwards direction of stock exchanges and can be cancelled up to an agreed date .
SocGen said yesterday it had uncovered the fraud in a routine inspection last weekend .
M. Kerviel had evaded detection because he knew when the inspections took place .
Finally , he made a mistake .
He admitted his actions last weekend and was allowed by the bank to go home .
Senior bank officials admitted yesterday it might have been a " mistake " but they were anxious to conceal the fraud until they had taken action to abandon M. Kerviel 's massive cat 's cradle of illegal trades .
When the full extent of the fraud was uncovered – amounting to an " accumulator " bet of more than € 50bn on rising share prices – European stock exchanges were in freefall on Monday .
A taskforce of the bank 's most senior officials – sworn to secrecy – scrambled to sell off the futures and save as much of the money as possible .
" It was the worst two days of my life , " one bank official told Le Monde .
M. Bouton told a press conference that initial investigations suggest the trader was acting alone : " It was an extremely sophisticated fraud in the way it was concealed . "
But he said the trader 's actions were " totally irrational " .
There was no sign that the dealer had sought to make personal gains .
" From his trading position , he created his own clandestine business within our trading floor ...
He managed to hide each position he took by taking other positions . "
Another SocGen official described M. Kervile as " relatively junior , not one of our stars . "
Small wonder , if the trader was working , not for SogGen , but on his own , mysterious network of trades .
The man who broke a bank – and other trading disasters
Yasuo Hamanaka
Sumitomo ; Lost £ 1.3bn in 1996
Hamanaka , a chief copper trader at Sumitomo Corporation – one of the largest trading companies in Japan – was jailed for eight years in 1998 after it emerged he had conducted off - the - book and bogus trades for more than 10 years .
At first , Hamanaka 's fraudulent activity , driving up the price of copper , had made Sumitomo huge profits , but eventually cost the corporation £ 1.3bn .
Nick Leeson
Barings ; Lost £ 827 m in 1995
Leeson , who worked in Barings ' Singapore office , at first made great profits for the bank through unauthorised speculative trades in derivatives and futures .
His efforts added £ 10 m to Barings ' annual income and earned Leeson a bonus of £ 130,000 .
However , his luck turned and he began hiding his trading losses in one of the bank 's error accounts .
The losses grew to £ 208 m by the end of 1994 as he made more desperate attempts to recoup the money .
Leeson fled in February 1995 after taking a final gamble that the Toyko Stock Exchange would not move significantly overnight .
It would have been a pretty safe bet , had the Kobe earthquake not struck , sending Asia 's markets into a frenzy .
Leeson left a note saying " I 'm sorry " .
The bank 's losses at this stage were £ 827 m , twice the bank 's trading capital .
After a failed bail - out attempt , Barings was declared insolvent , after more than two centuries of trading , on 26 February .
In December 1995 , Leeson was jailed for six years Singapore , and was released in 1999 .
He is now the commercial director of Galway United FC .
Toshihide Iguchi
Daiwa Bank ; Lost £ 557 m in 1995
Iguchi , a former car salesman who rose to become one of Daiwa 's senior US executives , confessed in 1995 that he had lost £ 557 m through unauthorised bond trading .
Hiding his losses from his bosses while he tried to trade back to a profit , Iguchi sometimes traded as much as £ 250 m worth of US Treasury securities in a day .
It emerged he had falsified more than 30,000 trading slips over a decade .
He was jailed for four years for fraud and falsifying documents , and had to pay £ 1.3 m in fines .
John Rusnak
Allied Irish Bank ( AIB ) ; Lost £ 350 m in 2002
Rusnak was a Baltimore - based currency trader for Allfirst bank , which had been part of the AIB Group .
Betting mainly on the Japanese yen , Rusnak used fictitious options contracts to hide his trading losses of more than £ 350 m over several years .
By 2002 , when checks revealed the bank 's exposure , Rusnak had secretly bet £ 3.8 bn of AIB 's money on the yen rising against the dollar – a good deal more than his trading limit of £ 1.25 m .
Rusnak faced a jail sentence of 30 years , but achieved a 7.5 - year term after a plea bargain with US prosecutors .
He will have to pay £ 500 a month when he is released , and is still liable to pay back all of the £ 350 m he lost .

Oregon Health & Science University Cancer Institute researcher Jeff Tyner , Ph.D. , has created a way to identify proteins that are candidates for targeted therapy in acute myeloid leukemia using an assay that yields results in just four days .
This research is being presented at the American Society of Hematology annual meeting in Atlanta , on Dec. 10 .
This functional assay , called RAPID , because it rapidly delivers the information , has the capability of telling researchers which actual proteins from the tyrosine kinase family are contributing to an individual patient 's cancer .
" If you know what protein is driving the cancer , you have the ability to target that protein and stop it .
With this knowledge it may be possible to match targeted drugs with the appropriate patient .
It may also be possible to identify mechanisms as to why certain leukemias respond well to therapy and why others may not .
The real novelty of our work is that we have performed this assay directly on patient samples .
It gets us one step closer to the clinic and personalized medicine , " said Tyner , a fellow in hematology / medical oncology , OHSU School of Medicine .
This research has several important aspects .
First , it will enable researches to more quickly compile a database of mutant genes that cause cancer .
That will enable better diagnosis in the future using DNA sequencing technology .
Second , it is possible that this technology may , in the future , be adapted for direct clinical use for diagnostic purposes .
In this manner , the RAPID screen could be run on a patient 's malignant cells , and the appropriate drug could then be determined to treat that patient .
Thirdly , the assay can be completed in just four days , whereas previous technologies could take months to years to yield similar information .
Tyner came about his discovery as many scientists do : trial and error and then success .
" We were initially screening for these targets by doing large - scale DNA sequencing , looking for mutations .
This strategy was not as successful as we had hoped , so we decided that an assay that could functionally screen cells and give us some idea based on what killed cells and what did n't kill cells would be a better place to start .
We could then work backward to find the actual mutation underlying that phenotype .
RNAi ( the name of the technology we use ) seemed an ideal platform for this because it allows you to knock down the expression of individual genes , " Tyner said .
Acute myeloid leukemia is a cancer characterized by the rapid proliferation of abnormal cells which accumulate in the bone marrow and interfere with the production of normal blood cells .
This leukemia is the most common acute leukemia affecting adults , and its incidence increases with age .
As an acute leukemia , AML progresses rapidly and is typically fatal within weeks or months if left untreated .
About 9,000 deaths from AML will occur in the United States during 2007 .
Other researchers include : Stephanie Willis , research associate , division of hematology and medical oncology , OHSU School of Medicine ; Michael Deininger , M.D. , Ph.D. , assistant professor of medicine , division of hematology and medical oncology , OHSU School of Medicine ; and Brian Druker , M.D. , OHSU Cancer Institute Director , JELD - WEN Chair of Leukemia Research at the Oregon Health & Science University Cancer Institute , Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator and a member of the National Academy of Sciences .
OHSU has licensed some of the underlying technology used in this research to MolecularMD .
The discovery of a USB memory stick containing classified NATO information in a library in Stockholm has prompted a meeting between the Swedish Military Intelligence and Security Service and foreign defence officials .
The Swedish Military Intelligence and Security Service is a division of the Swedish Armed Forces Central Command responsible for Sweden 's military intelligence .
According to Swedish daily Aftonbladet , the stick contained material on NATO 's ISAF peace - keeping force in Afghanistan , as well as an intelligence report on the attempted assassination of Lebanon 's defense minister and the murder of Sri Lanka 's foreign minister .
Colonel Bengt Sandström of the Swedish Military Intelligence and Security Service says this kind of carelessness is intolerable and can result in up to six months in prison .
It is unclear how the USB stick ended up in the library .
It is n't the first time the military has lost USB sticks with secret files .
In 2006 , a memory stick containing files on the Dutch military mission to Afghanistan was lost in a rented car .
The documents also included information about the rules of engagement for Dutch troops in Afghanistan and the personal protection of Dutch Defense Minister Henk Kamp .
Also in 2006 , the Dutch Defense Ministry reported the loss of another memory stick containing sensitive information about military intelligence agency MIVD .
If proper precautions are taken , the loss of a USB stick need n't mean the loss of information .
A couple of companies already offer USB sticks with military - grade AES hardware - based encryption .
Some can even self - destruct ( internally ) and erase everything on the drive using technology that physically overwrites every byte , making the data entirely unrecoverable . ®
We might test judgment by asking , on the issue of Iraq , who best anticipated how events turned out .
But many of those who correctly anticipated catastrophe did so not by exercising judgment but by indulging in ideology .
They opposed the invasion because they believed the president was only after the oil or because they believed America is always and in every situation wrong .
The people who truly showed good judgment on Iraq predicted the consequences that actually ensued but also rightly evaluated the motives that led to the action .
They did not necessarily possess more knowledge than the rest of us .
They labored , as everyone did , with the same faulty intelligence and lack of knowledge of Iraq ’s fissured sectarian history .
What they did n’t do was take wishes for reality .
They did n’t suppose , as President Bush did , that because they believed in the integrity of their own motives everyone else in the region would believe in it , too .
They did n’t suppose that a free state could arise on the foundations of 35 years of police terror .
They did n’t suppose that America had the power to shape political outcomes in a faraway country of which most Americans knew little .
They did n’t believe that because America defended human rights and freedom in Bosnia and Kosovo it had to be doing so in Iraq .
They avoided all these mistakes .
I made some of these mistakes and then a few of my own .
The lesson I draw for the future is to be less influenced by the passions of people I admire — Iraqi exiles , for example — and to be less swayed by my emotions .
I went to northern Iraq in 1992 .
I saw what Saddam Hussein did to the Kurds .
From that moment forward , I believed he had to go .
My convictions had all the authority of personal experience , but for that very reason , I let emotion carry me past the hard questions , like : Can Kurds , Sunnis and Shiites hold together in peace what Saddam Hussein held together by terror ?
I should have known that emotions in politics , as in life , tend to be self - justifying and in matters of ultimate political judgment , nothing , not even your own feelings , should be held immune from the burden of justification through cross-examination and argument .
Good judgment in politics , it turns out , depends on being a critical judge of yourself .
It was not merely that the president did not take the care to understand Iraq .
He also did not take the care to understand himself .
The sense of reality that might have saved him from catastrophe would have taken the form of some warning bell sounding inside , alerting him that he did not know what he was doing .
But then , it is doubtful that warning bells had ever sounded in him before .
He had led a charmed life , and in charmed lives warning bells do not sound .
People with good judgment listen to warning bells within .
Prudent leaders force themselves to listen equally to advocates and opponents of the course of action they are thinking of pursuing .
They do not suppose that their own good intentions will guarantee good results .
They do not suppose they know all they need to know .
If power corrupts , it corrupts this sixth sense of personal limitation on which prudence relies .
A prudent leader will save democracies from the worst , but prudent leaders will not inspire a democracy to give its best .
Democratic peoples should always be looking for something more than prudence in a leader : daring , vision and — what goes with both — a willingness to risk failure .
Daring leaders can be trusted as long as they give some inkling of knowing what it is to fail .
They must be men of sorrow acquainted with grief , as the prophet Isaiah says , men and women who have not led charmed lives , who understand us as we really are , who have never given up hope and who know they are in politics to make their country better .
These are the leaders whose judgment , even if sometimes wrong , will still prove worthy of trust .

I ’ve always been a big proponent of having actionable anchor text for links when I really want someone to click .
From a copywriting standpoint , it ’s a no brainer — it ’s been proven time and time again that if you want someone to do something , you ’ll get better results if you tell them exactly what to do .
Simple as that .
So , it catches me off guard when people question something so fundamental .
I ’ve had people email me to settle disputes over the issue , such as the time a reader told me about an argument he was having with his boss .
The employee thought it was archaic to tell people to “ click here , ” and his boss thought otherwise .
I politely replied that for once the boss was right .
I never heard back .
Another reader once chastised me for wasting anchor text with the words “ click here , ” even though my primary goal for the link was to get people to click ( shocking , I know ) .
This is when I first realized that Google is truly making people lose their minds .
Somehow , this person no longer saw links as navigation for actual people to use ; they only exist to pass on “ juice ” according to an algorithm that no one outside of Mountain View fully understands .
Someone has the wrong idea .
It ’s been a bit since I ’ve seen any independent testing data on the use of actionable link anchor text ( outside of my own ) , so I thought I ’d share the results of a Marketing Sherpa experiment performed with their newsletter readers .
The goal was to find out if the wording used in hyperlinks could make a difference in click through rates .
The answer is yes .
They found that the right two or three “ click ” link words can lift click through rates by more than 8 % .
Here are the results :
“ Click to continue ” : 8.53 %
“ Continue to article ” : 3.3 %
“ Read more ” : (-) 1.8 %
Since there ’s no relevant difference between an HTML email message and a web page , the lesson is clear .
Not only should you use actionable anchor text if you really want someone to click , but you should also tell people to take the exact action you want them to perform in order to get the best response .
Click here to read the original Marketing Sherpa article in its entirety , and have a good Monday . 🙂

It was Ron Paul 's turn to face Tim Russert this morning , and he certainly came out less bruised than past guests Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney .
I do n't think that Dick Cheney 's go to guy is a big believer in the libertarian ideals that Paul espouses , so I have to wonder if he just thought that Paul was n't worth the effort .
Certainly , Russert offers no follow up on any of Paul 's assertions here that he would abolish income tax and cut spending .
For example , aside from pulling the military from overseas assignments , where else would Paul cut spending ?
It 's a valid question that may color what otherwise sounds sensible after seven years of ridiculous spending on war - mongering .
If Paul had said that the next program to go was Medicare or Social Security , would it have the same appeal ?

As this second clip shows , Russert 's entire M.O. appears to be dredging up every single thing a politician does or says in his entire career to find some evidence of flip - flopping , as if that fairly juvenile game of " gotcha " is the only way to be hard - hitting .
Here Russert points out that as much as Paul complains about spending , he has no problem inserting earmarks to benefit his district , even though as Paul says , he votes against them every time .
Personally , that 's a little convoluted way to hold up your ideology , but expecting Russert to approach it in any other way than a bemused " you 're a flip - flopper " tone is apparently unrealistic .
The Scary Echo of the Intolerance of the French Revolution in America Today
Ms. Hamilton has a Ph.D. in English from Berkeley .
As an undergrad she studied history at UW - Madison with George Mosse , William J. Courtenay , and Brian Peterson ( of Florida International University ) , among others .
Her mother is Virginia Vanderveer Hamilton , professor emerita and the author of biographies of Supreme Court Justice Hugo Black and Alabama Senator Lister Hill .
" Denunciation is the mother of all virtues , just as surveillance is the most reliable guarantee of the people ’s happiness and liberty . " -- Félix Le Peletier , Jacobin revolutionary
In Charles Dickens ’s 1859 novel A Tale of Two Cities , the French aristocrat Charles Darnay is rescued from the guillotine by the testimony of Doctor Manette , his father - in - law , a man revered by the revolutionaries because of his long , unjust imprisonment in the Bastille .
The day after his reprieve , however , Darnay is again hauled before the revolutionary tribunal and denounced by the vengeful couple , Ernest and Therese Defarge , and a third mysterious accuser .
The Defarges dramatically reveal that the third accuser is Doctor Manette himself .
Decades before in his prison cell , Manette had composed a letter in which he recounted the crimes of Darnay ’s father and uncle , the men responsible for his arrest and confinement .
That letter concludes :
And them and their descendants , to the last of their race , I , Alexandre Manette , unhappy prisoner , do … denounce to the times when all these things shall be answered for .
I denounce them to Heaven and to earth . ”
1
The leading practitioner of denunciation during the French Revolution was the fanatical Jean - Paul Marat , the man who used the phrase “ enemy of the people . ”
Marat , a disappointed practitioner of science and medicine , printed in his newspaper .
Friend of the People , the names of those he considered deserving of the guillotine .
For these “ counter - revolutionaries ” he endorsed show trials and summary executions .
Tom Paine , whose efforts on behalf of the American Revolution had made him famous , was in France as a witness to , and participant in , the new revolution .
Regarded as a wild - eyed radical in Britain and America , in France he seemed a timid moderate .
In a 1793 letter to Georges Danton , one of the revolutionaries , the alarmed Paine attempted to intervene :
There ought to be some regulation with respect to the spirit of denunciation that now prevails .
If every individual is to indulge his private malignancy , or his private ambition , to denounce at random and without any kind of proof , all confidence will be undermined and all authority be destroyed .
2
Paine ’s warning was ignored .
Eleven months later , the infamous Law of 22 Prairial ( June 10th ) was passed by the French National Assembly .
Article 9 stated : " Every citizen is empowered to seize conspirators and counterrevolutionaries , and to bring them before the magistrates .
He is required to denounce them as soon as he knows of them . "
" With the Prairial decree , " comments Claude Lefort in Democracy and Political Theory , " the Terror declares that it knows no limits ; the very dimension of Law disappears . "
3 Paine was imprisoned and narrowly escaped execution .
Danton and his allies were executed the following April .
Marat , who fought with the pen , died by the sword .
In an effort to stem the tide of denunciation , Charlotte Corday stabbed him to death as he lay in his bathtub , soaking his diseased skin .
Unfortunately , rather than putting an end to the violence , Marat ’s demise only exacerbated it .
Corday was guillotined for his murder , and the Reign of Terror erupted .
At least 16,000 people perished during the Terror , which sparked a reaction called the White Terror , during which young royalists grabbed people off the streets and murdered them .
The spirit of denunciation was surely the worst political legacy of the French Revolution .
It reappeared with a vengeance in the twentieth century .
In Nazi Germany , Jews and communists were denounced by their neighbors , relatives , and associates .
Stalin had “ enemies of the people ” arrested in the middle of the night and dragged off to gulags .
Many Americans living today remember the era of Senator Joseph McCarthy and the hearings held in front of the ominously entitled House UnAmerican Activities committee .
Denunciation is a malignant practice that damages the political process , spreading cynicism , destroying careers , and discouraging public service .
Its practitioners arouse and manipulate the emotions of their followers , who in turn succumb to self - righteous and irrational indignation .
Sadly , both the spirit and the practice of denunciation are present now in debates between American conservatives and liberals .
Sean Hannity and Ann Coulter play the role of Marat with enthusiasm .
Each week on Fox News , Hannity denounces an “ enemy of the state . ”
In recent years a spate of denunciatory right - wing books has appeared , among them , Michael Savage ’s Liberalism is a Mental Disorder , Ann Coulter ’s Treason : Liberal Treachery from the Cold War to the War on Terrorism , and Daniel Flynn ’s Why the Left Hates America .
Some on the political left have attempted to respond in kind , with James Carville ’s We ’re Right , They ’re Wrong , Jack Huberman ’s The Bush - Hater ’s Handbook , and Al Franken ’s more humorous Lies and the Lying Liars who Tell Them .
Such books are akin to those political campaign tactics that smear candidates ’ personal reputations rather than engage their political agendas — “ swiftboating , ” as we call it .
Some of the denunciatory fervor may be a product of historical ignorance .
How many of our feuding pundits and politicians could tell you the first modern progenitor of their own political philosophy or name its founding text ?
How many conservative pundits have actually read Edmund Burke ’s Reflections on the Revolution in France ?
How many liberal politicians — or American students — have read the work of John Locke ?
The term conservative , in its political sense , was coined in 1819 by a Frenchman , the writer Viscount Francois - René de Chateaubriand , who founded a magazine called Le Conservateur , meaning “ the conserver ” or “ the conservator . ”
He defined a conservative as “ one who is a partisan of the established social and political order . ”
Chateaubriand favored the restoration of the French monarchy and aristocracy as well as the preservation of the established French ( Catholic ) church .
In the past two decades , the word liberal has been demonized in American politics , and liberal politicians have tended to shrink from the word rather than explain and defend it .
The Latin root of liberal is liber , which means “ free . ”
The familiar expression a liberal education refers to a broad - ranging education suitable for a free man , rather than a slave .
The liberal arts are those that make demands on the imagination and intellect , as opposed to the supposedly mechanical training of craftspeople and workers .
Liberal was also originally associated with economic theory , as in the expression free trade .
Although they may emphasize different traits , historians and scholarly theorists of liberalism and conservatism generally agree on the defining attributes of their subjects .
In Recasting Conservatism ( 1994 ) , Robert Devigne elucidates the conservative world - view as follows : Conservative political thought , as most fully expressed by Burke ’s response to the French Revolution , developed throughout the West in opposition to Enlightenment beliefs that societies could be guided along a secular , self - governing , and egalitarian path .
It was characterized by a pessimistic view of human nature , a preference for community or the state when this was in conflict with individualism , and a rejection of political institutions based on rational modes of behavior .
4 John Gray , a scholarly theorist of liberalism , provides a list of its defining traits :
It is individualist , in that it asserts the moral primacy of the person against the claims of any social collectivity ; egalitarian , inasmuch as it confers upon men the same moral status … ; universalist , affirming the moral unity of the human species and according a secondary importance to specific historic associations and cultural forms ; and meliorist in its affirmation of the corrigibility and improvability of all social institutions and political arrangements . ” 5 ( italics original )
In other words , while conservatives value social hierarchies , liberals champion equality ; conservatives want to preserve , liberals to improve ; conservatives look to the collectivity , liberals to individuals ; conservatives to the past , liberals to the future .
Conservatives are the party of order and the status quo , while liberals are the party of civil liberties and reform .
Because conservatives perpetually seek to preserve , and liberals seek to improve , the agendas of both groups are bound to shift over time .
As traditions change or disappear , conservatives find other embattled customs to defend .
After one group of reforms has been implemented or defeated , liberals propose new reforms .
As John Stuart Mill , author of On Liberty , asserted , “ A party of order or stability , and a party of progress or reform , are both necessary elements of a healthy state of political life . ”
The conservative Disraeli agreed , declaring , “ No government can be long secure without a formidable opposition . ”
Therefore , conservatism and liberalism are interdependent .
Neither is static , and one cannot flourish without the other .
Their spasmodic conflicts , Thomas Carlyle wrote , often end in embraces .
This mutual dependence is another reason that a climate of denunciation is inappropriate in our political discourse .
Infected by the French Revolution and partisan hatreds , the founders of the United States and their supporters engaged in ad - hominem attacks and the spreading of defamatory rumors .
Even George Washington was mocked and vilified , to his fury .
Nonetheless , it was obvious that mutual recriminations damaged both well - meaning individuals and the “ healthy state of political life . ”
The much - abused Alexander Hamilton complained , “ It is a maxim deeply ingrained in that dark system [ denunciation ] that no character , however upright , is a match for constantly reiterated attacks , however false . ”
6
In his first inaugural address , delivered on March 4 , 1801 , Thomas Jefferson cautioned his audience against “ political intolerance ” :
Let us reflect that , having banished from our land that religious intolerance under which mankind so long bled and suffered , we have yet gained little if we countenance a political intolerance as despotic , as wicked , and capable of as bitter and bloody persecutions …
Every difference of opinion is not a difference of principle .
We have called by different names brethren of the same principle .
We are all Republicans , we are all Federalists .

I think you used the 19th century conservatism - liberalism distinctions perfectly in order to make your case for rational deliberation / respect for the political other .
Yet today , I think conservatism ( via an orthodox neoliberalist ) has painted itself as the party of progress and that of the individual .
Conservatism for the individual -
Thye have framed the liberal promotion of positive liberty / freedom as an imposition on the individual .
Sure , the views on " culture " still makes sense within the preserve culture / a new ( progressive ) culture dialectic , but at the same time , conservatives have made more convincing arguments for why they are the party of the individual as far as governance is concerned .
On Progress - through their neoliberalism , they have painted liberals as those who follow obsolete economics .
They make the argument that a free market will produce more wealth for everyone and we will all live happily ever after ( as long as there are no regs ) .
The lbierals are now seen as non-progressive in that they speak of phantom cultural integrity rather than tangible economic progress .
... On another level , I disagree with your call for rational deliberation / respect for the political other .
While I know he 's a boogie man- but what about Schmitt ?
If one followed the friend - enemy distinction , then the conservatives are not longer a rational political other that we deliberate with , but that they 're a much more dangerous counterpart .
They are a counterpart who has deliberately elevated points of disagreement into a more tense arena that requires more aggressive engagement .
Indeed , I think it 's the constant liberal recourse to " let 's return to reason / deliberation " that has allowed Bush & Co. to go so far .
Maarja Krusten - 12/14/2007
Many people in political life act opportunistically .
There always has been mudslinging by people of various parties in U.S. politics ( it is n't limited to any one party ) and always will be .
That does n't mean it is equivalent to what happened during the French Revolution or under various totalitarian regimes .
But the demonization of opponents is an interesting phenomenon , one which interests me .
( Have you read the Andreas Umland piece elsewhere on the home pae . )
In U.S. history , I 've found that it is not always easy to distinguish between what a speaker genuinely believed and what he said for effect when he went negative .
( More on that in a moment , as drawn from a column by David Brooks . )
There 's a lot of hyperbole , exaggeration and overheated rhetoric in the political world .
I sometimes try to translate some of it in my mind to daily life and end up with an image of a show such as Jerry Springer with people screaming at each other .
( I never watched it , I have to admit , but I 've seen clips and heard descrptions of it . )
That 's nothing like my everyday life , thank goodness .
Some of the mudslinging in politics over the years appears to have been an effort to distract people , some of it reflected an appeal to emotion , a way to get people riled up about an issue .
What works in the short term sometimes fails in the long term .
Sometimes politicians see an issue that bears examination but then overreach and end up giving ammunition to their enemies .
That does n't stop successive generations of politicians from going negative , a process in which the public plays a role , too .
Unfortunately , I 've read few books where people reflect on what they did .
The people from whom we most would like answers about what they did and why are not always as introspective as are many of us who are drawn to history in our careers .
John Podhoretz suggested as much in his memoir .
He wrote in _ Hell of a Ride_ that
" This might sound pretty awful , but people who reach this West Wing level are , generally speaking , not especially reflective people .
Washington ambition discourages reflection . "
He added that if politicians " had it in them to do even minimal soul - searching about the compromises they were making , had to figure out whether what they were doing was for the common good or for their own personal good , the conundrums of conscience would make them ineffective and indecisive .
The same capacity for deliberately unenlightened self - interest characterises just about everyone else involved in American politics .
Just as [ politicians ] live for power -- and after all , even the best of them are in it for the power , because they , too , need it to fulfill their special sense of mission -- their parasites crave its proximity . "
But more recently , David Brooks wrote in a column on October 16 , 2007 of a discussion with a politician who told him of political advertisin , " I was appalled by what I had to do . "
Brooks concluded , " Politics , as you know , is a tainted profession .
Professional politicians cannot serve their country if they do not win their races , and to do that they must grapple with a vast array of forces that try to remold and destroy who they are . "
Sometimes the tactics backfire .
We tend to hear more these days about Joe McCarthy 's tactics and the polemical approach that brought about the fall of the Senator from Wisconsin than about the issues that brought him fame initially .
That he acted as a bully does not mean all the issues he was looking at did not bear at least * some * examination .
Mark Reitz - 12/14/2007
Well , it appears that the author does n't want to engage in the free flow of thought and idea .
Rather than engage in a discussion about her essay that may end up contradicting her apparent thesis that evil Republicans denounce and are therefore the same as Murat , Nazis and Stalin , she has taken the advice of Harry Truman to stay out of the kitchen if you can't stand the heat .
William J. Stepp - 12/13/2007
While she 's contemplating her answers to your questions , I 'd like to add this one : what on earth do CEOs , with or without golden parachutes , have to do with political denunciation ?
Mark Reitz - 12/13/2007
It 's been nearly 48 since we 've heard from you , Carol , and there are several questions outstanding that I 'd like to hear your answers to , namely :
Should the country elect people to office based upon the free flow of truthful statements concerning those running for office , and that are relevant to the character of the candidate or his / her political positions ?
Was the Rather - gate controversy with the forged Air National Guard records of President Bush a denunciation ?
Is the argument that “ BUSH LIED ” over the circumstances of going to war with Iraq denunciation ?
Is pointing out that Romney is a Mormon denunciation ?
Is questioning the circumstances of John Kerry ’s first Purple Heart and the request for Kerry to release his military records for independent review denunciation ?
I await your response .
Lawrence Brooks Hughes -
12/13/2007 Senator Joe McCarthy sent the tumbrils not to the spot where the innocent could be dragged away to the guillotine , but to the spot where the GUILTY could be dragged away to hide behind the Fifth Amendment ...
You have nailed her rather eloquently , Mark .
Our country rarely deals in political murder .
Other than JFK sending killers to Cuba , and also giving the green light for the murder of Diem in South Vietnam , it 's hard to think of a case .
Mark Reitz - 12/12/2007 Carol , sorry I missed you answer in a prior post as to what , exactly , you mean by denunciation .
I now see that you define the term as “ I 'm talking about calculated political campaigns that intend to destroy a candidate 's reputation and deprive potential constituents of his representation . ”
[ Do you mean deprive the candidate of the constituent 's votes ?
Is this a top down system , of a bottom up system ? ]
Of course , in the context of your essay , I ’m not sure how this definition fits in .
Do you not see a difference between the denunciations of Murat and Stalin as against the calculated political campaigns of Hillary Clinton ( against Obama ) and Bush ( against Kerry ) ?
By your definition , what would acceptable political discourse look like ?
Would it be allowed ?
Should a candidate ever be permitted to talk about his opponent and his / her positions ?
Clearly , the only reason one would discuss an opponent ’s positions would be as part of the political campaign , and because of a calculation that by so doing the opponent ’s reputation will be tarnished and people will not vote for that opponent .
Thus , denunciation !
Mark Reitz - 12/12/2007 Carol , you write as if Cleland was entitled to this senate seat by virtue of his Vietnam injuries .
Your argument is that Chambliss and those nasty Republicans questioned his patriotism and denied him his office .
The Republican Party has no such power .
Cleland was removed and replaced by the voters , to who the government and offices in our democracy ultimately belong .
The ads run by Chambliss pointed out that Cleland had voted for an amendment to the Chemical Weapons Treaty that eliminated a ban on citizens of terrorist nations being on U.N. inspection teams in Iraq , and noted that Cleland voted 11 times against the Homeland Security measures co-authored by Georgia ’s more moderate , more popular Democratic Senator Zell Miller .
Those are indeed facts .
Should facts be ignored so as not to denounce anyone ?
Read the editorial of the Wall Street Journal on the Cleland - Chambliss contest and then tell me that what was done equates to a denunciation .
http://www.opinionjournal.com/editorial/feature.html?id=110002637
And let ’s talk about denunciation , the purported topic of your essay .
You have yet to define it .
I would appreciate if you would do so , so that these conversations might continue in a productive manner and without the ad hominem attacks you so deplore .
Merriam - Webster defines denunciation as “ a public condemnation . ”
I do n’t know if that 's too helpful for purposes of your discussions .
Does it matter , for instance , whether the public condemnation is true or false ?
It seems to me , and especially in a liberal democracy as the US , that truthful public discussion can never be a denunciation .
Charles Bradlaugh said “ Without free speech no search for truth is possible . ”
In a free speech case before the Supreme Court Justice Brandeis said “ Sunlight is the best disinfectant . ”
We need more truthful free speech .
One of the problems with the historical denunciations of your essay is that the denunciations were not truthful and resulted in the death of the denounced .
In the US today , no political denunciation , whether truthful or not , results in arrest , isolation and death .
Your direct question to me was whether I “ really think it 's good for the country to elect people based on who produces the most savage attack ad ? ”
My answer , no , but your question is a straw man .
Let ’s rephrase the question :
Should the country elect people to office based upon the free flow of truthful statements concerning those running for office , and that are relevant to the character of the candidate or his / her political positions ? ”
I ’ll answer this question , yes .
How about you ?
And finally , just a couple more questions for you .
Was the Rather - gate controversy with the forged Air National Guard records of President Bush a denunciation ?
Is the argument that “ BUSH LIED ” over the circumstances of going to war with Iraq denunciation ?
Is pointing out that Romney is a Mormon denunciation ?
Are the questionable circumstances of John Kerry ’s first Purple Heart and requests for Kerry to release his military records for independent review denunciation ?
If you ’re keeping score , my answers are : Yes , Yes , No , and No .
How do you answer .
Lawrence Brooks Hughes -
12/12/2007 Senator Joe McCarthy sent the tumbrils not to the spot where the innocent could be dragged off to the guillotine , but to the spot where the guilty could be dragged off to hide behind the 5th Amendment .
Your analogy was absurd , and it is fitting Mr. Reitz jumped on it promptly .
In 2004 the Swiftboat veterans managed to expose John Kerry 's sorry military record from Vietnam to Paris , thus rendering a high service to the nation .
To insinuate he was smeared by them is to admit not having read " Unfit for Command . "
So liberals champion equality , do they ?
How about John Edwards and his 28,000 square foot house , Al Gore and his $ 1,300 heat bills , or the Bill Clinton family , with a recently reported a net worth of $ 50 million ?
Apparently further SBA loan frauds , new national parks in Utah to help Chinese friends with mines in Indonesia , sales of pardons , and collectng bribes via commodity futures , will no longer be necessary .
Serge Lelouche - 12/12/2007 mate .
William J. Stepp - 12/11/2007 Yes , Ron Paul would abolish the DoE , Soc. Sec. , and Medicare , but that does n't mean these functions would cease to exist , which is a common but incorrect charge against libertarians .
Abolishing the DoE and putting the educrats out to pasture , for example , hardly implies that Ron Paul is against schools .
He just wants them out of the maw of the state .
Ditto for retirement plans and healthcare , which would be better provided by the market .
As for global warming , whatever that actually is , Bush himself is on record as saying that it is real and caused by humans .
CAFE standard legislation was passed with numerous GOP votes in Congress , and GOP members have long supported the gas tax .
The mountain of pages in the Federal Register were put there with lots of help from the GOP .
As for Al Hamilton , he was a proponent of militarism , monetary centralization , high taxes , and " national greatness , " everything libertarians abhor for good reason .
As for CEOs and their golden parachutes , some do get them , but relatively few .
You also left out the part where the Clinton administration capped the deductibility of executive pay at one million dollars annually , so the market figured out how to get around that stupid law by loading up executives with stock options , which kept their pay in line with the market .
If Michael Jordan could make millions playing basketball , CEOs were going to as well , at least those who created as much shareholder value as # 23 did for the Bulls , and options were the way to do that .

Carol Hamilton - 12/11/2007 " Ms. Hamilton , is it your contention then that the ' denunciation ' seen in today 's American politics is unlike the discourse in politics of previous eras ? "
Answer :
Of course not .
Look at the paragraph at the end of the article , just before the Jefferson quotation .
It 's too frustrating to be attacked for supposedly not saying what one has in fact said .
I had thought some conservatives might agree with my main points , but apparently not .
Carol Hamilton - 12/11/2007
You have yet to give any examples of French history , and I know perfectly well the difference between LePen and Sarkozy .
As for Hitler , he 's dead and you 're alive .
If you had a functioning frontal lobe , you would realize this .
If you really had any patriotic feelings , you would be upset with the American Right , with its trashing of French and European culture , rather than people who share my views .
Since you are such an unpleasant man and possibly a misogynist , I will not read or respond to any more of your comments -- but I urge you to submit a piece to hnn.us
Serge Lelouche - 12/11/2007
My politics , like those of my countrymen , are closer to Sarkozy than Le Pen .
I suppose for you that 's pretty similar , but , then again , French history itself seems to be a bit of a muddle in your mind .
Carol Hamilton - 12/11/2007 Ron
Paul would abolish the Dept. of Education , Social Security , and Medicare -- although the latter two not immediately but gradually .
Other Republicans , notably Bush , would like to privatize Social Security .
I have yet to hear any Republican express concern about global warming , pollution , raising fuel standards , a gas tax , or anything that would require government regulation of big business .
The Democrats want to keep the estate tax and raise the tax on dividends back to where it was before Bush .
The basic " conservative " position since Reagan / Thatcher since has been that most taxes should be lowered and people should just take care of themselves .
But as Alexander Hamilton wrote , " When avarice takes the lead in a state , it is commonly a forerunner of its fall . "
In our culture , unsuccessful football coaches ignominiously lose their jobs immediately after a losing season , yet CEOs who preside over great stock losses get golden parachutes .
Carol Hamilton - 12/11/2007
You ask :
" How is a bare - knuckle campaign against Max Cleland akin to the Murat denunciations ? "
Here 's what happened : " In 2002 , Cleland was defeated in his bid for a second Senate term by Representative Saxby Chambliss .
Voters were perhaps influenced by Chambliss ads that featured Cleland 's likeness on the same screen as Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein , ads that Cleland 's supporters claim questioned his commitment to homeland security . [ 6 ]
( The ads were removed after protest from some prominent politicians including John McCain . ) "
You call the above a " bare - knuckle campaign , " when it accuses a triple amputee war vet of such affiliations ?
I call it defamatory and shameful .
Do you really think it 's good for the country to elect people based on who produces the most savage attack ad ?
Carol Hamilton - 12/11/2007
Are you capable of a comment that is 1 . specific 2 . dispassionate and polite in tone and 3 . substantive ?
No wonder you are Jean - Marie LePen 's communication adviser .
You 're the French Karl Rove , in your own tiny , spiteful way .
Carol Hamilton - 12/11/2007
You show no evidence of any such knowledge yourself .
Your criticism is entirely non-specific .
You are , Monsieur , " louche " and you have posted rude comments on other posts at this site .
Why do n't you submit something yourself and give us a chance to evaluate you ?
Carol Hamilton - 12/11/2007
In the comments section I respond in kind to the attacks I receive .
If someone attacks me , I respond in kind .
The piece itself is dispassionate ; but the responses are not .
I engaged in no sniping in the piece itself , but I wo n't sit back and let people take potshots at me .
If someone accuses me of wearing distorted political lenses , surely I can return the accusation .
I 'm not running for office and I 'm entitled to defend myself .
It 's disingenuous of you to ask me to define " denunciation . "
Just read the titles of the books I cited .
But you miss my point entirely .
I 'm talking about calculated political campaigns that intend to destroy a candidate 's reputation and deprive potential constituents of his representation .
Why is that so difficult to grasp ?
As I said George Washington and Alexander Hamilton were wounded and angered by such attacks .
The French Revolutionary regime was not a democracy , and denunciation had a more lethal effect .
We live in a representative democracy and attacks affect political careers and , as I said , poison the political atmosphere and spread cynicism about the political process .
I spent a long time reading material for this piece ( including a lot of books on the French Revolution that I did not cite , although that 's not the real focus of the article ) .
I did n't get paid for writing it .
I try to argue for a diminution of denunciation on both sides .
And the comments I get have a sneering tone .
Sally Gee -
12/11/2007 Unworthy !
Sally Gee - 12/11/2007
What you seem to be saying is that conservative prefer to beat , gun down and starve out opponents to death to maintain the current social order , however dysfunctional , while liberals are nice people who do not and would prefer to make the world a freer better place .
It that it ?
Perhaps we should join together in denouncing those not obviously conservative or liberal first , and after they have provided us with a couple if weeks of televised guillotine reality tv , we can start on our real enemies for even more sophisticated guillotine entertainment , and may the least dysfunctional win and claim America for ( relative ) sanity !
Serge Lelouche - 12/11/2007 . . . for failing to respect the authority of 1980s era Berkeley Marxist / Linguistic turn apparatchniks .
Mark Reitz - 12/11/2007 Ms. Hamilton , is it your contention then that the ' denunciation ' seen in today 's American politics is unlike the discourse in politics of previous eras ?
How is a bare - knuckle campaign against Max Cleland akin to the Murat denunciations ?
I take it that you dislike denunciations and believe that a higher level of discourse should be taking place .
( What 's the definition of a denunciation by the way ? )
Far be it from you to engage in denunciation and ad hominem attacks .
“ Apparently these readers approve of denunciation , swift - boating , and ad - hominem personal attacks . ”
“ Or he may be simply a rude person -- which his other posts on this site suggest that he is . ”
“ It 's no surprise to me that you do n't recognize this ; that 's part of the historical ignorance I refer to . ”
“ But your own " political glasses " are so distorted that they wo n't allow you to see this . ”
Serge Lelouche - 12/11/2007
Thank you for that helpful clarification !
I am now convinced that you do indeed have a quite extensive familiarity with French historiography .
Serge Lelouche - 12/11/2007

William J. Stepp - 12/11/2007
My reference to your statement was because the way you worded it could be taken to imply ( I do n't think you necessarily meant this , but I wanted to be clear ) that it was new to contemporary conservatives .
Obviously it 's not .
As a matter of fact , not only do libertarians admit to anarchist roots , most of us like them , myself included .
( For the record , I 'm an anarchist . )
Tucker ( and Spooner ) have had far more influence on contemporary libertarianism than Stirner .
My guess is that most college libertarians these days could n't identify the latter .
What GOoPer candidates want to abolish all social programs ?
Social Security ?
Medicare ?
I do n't think so .
Just last night on CNN there was a segment on how Huckabee was opposed to federal funding for an AIDS vaccine in 1990 but now supports it .
Etc .
Of course in an election season even Democrats are going to come out for lower taxes -- AMT " reform , " etc .
This is not unique to GOoPers .
I have yet to hear a denunciation from GOoPers of either social programs per se or the weak , poor , and the environment .
The word " commonwealth " implies lots of things , none of them consistent with either libertarianism or classical liberalism .
The institutions that RP would abolish , like the Pentagon , the Fed , the IRS , etc. should be abolished .
There was a time not so long ago that the U.S. ( and the " commonwealth " ) did just fine without them .
As for speech codes , see the work done by FIRE .
No doubt lots of conservatives support them , but they have n't been in the vanguard of support for them .
Again , lots of conservatives support prayer in the schools , flag saluting , etc. , but not all ( or probably even most ) of them .
Goldwater conservatives certainly would not be among them .
Carol Hamilton - 12/11/2007
Upon further thought , M. Lelouche is making a false analogy .
There 's quite a difference between a technical skill like flying an airplane and an acquired body of knowledge , like a field of history .
In the latter case , the child of a historian will be raised around bookshelves full of history , taken to historical places , and engage in conversations with the parent about that subject .
It 's not unlike learning from a professor in a classroom , except that it is prolonged and varied .
I will add that M. Lelouche misses the point of the essay , which is the Marat - like climate of denunciation in the US today .
He may well be a poor reader of texts , thanks to his unfamiliarity with literary theory and criticism or his command of English .
Or he may be simply a rude person -- which his other posts on this site suggest that he is .
Carol Hamilton - 12/11/2007
I rewrote my bio to give a nod to some people who inspired me , including my mother , a member of Columbia 's Society of American Historians , and the late George Mosse , whose name I thought historians would recognize with some pleasure .
As for my credentials to write the article , for some decades now English has ceased to be merely literary criticism .
The Berkeley English department was the birthplace of the New Historicism and of a historically - conscious Marxism that disputed it .
Professors from art history , intellectual history ( Martin Jay ) , political science , and literary studies taught courses and worked together ; graduate students flourished in such an intellectual atmosphere .
One of my dissertation committee members , political scientist Michael Rogin , wrote a book on Melville ; no one would have told him he lacked the credentials to write about a novelist .
What 's interesting is the hostility , vagueness , and dismissive tone of these responses .
Apparently these readers approve of denunciation , swift - boating , and ad - hominem personal attacks .
Carol Hamilton - 12/11/2007 American conservatism 's hostility to individualism is evident in its hostility to nonconformity of every kind : thought , word , and deed .
At least the Tories tolerate eccentricity .
I 'm not sure what " long " or " recently " means in the second paragraph above .
I'm the author of a number of scholarly articles on anarchism , and I 'm sure that contemporary American libertarians are not going to admit to such an intellectual ancestry .
I 'm not saying that libertarians ARE anarchists ; they 're certainly not anti-capitalist or anti-church , just anti-state .
I 'm saying that they owe a more to Max Stirner and Benjamin Tucker than they would ever like to admit .
I 've watched all the Republican debates , and all I hear is : lower taxes , abolish all social programs , every man for himself ( armed to the teeth ) , and to hell with the meek , the poor , and the environment .
This is not altogether true of Huckabee , but he 's being attacked precisely for having abandoned that stance , raising some taxes to pay for a few programs .
And of course , Ron Paul is refreshing in many respects , although he too is against any sense of a " commonwealth " and would abolish many institutions .
As for what you charge liberals with in the first paragraph , I 'd need to see some specifics to be convinced .
Speech codes , in my view , are an unfortunately authoritarian attempt to impose politeness and good manners upon people who are n't used to associating with women , Jews , gays , people of color -- associating with them as equals , that is , rather than as house - cleaners or other subordinates .
As an authoritarian move , the imposition of speech codes is not alien to conservatism , with its respect / worship for authority .
Conservatism would not require speech codes , but it would compel public school pupils to salute the flag , say the pledge of allegiance , and bow their heads in prayer or suffer various consequences , from ostracism to expulsion .
Having grown up in the deep South , I know whereof I speak .
William J. Stepp - 12/10/2007
In addition to the points Mark Reitz makes about liberalism ( speech codes , etc. ) , we might add prosecuting the drug war , involving the U.S. in 20th - century shooting wars too , and starting the Cold War .
Carol Hamilton writes :
That " conservatives " now trumpet individualism is partly a result of their opposition to the federal government and partly their adoption of libertarianism , which is descended from individualist anarchism .
Conservatives , rightly or wrongly , have long identified with individualism to some extent .
This did n't start recently , as the post implies .
There are no doubt conservatives who believe this , but obviously it 's a bogus point in the case of the budget busting and warmongering neocons and their supporters .
Which contemporary conservatives have adopted libertarianism ?
Again , certainly not the neocons , who do n't have a libertarian bone in their bodies .
As a card carrying libertarian , I can tell you that it 's only partially descended from individualist anarchism .
Not all self - identified libertarians are anarchists .
Libertarianism also has strong roots in classical liberalism , which did n't reject the state , but did want to limit its growth and its functions more or less to protecting individual rights ( including the right to property ) .
Serge Lelouche - 12/10/2007
It is obvious that the author has no familiarity with the historiography of the French Revolution .
What are Carol Hamilton 's credentials to write on this ?
I understand her mother wrote history , but my father was a long - haul pilot for Royal Air Maroc .
Would you want me in the cockpit ?
Carol Hamilton - 12/10/2007
These are the traditional definitions of liberalism and conservative as propounded by scholars and PROPONENTS of those positions ( if you had read more carefully ) .
It 's no surprise to me that you do n't recognize this ; that 's part of the historical ignorance I refer to .
That " conservatives " now trumpet individualism is partly a result of their opposition to the federal government and partly their adoption of libertarianism , which is descended from individualist anarchism .
As for contemporary denunciation having no consequences , look at what happened to John Kerry 's campaign after he was swiftboated , or Max Cleland 's reelection campaign in Georgia , where , after losing several limbs in combat , he was tarred as an Al Quaida sympathizer and defeated .
But your own " political glasses " are so distorted that they wo n't allow you to see this or to understand how Coulter , Fox News , and those liberals who attempt to imitate their tactics poison political discourse , deflecting the attention of the media and the citizenry from actual issues to personal failings , real or imaginary .
Nato soldiers face the daily risk of roadside bomb attacks
An interpreter was also killed in the incident while three other soldiers were wounded .
More than 200 soldiers of the Nato - led International Security Assistance Force ( Isaf ) have been killed in 2007 .
Meanwhile , US and police forces claimed to have killed scores of insurgents in clashes across southern Afghanistan .
Weapons search
The roadside bombing happened north of a Canadian base near Panjawi in Kandahar province .
The Canadians who died were identified as Cpl Nicolas Raymond Beauchamp and Pte Michel Levesque .
The wounded were taken to a hospital at Kandahar air field with non-life threatening injuries , a military spokesman said .
Wing Commander Antony McCord , a spokesman for Isaf Regional Command South , said in a statement : " Isaf troops contend with the threat of [ bomb ] strikes on a daily basis , but our soldiers continue to improve the security situation and make a very real and positive difference to the lives of normal hardworking Afghan people .
" Our thoughts at this time are with the families and friends of those who have been killed or injured in today 's incident . "
Also on Saturday , the US military said at least 23 insurgents were killed during a search for weapons in the south of the country .
One report said a lorry full of Taleban weapons exploded in the province of Helmand , one of the centres of the Taleban insurgency .
In a separate incident , Afghan police say at least 10 militants were killed in Kandahar province .
In the central province of Ghor , Afghan officials say at least four policemen were killed when they were attacked by militants .
Isaf has more than 41,000 soldiers in Afghanistan .
Today ’s Washington Post :
A comprehensive review of 31 years of data from 830 mid-size to large U.S. workplaces found that the kind of diversity training exercises offered at most firms were followed by a 7.5 percent drop in the number of women in management .
The number of black , female managers fell by 10 percent , and the number of black men in top positions fell by 12 percent .
Similar effects were seen for Latinos and Asians .
The analysis did not find that all diversity training is useless .
Rather , it showed that mandatory programs — often undertaken mainly with an eye to avoiding liability in discrimination lawsuits — were the problem .
When diversity training is voluntary and undertaken to advance a company ’s business goals , it was associated with increased diversity in management .
… Today , U.S. businesses spend from $ 200 million to $ 300 million a year on diversity training , … Kalev said many trainers and executives told her they were not surprised by her findings .
…
Businesses are responding rationally to the legal environment , since several Supreme Court rulings have held that companies with mandatory diversity training are in a stronger position if they face a discrimination lawsuit .
Lindsay Lohan Drinking Again ( Video )
appears to have fallen off the wagon .
We 've got a video of the celebrity drinking at a New Year 's Eve party in Capri , Italy .
This certainly helps to explain her out of control behavior over the past few days .
Lohan 's lawyer , Blair Berk , says that despite the lapse , she is " back on track " .
The actress left Cirque Lodge rehab in October .

" The U.S. Marine Corps is rolling out a new ad campaign this week in an effort to target teachers , coaches , clergy and other groups that tend to have influence on kids ' career paths , " reports the Wall Street Journal .
The Marines " previously aimed its marketing directly at young adults , " running ads on Walt Disney 's ESPN or News Corporation 's FX .
But the new spots will run during Fox 's " American Idol , " which " has a broader audience that includes adults as well as kids . "
The WPP Group advertising firm JWT designed the Marines ' new television spots ; the campaign also includes print and online ads .
One ad " features a line of Marines standing in formation in front of landmarks across the U.S. such as the Golden Gate Bridge and Independence Hall . "
The campaign 's focus on " influencers " is consistent with the U.S. Army 's recruiting efforts , which the Center for Media and Democracy previously reported on .
Their slogan " Army strong " was chosen , in part , to appeal to influencers .
The e-mail records in question date back to President Bush 's first term
The taped - over e-mails could include messages discussing the Iraq war and leaking of a CIA officer 's identity .
The White House disclosure was forced by a lawsuit brought by private groups .
White House spokesman Tony Fratto said there was " no basis to say that the White House has destroyed any evidence or engaged in any misconduct " .
If the e-mails were not saved , the White House may have violated laws which require the preservation of documents that make up part of presidential and federal records .
The possibility that some of the lost e-mails may have dealt with the leaking of the identity of CIA operative Valerie Plame in 2003 has fuelled interest in the case .
The leak resulted in her resignation from the CIA and , three years later , the conviction of top White House aide Lewis " Scooter " Libby on charges of obstruction of justice and perjury .
' Significant ' time period
Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington ( Crew ) , one of two groups bringing the lawsuit against the White House , says the problem stems from its decision to dismantle its electronic record - keeping system from March 2003 at the same time as recycling back - up tapes of deleted emails , a process which continued until the end of October 2003 .
Crew claims that up to 10 million e-mails may have been lost between 2003 and 2005 .
Lost e-mails could potentially shed light on the Valerie Plame case
" The significance of this time period cannot be overstated : the US went to war with Iraq , top White House officials leaked the covert identity of Valerie Plame Wilson and the Justice Department opened a criminal investigation into their actions , " Crew said in a statement .
The group has questioned the White House 's apparent failure to explain how the problem arose or to determine how many e-mails may have been permanently lost .
' Best practice '
In a sworn court statement , Theresa Payton , chief information officer for the White House Office of Administration , said the White House " does not know if any e-mails were not properly preserved in the archiving process " .
She said e-mails sent between October 2003 and 2005 should be contained on back - up tapes which had been preserved and stored .
Previously they had been recycled in a manner " consistent with industry best practices " .
In December , Henry Waxman , Democratic chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee of the House of Representatives , expressed concerns about the Bush White House 's preservation of electronic records .
After the second term of President George W Bush comes to an end in January 2009 , the White House will be obliged to turn over all its presidential records to the National Archives .
Superhero Cinema 2008
If 2007 was the year of the sequel , 2008 is the year of the superhero movie .
With the obvious money to be made in the genre , production companies are buying up and churning out as many big - screen adaptations as they can , some with skill and respect for the source material , some with hasty disregard for anything than can be remotely described as quality .
There have been some phenoms ( Spider - Man ) and some stinkers ( Catwoman ) , but there ’s no shortage in new material .
Here ’s my best attempt at a rundown of what you can expect to see ( or avoid ) in 2008 , bypassing the fanboy BS and campy ( Marvel vs. DC ) loyalties .
Superhero !
Superhero !
Release Date : March 28
The Gist : A parody of superhero movies , in the same spirit as Epic Movie , Date Movie , Scary Movie , etc .
Why it might be great :
Not much is going well for this one , but there have been enough superhero movies in the last few years ( both good and bad ) to provide ample material ripe for parody .
Why it might be terrible : Nearly all of Craig Mazin ’s “ parodyâ€ films are terribly received , but due to a low production costs , these movies do n’t need mass appeal to turn a profit .
Mazin ’s last film , Epic Movie , is still listed as one of the worst movies of all time on IMDB and RottenTomatoes .
Superhero ! has been plagued by production problems since 2004 , and rumors originally suggested it may be shut down completely .
Now that it ’s officially going to make it to the big screen , what plot and casting information that has been made public seems to be a lot of the same old material .
The film stars Leslie Nielsen , whose comedic career has come crashing down since the days of The Naked Gun and who has become the official poster - boy for bad parody films .
Why I will never see it : Parody is not as easy as Mazin seems to think it is .
Like every “ Movieâ€ movie to come out since the original Scary Movie , this one will have the same pitfalls .
Instead of clever parody , it will probably be full of simple references to other films with poop jokes thrown in .
Iron Man
Release Date : May 2
The Gist : Billionaire Tony Stark is injured , kidnapped , and forced to build a weapon for extremists in Afghanistan , but instead builds a powerful suit of armor that both gives him super abilities and keeps him alive .
Upon returning home to America , he becomes “ Iron Man , â€  while his political and business connections foster more threats to deal with .
Why it might be great : Stark is not a typical good - natured superhero .
In fact , he ’s not even a good person at first .
There ’s strong potential to see a deeper origin story that most comic movies present .
Downey ’s personal life has hurt his career at times , but may actually help add credibility to the character of Stark , who battles similar personal demons .
Samuel L. Jackson is Nick Fury , so we already know who is in charge of the comic relief .
The single image of Iron Monger leaked online shows promise for a kick - ass climatic battle .
Why it might be terrible : Jon Favereau has limited experience as a director , and even then his focus has mostly been on comedy and family - friendly action ( Zathura ) .
The screenwriters do n’t have any major films to their credit .
Despite massive budgets and big names in starring roles , most Marvel adaptations have missed the mark in recent years .
Why I ’ll see it in theaters : Iron Man ’s story is more complex and has more real world attachments both to politics and corporate America , which , when coupled with power based on creativity and intelligence rather than being simply “ super , â€ may give the genre a much needed entry that is both grounded and believable .
The Incredible Hulk
Release Date : June 13
The Gist : After the poor reception Ang Lee ’s Hulk ( 2003 ) received , Marvel has decided to reboot the series in a new direction .
It says a lot about the film when the series is given a reboot in half the time it took DC to recover from Batman and Robin .
Lee ’s attempt to give emotional depth to a character that did not need it came off as pretentious and artsy , a bad combination for the superhero film genre .
Somewhere along the line , Lee forgot people who were fans of the character wanted to see “ Hulk smash , ” not “ Hulk has unresolved issues with his father and is struggling to understand himself as well as his powers . ”
To stop the eyes rolling from critics and fans alike , Marvel quickly hit the reset button .
The new film disregards the first film ( and its cast ) entirely and follows Dr. David Banner ( Ed Norton ) as he searches for a cure for his condition .
Banner must simultaneously battle his own condition while facing the threat of Emil Blonsky ( Tim Roth ) , a former KGB agent who transforms himself into The Abomination via the same gamma radiation that created The Hulk .
Why it might be great : Marvel ’s quick decision to reboot the series shows they ( hopefully ) learned from their mistakes and are looking to cater to their fans this time around .
The casting choices , particularly replacing Eric Bana with Ed Norton , shows promise for strong performances , and Roth rarely disappoints .
Pitting the Hulk against an arch-rival also promises to improve the action quality .
The effort Marvel is putting into this one to show they can get the story right may pay off in the end .
Why it might be terrible :
The first one suffered from too much effort going into creating a false sense of depth for character who did n’t need it , and the reboot may suffer from too much effort going in the opposite direction .
In an effort to separate themselves from the original , the filmmakers may go too far and make a film that is so cheesy that it insults the intelligence of their fans ( see Daredevil , Elektra , Catwoman . )
Like the first one , this film is shaping to be highly dependent on CGI for action sequences , and the cartoon - like Hulk ( and possibly Abomination ) may not look anywhere as cool as people hope they do .
Why I ’ll wait for the DVD :
Though this film will undoubtedly be better than its predecessor , the Hulk has never had the same appeal as more complicated superheros .
Lee ’s failed attempt to force complications upon the character showed how unnatural it seemed , and though Norton will certainly do better than Bana as Banner , the story is still shaping up to be a CGI - slugfest and not much more ( we all know there ’s no way Marvel is going to “ cure ” the Hulk . )
Hancock
Release Date : July 2
The Gist : Will Smith is Hancock , a superhero who has seen better days .
He ’s not the public superstar he once was , and has turned to booze and womanizing to dull the pain .
While trying to regain some of his prior glory , Hancock must deal with his personal demons , which include having an affair with a married woman ( Charlize Theron ) .
Why it might be great : Peter Berg is writing / directing .
Previous works like Friday Night Lights prove he ’s capable of taking a unique look on a common topic with great results .
The story of Hancock is not based on any comic or previous story , though the idea of a superhero dealing with realistic personal demons rings of Watchmen .
Whether or not the film is heavily dramatic or comedic , Will Smith has shown enough range in the past to cover both .
The unique story could provide a refreshing look at the life of superheroes that is missing from most other movies in the genre .
Just because someone has a heroic job does n’t mean they are a good person , and like with Iron Man , a serious look at the differential could be a nice change .
Why it might be terrible :
This could very easily be the next My Super Ex -Girlfriend with the genders reversed .
Smith can have his funny moments , but an over - reliance on it could turn this into an amalgamation of Men in Black and Hitch .
The original story could also hurt the film , as there ’s no major fan base to guarantee opening weekend numbers or word - of - mouth buzz .
These things wo n’t affect the quality of the film of course , but could still hinder its success .
Why I ’ll wait for the first reviews to come in : Despite a relatively original story , Hancock does n’t seem that interesting .
Hancock ‘s issues might be uncommon for superheros , but not for movies in general .
Hellboy II : The Golden Army
Release Date : July 11
The Gist : Hellboy , the demon raised by humans who works for a secret government organization to combat the supernatural , is back for more .
This time , the Earth is threatened by the old gods and supernatural creatures of the old world , the world we have long forgotten .
But in order to take back the world they once controlled , they ’ll have to get through Hellboy and his friends .
Why it might be great : Guillermo del Toro is once again writing and directing the film .
After the success of Pan ’s Labyrinth , del Toro seems at the top of his game , and will likely bring the same look and feel the original film had to the sequel .
Everyone is back , including John
Hurt despite his character being killed in the first film , keeping the superb cast intact .
Perlman is perfectly cast , and we ’re likely to be treated once again to the costume design and makeup work that made the original look so incredible .
It ’s amazing what good costumes can do to set a film apart in the age of CGI , and Doug Jones has proven he knows how to bring the bizarre character of Abe Sapien to life with striking realism .
Why it might be terrible :
Not much is going against this film .
Even changing production companies due to Sony ’s lack of faith in the series has n’t significantly hindered production .
The only real risk the film might be taking is the same one all sequels take , that it may try to do too much ( with a whole army of creatures this time ) and the plot may become convoluted .
However , with del Toro at the helm , this seems unlikely .
Why I will see it :
The first one was amazing , and all signs point to the sequel offering more of the same quality .
The Dark Knight
Release Date : July 18
The Gist : The sequel to Batman Begins ( 2005 ) , the immensely successful reboot to the Batman series .
Picking up where the first film ends , Bruce Wayne / Batman ( Christian Bale ) battles the world of organized crime in an effort to save Gotham City .
The mob is in disarray after Batman ’s efforts to take down mob boss Carmine Falcone .
The ensuing underworld chaos gives rise to the Joker ( Heath Ledger ) , who looks to seize control of the city ’s crime syndicates .
Meanwhile , Batman works with Lieutenant Gordon ( Gary Oldman ) and District Attorney Harvey Dent ( Aaron Eckhart ) to maintain order and take down the criminal mastermind .
Why it might be great :
This film has a lot going for it .
All of the major players have returned for the sequel , both behind and in front of the camera .
Most importantly , Christopher Nolan is once again writing and directing , and as one of the best young English directors working today , he is likely to bring the same dark , yet realistic and very human quality to The Dark Knight that made the original as powerful as it was .
All his prior films have shown that Nolan cares more about his overall vision for film than its marketability , so there ’s little to fear that this is simply a hasty and haphazard attempt to cash - in on a sequel .
David S. Goyer was brought back to pen outlines for both The Dark Knight and a planned third film , hopefully preserving the continuity the original series lacked throughout .
Bale is arguably the best Batman ever , and Gary Oldman has shown to be a fantastic choice as Gordon .
The only change up in the cast ( Katie Holmes being replaced with Maggie Gyllenhaal as Rachel Dawes ) will likely prove to be an upgrade .
The Batman mythos has been invigorated by the most realistic approach ever taken , and seeing the origins of both The Joker and Two - Face may prove the best yet .
Reports speculate that Nolan gave Ledger a copy of Alan Moore ’s immensely popular one - shot The Killing Joke as source material for his character study .
Why it might be terrible : A lot of pressure is already mounting on Ledger for portraying one of the most famous comic book villains in history and doing so in the shadow of Jack Nicholson .
Talk has begun already that Ledger sounds like he is trying to imitate Nicholson ’s performance .
It ’s likely some fans will not like his performance regardless of how original it may be .
Even if the remaining aspects of the film are strong , it ’s likely this film ’s reception will be based mostly on Ledger .
Why I will see it immediately :
There ’s no good reason not to .
Nolan and Bale alone are almost guaranteed to make this film amazing .
What has been shown already promises this one will be darker than Tim Burton ’s original film .
The Punisher : War Zone
Release Date : Sept. 12
The Gist : Even though this film is officially a sequel to the 2004 film , none of the original cast members are returning , including Thomas Jane as Frank Castle / The Punisher .
This time around , Frank Castle ( Ray Stevenson ) is at war with organized crime in New York City , pitting him against disfigured mafia assassin Jigsaw ( Dominic West ) .
Plans for a sequel were announced before the original hit theaters , and Jane was attached to the project until early 2007 , when he left citing creative differences .
Jane originally turned down the role as well a part in the X - Men series , reportedly because he does n’t feel he fits the superhero archetype .
Why it might be great :
Even with the loss of Jane as Castle , Stevenson ’s talents have been showcased before in Rome and he definitely looks the part .
The inclusion of Jigsaw will likely give the the series a boost with two arch - enemies combating one another .
Why it might be terrible : Barring reboots or sequels that are made decades apart , changing stars between films is usually a bad sign of things to come .
Val Kilmer and George Clooney can vouch for this .
Jane had originally expressed enthusiasm over the sequel , but left the project after nearly four years of script problems .
Why I ’ll wait for the DVD : Even the best efforts to adapt the Punisher character can barely raise him above the typical shoot - em - up movie cliches .
There ’s still some entertainment value there , but it ’s unlikely to match the quality of the comics .
So there you have it .
Rumors abound about other superheros who may grace the silver screen in 2008 , but without solid news of production , there ’s no certainty of when , if ever , we may see them .
One thing ’s for sure , even if every film on this list is poorly received , there ’s likely to be more behind them in 2009 .
Lou sez , " This is an actual scanned page of a radio station 's Emergency Broadcast System authenticator list .
A radio station would receive a ' secret word ' by teletype and they'd have to use this list to verify that the emergency was real or if it was merely a test .
As I look over this list , I can't help but notice the silly ones , and imagine myself as a DJ trying to announce the probable extinction of the human race by nuclear attack , all the while straining to hold back the laughter over the authenticator word being one of the stupider ones on this list , like ' OINTMENT ' or ' SPAGHETTI ' — or ' FLAPCAKE '
Then there are the creepy ones , like ' UNHOLY ' , ' TORMENT ' , ' MALICE ' , and ' RAISIN ' "

Mr. Svensson offered no protest when another Karolinska official notified him of his expulsion , she said .
Mr. Svensson did not respond to numerous attempts to reach him for this article .
In 2000 , Mr. Svensson , then Mr. Hellekant , was convicted of shooting a trade union worker , Bjorn Soderberg , 41 , seven times after a loud argument outside Mr. Soderberg ’s apartment in a Stockholm suburb on the night of Oct. 12 , 1999 .
Mr. Soderberg had complained about a co-worker who displayed his neo -Nazi beliefs at work , leading to the co-worker ’s loss of a job and union position .
The co-worker was a friend of Mr. Svensson’s .
At the time of the killing , according to court records and Stockholm police officials , Mr. Svensson was under surveillance for neo -Nazi activities by the Swedish Security Service , the equivalent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation .
Despite the conviction , Mr. Svensson maintained that he did not commit the killing .
After serving 6 1/2 years of an 11 - year sentence , Mr. Svensson was released on parole in February 2007 .
According to Swedish prison standards , inmates are usually released after serving two - thirds of their sentence .
While imprisoned , Mr. Svensson took a number of online courses that met the Karolinska ’s high standards .
Two admissions committee members interviewed him separately , Dr. Wallberg - Henriksson said .
One was a psychiatrist .
But neither interviewer detected anything unusual or asked him to explain his activities during the previous six - and - a - half - year period , she said .
She notified Mr. Svensson ’s classmates by intranet on Thursday of the decision to expel him .
On Friday she said she would address the students , her third meeting with the student body concerning Mr. Svensson ’s case .
Dr. Wallberg - Henriksson first met with students last fall to tell them that a convicted murderer was a classmate .
A higher percentage of students in public high schools are taking and passing Advanced Placement exams , according to a report issued Wednesday by the College Board .
The gap between the performance of black and white students , however , remains large .
Advanced Placement courses , which offer college - level study in 37 subjects , are prepared by the College Board and have been widely seized on as a good route to increasing the rigor of a high school education .
The exams are scored on a five - point scale , and some colleges offer course credit to students who pass , earning a score of 3 or above .
The proportion of students taking the courses has grown slowly but steadily over the last five years , as has the percentage of students with a score of 3 or higher .
Last year , more than 15 percent of the 2.8 million students who graduated from public high schools scored a 3 or above on at least one A.P. exam .
In 2002 , 11.7 percent of the graduates got a 3 or better on at least one exam , as did 14.7 percent of the 2006 graduates .
Microsoft Updates Both XP and Vista Without User Permission or Notification
The details are still fuzzy , but if this is true , it ’s a huge deal .
Not that Microsoft can do this ; that ’s just stupid company stuff .
But what ’s to stop anyone else from using Microsoft ’s stealth remote install capability to put anything onto anyone ’s computer ?
How long before some smart hacker exploits this , and then writes a program that will allow all the dumb hackers to do it ?
When you build a capability like this into your system , you decrease your overall security .

The Odyssey Explorer , a 250ft salvage vessel , was trying to leave Gibraltar , where it had been effectively blockaded for three months after Spain claimed a share of millions of dollars worth of gold and silver coins it had recovered .
After setting sail , it was approached by a Spanish navy gunboat and civil guard patrol ship once it passed the three - mile " buffer zone " that surrounds Gibraltar and forced to turn round and head for the Spanish port of Algeciras .
" We were forced at gunpoint to come to Algeciras , " said Ali Nessar , a company representative on the boat .
Following a stand - off , the boat was boarded and searched for information that Spanish authorities hope could lead to the site of the treasure .
The captain of the Odyssey Explorer , Sterling Vorus , was arrested last night for disobeying orders and was facing the night in jail .
The row centres around Odyssey Marine Exploration , run by Greg Stemm , the world 's leading underwater treasure hunter .
His company trawls the ocean 's floors , looking for sunken treasure , which it then sells to collectors .
Founded in 1994 , its first major success came with the recovery of $ 75 m worth of booty from the SS Republic , which sank off the coast of Florida in 1865 .
But now it has come up against the Spanish government in a diplomatic tussle that is costing the company millions of dollars in lost revenue .
In May Odyssey spirited away what it subsequently claimed were $ 500 m worth of silver and gold coins that it found in international waters in the Atlantic Ocean .
The coins were flown out of Gibraltar airport and are now sitting in an undisclosed location in Tampa , Florida , where Odyssey is based .
The Spanish government believes they were transported with the complicity of the British and that the coins may belong to Spain .
Odyssey and the governments of Britain and Gibraltar deny any foul play , saying that Odyssey flew the treasure out from the airport in full compliance with customs requirements .
Spain has filed a suit in Tampa against Odyssey to clarify the details of its discovery , to prevent future recovery efforts and to claim back what has already been discovered .
But the company refuses to reveal specific information about the treasure , admitting only that it was found around 180 nautical miles west of Gibraltar .
Mr Stemm argues that as " custodians " of the site - which Odyssey has named the Black Swan - they have a responsibility to protect it from other interested parties , including potential treasure hunters .
Mr Stemm says Odyssey is keen to " learn the name of the ship from which we removed the treasure , " but that they may " never be able to establish [ its ] identity " .
Spain counters that the company 's lack of transparency reveals their intention to make a financial profit from its national heritage .
The coins are believed to be Spanish , but Odyssey argues that this does not necessarily mean that they came from a Spanish ship .
The Spanish " real de a ocho " ( piece of eight ) was the international currrency of the day and could have ended up on any shipwreck , says the company , which has invested millions of dollars in their recovery .
There is debate over the value of the coins .
In export licence applications made to Gibraltar in May the company valued the 500,000 coins at $ 2.5 m ( around $ 5 per coin ) , but in a press release put out by Odyssey in June , they said the coins may be worth $ 500 m , or $ 1,000 per coin , making it the world 's largest shipwreck recovery .
Odyssey said it was not responsible for the higher valuation , based on calculations by an independent numismatist .
But they did publicise the higher figure .
Spanish media reports suggest the boat from which the coins were recovered is the Nuestra Señora de las Mercedes , which sank off the coast of Portugal in 1804 after a battle with British warships .
Down with it went more than 1 m silver coins , plundered from Spain 's American colonies .
The treasure has entered into Spanish lore as the world 's greatest sunken booty and the idea that it might have been whisked away has incensed politicians and journalists .
The battle is unlikely to be resolved on the high seas , but in the Tampa courtroom .
Odyssey describes its work as " commercial archaeology " and says that , as the treasure was found in international waters , it should keep 90 % of the proceeds .
Spain 's lawyer , James Goold , counters that " Spain has not abandoned its sunken property and it does not permit unauthorised salvage " .

RINF Alternative News
Bullying journalists endangers us all
RINF has acquired first hand experience – the UK is now in the early stages of becoming a police state directed solely for the benefit of the ruling elite , but the cops on the ground doing the harassment are fairly friendly “ just taking orders ” – just like in 1932 NAZI Germany .
As a science reporter it is my job to accurately report to our readers police roadblock activities , but when the officers will not even give their names or the name of the operation because they are told not to , but demand your details – then you know the Police Authority have something sinister to hide .
“ Common Purpose ” is what they have to hide folks . ” Common Purpose ” is a well - funded EU organisation set up by the Euro political elite to undermine our British “ Common LAW ” democracy and the UK police ; courts , judiciary and every facet of UK authorities are riddles with these characters like a spreading Cancer .
Many good colleagues would simply not even know who or what these characters are – and what their real adgender is .
But here is how to spot one : Check out this Video
Ever wondered why our public services are becoming much more expensive , less efficient and more draconian , well now you know .
1st of December this year is being used by “ Common Purpose ” infested police forces up and down the UK as another excuse to harass law abiding shoppers & motorists , and apparently law abiding Journalists who report the harassment on the ground .
Drink Driving is unwelcome by anyone with an atom of respect for fellow motorist & general public alike , indeed it should not be understated , this is withought doubt an abhorrent activity and its potential for devastating innocent lives is very real .
I personally would lock each and every Drink Driver up for a minimum of 30 days with only bread & water and those who cause fatality & Injury should be tried for MURDER or attempted MURDER .
BUT : The simple fact is more people will die from Smoking at Christmas than die from Drink Driving ; taking all the hard drugs combined , Swigging Alcohol or ANY other activity !!!
Including ALL Terrorism deaths , JET CRASH deaths , TRAIN CRASH deaths & every other type of Incident / Accident – by a factor of 10 with room to spare .
If it really were about saving peoples lives at Christmas would the authorities not have Roadblocks about “ Smoking ” ?
How stupid would that be to most people ?
Yet Carbon Monoxide from Cigarettes sends folk to sleep at the wheel .
Tobacco products harm those who take them & are harming those kids in the car being driven from A to B whilst having to suck it in !
Should we not be sick to the back teeth of NAZI dressed storm troopers with skinhead style JACK boots from stopping us going about our lawful business at Roadblocks based upon what is in reality a “ Common Purpose ” PLOY ?
Are Roadblocks something you use to see in third world BANANA republics only –
Apparently not , according to one relatively friendly bunch of Cops who gave me the once over on Saturday 01st December .
One chap in charge ( WAS NOT GIVING HIS DETAILS ) says he has been doing roadblocks for over 10 years .
Can anyone else remember roadblocks prior to “ Common Purpose ” riddled NEW LABOUR ?
Why are there never any Roadblocks in the pub car parks , would it not be better to stop the problem at source rather than let it get on the road to start with ?
How about starting at the pubs the cops frequent and then work on the Clubs Barristers & Judges get sloshed at ?
Now , as it so happens these officers were dressed like Storm troopers but it ’s because they also do drug raids and respond to bar brawl punkouts , etc according to the ( Anonymous ) team leader .
He claimed the other officers were on their TEA break .
Cough Cough !
But that is the point exactly is it not ?
If we wanted Storm troopers stomping about stopping traffic at checkpoints – we would have invited Hitler to do the job ?
WELL , as you have observed from the video that is exactly what is being foisted on the unsuspected British Public by the back door – here is how their dictatorship style patter goes :
“ Do you mind being stopped to help us with our drink drive campaign Sir / Madam ? ”
If you say you DO object , you then become a SUSPECT – in turn your car is searched and all your stuff thrown about and you are given the Christmas once over .
The Cops report back to COP HQ that most of the public do not mind being stopped to help the DD campaign .
This is reported correctly , but in such a slanted way , because as one officer let slip “ It keeps us in a JOB ” .
And it is all very true ; the vast majority of people do indeed say they welcome the Cop Checkpoints .
Indeed I got the opportunity to ask one motorist before the Storm troopers harassed and stopped me for reporting the truth , and he “ the motorist ” wished to remain anonymous , clearly was not happy , but felt he had no other option but to put up with the police checkpoint and the inconvenience he was subjected .
In fact his facial expressions of clear stress did not match him saying he did not mind – the guy looked like he was ready to have a heart attack .
What would you say to an enquiring journalist if you had a cop dressed like a storm trooper stood over ?
It was then my turn to receive the once over : the officer refused to give his name despite three separate polite requests and said he was not prepared to give his details at all .
I then took the officers number L975 of which he was clearly not pleased .
Well , as you can guess my scientific & journalistic curiosity questioned , why hide your name , if a public servant , and if indeed – one has nothing to hide ?
I gave the officer my RINF .
COM press badge and asked , “ Could you tell me the name of this harassment operation officer ? ” I had already introduced myself to the officer in charge as John Blacker RINF .
COM Science correspondent .
For public information the storm troopers were operating from Lancaster ( BLACK MERIA ) Police unit registration X771 JEC at 20:06 on Saturday 01 December on Morecambe Road Lancaster England .
The officer then started to trump up charges of interfering with police duties & wasting police time because I was at the Roadblock asking questions .
I then remarked , “ It ’s a public place ; I am press reporting events live for RINF .
COM . ”
The officer then claimed I should have followed press protocol and downloaded the official press release from the Internet .
LET US BE Absolutely clear here , this was suppression of the PRESS media , this was a deliberate stopping of me doing a lawful activity and reporting on the ground police harassment of motorists , disguised as Christmas DD campaign on 1st December 2007 .
I was asked if I minded my vehicle being searched and I said I certainly do mind but go ahead .
Well , what do you know ; as luck would have it — an emergency ensues —
In the boot of my car appeared to be a juicy stash of contraband .
I wonder how they got there ?
Well , anyway , “ HANDS UP ! ” “ Step away from the vehicle ! ! ”
I thought the officers handled this bit really well .
Now , this is what we are paying these guys for , not to stop old codgers after dark frightening heart failure .
Anyway , after explaining the situation all was in order .
However before departing :
I took it upon myself to clearly inform the officers of X771 JEC that 911 was an inside job and so were the 7/7 London Bombings .
They did not argue – because they already knew .
Indeed , I went on to explain US VICE President DICK CHENEY is being impeached for High Crimes .
I told those good police officers that if they wanted real information they would have to go to RINF .
COM as the mainstream media is not reporting worthy news such as WAR CROOK Cheney ’s impeachment for high crimes .
Let us not forget this ; it was first responders who were murdered along with ordinary civilians by Government Criminals on 911 .
As I promised the officers of X771 JEC – Here is Dick Cheney impeachment video 2007 :
Now we all know how much the UK news is being censored – and how free the UK press actually is .
Would you not expect Dick Cs Impeachment to be reported on the BBC as top headline news ?
Surely , the best way to target & catch Road Hogs & motor offenders such as Drink Drivers is for the officers to be mobile , patrolling in groups of two or three .
If that system was so inefficient – then why do police use it most of the time & the UK courts / JAILS are full ?
Is n’t the REAL TRUTH the roadblock system is used in the run up to Christmas to lighten the loads on the justice services and at the same time groom the unsuspecting public to accept “ Common Purpose ” EU draconian adgender ?
I heard about this on , where else , the Thom Hartmann show .
He discussed Democratic Underground 's look at Family Security Matters .
This bunch of sickos ( apologies to Michael Moore ) advocates that Bush should be our permanent president and that there should be no more democracy .
Democracy is bad .
Kings are good .
Laura Ingraham , Frank Gaffney ,
Who 's on their advisory board ?
Reagan era remnants abound .
Here are some names that Hartmann tossed out : Barbara Comstock James Woolsey , and ... drum roll ... Dick Cheney .
Oh , and by the way , it 's the same Gaffney who goes on CNN with talk of aggression against Iran .
That Frank Gaffney .
Here 's what FSM removed from their web site :
President Bush is reviled ; he has become another victim of Democracy .
By elevating popular fancy over truth , Democracy is clearly an enemy of not just truth , but duty and justice , which makes it the worst form of government .
President Bush must overcome not just the situation in Iraq , but democratic government .
However , President Bush has a valuable historical example that he could choose to follow ....
That valuable historic example ?
Julius Caesar .
If President Bush copied Julius Caesar by ordering his army to empty Iraq of Arabs and repopulate the country with Americans , he would achieve immediate results ...
Eyebrows raised yet ?
He could then follow Caesar 's example and use his newfound popularity with the military to wield military power to become the first permanent president of America , and end the civil chaos caused by the continually squabbling Congress and the out - of - control Supreme Court .
Mine are .
Raised , that is .
President Bush can fail in his duty to himself , his country , and his God , by becoming “ ex- president ” Bush or he can become “ President - for - Life ” Bush : the conqueror of Iraq , who brings sense to the Congress and sanity to the Supreme Court .
Then who would be able to stop Bush from emulating Augustus Caesar and becoming ruler of the world ?
For only an America united under one ruler has the power to save humanity from the threat of a new Dark Age wrought by terrorists armed with nuclear weapons .
When someone tells you that the " surge " is working , you must walk them through this chain of events :
On August 7 , 2007 , near the end of America ’s bloodiest summer in Iraq , the New York Times reported the following :
Attacks on American - led forces using a lethal type of roadside bomb said to be supplied by Iran reached a new high in July , according to the American military .
The devices , known as explosively formed penetrators , were used to carry out 99 attacks last month and accounted for a third of the combat deaths suffered by the American - led forces , according to American military officials .
" July was an all - time high , " Lt. Gen. Raymond T. Odierno , the No. 2 commander in Iraq , said in an interview , referring to strikes with such devices .
Such bombs , which fire a semi-molten copper slug that can penetrate the armor on a Humvee and are among the deadliest weapons used against American forces , are used almost exclusively by Shiite militants .
The " Shiite militants " described by the New York Times were , in fact , members of Muqtada al - Sadr ’s Mahdi Army .
And , as we all saw this past summer , Muqtada ’s fighters were really doing a job on American forces — despite the troop increase which began earlier in the year .
That was on August 7th .
And remember , this was during a summer throughout which we were bombarded with news of Iranian / Shia efforts to kill Americans and destabilize the Iraqi government .
Then , barely three weeks after the New York Times article ran , 50 Muslim pilgrims were slaughtered in sectarian fighting in Karbala .
In response , Muqtada al - Sadr announced that he had
ordered his militia to suspend offensive operations for six months .
No one saw this coming .
The surprise statement regarding his notorious Mahdi army , which is responsible for much of Iraq 's sectarian blood - letting , not only caught British and American commanders off - guard but appeared to have surprised Baghdad officials too .
Mowaffak al - Rubbaie , Iraq 's national security adviser , said Baghdad would only welcome the move if Sadr 's lieutenants stop attacks and their attempts to " blow up " the Iraqi government .
" I will see on the ground what is going to happen , " he said .
" It is good news if it is true .
If it happens it will reduce violence in the country a great deal . "
When this news was reported on August 30th , no one really believed it , much less expected the implementation of an actual cease - fire on the part of Iraq ’s Shia fighters .
On September 1st , even the U.S. military admitted that this could be an important — if not the important — development in the situation on the ground in Iraq .
According to CNN ,
" Muqtada al - Sadr 's declaration holds the potential to reduce criminal activity and help reunite Iraqis separated by ethno- sectarian violence and fear , " the U.S. military said .
::
An end to Mehdi Army " would also be an important step in helping Iraqi authorities focus greater attention on achieving the political and economic solutions necessary for progress and less on dealing with criminal activity , sectarian violence , kidnappings , assassinations , and attacks on Iraqi and coalition forces , " the military said .
When that was said by the U.S. military on September 1st , the " surge " was never mentioned .
It was all about an Iraqi decision that would succeed or fail on Iraqi actions .
The U.S. military was only observing .
Lo and behold , U.S. troop deaths began plummet .
American deaths dropped from 84 in August , to 65 in September , to 38 in October — the lowest tally for a single month in over a year and a half .
Having argued for months that Iranian - supplied Shia fighters were the most serious threat to U.S. forces in Iraq , those same forces had suddenly stopped fighting .
And it showed .
On November 2nd , the Washington Post reported that
The number of explosively formed projectiles ( EFPs ) that have been detonated or found in Iraq has dropped by nearly half in recent months , from a peak of 99 in July to 53 last month , Lt. Gen. Raymond T. Odierno , the commander in charge of day - to - day military operations in Iraq , said yesterday in a videoconference with Pentagon reporters .
But rather than recognize this for what it was , notable Republicans and other right - wingers immediately began to spin the story as if this was the result of the " surge " :
McCain told students at Coastal Carolina University that the United States has had " astonishing success " in Iraq as a result of the military strategy now in place .
Notice that Senator McCain never mentions the fact that our gravest enemy in Iraq -- the Mahdi Army -- has quit fighting .
On November 3rd , the Los Angeles Times , reported of President Bush :
At the graduation ceremony , the president said that since the troop increase reached full strength in June , the number of roadside bombs had been cut by half .
He said U.S. military deaths were at their lowest in 19 months .
Again , no mention of Muqtada al - Sadr , his Mahdi Army , or their decision to stop killing Americans .
Instead , it was all about the " troop increase . "
Even the London Times got in on the spin , stating explicitly :
This has not been an accident but the consequence of a strategy overseen by General David Petraeus in the past several months .
Unfortunately , no one seems to be calling our elected officials or the traditional media on this nonsensical idea that the " Petraeus strategy " should be credited with stanching the flow of blood .
No one seems to notice that , as with everything else in Iraq , the Iraqis are going to do what they want , when they want .
When al - Sadr lays down his arms , there will be relative peace .
When he takes them up , Americans will die in dozens .
Regardless , the fortunes of Iraq will turn on Iraqi decisions made in Baghdad and Najaf , not in Washington , D.C. and the halls of Congress .
As this situation shows , peace in Iraq lies in the hands of Iraqis .
It cannot — and will not — be forced by Americans at the point of a gun .
As Eric Alterman has written , he 's the " journalist " of " perpetual wrongness " ( as well as an " apparatchik " of the first order and a " right - wing holy warrior " ) .
And for that , he 's perpetually hired or published : Fox News , the Washington Post op - ed page , Time Magazine , and most recently , the New York Times where , in his very first column , he made a goof that had to be corrected at the bottom of column two ( and where , with his usual perspicacity when it comes to the future , he predicted an Obama victory in the New Hampshire primary ) .
Liberal websites devote time to listing his many mistakes and mis-predictions .
In a roiling mass of neocons , right - wingers , and liberal war hawks , he 's certainly been in fierce competition for the title of " wrongest " of all when it came to the invasion and occupation of Iraq .
( " Iraq 's always been very secular " ) I hardly have to spell out the name of He Who Strides Amongst Us , the editor of Rupert Murdoch 's Weekly Standard .
But , okay , for the one person on the planet who does n't know -- it 's Bill Kristol .
The notorious Mr. Kristol , the man whose crystal ball never works .
But is n't it the essence of American punditry that serial mistakes do n't matter and no one is ever held to account ( as in this primary season ) for ridiculous predictions that add up to nothing ?
As New York Times editorial page editor Andy Rosenthal put it after his paper signed Kristol to a one - year contract , " The idea that The New York Times is giving voice to a guy who is a serious , respected conservative intellectual -- and somehow that 's a bad thing How intolerant is that ? "
How intolerant indeed !
Since no one in the mainstream is accountable for anything they 've written , the management of the Times can exhibit remarkable tolerance for error in its gesture to the neocon right by hiring a man who 's essentially never right .
His has been a remarkable winning record when it comes to being right ( - wing ) by doing wrong .
Former Saturday Night Live contributor Jonathan Schwarz pays homage to that record in what follows .
Tom
I 'm talking about Kristol 's two - hour appearance on C - Span 's Washington Journal on March 28 , 2003 , just nine days after the President launched his invasion of Iraq .
No one remembers it today .
You can't even fish it out of LexisNexis .
It 's not there .
Yet it 's a masterpiece , a double album of smarm , horrifying ignorance , and bald - faced deceit .
While you 've heard him play those instruments before , he never again reached such heights .
It 's a performance for the history books -- particularly that chapter about how the American Empire collapsed .
That 's how I feel for my fellow William Kristol fans .
You loved it when Bill said invading Iraq was going to have " terrifically good effects throughout the Middle East " ?
You have the original recording of him explaining the war would make us " respected around the world " and his classic statement that there 's " almost no evidence " of Iraq experiencing Sunni -Shia conflict ?
Well , I 've got something that will blow your mind !
Imagine that there were a Beatles record only a few people knew existed .
And imagine you got the chance to listen to it , and as you did , your excitement grew , note by note .
You realized it was n't merely as good as Rubber Soul , or Revolver , or Sgt. Pepper's .
It was much , much better .
And now , imagine how badly you 'd want to tell other Beatles fans all about it .
At the time Kristol was merely the son of prominent neoconservative Irving Kristol , former chief of staff to Vice President Dan Quayle ( aka " Quayle 's brain " ) , the editor of Rupert Murdoch 's Weekly Standard , and a frequent Fox News commentator .
He had n't yet added New York Times columnist to his resumé .
Opposite Kristol on the segment was Daniel Ellsberg , famed for leaking the Pentagon Papers in the Vietnam era .
Their discussion jumped back and forth across 40 years of U.S. - Iraqi relations , and is easiest to understand if rearranged chronologically .
So , sit back , relax , and let me play a little of it for you .
To start with , Ellsberg made the reasonable point that Iraqis might not view the invading Americans as " liberators , " since the U.S. had been instrumental in Saddam Hussein 's rise to power :
Here 's how he put it :
" ELLSBERG : People in Iraq ... perceive Hussein as a dictator ...
But as a dictator the Americans chose for them .
" KRISTOL : That 's just not true .
We 've had mistakes in our Iraq policy .
It 's just ludicrous -- we did n't choose Hussein .
We did n't put him in power .
" ELLSBERG : In 1963 , when there was a brief uprising of the Ba'ath , we supplied specifically Saddam with lists , as we did in Indonesia , lists of people to be eliminated .
And since he 's a murderous thug , but at that time our murderous thug , he eliminated them ...
" KRISTOL : [ surprised ]
Is that right ?...
" ELLSBERG :
The same thing went on in ' 68 .
He was our thug , just as [ Panamanian dictator Manuel ] Noriega , and lots of other people who were on the leash until they got off the leash and then we eliminated them .
Like [ Vietnamese president ] Ngo Dinh Diem . "
Ellsberg here is referring to U.S. support for a 1963 coup involving the Ba'athist party , for which Saddam was already a prominent enforcer -- and then another coup in 1968 when the Ba'athists consolidated control , after which Saddam became the power behind the nominal president .
According to one of the 1963 plotters , " We came to power on a CIA train . "
( Beyond providing lists of communists and leftists to be murdered , the U.S. also gave the new regime napalm to help them put down a Kurdish uprising we 'd previously encouraged . )
James Crichtfield , then head of the CIA in the Middle East , said , " We really had the t's crossed on what was happening "
This turned out not to be quite right , since factional infighting among top Iraqis required the second plot five years later for which , explained key participant Abd al - Razzaq al - Nayyif , " you must [ also ] look to Washington . "
Yet it appears clear on video that Kristol is genuinely startled by what Ellsberg was saying .
Consider the significance of this .
Any ordinary citizen could easily have learned about the American role in those two coups -- former National Security Council staffer Roger Morris had written about it on the New York Times op - ed page just two weeks before the Kristol - Ellsberg broadcast .
And Kristol was far more than an ordinary citizen .
He 'd been near the apex of government as Quayle 's chief of staff during the first Gulf War in 1991 .
He 'd been advocating the overthrow of the Saddam regime for years .
He 'd co-written an entire book , The War Over Iraq : Saddam 's Tyranny and America 's Mission , calling for an invasion of that country .
Nevertheless , Kristol was ignorant of basic , critical information about U.S. - Iraq history .
Iraqis themselves were not .
In a September 2003 article , a returning refugee explained the growing resistance to the occupation : " One of the popular sayings I repeatedly heard in Baghdad , describing the relations between the U.S. and Saddam 's regime , is ' Rah el sani ' , ija el ussta ' -- ' Gone is the apprentice , in comes the master . ' "
What this suggests about the people running America is far worse than if they were simply malevolent super - geniuses :
They do n't know the backstory and could n't care less .
It 's as though we 're riding in the back seat of a car driven by people who demanded the wheel but are n't sure what the gas pedal does or what a stop sign actually looks like .
Moreover , when Ellsberg tells Kristol this information , he demonstrates no desire to learn more ; nor , as best as can be discovered , has he ever mentioned it again .
Really ?
Those colored lights mean something about whether I 'm supposed to stop or go ?
Huh .
Anyway , let 's talk more about how all of you complaining in the back seat hate freedom .
Later , when the discussion gets closer to the present .
Kristol 's demeanor changes .
He appears to be better informed and therefore shifts to straightforward lies :
" ELLSBERG :
Why did we support Saddam as recently as when you were in the administration ?
And the answer is -- " KRISTOL :
We did n't support Saddam when I was in the administration .
" ELLSBERG :
When were you in the administration ?
" KRISTOL : 89 to 93 . "
This is preposterously false .
First of all , Kristol worked in the Reagan administration as Education Secretary William Bennett 's chief of staff -- when the U.S. famously supported Saddam 's war against Iran with loans , munitions , intelligence , and diplomatic protection for his use of chemical weapons .
After George H.W. Bush was elected in 1988 , Kristol moved to the same position in Vice President Quayle 's office .
During the transition , Bush 's advisors examined the country 's Iraq policy and wrote a memo explaining to the incoming President the choice he faced .
In a nutshell , this was " to decide whether to treat Iraq as a distasteful dictatorship to be shunned when possible , or to recognize Iraq 's present and potential power in the region and accord it relatively high priority .
We strongly urge the latter view . "
And Bush chose .
Internal State Department guidelines from the period stated , " In no way should we associate ourselves with the 60 year - old Kurdish rebellion in Iraq or oppose Iraq 's legitimate attempts to suppress it . "
( Saddam 's gassing of the Kurdish town of Halabja has occurred less than a year before . )
Analysts warning of Iraq 's burgeoning nuclear program were squelched .
The Commerce Department loosened restrictions on dual - use WMD material , while Bush the elder approved new government lines of credit for Saddam over congressional objections .
And Saddam was receiving private money as well : most notably from the Atlanta branch of Italian bank BNL .
BNL staff would later report that companies wanting to sell to Iraq were referred to them by Kristol 's then - boss , Vice President Quayle .
One Quayle family friend would end up constructing a refinery for Saddam to recycle Iraq 's spent artillery shells .
The Bush Justice Department prevented investigators from examining transactions like this , while Commerce Department employees were ordered to falsify export licenses .
As Kristol and Ellsberg discuss the buildup to the 1991 Gulf War , Kristol , of course , continues to fiddle with reality :
" KRISTOL : So you were against the liberation of Kuwait .
" ELLSBERG : No , on the contrary .
At that time , a number of four star military people , former chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , who were foursquare for containing Saddam , preventing him by military means from getting into Saudi Arabia ...
When it came to expelling him from Kuwait , they wanted to give the blockade and the embargo [ more time ] , on the belief of people like Admiral Crowe that that would be preferable to the deaths that would be involved in trying to expel him militarily .
We did n't test that theory .
" KRISTOL :
The argument was not that the sanctions could get him out of Kuwait .
The argument was that we could keep him out of Saudi Arabia .
Who seriously thought he could be expelled from Kuwait by sanctions ?
" ELLSBERG : Practically everyone who testified before Senator Nunn , who is no left - wing radical .
And Senator Nunn himself .
You 've forgotten the history of that .
" KRISTOL : I remember the history vividly . "
Ellsberg is correct , of course : On November 28 , 1990 , former Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Admiral William Crowe testified in front of the Senate Armed Services Committee and its chairman Sen. Sam Nunn ( D - Ga . ) .
Crowe stated : " [ W ]e should give sanctions a fair chance ...
I personally believe they will bring [ Saddam ] to his knees " -- by which Crowe meant Iraq would be " pushed out of Kuwait . "
The same message was delivered by General David Jones , another former Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman .
The next day , the lede in a page one New York Times story was that Crowe and Jones had " urged the Bush Administration today to postpone military action against Iraq and to give economic sanctions a year or more to work . "
It 's not like Kristol could have missed all this , since the Bush administration immediately disputed such commentary -- and one of its point men for the push back was none other than Dan Quayle .
An early December 1990 article about a Quayle speech reported : " [ Quayle ] specifically cited the Senate Armed Services and Foreign Relations Committee " where " voices have argued that the Bush Administration should allow time for economic sanctions against Iraq to work , getting President Saddam Hussein to leave Kuwait voluntarily rather than using force to dislodge him . "
( Unfortunately , there 's no available reporting on whether Quayle 's chief of staff wrote this speech for him . )
Then there 's Kristol 's curious explanation of his views on how the Gulf War ended -- that moment when George H.W. Bush called upon the Iraqi people to overthrow Saddam and then , despite having smashed Saddam 's army and controlling Iraq 's air space , let the dictator 's helicopter gunships take to the air and crush a Shiite uprising .
There were even reports the administration forbade the Saudis from aiding the uprising and that U.S. troops blew up caches of Iraqi weapons rather than allow the rebels to use them .
Kristol , however , uses his courtier 's skills to remake reality more pleasingly :
" KRISTOL : I was unhappy in 1991 when we stopped the war and left this brutal tyrant in power .
I think we betrayed the people who rose up against Saddam , a genuine popular uprising .
That was a big mistake on the part of the Bush administration .
A political mistake and a moral mistake . "
So that 's clear : Kristol feels the decision was immoral .
Or ... was it ?
" KRISTOL : I do n't think these were simply immoral decisions by the president .
These were judgment calls .
There were reasons .
There were arguments .
There were n't simply -- " ELLSBERG :
But they were immoral -- " KRISTOL : Well , no , that 's not so easy to call a political decision an immoral decision . "
That 's fancy footwork for you !
On the one hand , Kristol wants us to know that the decision was indeed " a moral mistake . "
The implication is that he should be respected in the post- invasion moment of 2003 as the sort of sensitive tough guy who would indeed invade Iraq to make up for past decisions that lacked morality .
On the other hand , we 're talking about a former Republican president and the present President 's father .
A straightforward declaration of " immorality , " if pursued far enough , could easily hurt future employment prospects .
Kristol has absolutely perfect pitch , managing to strike a blow for moral beauty in politics while maintaining career viability .
Ellsberg then asks questions aimed at just this issue :
" ELLSBERG : Did you consider doing more than disagree ?
Perhaps putting out the word of your dissent ?
Perhaps resigning with documents and revealing those to the press and the Congress ?
" KRISTOL [ scoffing ] : I had no documents to put out .
There were no secrets about the President 's policy ...
We did n't want to occupy Baghdad .
The rebellion would have failed anyway .
We would have gotten in deeper . "
Hmmm .
No secrets about Bush the elder 's policy .
Yet there was something that most certainly was secret about the rebellions at the end of the Gulf War : Saddam was using chemical weapons to put down the Shiite uprising in the south .
Rumored since 1991 , this has been confirmed by the most impeccable source imaginable -- the CIA 's final 2004 report on Iraq 's WMD .
According to the report , the Iraqi military used Sarin nerve agent , dropped from the helicopters the U.S. had given them permission to fly .
The CIA goes on to to suggest the U.S. government knew about this at the time , describing " reports of attacks in 1991 from refugees and Iraqi military deserters . "
And Gulf
War veterans have said they passed such reports up the chain of command .
Did Kristol know it then ?
Probably not .
But even today there 's no sign he knows : he and the Weekly Standard appear never to have mentioned it .
As with the coups in 1963 and 1968 , Kristol 's ignorance is of a peculiarly convenient variety .
In any case , here 's what Kristol did know : the Bush administration made the choices it did at war 's end not because , as Kristol says , they felt " the rebellion would have failed . "
Their fear was exactly the opposite : that the rebellion would succeed .
Yes , the Bush administration preferred Saddam gone , but it wanted him replaced by some other , more amenable group or leader from the Sunni military elite .
It most certainly did not want a popular uprising that might leave a largely Shiite government in power in Baghdad , potentially close to Iran .
Even worse was the possibility Iraq could fracture , with power shifting to the oil - rich Shiite south .
As an administration official told Peter Galbraith , then a Senate Foreign Relations Committee staffer , " [ O ] ur policy is to get rid of Saddam Hussein , not the regime . "
Later , New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman explained that Washington was looking for " the best of all worlds : an iron - fisted Iraqi junta without Saddam Hussein . "
Kristol 's predictions that March day in 2003 are every bit as on target as his descriptions of the past .
When Ellsberg raises the possibility of the new Iraq war coming to resemble Vietnam in some fashion , Kristol insists that this is utterly preposterous : " It 's not going to happen .
This is going to be a two - month war . "
Here 's the exchange when they turn to what will happen to Iraq 's Kurds :
" ELLSBERG : The Kurds have every reason to believe they will be betrayed again by the United States , as so often in the past .
The spectacle of our inviting Turks into this war ... could not have been reassuring to the Kurds ...
" KRISTOL : I 'm against betraying the Kurds .
Surely your point is n't that because we betrayed them in the past we should betray them this time ?
" ELLSBERG :
Not that we should , just that we will .
" KRISTOL : We will not .
We will not . "
This past December , we did .
The Bush administration officially looked the other way while Turkey carried out a 50 - plane bombing raid on Iraqi Kurdistan against the PKK , a Kurdish rebel group .
Ken Silverstein of Harper 's reprinted an email from a former U.S. official there that said , in part :
" The blowback here in Kurdistan is building against the U.S. government because of its help with the Turkish air strikes .
The theme is shock and betrayal ...
The people killed and wounded were villagers , not PKK fighters or support people
The initial explanation from Washington that the United States did not authorize the Turkish strike is bullshit , and every Kurd here knows it . "
No mention of the bombing has appeared in the Weekly Standard .
It 's fair to assume , however , that Kristol will eventually call America 's actions there " a moral mistake , " while emphasizing that " these were judgment calls .
There were reasons .
There were arguments . "
Back in 2003 , Kristol was also quite certain , almost touchingly so , that the Bush administration would be well served by relying on Iraqi exiles :
" KRISTOL : We have tens of thousands of Shia exiles [ who ] have come back to help contribute to the liberation of Iraq .
" ELLSBERG : I 'm afraid the people who propose this war have failed one lesson of intelligence history , which is not to rely too much on the knowledge of people who have left the country ...
The people who 've come to this country may very well underestimate the desire of those people not to be governed by foreigners . "
This lesson of history goes back a long way .
Book II , Chapter XXXI of Machiavelli's Discourses on Livy is titled " How Dangerous It Is to Believe Exiles " :
" It ought to be considered , therefore , how vain are the faith and promises of those who find themselves deprived of their country ... such is the extreme desire in them to return home , that they naturally believe many things that are false and add many others by art , so that between those they believe and those they say they believe , they fill you with hope , so that relying on them you will incur expenses in vain , or you undertake an enterprise in which you ruin yourself ...
A Prince , therefore , ought to go slowly in undertaking an enterprise upon the representations of an exile , for most of the times he will be left either with shame or very grave injury . "
The Weekly Standard 's archives show Kristol has published quite a few articles on how political correctness in elite U.S. universities is strangling the teaching of the Western canon .
And you can understand where he 's coming from :
While Kristol himself received a PhD in government from Harvard , it obviously was during a period when radical multiculturalists had completely expunged Machiavelli from the curriculum .
When will the PC brigade ever learn ?
Teaching Toni Morrison starts wars .
Finally , there 's the most telling moment of the entire two hours , when a caller asks Kristol something he does not at all expect :
" CALLER : I wonder how we reconcile these views with how we treat the American Indians ?
" KRISTOL : [ raising eyebrows , chuckling ]
Well , I think the American Indians are now full citizens of the United States of America .
We have injustices in our past in treating the American Indians .
I 'm for equal rights for American Indians and for liberating the people of Iraq from this horrible tyranny . "
Kristol obviously finds the caller 's perspective ridiculous .
But the man had , in fact , asked the most profound question possible .
After all , there is a deep cultural connection running from our conquest of the continent to the invasion of Iraq .
While Americans have mostly forgotten this , the early settlers did not perceive themselves as simply pushing Indians out of the way .
Rather , they came here with the very best of intentions .
The 1629 seal of the Massachusetts Bay Colony is a picture of an American Indian , who is saying , " Come over and help us . "
Three hundred seventy - three years later in 2002 , Ahmed Chalabi was being paid by the U.S. government to tell Americans to come over and " help the Iraqi people . "
In his book The Winning of the West , Teddy Roosevelt wrote that no nation " has ever treated the original savage owners of the soil with such generosity as has the United States . "
In 2004 , Fred Barnes wrote ( in the Weekly Standard ) that the invasion of Iraq might be " the greatest act of benevolence one country has ever done for another . "
Kristol finishes the C - Span show with a crescendo :
" The moral credentials of this war are strong .
We 'll see if we follow through .
I agree with Mr. Ellsberg on this , if we 're not serious about helping the Iraqi people rebuild their country and about helping promote decent democratic government in Iraq ... it will be a much less morally satisfying and fully defensible war ...
I 'm happy to be held to a moral standard .
I ask that it be a serious moral standard . "
So , there you have it : a complex , rich experience to be savored by anyone who enjoys watching a master at the very peak of his craft .
Yet trying to encapsulate Kristol 's now almost five year - old chilling performance by turning it into a bitter joke only takes us so far .
After all , the joke is on us .
Kristol indeed has been held to a moral standard , but it 's the moral standard of Rupert Murdoch and , more recently , the New York Times .
What we learn from this dusty vinyl LP is that some of the most powerful men and institutions in our country are genuinely depraved .
They provide Kristol with his prominence not in spite of performances like this one , but precisely because of them .
Kristol is giving them just what they want .
The fact that he 's a propagandist straight out of Pravda 's archives makes the same impression on them as the fact that John Lennon was a great songwriter might make on you or me .
Of course he is .
That 's why we bought the album .

I fear he has hurt himself very badly among those who were more than prepared to give him a chance .
Oliver Willis :
It 's Mitt Romney all over again .
Kevin Drum :
It 's one thing to be against torture in a primary debate where you 're trying to appeal to independents and crossover voters , but it 's quite another thing to be against torture after you 've won the nomination and need to appease a conservative base that 's righteously pissed off and not afraid to let you know it .
Digby :
It would be very helpful if someone in the press would ask McCain is he will rescind Bush 's signing statements pertaining to the president 's alleged " unitary " constitutional right to break the law and order torture .
He said today that he personally believes that torture is illegal but he does n't want to inhibit the CIA so he wo n't vote to explicitly make it illegal across the board .
That 's some straight talk for you .
Damozel at the Moderate Voice :
Why , John McCain ?
Why ?
I do n't mean " Why did you vote the way you did ? "
The answer is obvious .
But why , or how , could you let down people who regarded you as someone who would stand by a moral principle , even if it appeared to be detrimental to his own interests ?
( And I would argue that it has not been detrimental to your interests . )
From being an honored outsider who would take on the establishment , you 've revealed yourself as an ordinary cynical politician .
It 's only now that I am realizing how much I esteemed you for standing by your convictions and insisting on holding the government to a higher standard .
Maybe McCain is waiting to take on the forces of Rove and the electoral advantages of appealing to crude , fascistic templates of " torture - them - or - we - all - die " variety .
But McCain should know that when dealing with unscrupulous thugs , appeasement is not the best policy .
He 's the nominee .
He needs to remind people that conservatism can be - must be - a decent political philosophy , that upholds , rather than trashes , the deepest moral traditions of the United States .

Dear NBC News and the American Public :
A rose by any other name would smell as sweet , and censorship by any other name is censorship .
I think I can speak for every single one of us Americans when saying that your " first amendment rights " to censoring ANY Presidential Candidate is a bogus claim .
Amazing how people can rationalize anything .
We the People see right through it .
Your decision to cut Rep. Dennis Kucinich out of the Debates , going so far as to seek an " emergency appeal " to do so is a ) an undercutting of Kucinich's own free speech b ) an attempt to undermine the American public 's own electoral choices , ie to assist in stealing the election c ) is unconstitutional d ) undermines the Spirit of the Law :
The Purpose of a Free Press ( and media ) is to assure a free flow of information to the public .
It is fascism which seeks to censor and control public information , to brainwash a nation and to support its own agendas .
Just what our founding fathers sought to prevent .
If you think there will be no consequences , you are wrong .
There is a very good reason why Americans are increasingly turning to independent sources of news :
It 's time for you to " get real " with the news if you want to keep your business flourishing .
Because of what you have done as an outright attempt to steal an election , to censor free speech and to cloak it in the selfish and un-reality - based " free speech " garb of your own :
We the People are going to boycott you .
We are going to file class action lawsuits .
We are going to spread word far and wide , urging others to seek independent and REAL sources of news .
We take it into our own hands to tout the cause of Any Presidential Candidate who is being censored , whether we personally agree with their positions or not .
Because this is about Democracy , not about individual agendas and wishes .
Your public image , nationally and internationally , is at stake .
You are no longer a credible source of news .
Instead , you are known as deeply unethical , agenda - based , money - greedy , and biased .
No longer can you be considered an impartial source of news .
NBC , you and the mainstream news are going down in history .
Time to " get real " with the news and the reality which you are carving out for your own selves .
I am requesting that ALL readers spread this letter far and wide .
I am asking that ALL readers write similar letters of their own , posting it to the Internet and e-mailing it all over the globe .
Thank you , dear readers .
MIAMI , Florida ( CNN ) --
More than a million people who want to vote in November 's general election probably wo n't get the chance because of a delay in processing applications to become U.S. citizens , according to the U.S. Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services .
A backlog processing naturalization applications could keep over a million immigrants from voting this fall .
The dream of voting in the upcoming presidential election -- along with a scheduled increase in fees -- motivated 1.4 million people across the country to apply after June 1 last year to become naturalized U.S. citizens -- double the previous year 's number , the bureau said .
The huge jump in applications also increased the time normally needed to process them from about seven months to as many as 18 months .
Serena Perez moved to the United States from Ecuador more than 10 years ago after marrying an American citizen .
She applied for citizenship in May , thinking she would have plenty of time to become a citizen and be granted the right to vote .
But now , she probably wo n't get that chance .
Watch how the backlog affects voting »
" What is the reason for this backlog when there are so many people in an election year that are willing to participate ? "
Perez asked .
Immigrant advocate Jose Lagos is furious at the slowdown .
" They say they are doing what they can , but we think they can do more , " Lagos told CNN .

At a recent congressional hearing , the U.S. Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services said it 's hiring 1,500 more employees to handle the delays .
But officials say that even with the additional resources , there 's little chance the backlog will be significantly reduced by the November election .
Immigrant rights groups estimate as many as 200,000 legal residents in Florida alone are waiting to learn if they 'll become citizens in time to vote .
And in Florida , where the results of the 2000 election hung in the balance , thousands of new voters could swing the 2008 vote .
Historically , Florida immigrants -- many of them Cubans -- tended to vote Republican .
But as more apply for citizenship from other countries , experts say , the immigrant vote is now up for grabs .
Mitch Ceasar , a Democratic party chairman in South Florida , says there are suspicions about the delay .
" Conspiracy theorists may say this is grinding to a very slow movement or halt specifically to disenfranchise these new legal citizens from finishing their process and becoming voters , " Ceasar said .
That view is dismissed by Jose Riesco , the Republican party vice chairman in Miami - Dade County .
" We do n't have voter suppression here , " Riesco said .
" That is ludicrous .
It is an election year , and that is political rhetoric . "
Either way , Perez thinks her vote could make a difference .
" I 'm going to feel I 'm missing an opportunity to change the way the government is running this country .
...
And I really feel that I want to be able to be part of that change , " Perez said .

HPD : Stinky feet led to man 's fatal stabbing
A man allegedly stabbed his roommate to death Saturday night during a drunken argument over smelly feet , Houston police said .
The two men shared a 10 - foot - by - 10 - foot bedroom at the Magnolia Cove Apartment Homes in the 100 block of Goodson , said Sgt. M. Sosa of the homicide squad .
They subleased the bedroom from a married couple , who also lived in the apartment , Sosa said .
On Saturday night , the woman was sitting outside with her newborn baby while the two roommates drank together inside , he said .
The woman 's husband was not home at the time .
At some point , an argument broke out over one of the men's " stinky feet , " Sosa said .
It was n't clear which one of the men's feet allegedly emitted the offensive odor , but the bedroom they shared " does smell , " he said .
About 8 p.m. , the woman peeked inside the window and saw one of the men with two knives in his hands , Sosa said .
" By the time she got inside , he was on top of the other man , " he said .
The woman called 911 and fled the apartment .
" The suspect comes after her and says , ' I did n't mean to do it , I did n't mean to do it , ' " Sosa said .
Worried he might attack her or her baby , the woman alerted a neighbor , who held the man until police arrived , he said .
Shortly after 10 p.m. , police escorted the man from the apartment , barefoot and handcuffed as a crowd of neighbors looked on .
He was taken to police headquarters for questioning .
Investigators did not release the man 's name or that of the victim .

Before the US House of Representatives , December 5 , 2007
I regret that I was unavoidably out of town on October 23 , 2007 , when a vote was taken on HR 1955 , the Violent Radicalization & Homegrown Terrorism Prevention Act .
Had I been able to vote , I would have voted against this misguided and dangerous piece of legislation .
This legislation focuses the weight of the US government inward toward its own citizens under the guise of protecting us against “ violent radicalization . ”
I would like to note that this legislation was brought to the floor for a vote under suspension of regular order .
These so - called “ suspension ” bills are meant to be non-controversial , thereby negating the need for the more complete and open debate allowed under regular order .
It is difficult for me to believe that none of my colleagues in Congress view HR 1955 , with its troubling civil liberties implications , as “ non-controversial . ”
There are many causes for concern in HR 1955 .
The legislation specifically singles out the Internet for “ facilitating violent radicalization , ideologically based violence , and the homegrown terrorism process ” in the United States .
Such language may well be the first step toward US government regulation of what we are allowed to access on the Internet .
Are we , for our own good , to be subjected to the kind of governmental control of the Internet that we see in unfree societies ?
This bill certainly sets us on that course .
This seems to be an unwise and dangerous solution in search of a real problem .
Previous acts of ideologically - motivated violence , though rare , have been resolved successfully using law enforcement techniques , existing laws against violence , and our court system .
Even if there were a surge of “ violent radicalization ”  a claim for which there is no evidence  there is no reason to believe that our criminal justice system is so flawed and weak as to be incapable of trying and punishing those who perpetrate violent acts .
This legislation will set up a new government bureaucracy to monitor and further study the as - yet undemonstrated pressing problem of homegrown terrorism and radicalization .
It will no doubt prove to be another bureaucracy that artificially inflates problems so as to guarantee its future existence and funding .
But it may do so at great further expense to our civil liberties .
What disturbs me most about this legislation is that it leaves the door wide open for the broadest definition of what constitutes “ radicalization . ”
Could otherwise nonviolent anti-tax , antiwar , or anti-abortion groups fall under the watchful eye of this new government commission ?
Assurances otherwise in this legislation are unconvincing .
In addition , this legislation will create a Department of Homeland Security - established university - based body to further study radicalization and to “ contribute to the establishment of training , written materials , information , analytical assistance and professional resources to aid in combating violent radicalization and homegrown terrorism . ”
I wonder whether this is really a legitimate role for institutes of higher learning in a free society .
Legislation such as this demands heavy - handed governmental action against American citizens where no crime has been committed .
It is yet another attack on our Constitutionally - protected civil liberties .
It is my sincere hope that we will reject such approaches to security , which will fail at their stated goal at a great cost to our way of life .
According to Fox News , Mike Huckabee 's statements about showing Iran the " gates of hell " was the most popular statement of last night 's debate , even among moderates .
On the other hand , Fox called Ron Paul 's sensible warnings " the most negative thing we 've tested in all of these debates . "
( link )
There are two ways to interpret Fox 's stance , and both of them leads to war .
Moderates truly support Huckabee 's statement over Ron Paul's
This is the most straightforward and the most disturbing interpretation of that clip .
One would expect moderates to be more wary of calls to arms after :
The WMD embarrassment in Iraq , and The recent NIE finding that Iran was not developing nuclear weapons ( a finding Huckcabee did n't know about for more than 30 hours after its release , by the way ) .
Talk about not learning from your past mistakes .
Fox is misrepresenting the data
The second explanation is that Fox is misrepresenting the data .
Keep in mind the focus group was of 28 Republican - leaning moderates .
Exactly how far do they lean to the right ?
How " moderate " are they ?
Are they Neo Con Republicans ?
Of course , Fox glossed over that part .
Despite the fact that it was only a focus group of 28 people , most of the clip used fancy graphs to convince viewers that this was an important measure of our country 's mood .
The not - so - subtle message :
We 're ready to kick some ass .
Pay attention people .
This is how wars are sold .
MILAN ( Reuters ) - Hotel heiress Paris Hilton dressed provocatively in a skimpy leopard print outfit and showing off her bare legs is not an image Italian winemakers feel is fitting for their Prosecco white sparkling wine .

Yet Hilton , in various high - heeled stages of undress , graces the ads of Rich Prosecco , an Austrian company selling the bubbly in 27 countries .
What ’s worse , in the eyes of Prosecco producers , Rich Prosecco also comes in cans and in two fruit varieties .
“ Hilton hotels are a sign of quality ; Paris Hilton is not , ” said Fulvio Brunetta , president of the wine growers association of Treviso , the northern Italian city in the Veneto region where Prosecco is made .
Paris , a symbol of celebrity privilege in America , gained notoriety in 2003 when a home video of her having sex with a boyfriend was posted on the Internet .
She parlayed her notoriety , fueled by tabloid headlines about her partying lifestyle , into a celebrity career that has included reality television , a book and film roles .
Last year she spent more than three weeks in jail for violating probation in a drunk - driving case .
“ Paris Hilton is sensationalism .
It ’s not good .
It ’s not adequate for Prosecco , ” Brunetta said .
The association is planning two meetings next week to decide on ways to protect the Prosecco name and insure that any company selling Prosecco is actually using wine made from the Treviso area .
“ Without stricter rules , Rich Prosecco or another company could sell Prosecco made in Brazil or wherever , ” Brunetta said .
That ’s not going to stop Rich Prosecco , which says it sources its wine from the Treviso area .
“ We follow exactly European laws , which are very strict , especially concerning wine , ” said Rich Prosecco Chief Executive and owner Gunther Aloys , who founded the company in 2006 in the Austrian ski resort of Ischgl .
To respect wine laws , Rich Prosecco ’s two fruit varieties , with a lower alcohol content and called Rich Passion and Rich Royal , are not labelled Prosecco .
Last year Rich Prosecco sold 10 million cans , primarily in Germany but also in China , India and South Korea , for about 2 euros ( about $ 3 ) a can .
The company ’s rapid growth mirrors the rise of the Prosecco region , which last year produced 50 million bottles , up 14 percent from 2005 , and is increasing exports to Canada and the United States , though Germans remain the top foreign buyers .
The winegrowers are concerned that Rich Prosecco may give their wine the image of a cheap fruit drink .
And then there ’s the cans , advertised by Paris , nude and painted in gold in one ad reminiscent of the James Bond film Goldfinger .
“ In the U.S. and Australia they toast with beer bottles , ” Brunetta said .
“ That ’s their culture .
The culture of Prosecco is one of friends meeting around a good bottle . ”

Aloys says he is helping build the wine ’s world renown and does not understand the fuss .
“ It ’s as if someone from Champagne would oppose us selling champagne cans with Kate Moss for example .
It ’s just marketing and Paris Hilton is the most famous girl in the world . ”
Last year Paris ’s grandfather Barron Hilton said he would donate 97 percent of his $ 2.3 billion fortune to charity .
Jerry Oppenheimer , who profiled the Hilton family in his 2006 book “ House of Hilton , ” has said Barron Hilton is embarrassed by the behavior of his socialite granddaughter Paris and believes it has sullied the family name .
Barron Hilton has not commented on the book .

Soldiers witness what they think is some sort of natural phenomenon in the sky over Iraq .
By Alastair Leithead
BBC News , Kabul
Hundreds of families , comprising some 6,000 mainly women and children , have been crossing the border .
The UN refugee agency says clashes between Pakistan 's Shia and Sunni groups have forced people to flee .
It is the first time so many people have crossed this way as for years it was Afghans fleeing fighting .
It 's the first time that we see this in very large numbers
Salvatore Lombardo , UNHCR
The refugees have been crossing the border between Pakistan 's tribal areas and south - eastern Afghan provinces .
The UN refugee agency ( UNHCR ) says historic clashes between Shias and Sunnis in the villages in Kurram , North West Frontier Province , have escalated in the past couple of weeks .
This and the unstable situation in that part of Pakistan have led to the movement of so many people , the UNHCR says .
" It 's the first time that we see this in very large numbers which shows that security in those areas has seriously deteriorated and it's probably become out of control , " said Salvatore Lombardo , a UNHCR representative in Kabul .
He said many of the people had been given shelter in Afghanistan by villagers who live by the Pashtun Valley tribal code of hospitality , and tents were being handed out to help provide shelter as winter was intensifying along the border .
Discussions
Over the past three decades millions of Afghans fled the violence in their country during the Soviet occupation , the civil war and then in the fighting that saw the Taleban take control of Afghanistan .
With the rise of the Pakistani Taleban and militant Islamic groups along the Pakistan side of the border , the UN says it now appears that parts of Afghanistan are safer for families .
It is hoped discussions within the tribal groups can resolve the situation and allow the people to return home .
This is a post that has been a couple weeks in the making ( in my head ) , but the more that time passes by the less interested I am in writing it .
Nevertheless , there are a couple of points I want to get out there both for the record and for possible discussion .
First of all , it is obvious that Zed was using that ugly word in its current derogatory sense , and I 'll keep that sense in my writing as well .
According to the dictionary one of the definitions of ghetto is " an isolated group " or " a situation that resembles a ghetto especially in conferring inferior status or limiting opportunity " .
In the greater realm of IT ?
Does that definition ring true of Rails in the greater realm of Information Technology , or even just the programming world ?
I do n't think so .
The Rails community is not an isolated group , having members across a wide , diverse , range of enterprises and groups of individuals , from the highest - paid professional consultants , to the humblest program - for - fun enthusiasts .
What about inferior status , or opportunity limitations ?
That does n't ring true either .
If anything , the mainstream fascination with dynamic languages was ignited by Ruby on Rails a couple of years ago , which gives popular Rails practitioners a disproportionate amount of influence ( ahem ) in the programming world , and a prominent voice in online conversations about the future of our craft .
From my own ( admittedly - biased ) viewpoint , Rails is continuing to explode in popularity .
Among other things , my book The Rails Way is selling extremely well , and we just had to do a rush reprint because demand exceeded even our optimistic estimates .
It 's currently a top - seller on Safari ( a good indicator of traditional corporate developer interest levels ) , and has been hovering in the hundreds ranking on all of Amazon.com .
But where are the jobs ?
To those that would use the number of Rails - related listings on major job boards as evidence of opportunity limitations , I point out that due to extraordinary demand for Ruby talent in the marketplace , it is almost pointless to advertise Ruby job positions via conventional channels .
The way to find Rails talent is via targeted Ruby job boards , word of mouth , and blogging .
Counts on mainstream job boards are meaningless at best , misleading at worst .
Most Rails developers worth their salt are contracting , simply because it is very lucrative right now .
Rates for premium Rails talent is now in the neighborhood of $ 200 / hour and continuing to climb .
Average Rails talent costs at least $ 100 / hour .
The work is finding them , not vice - versa .
Why are clients willing to pay so much ?
Because they know we are a cost - effective bunch , doing the same amount of work ( as individuals ) that would take multiple traditional programmers in other mainstream languages , and with higher - quality as the " icing on the cake " .
How about just in the Ruby community ?
Considering Zed strictly within the confines of the Ruby community , and not in the much bigger sphere of programming , I think he 's still wrong .
Like a newbie OO programmer violating the rule prefer composition over inheritance , he made an is - a / has - a mistake .
What is true perhaps , metaphorically , is that Rails has ghettos , and Zed made the mistake of attributing qualities of a ghetto to the whole .
What I " m trying to say is that there are groups of people that have come over to work in Rails , the city of Rails if you will , who have settled into neighborhoods that can be very dangerous ( monetarily ) to inexperienced clients .
But why can't Zed get a job then ?
What put me off about Zed 's rant was not so much the content , but rather that it achieved such wide circulation .
It was n't meant to be read so widely , and I do n't believe that he had destructive intentions when he wrote it .
I lived and worked with Zed for five months during 2007 , a time in which we became ( and remain ) good friends .
I swear to you that Zed is a good , friendly guy , in person .
( His created , over - the - top , narcissist online persona is another story ! )
The rant was filled with tons of inside jokes and commentary that really only make sense to other clued - in Ruby people , stuff that comes across as just mean , stupid or crazy to everyone else .
For instance , a significant percentage of readers obviously understood from the rant that Zed is unemployed , starving , and / or stark - raving mad .
All three could not be further from the truth .
Zed is happily employed by a major , household - name financial institution in New York City , where he comes into work everyday with a nice shirt and tie , and leads a Rails ( yes , Rails ) development team .
Of course , none of this is news to those of us that really know him , but the rest of the world got a totally different story .
The Touchmods team have released version 1.0 of SIP - VoIP for the iPod Touch .
This hack will allow the Touch to make phone calls over its WiFi connection .
Although named version 1.0 , it is most certainly still a beta , and will take some special magic on your part to get things going .
The Touchmodders are giving away the software and hope to make money on their iPod Touch microphone , without which you ’ll be having a very one - sided conversation .
Installation is easy if your iPod Touch is already hacked .
You ’ll need to add the Touchmod team ’s server to the Installer ’s source list ( http://touchmods.net/rep.xml) before the application will show up .
You ’ll then need to get a SIP ( Session Initiation Protocol ) account .
SIP is the open protocol for VoIP .
I tried with my Gizmo Project account details with little success , but as you can see in the video , it does work .
The application will need some prettying up and a little more user feedback ( error messages are absent ) , but this is shaping up to be a nice little hack .

Why writing a tutorial about fog ?
Have you heard of the new features of Direct3D 10 or OpenGL 3.0 ?
Or more accurately , by the lack of features ?
For simplicity reasons , ( I hope so at least ... )
D3D10 no longer supports the fixed functions of the 3D pipeline .
The first aftermath is that these features have to be coded again at the shaders ' level ( lighting , materials , texturing , fog ... ) .
The second aftermath is that D3D10 requires a barely high level of skills in order to code a simple scene , because you have to know how to handle programable shaders , even for a simple scene .
On its part , OpenGL keeps giving fixed pipeline support , whilst it supports the new features of the programmable pipeline .
The best of all worlds for begining developer , as for the skilled one .
In this tutorial , we shall see how to add fog support to our real - time GLSL - written shaders ( OpenGL Shading Language ) .
Fog support already existssince the first implementations of OpenGL at the fixed pipeline level , but if your objects ' rendering uses GLSL shaders , you 'll need to implement it at the programmable pipeline level .
At the end of this tutorial , you 'll be able to implement fog equations in any environment ( OpenGL or Direct3D ) .
We shall use the Demoniak3D platform in order to experiment our GLSL shaders .
For your feedbacks , please use the following thread : GLSL Fog Tut @ oZone3D .

First Apple - Authorized Tablet Mac Shipped
Axiotron 's Modbook offers 512 levels of pressure sensitivity to achieve a level of precision needed in creating and editing digital art .
Axiotron has released to retailers its Apple - authorized tablet Mac , which targets artists and design - oriented professionals .
Axiotron 's Modbook is a modified MacBook running Mac OS X that has had its screen and keyboard severed and replaced with the tablet screen .
The Modbook , which started shipping Dec. 31 , uses a pen-sensitive LCD slate - style display from Wacom for onscreen writing and drawing .
Axiotron unveiled the Modbook a year ago at Macworld .
The Modbook pen offers 512 levels of pressure sensitivity to achieve a level of precision needed in creating and editing digital art , the company said .
The computer comes pre-installed with Mac OS X Leopard , officially OS X 10.5 , and is powered by a 2.0 GHz or a 2.2 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo processor .
The device uses Leopard 's built - in Inkwell software for handwriting recognition .
The tablet has a 13.3 - inch screen , a built - in iSight Webcam , a global positioning system , and a CD / DVD combo drive .
The computer also has built - in support for Bluetooth and 802.11n Wi -Fi .
It has a triple layer of metal plating , including nickel over copper and topped with chrome , and is available in standard satin or optional mirror finish .
The Modbook is a modified MacBook with its screen and keyboard severed and replaced with a tablet screen .
The device , which is available through Axiotron resellers , has a suggested retail price starting at $ 2,290 .
The computer will be shown at Macworld 2008 in San Francisco , Jan. 15 - 18 .
Bloggers have been chattering for months about the possibility of Apple releasing its own tablet Mac or an ultra-mobile computer .
Others have also speculated that the company may be readying a handheld device that would be separate from the iPod Touch or iPhone .
On the Windows side of the market , Dell last month released its first tablet PC , saying that businesses were ready to consider more flexible types of computers for employees .
The Latitude XT weighs 3.5 pounds and features a 12.1 - inch daylight - viewable display for indoor and outdoor use .

AP Via Yahoo :
Iraqi investigators have a videotape that shows Blackwater USA guards opened fire against civilians without provocation in an incident last week in which 11 people died , a senior Iraqi official said Saturday .
He said the case was referred to the Iraqi judiciary .
Interior Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Abdul - Karim Khalaf said Iraqi authorities had completed an investigation into the Sept. 16 shooting in Nisoor Square in western Baghdad and concluded that Blackwater guards were responsible for the deaths .
He told The Associated Press that the conclusion was based on witness statements as well as videotape shot by cameras at the nearby headquarters of the national police command .
He said eight people were killed at the scene and three of the 15 wounded died in hospitals .

C&L has been documenting Blackwater 's activities for some time now .
While it would be heartening to think these investigations by the Iraqi government will end in justice for the families of the murdered , it 's not a likely outcome .
It 's put up or shut up time for the Bush administration -- if the Iraqi government is truly sovereign as they love to shout at every opportunity , they need to step back and let them make their own decisions .
In a separate matter , Blackwater has released a statement in which they deny illegal arms activities in Iraq .
DIGG THIS
Thomas Friedman expressed the view that if the Republicans had remained in control of the House and the Senate , the US would have become a banana republic .
But a banana republic is n’t characterised only by a rotten political system , ruled by a small , wealthy , and corrupt clique usually put in power or supported by foreign interests ( in the 20th century , in the case of several Central and Latin American countries , by the US ) , but also by huge wealth and income inequities , poor infrastructure , backwardness in many sectors of the economy , low capital spending , a reliance on foreign capital , money printing and budget deficits , and of course a weakening currency .
A banana republic is also characterised by a ruling class that curtails people ’s personal freedoms and is moving towards a heavyhanded military dictatorship under the excuse of fighting guerrilla ( or terrorist ) opposition groups or enemies .
Moreover , the fact that the ruling class or the elite comes from different political parties is n’t a relevant factor in classifying a country as a banana republic ; what is relevant is the determination of the elite , irrespective of which party its members belong to , to shift wealth from the majority of the people ( the masses ) to themselves , usually through simply printing money and incurring chronic budget deficits , and frequently also through senseless warfare .
Now , I am not insinuating that the US is already a banana republic , but the trend is undoubtedly there .
The physical infrastructure is more often than not totally insufficient .
Not a single flight I took in the US was on time , with one arriving 10 hours late , another 12 hours late , while two were cancelled altogether , resulting in delays of more than 4 hours .
In Philadelphia , my US Air flight was delayed by three hours .
The plane was on the ground in front of us , the pilots were all present , as well as one flight attendant ( air hostess ) .
But because a second flight attendant was unavailable in Philadelphia , one had to be flown in from Washington , so delaying my flight .
Since there was no service provided on the flight , I wondered what purpose the additional attendant might have served .
I stayed at five different hotels on this trip .
In three of them they could n’t locate the FedEx box that my assistant had sent me from Hong Kong and which had been signed for as having been received by the hotel .
As I have written before , the productivity of corporations has risen , but the productivity of the consumer is down as he is constantly waiting in lines and has to suffer from insufficient service and support staff .
Also , compared to Asian and European cities , the streets tend to be filthy , except , of course , in the “ ghettos ” where the super - rich live .
In the meantime , members of the American elite are enjoying the asset inflation , the printing of money , and the trade and current account deficits , because they keep the “ lower classes ” reasonably happy and content by allowing them to continue to consume and buy “ cheap ” foreign goods .
In turn , this excessive consumption and lack of capital spending boosts corporate earnings and cash flows , which then benefit mostly the elite , through rising stock prices .
Moreover , the weakening currency , which is also brought about by capital flight  another characteristic of banana republics  does n’t bother the elite much because they have the ability to easily transfer their wealth overseas or to fully hedge their exposure to the declining foreign exchange rate .
( The aristocrats of banana republics are usually Swiss banks ’ best customers . )
This is particularly true in the case of moneyed elites , which are relatively fixed asset poor and hugely financial asset rich .
Let me explain .
Compare , say , a farmer who cultivates land that has been in his family for generations with a money shuffler on Wall Street .
The farmer is far more tied to his land by tradition , and by his inability to transfer that land and his familiar environment overseas , than is the money shuffler , who will feel equally comfortable whether he lives in New York ’s Park Avenue , London ’s Belgravia , or Singapore ’s Nassim Road .
Basically , what I am suggesting here is that the financial sector  and there are exceptions  really does n’t care much for the overall long - term health of an economy ; it is only interested in asset prices moving up  no matter how unsound the economic policies might be that inflate those asset prices .
So , when things really turn bad and  to use Senator Webb ’s words  the “ bifurcation of opportunities and advantages ” along class lines leads to “ a period of political unrest ” , the money shufflers  like so many former leaders of banana republics have done before them  just pack their bags , hop in their private jets , and move to another society where they can start playing the same game all over again !
Now , this is not to say that there are no responsible people among the money shufflers , but the immense pressure to perform in order to make money as quickly as possible , and hence to enjoy a “ high esteem ” among their peers , which is now based solely on how much money an individual makes , has shifted the priorities of the money shufflers and the chief executive officers of companies in a way that is regrettable .
Still , I was very gratified to see that there are still some socially responsible companies in the US , and this is the second good news I have to report about the US .
On my trip I stayed twice at Marriott hotels , where I found the staff to be extremely friendly and helpful .
In New Orleans , at a private party hosted by David Tice , I spoke at length to two Marriott employees who were attending to the bar .
One of them had been with Marriott for over 20 years , the other for eight years , and both of them could n’t praise the management enough for “ caring ” for its employees .
So happy were they , they assured me , they wished to work for Marriott until they retired .
Not entirely believing what I was hearing , I asked my cleaning lady at the San Francisco Marriott how she enjoyed working for the chain .
Again , she had only positive things to say .
She smiled and said that she was “ very happy ” to work for the company , where she cleans 40 rooms a day .
And although I do n’t agree with some of the Marriott ’s policies ( no smoking facilities in their US hotels , and in San Francisco patrons are prohibited from bringing their own alcoholic beverages into the hotel ) , it is encouraging to see that successful and profitable companies can also treat ordinary people well .
The third good news is that although there are ominous signs of the US drifting towards the status of a banana republic , the polarisation of wealth is n’t due only to appreciating asset values , inheritances , and the disproportionate growth of the financial sector compared to the rest of the economy .
The five richest Americans all made their money themselves , and while money managers , real estate moguls ( including hotel and casino owners ) , and leverage buyout artists are very predominant on the Forbes list of the 400 richest people in America , there are also a large number of “ new economy ” entrepreneurs on the list , such as the founders of Yahoo , eBay , Amazon , and Google .
This goes to show that there is still ample social mobility in American society .
Still , what is striking about the list of America ’s richest people is that most of the wealthy people ( inheritances aside ) are involved in some form of money management , consumer finance , real estate , oil and gas , or anything that has to do with consumption , such as casinos , hotels , retail , advertising , fast food , media , entertainment , sport , cosmetics , and health care .
This gives me the impression of a relatively lopsided economy consisting of asset inflation beneficiaries and entrepreneurs who know how to encourage and capitalise on Americans ’ seemingly insatiable appetite for consumption .
Finally , I also have to point out that there are two socially different Americas : there are the money and asset shufflers in the coastal areas ; and then there is the conservative , but extremely friendly and hospitable , inland and southern population .
Tennessee was an eyeopener for me .
Although I had travelled around the South in the past , the contrast between Tennessee ’s social fabric and that of New England or of California ’s coastal regions could hardly be more striking .
And while in earlier reports I have been very critical about the Southern states that supported the Bush administration , I also have to admit that the types of Americans who live outside the coastal regions are also those most likely to retard the process of American society sliding into the state of a banana republic .
These people tend to have high ethical values ( although admittedly sometimes misdirected ) , and they are very concerned about and proud of their small communities .
I came away with the impression that people in these communities help and support each other , and are also  in a positive sense  patriotic and proud to be Americans .
I was also pleasantly surprised by Tennessee ’s scenic beauty ( there are some magnificent homes along the Tennessee River ) and its low price level .
In a bar in Knoxville , where a band ( unfortunately without Dolly Parton ) played hillbilly rock , a pint of excellent local draft beer cost just $ 2 .
In fact , I found wages for less - skilled workers in the US to be extremely low when compared to wages for similarly skilled workers in Switzerland and most of the EU .
A builder from Baltimore , whom I met on the street in New Orleans , told me that he pays his foreman  according to him , a highly qualified worker  just $ 18 per hour , while all his other staff earn between $ 10 and $ 12 per hour .
( Baltimore , by the way , has the highest murder rate in the US . )
A New Orleans waitress told me that her basic wage was $ 2 an hour , but of course she earned tips on top of that .
A taxi driver in Knoxville told me he earns between $ 300 and $ 400 a week .
Compared to wages in Switzerland , these amounts are extremely low .
They are also very low compared to prices of US assets ( real estate and equities ) .
Based on the low level of wages compared to both Western European wages and US asset prices , I am inclined to think that either US wages might continue to rise or asset prices could adjust down to the wage level .
Also , whereas the US dollar may adjust on the downside against Asian currencies and precious metals , it may be less vulnerable against the Euro .
At the expense of being called anti-American , I found that , with the exception of the areas where the wealthy people live , as I mentioned above , the streets are filthy .
The French Quarter in New Orleans , which escaped being flooded during Hurricane Katrina , may not be entirely representative of inner-city areas in the US , but on an early morning walk , Bourbon Street looked as if hordes of Vandals had just ridden through !
The streets around the Marriott hotel in San Francisco ( located on 4th Street adjacent to Market Street , and a block from Bloomingdale ’s  and thus not exactly a slum area ) were n’t much better .
( Compared to , say , Japan , the streets , clothing , and food in the US are , to put it bluntly , schmuddelig  tacky or filthy . )
I have also never seen anywhere in the world as many police cars as I saw patrolling the streets of New Orleans .
( The more police cars required to patrol the streets , the closer a region or a country is to being a banana republic . )
Above , I referred to the insufficient physical infrastructure in the US .
Not only are airlines late , but the types of old aircraft that are frequently in service would n’t be used by even budget Asian air carriers .
Airports are mostly inefficient ( there are long lines and long waiting times for luggage delivery )  certainly compared to Asia ; and there are no transit facilities at US airports for foreign visitors en route to another country .
So , if a passenger from Asia transits in Los Angeles on the way to Mexico , he or she needs to clear US immigration and customs in LA .
This increases the workload of immigration and customs officers for no purpose whatsoever .
Late , unreliable , and uncomfortable flights , as well as poor airport facilities , then motivate wealthy people , corporate executives and , of course , politicians to travel by private plane .
This increases the amount of airline traffic and clogs air space .
In turn , this causes even more flight delays .
In addition , and this should be understood very clearly , if the wealthy , corporate executives , and especially politicians increasingly live a life of their own ( private jets , private schools , private clubs , personal drivers , and high - end living compounds ) , they frequently fail to notice the poor state of affairs in , and also begin to care less and less about , the rest of the country and its physical , security , and educational infrastructure , which then creates a huge gap between social classes ( another characteristic of a banana republic ) .
I am not suggesting that we do n’t have huge wealth and income inequities in Asia , but whereas in Asia people are accustomed to these conditions , in the US this growing two - class system will lead to disappointed expectations and , at some point , in all likelihood , to social strife .
As I have explained above , however , not all is rotten and bad in the US .
There are many pockets of incredible inventiveness , innovation , technology , research and development , education , knowledge , and high moral and ethical values .
But the trend I am observing , after having been a regular visitor to the US since 1970 , is certainly not very encouraging .
It will take very strong determination and sacrifices by all classes of the American nation to reverse this relative social and economic decline when measured against the newly emerging economies of the world .
IS THE US ECONOMY ROLLING OVER ?
There is growing evidence that US consumption is slowing down , based on the weakness in the housing industry and slower credit growth .
In fact , the August 8 , 2006 GBD report , entitled “ Increased Recession Risks ! ” , alerted our readers to the possibility of the US economy entering a recession in late 2006 or early 2007 .
However , there are a few issues we need to address .
First , it is far from certain that the US consumer will cave in ; and second , we will need to address the investment implications of a slowdown or decline in US consumption .
I mention this because it is one thing to forecast economic trends , and another to draw the correct investment conclusions .
Most strategists and economists correctly forecasted the global economic expansion , especially the strength in Asia , following 2001 , but they totally failed even to mention industrial commodities as the preferred asset class for capitalising on such a global economic recovery .
Others were misled into believing that strong corporate profit growth in the US would lead to a strong US stock market performance , when in fact the increase in US equities in the last four years significantly lagged the performance of emerging market and European equities and was flat in Euro terms , as rising US financial asset prices were offset by a weak dollar  not to mention the continuous decline of US asset prices in gold and silver terms .
So , to conclude that a weakening US consumer will inevitably lead to a lower stock market is tenuous at best .
There is no doubt that , as David Rosenberg pointed out , US retail sales growth has slowed .
An especially sharp slowdown in sales growth occurred in housing - related retail sales .
Whereas last March housing retail sales were growing at an annual rate of over 17 % , in the three months ending October they rose year - on - year by only 4.5 % .
But , considering the weak housing environment , I find the current growth rate in this sector to be quite remarkable .
Moreover , the slowdown in housing retail sales does n’t tell us anything about whether we should be long or short Home Depot .
Moreover , as David Rosenberg also pointed out , many strategists have expressed the view that , based on slower bank consumer and mortgage credit growth , the economy will weaken further .
This may be the case , but the fact is that while consumer loan growth ( ex auto leases ) has slowed , it is still positive .
Moreover , even if consumer loan growth turned negative , as it did in 1997 , it would n’t mean that a recession is just around the corner .
After all , the 2001 recession occurred almost four years after consumer loans turned down , and actually at a time when consumer loan growth had recovered .
Obviously Mr. Greenspan ’s money printing , post the 1998 LTCM and Russian crises , and ahead of Y2 K , had a positive impact on equities and consumption .
I am not trying to downplay the significance of slower consumer credit growth ; I wish only to point out that easy money and rising equity prices can postpone a consumer downturn .
Furthermore , banks ’ real estate loans , as well as commercial and industrial loans , still seem to be growing rapidly .
I concede that banks ’ real estate loans could be increasing because of still - strong non-residential construction activity , including construction for commercial buildings , hotels and amusement parks .
( Amusement park construction leading to more consumption is , of course , exactly what the US needs at present ! )
But also home mortgage borrowings are still rising , although obviously at a far slower rate than a year ago .
One factor that needs to be considered when making predictions based on a decline or slowdown in bank credit growth is , of course , that bank lending is only part of credit growth , as consumers and businesses can increasingly borrow money outside the banking sector through bond issuance and all kinds of other asset - backed and collateralised debt securities .
According to Doug Noland of PrudentBear.com , total commercial paper issuance is up , year - to - date , by 20 % , and while asset - backed security issuance is running 6 % below the 2005 record pace ( home equity loans are down 5 % y- o -y ) , collateralised debt obligations issuance is running 80 % ahead of 2005 .
Moreover , international reserves ( ex gold )  a reliable indicator of international liquidity  are up year - to - date by 18 % annualised !
I am aware that bank loan officers are reporting that households and corporations are slowing down their borrowings .
In fact , Albert Edwards of Dresdner Kleinwort recently published a report entitled “ Almost unnoticed , one key part of the liquidity cycle turns downward ” , in which he makes the case that ,
… both corporate and household appetite for debt is deteriorating at the same time , in contrast to say , 1994 and 2001 , where weakness in credit demand in one sector was counterbalanced by strength in demand by the other sector .
What does it mean if the credit cycle is turning down when , at the same time , the US private sector has been borrowing heavily to finance its yawning funding gap ( the excess of spending over income ) ?
Any cessation of borrowing appetite can only mean one thing  a sharp retrenchment in spending must now be underway and with it comes the risk of a hard landing .
There is no way around it as we are working within National Income Account identities .
According to Edwards , “ the liquidity lake is drying up at the same time as the fundamentals are deteriorating ….
When prices swing in the other direction and investors begin to feel the pain , ‘ liquidity ’ will suddenly evaporate as either investors end speculative excesses or alternatively banks pull the plug . ”
I have no doubt that Albert Edwards will be right at some point .
The question , however , is whether reduced appetite for debt by the household sector can be offset by an increased appetite by investors ( including foreigners ) and whether the corporate sector has indeed less appetite for debt .
After all , commercial and industrial loans growth is still well and alive ( also confirmed by the credit growth figures provided by Doug Noland ) .
Reduced demand for funds by the corporate sector could also be the consequence of corporations being flushed with cash .
Moreover , as long as the US current account deficit does n’t contract , foreign net financial investments into the US wo n’t contract .
As Bridgewater Associates pointed out recently in a piece entitled “ What To Do With All of the Money ? ” , the resilience of the US economy can largely be explained by foreigners loading up on US government bonds and the diminished demand by the government and by cash - rich businesses that do n’t need to borrow at all .
According to Bridgewater ’s Bob Prince and Jason Rotenberg ,
… over the past year , foreigners plowed 6.4 % of GDP into US financial assets ( entirely debt ) , business provided another 0.6 % , saver households provided 4 % and the government only needed 2.8 % to finance the deficit .
The total financing was 8.2 % of GDP .
This financing was essentially thrust upon the remaining households , who were then forced to borrow it , which means that they were forced to spend it , which required output and employment .
I have to say that I am not entirely in agreement with the analysis by Bridgewater .
I could argue that ultra-expansionary US monetary policies after 2001 led to excessive US consumption .
In turn , excessive consumption led to a growing trade and current account deficit , which then forced foreigners to plough back funds into the US equivalent to the current account deficit .
Last month ’s GBD was entitled “ No Chain is Stronger than its Weakest Link ” .
I ’m not sure what the weakest link is in the equation : consumption in the US , or the appetite of foreign central banks for continuing to finance this consumption through enormous net financial investment flows .
I have to confess that I am at a loss to see exactly what event will act as the catalyst to unravel this admittedly unstable and , in the long run unsustainable , equilibrium .
It could be accelerating inflation , a total loss of confidence in the US dollar , or , as Albert Edwards suggests , a sharp retrenchment in consumption .
It could also be an exogenous event  such as war , the interruption of oil supplies , a major terrorist attack ( it is only a matter of time before terrorists will be in possession of nuclear or biological weapons ) or a pandemic  that derails the Goldilocks scenario .
Something is bound to happen , but then we also have to take into account that Mr. Bernanke and Mr. Paulson will be standing by with their money printing machines and “ extraordinary monetary policy measures ” to bail out their bodies on Wall Street and in government .
There is one last point I wish to make and this concerns the recent improvement in the still - negative saving rate and , as David Rosenberg puts it , the net paydown of consumer credit .
From the figures provided by Bridgewater , we can see that although the average household is n’t saving , there are still a huge number of US saver households that are lending money through the financial system .
These household savers provided 4 % of GDP to balance the financial gap ( see above ) .
Now , in an economy where wealth is shifted from the masses or the median household to the Wall Street bonus recipients and other asset shufflers , the saving rate does increase : the average household may not save out of current income , but people earning in excess of US $ 50 million a year may have a 90 % to 95 % saving rate .
As a result , the overall increase in the saving rate for the economy as a whole may be due not to the typical household ’s willingness to increase its savings and rebuild its balance sheet , but to his complete inability to spend .
In this instance , the growing income and wealth inequities lead to some form of “ forced saving ” and can contribute , as some economists maintain , to an economic slump .
( The Great Depression of 1929 1932 is explained partly by rising income inequity : the masses want to spend but cannot afford it , while the rich can spend but already have everything and therefore do n’t spend enough . )
INVESTMENT IMPLICATIONS
From our remarks about the polarisation of wealth in the US , one could construe that the typical household in the US is vulnerable , whereas the type of people who make the Forbes list of the 400 wealthiest Americans will continue to thrive .
( I could also be labelled as a socialist . )
This would imply avoiding stocks such as Wal - Mart and Home Depot , and buying any company that has to do with the economy of the superrich , such as auction houses , brokerage stocks , publicly traded hedge and LBO funds , luxury goods retailers , and high - end hotel chains , or investing in top - end properties around the world .
Indeed , if we compare the performance of luxury department stores to the performance of low - end stores , it is evident that the economy of the super - rich has done far better than that of the median household .
However , when payback time comes , it is likely that the economy of the super - rich could be hurt rather badly .
This would certainly be the case if Albert Edwards is correct and the “ credit cycle is turning down ” .
In the mid-1990s , Stephen Roach frequently wrote about a “ workers ’ backlash ” .
His view was that , in time , wages would rise , lifting the rate of inflation and depressing corporate profits .
While this view was premature then , I would n’t be surprised to see wage inflation accelerating and shifting some income back from Wall Street and corporations to the labour force .
Such a shift would lead to higher inflation and have a negative impact on corporate profit margins , and on the valuation of bonds and equities .
There is another point I should like to make about the economy of the super - rich .
In the late 1980s , the super - rich did very well in Japan .
In the mid-1990s , the super - rich creamed off all the money in Southeast Asia .
Both periods were characterised by asset accumulators becoming rich and being highly leveraged .
In both cases , subsequent events  the bear market in asset prices in Japan , and the Asian crisis  hurt the asset shufflers the most ; ordinary people , especially those living in the countryside , were hardly affected .
I suppose that if you have nothing , you have little to lose !
Therefore , as a contrarian bet , I would look at shorting at some point companies that have benefited the most from the shift in wealth from the masses to the asset shufflers .
Such a list would obviously include luxury retailers , the brokerage industry , asset management companies , and custody banks , all of which either arranged or benefited from this transfer of wealth and the asset inflation .
The last few weeks have been characterised by a weak dollar and rising equity , bond , and commodity prices .
As we move into 2007 , the pattern will be the same .
Either the Fed will finally decide to implement tight monetary policies , which would strengthen the US dollar and weaken all asset prices except bonds , or it will continue with its expansionary bias .
In that case , asset prices will continue to rise and the dollar will continue to weaken .
However , it should be understood that under easy monetary policies , dollar assets ( US equities , bonds , and real estate ) will , as has been the case for the last few years , underperform foreign assets and commodities .
Since Mr. Bernanke was appointed Fed chairman , the S&P 500 is up by 14.6 % in dollars , but only by 7.5 % in Euro terms .
Over the same time frame ( November 1 , 2005 to November 27 , 2006 ) , gold is up 40 % , silver 80 % , and copper 68 % .
Year - to - date , the S&P is up 11 % in dollars but only up 0.2 % in Euros and , of course , it is down against gold and silver .
The worst investments were US dollar cash and bonds , both of which declined in value in both Euro and gold terms .
Therefore , I advise investors who wish to have an equity exposure to overweight foreign markets , especially the Asian stock markets , and to significantly underweight US assets .
Near term , asset markets are mostly over - extended and the contrarian play is to reduce exposure to all asset markets .
Moreover , after its recent weakness , the dollar could stabilise , but a strong rally should n’t be expected .
Euro - area monetary and debt growth has been strong over the last 12 months and may force the European Central Bank to increase interest rates , which should support or even strengthen the Euro .
Also , given the record short positions that exist in the Japanese Yen , I would consider buying Yen against the US dollar .
As of late November , asset markets became extremely overbought .
I recommend deferring any buying and to await the shape and the severity of the expected correction .
I wish my readers a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year .
I would like all my readers to travel often to new places to see the world , to learn about other cultures , and to take an interest in other people ’s lives .
I also hope that my more affluent readers know that giving money away is n’t the only way to help those who are less fortunate .
As the author Han Suyin ( A Many Splendored Thing ) observed , “ There is nothing stronger in the world than gentleness . ”
And as Abigail Van Buren remarked , “ The best index to a person ’s character is how he treats people who ca n’t do him any good , and how he treats people who ca n’t fight back . ”
At the same time , I hope that my readers enjoy their lives and have some fun and laughs .
The famous and extremely popular golfer Chi Chi Rodriguez once said : “ I was born broke , so I want to live like a millionaire and die poor ; I do n’t want to live poor and die a millionaire . ”
Mark
Twain believed that , “ Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you did n’t do than by the ones you did do .
So throw off the bowlines .
Sail away from the safe harbor .
Catch the trade winds in your sails .
Explore .
Dream .
Discover . ”
At the same time , on a more sobering note , do n’t forget the words of Mahatma Mohandas K. Gandhi : “ The things that will destroy us are : politics without principle ; pleasure without conscience ; wealth without work ; knowledge without character ; business without morality ; science without humanity ; and worship without sacrifice . ”

The Best of Marc Faber
Tauschen verboten
VON CHRISTIAN RATH
Die Hüterin der Schulhöfe hat nun doch nachgegeben .
Justizministerin Brigitte Zypries ( SPD ) verzichtet bei der geplanten Reform zum Urheberrecht auf die von ihr angekündigte „ Bagatellklausel “ .
Mit dieser Klausel wollte sie gelegentliche Nutzer von Internet - Musik - und Filmtauschbörsen vor Strafverfolgung bewahren .
Durchgesetzt hat sich nun aber die CDU .
„ Es darf keine unterschiedliche Wertung zwischen dem Diebstahl eines Kaugummis und einem illegalen Download geben “ , hatte der CDU - Urheberrechtsexperte Günther Krings gefordert .
Künftig wird der vor allem bei Jugendlichen beliebte Download von Musiktiteln aus Internet - Tauschbörsen also strafbar sein .
Zulässig bleibt nur das Brennen einer CD für Freunde – wenn dabei kein Kopierschutz der Plattenfirma verletzt wird .
Dies sind die Kernpunkte einer Reform des Urheberrechts , die die Bundesregierung gestern in die Wege geleitet hat .
Noch in diesem Jahr soll der Bundestag den Gesetzentwurf beschließen .
Anlass der Reform sind Klagen der Plattenfirmen und Filmverleihe über Umsatzrückgänge , für die sie Internettauschbörsen sowie selbst gebrannte CDs und DVDs verantwortlich machen .
In zwei Schritten hat Ministerin Zypries deshalb versucht , das Urheberrecht den neuen Zeiten anzupassen .
Ihr Ziel ist ein Interessenausgleich zwischen Kultur - und Industrielobby einerseits und Internet - Nutzern andererseits .
Traditionell gilt im Urheberrecht : Jeder kann für sich und seine Freunde Privatkopien eines geschützten Werkes anfertigen .
Früher wurde eine Schallplatte auf Kassette überspielt .
Heute kann man mit dem Computer von der selbst gekauften CD eine Doublette brennen und an Freunde verschenken .
Das bleibt auch weiterhin zulässig .
Im erste Teil der Reform wurde zugunsten der Plattenfirmen aber eine wichtige Einschränkung eingebaut .
Wenn die Plattenfirmen ihre CDs mit Kopierschutz versehen , dann darf dieser nicht umgangen werden .
Damit war die Industrie eindeutig Gewinner der ersten Reform , die im Herbst 2003 in Kraft trat .
Auch die zweite Runde scheint nun ganz im Sinne der Industrie abzulaufen .
Indem die Novelle Internet - Tauschbörsen komplett für illegal erklärt , schließt sie das letzte noch verbliebene Schlupfloch .
Bisher war der Download von Dateien nämlich nur verboten , wenn die Vorlage „ offensichtlich rechtswidrig hergestellt “ wurde .
Damit war nicht der häufige Fall erfasst , dass jemand ein Stück anbietet , das von einer legal gekauften CD stammt .
Hier war zwar bisher schon das Angebot illegal , nicht aber das Herunterladen .
„ Wer einen Kinofilm schon vor dem offiziellen Start aus einer Internet - Tauschbörse herunterlädt , weiß natürlich , dass es sich um ein rechtswidriges Angebot handelt und agiert daher selbst rechtswidrig “ , sagte Zypries gestern .
Das gilt allerdings auch für kommerzielle Musik - CDs .
Es gibt künftig keinen gutgläubigen Download von kostenlosen Tauschnetzwerken mehr .
Weil damit die Strafbarkeit künftig deutlich ausgeweitet ist , wollte Zypries zum Ausgleich eigentlich eine Bagatellklausel einführen .
Von der Strafverfolgung wären demnach diejenigen ausgenommen worden , die Internet - Tauschbörsen nur selten und „ zum privaten Gebrauch “ nutzen .
„ Die Schulhöfe sollten nicht kriminalisiert werden “ , sagte Zypries damals .
Sie wollte die Akzeptanz des Urheberrechts bewahren , indem der kleine Privatnutzer generell unbehelligt bleibt .
In der Bundesregierung stieß dies aber auf Widerstand .
Vor allem Kulturstaatsminister Bernd Neumann ( CDU ) fürchtete um das Rechts - und Wertebewusstsein der Jugend .
Und so strich die wenig standfeste Ministerin ihre Bagatellklausel wieder aus dem Gesetzentwurf .
Ihr Argument : Auch künftig wird die Staatsanwaltschaft die Verfahren gegen Gelegenheits - Downloader „ wegen Geringfügigkeit “ einstellen .
Allerdings kann man ein Ermittlungsverfahren nur einstellen , wenn es zuvor eröffnet wurde .
Es muss also zumindest eine Akte angelegt werden .
Das findet nicht jeder angenehm .
Außerdem könnte die Praxis der Staatsanwaltschaften je nach Bundesland ganz unterschiedlich ausfallen .
Bisher gibt es in Deutschland kaum Strafverfolgung gegen Tauschbörsen - Nutzer .
Das könnte sich aber schnell ändern , wenn ein zweiter parallel verfolgter Entwurf zum Gesetz wird .
Die Bundesregierung plant nämlich , der Musik - und Filmindustrie erstmals Auskunftsansprüche gegen Internet - Provider zu geben .
Diese müssen dann sagen , wer in größerem Stil illegale Tauschbörsen nutzt .
Die Industrie kann dann Schadenersatz von den so Entlarvten verlangen .
Sie kann aber auch Strafanzeige gegen konkrete Personen erheben , was eine verschärfte Strafverfolgung möglich macht .
Auf Urheberrechtsverletzungen stehen bis zu drei Jahre Haft oder Geldstrafe .
Dennoch spricht die Ministerin nach wie vor von einem fairen Ausgleich zwischen Industrie und Nutzern .
