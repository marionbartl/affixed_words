In GQ ’s upcoming funny , sympathetic story on Levi Johnston , we learn a lot more about the young father we ’ve come to know as Sex on Skates .
For one , he is capable of sentences and even words that consist of more than a couple of syllables , something you ’d likely not know from watching his appearances on television shows like Larry King Live and Tyra .
For another , he estimates that he has “ as much fishing , camping , and hunting experience of anybody [ his ] age in the country , if not more . ”
In fact , he estimates , he ’s “ never done anything but hunt and fish and camp . ”
Of course , that ’s not true — he also dated Bristol Palin ; fathered a child with her ; joined her mother , Sarah , onstage at the Republican National Convention ; and played a moderate - size role in a Republican melodrama that was acted out in headlines and news clips across the country .
In person , Levi is quiet , with occasional bursts of bravado and humor , according to the story , a copy of which we obtained .
He pals around mostly with an enormous black private eye named Tank , who is sort of the Johnston family body man , because a lot of his friends have been selling him out to the tabloids .
He may or may not be seeking work , but things are getting better between him and Bristol , who has taken to dropping off their son , Tripp , herself to see him .
After dueling television appearances earlier this month ( Bristol was talking about teen pregnancy for Candie ’s , Levi was basically saying the opposite of whatever she said ) , GQ writer John Jeremiah Sullivan watched them exchange flirty text messages .
That led to a warmth between them , and now they ’re in regular contact — though we imagine that relations with Todd and Sarah Palin , the former of whom on several occasions offered to buy Bristol a car if she ’d dump Levi , are still strained .
Getting back together , though , is “ not even in ” Levi ’s mind .
For now he ’s just focusing on hunting bears and , in his lawyer ’s words , taking “ the chance to tell his story . ”
What posing shirtless has to do with that , we ’re not sure .
But we ’re extremely glad they ’re related .
He Shall Be Levi [ GQ ]
I have n’t had time to write anything this week because I am up to my neck in this Seven - Samurai - style software engineering project .
You know , where a bunch of untrained villagers ( that ’s me ) need to defend themselves against marauding bandits ( that ’s the Global Burden of Disease 2005 Study ) , so they have to learn everything about being a samurai ( that ’s writing an actual application that people other than this one villager can use ) as quickly as possible .
I guess this analogy is stretching so thin that you could chop it with Toshirō Mifune ’s wooden sword .
But , if anyone knows how a mild - mannered theoretical computer scientist can get a web - app built in two weeks , holler .
If you prefer to explain in terms of wild - west gunslingers , that is fine .
Here ’s my game plan so far : I ’m going to make the lightest of light - weight Python / Django apps to hold all the Global Disease Data , and then try to get my epidemologist doctors to interact with it on the command - line via an interactive python session .
The rest of this post is basically a repeat of the Django tutorial , but specialized for building a data server for global population data .
As far as interesting theoretical math stuff , hidden somewhere towards the end , I ’ll do some interpolation with PyMC ’s Gaussian Processes using the exotic ( to me ) Matérn covariance function .
Here is everything important for making Django smart in the ways of global population data :
gbd/population_data_server
Django calls the objects that correspond to things it stores in a database “ models ” , which is a little confusing , because I also have “ statistical models ” which are entirely different .
But in models .py , you ’ll find not too much .
Only a little more than this :
class Population ( models .
Model ) : region = models .
CharField( max_length=200 ) year = models .
IntegerField ( ) sex = SexField ( ) params_json = models .
TextField( default=json.dumps ( {} ) )
This defines the contents of the population data table ; each unit of population data knows a region , a year , a sex , and some less structured params , stored as a json string .
To see how to interact with these data objects , take a peek at load_population_csv.py , which is about 100 lines long , but 20 % comments .
It is a little bit of a mess , but basically an elaboration of the following :
for x in csv_file : opts = {} opts [ ' region ' ] = smart_unicode ( x [ 0 ] .strip ( ) , errors= ' ignore ' ) opts [ ' year ' ] = int ( x [ 3 ] ) opts [ ' sex ' ] = x [ 4 ] . strip ( ) .lower ( ) pop , is_new = Population.objects.get_or_create (** opts ) pop_counter += is_new
views.py is the file where Django looks for the things everyone else calls “ controllers ” in the model - view - controller framework , which is at least as confusing as the many meaning of “ model ” in this business .
But the contents of that file are pretty simple .
They run about 150 lines , but most of them are for setting axes of matplotlib graphs and what - have - you .
Stuff that takes lots of typing and lots of time , but not lots of deep thought .
Besides setting the axis ticks , there really is nothing more than an elaboration of the following :
def population_show ( request , id , format= ' png ' ) : pop = get_object_or_404( Population , pk=id ) M , C = pop.gaussian_process ( ) x = np.arange ( 0.,100 .,1. ) p = np.maximum ( 0. , M( x ) ) if format == ' json ' : response = {'age ' : list( x ) , ' population ' : list ( p) } response = json.dumps( response ) return HttpResponse ( response , view_utils .
MIMETYPE [ format ] )
Oh , that ’s the one mathy bit , in there .
Did you catch it ?
On line 4 , above , it says M , C = pop.gaussian_process ( ) ;
I ’d like to write about it in more detail someday soon .
For now , it is all just 40 lines at the end of models .py .
And at least half of those are comments .
Finally , tests.py and fixtures .
json , are the very important business that seem like an after thought , because they are last on the list .
This is where the test - driven development happens .
tests .py says simple things like :
def test_gp ( self ) : " " " Test Gaussian Process interpolation " " " M , C = self.pop.gaussian_process ( ) self.assertEqual( M(0 ) , 1 . )
and
def test_population_show ( self ) : " " " Test plotting population curve " " " c = Client ( ) url = self.pop.get_absolute_url( ) response = c.get ( url ) self.assertPng(response )
This way I ’ll know if I change something somewhere to fix one bug and break something else .
fixtures .
json is a very annoying - to - get - right file that fills the test database with something resembling the data that the actual app with be dealing with .
It is not the true population of Australia , however .
Now it ’s back to ( metaphorically ) learning how to defend my village from bandits .
I hope to be back to ( metaphorically ) farming in two weeks .
Badger is the common name for any animal of three subfamilies , which belong to the family Mustelidae : the same mammal family as the ferrets , the weasels , the otters , and several other types of carnivore .
Just the Facts : Typical badgers are short - legged and heavy - set .
The lower jaw is articulated to the upper , by means of a transverse condyle firmly locked into a long cavity of the cranium , so that dislocation of the jaw is all but impossible .
This enables the badger to maintain its hold with the utmost tenacity .
Badgers are the largest indigenous carnivores in the UK .
Formidable :
There is a general belief that nothing of comparable size can overcome a badger .
Its ferocity , sharp teeth and strong claws make it a formidable foe .
The badger 's thick hair and loose skin make an armor too tough for other animals to penetrate .
And if worse comes to worst , the badger can run backwards as fast as forward !
Super Digger :
The badger uses its claws to dig .
It digs to hunt and to eat .
Its success is dependent upon the ability to dig faster than its prey .
It also " digs in " to escape intruders but if attacked , can easily defend itself .
Subway System :
The badger 's grass - lined nest is in a chamber two to five feet underground usually at the end of a tunnel up to 30 feet long .
Two to five young are born in the spring .
Their eyes open within five weeks , and soon they join their mother on hunting trips .
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Ratel ( Mellivora capensis ) , also known as the Honey Badger , is a member of the Mustelidae family .
They are distributed throughout most of Africa and western and south Asia .
It is the only species classified in the genus Mellivora and the subfamily Mellivorinae .
Honey Hunters : Ratels have such a great appetite for ravaging beehives that there have been cases of dead ratels being found , stung to death within the hives they were trying to eat .
Commercial honey producers do not take kindly to this destruction and sometimes shoot , trap , or poison ratels they suspect of damaging their hives .
Bird / Badger Collaboration : Some sources say that a bird , the honeyguide , has a habit of leading ratels and other large mammals to bees ' nests .
When a ratel breaks into the nest , the birds take their share too .
Other sources say that honeyguides are only known to guide humans .
The ratel is among the fiercest hunters of the desert , with prey including earthworms , termites , scorpions , porcupines , hares and even snakes .
Its ferocious reputation extends to attacks on animals much larger than itself .
Temper , Temper : Several African tribes report that the honey badger attacks the scrotum of larger mammals if provoked and has even castrated humans .
While these reports remain uncorroborated by first - hand evidence , there is some circumstantial evidence such as remains of castrated waterbuck and gnu found in Kruger National Park ( dead by blood loss ) .
The American Badger , Taxidea taxus , is a North American badger , somewhat similar in appearance to the European Badger .
It is found in the western and central United States , northern Mexico and central Canada .
This animal prefers dry open areas with deep soils that are easy to dig , such as prairie regions .
Just the Facts : American Badgers have a triangular face with a distinctive black and white pattern and a stocky body covered with shaggy grizzled fur .
They have short powerful legs with long sharp claws on the front paws and shorter claws on the back paws .
What 's for Dinner ?
These animals prey on ground squirrels and mice and other small mammals , often digging to pursue prey into their dens .
They also eat birds , snakes and insects .
Badger Basics :
They are mainly active at night , but may be active during the day .
They do not hibernate but may become less active in winter .
They are normally solitary animals for most of the year .
Males may breed with more than one female .
The Badgers and the Bees : Mating occurs in the summer , but implantation is delayed and the young are born in an underground burrow during late winter .
They have few natural predators other than humans .
The numbers of these animals has declined due to persecution by farmers and the extermination of many of their prey in agricultural areas .
Eurasian badgers are around 90 cm long ( including a 20 cm tail ) and weigh 10 kg on average , but weights can vary enormously .
In the northern area of the range ( only ) , badgers hibernate and put on fat in the autumn to help them through the winter months .
In parts of Russia , badgers may weigh as much as 32 kg in the autumn .
What 's for Dinner ?
Badgers are omnivorous ; most of their diet consists of earthworms , although they also eat insects , beetles , small mammals , lizards , frogs , eggs , young birds , berries , roots , bulbs , nuts , fruit , and other plant matter .
They also dig up the nests of wasps in order to eat the larvae .
Badgers prefer grazed pasture and woodland , which have high numbers of earthworms exposed , and dislike clay soil , which is difficult to dig even with their powerful claws .
In urban areas , some badgers scavenge food from bins and gardens .
Badger Basics : Badgers are nocturnal and spend the day in their setts , extensive networks of tunnels .
Setts enable them to survive through very hot or cold weather .
They are territorial , but can be found in groups ( called clans ) of up to 12 .
Each clan has a dominant male and female which are often ( but not always ) the only members of the clan to reproduce .
Female badgers can display delayed implantation : after mating at any time of the year , they keep the fertilized eggs in suspended development until an appropriate time , at which stage the eggs are implanted and begin developing .
Badgers have a gestation period of 7 - 8 weeks and give birth to 1 - 5 offspring .
Males are called boars and females sows ; the young are cubs .
Badgers live for up to 15 years ( average 3 years ) in the wild , and up to 19 years in captivity .
If they survive their first year , the most common cause of death is by road traffic .

Cartoons that are none of your business .
In marked contrast to the PC market , where differention primarily centers around gigabytes , GHz , and Intel Inside branding , Apple is working to keep attention on the iPhone 's software , with a curious avoidance of any mention of the make or specification of its internals , apparently for competitive reasons .
The specifications of the iPhone and iPod touch , as well as the internal details of other integrated products sold by the company such as Apple TV , are n't being kept secret to keep competitors from knowing what 's inside , as the components are quickly discovered in a simple tear down .
Instead , Apple is working to keep consumers ' attention focused on what 's unique to its iPhone and other devices , which is often the company 's unique software , rather than the commodity hardware the company commonly uses and which competitors can much more easily duplicate .
The unique software capabilities of the iPhone , including its ability to run the 50,000 titles on the App Store , is far more important from a marketing standpoint than the hardware specifications of the iPhone that any manufacturer can match or exceed with little effort .
The company faced similar issues in working to sell the original Macintosh against DOS PCs , which were marketed primarily as having a given number of megabytes and MHz rather than having the functionality or usability of the Mac 's graphical user interface .
Rather than being compared on the basis of MHz and MB of RAM , the numbers Apple would prefer to have consumers and pundits contemplate are the installed base of more than 40 million users , the tens of thousands of apps available from thousands of developers , and the number of free regular updates that Apple ships to enhance and secure the iPhone 's operating system .
Those are numbers that phones using Android , BlackBerry OS , Symbian , WebOS , and Windows Mobile are hard pressed to match .
Platform size
While RIM , Symbian and Microsoft advertise sales of more phones than Apple , none of them have a comparably large installed base of modern phones that all run the same software .
That 's why Apple could compare its iPhone app library against only 5,000 apps for Android , and even fewer software titles for phones such as Nokia 's , which sell in much greater quantity but have fractured software platforms where each phone only runs specific titles .
Similarly , Microsoft 's highly publicized 50 million Windows Mobile phones are fractured between Pocket PC devices with a full touch screen and those the company referred to as " Windows Smartphones , " which have no touch screen and only limited button control .
Writing software to take advantage of both form factors requires more work with little payoff for developers .
Apple 's cohesive iPhone platform is now being tested to see how well the company will be able to introduce significant new hardware features without similarly fracturing its platform , potentially resulting either in software titles that only run on specific models or , alternatively , a " lowest common denominator " barrier that prevents developers from really using any of the new features .
The iPhone upgrade cycle
Last year , Apple improved upon the original iPhone 's hardware by adding key missing features , including GPS and 3G mobile data service .
It also added the increased overhead of push messaging and installing and running third party applications and graphics intensive games , without addressing any of those processor intensive software functions with hardware processing improvements .
This year 's iPhone 3G S focuses on hardware performance improvements with its faster general purpose ARM and PowerVR graphics processor cores and increase in its internal RAM from 128 MB to 256MB .
Apple has oddly enough kept the internal specifications of the iPhone hidden , which is curious given the fact that they wo n't be secret for long once the device goes on sale .
It 's also a bit unusual in that specification numbers have long driven purchasing decisions in the PC market , often pointlessly .
A decade ago , consumers were so driven by marketing efforts to demand greater clock cycles regardless of actual performance that it coined the term " Megahertz Myth . "
Intel was eventually forced to back down from its marketing - oriented clock cycle engineering on the Pentium 4 and start over with a new design that delivered real performance and efficiency at lower clock speeds with the Core architecture .
Apple 's marketing has focused on the usability and utility of the iPhone , particularly its extensive library of mobile applications on the iTunes App Store .
The company is pushing developers hard to ensure that their existing apps work without a hitch on the new model and under the new iPhone 3.0 software release , giving them early access to the golden master version of iPhone 3.0 and allowing a couple days between the new software release and the first sale of new iPhone 3G S. People familiar with the gold master say the included App Store application will identify which applications have been quality tested with iPhone Software 3.0 and which have not , as can be seen in the below image .
Keeping software compatible is n't easy
Last year , the introduction of new hardware features such as GPS did not result in two classes of software , one that required a GPS model and one that could not take advantage of the new feature .
Instead , Apple paved over the differences in the platform using hardware abstraction .
In the case of GPS , the iPhone 's Location Services allowed devices with GPS to obtain more accurate positioning , while devices lacking GPS could still triangulate their position using cell phone towers and WiFi base stations with known positions .
Similar efforts have kept other hardware changes from causing serious software incompatibilities .
By making new technologies optional but accessible in the platform , Apple 's third party developers can easily incorporate the latest features in the iPhone 3G S while leveraging the large base of existing users by remaining seamlessly compatible .
That solves a major Catch - 22 that has commonly plagued computing platforms : how to introduce something really new without losing your existing users .
Apple has been learning how to do that for over thirty years .
It 's not easy .
The iPhone OS has to seamlessly manage the new phone 's faster processor speed to accelerate the animated interface while preserving proper timing for things that can't run twice as fast , such as video playback and certain animations .
While these are fairly elementary aspects of managing a software platform , rival software platforms from Nokia , Microsoft , Google , RIM , and Palm have demonstrated serious problems in delivering both developers and end users a simple , cohesive , and yet progressive platform .
Palm 's early design decisions in its Palm OS devices resulted in the platform tanking as the company shifted back and forth on strategies for moving it ahead , ranging from migrating the old interface from the 68000 chip to a new ARM processor without being able to take much advantage of the new CPU , to introducing new operating system revisions that the market and developers simply ignored , such as Palm OS Cobalt 6.0 .
During all of this the Palm OS was allowed to stagnate in terms of new features .
Microsoft experienced similar problems with Windows CE / Windows Mobile .
First , it attempted to support too many hardware configurations , from Handheld PCs to Pocket PC PDAs to several smartphones form - factors , non of which really became popular enough to support a viable software business .
The company also chose to make major architectural changes in Windows Mobile that jettisoned support for previous devices ' hardware , forcing developers to either cater to a tiny installed base of new models , or the now obsolete market of existing devices .
RIM advertised its new iPhone - like Storm as " the first touchscreen BlackBerry , " but it was only a BlackBerry in marketing .
It did n't work much like earlier models , did n't run the same software , and developers needed to write all new titles to take advantage of its features .
Most importantly , potential developers could n't benefit from the large installed base of other BlackBerry users , giving them little reason to write apps for it until enough people had bought one , while potential buyers were left to realize that there was no real potential for a wide variety of Storm apps approaching that of the iPhone's .
Managing the platform
Another aspect to keeping technical specifications out of the limelight is that Apple is careful to expose access to hardware components in a manageable , sustainable manner .
If developers are allowed to write " to the hardware , " the result is a broken platform where the vendor can't move forward without breaking the apps .
Apple experienced this problem in the clever hacks to the classic Mac OS which resulted in destabilizing the system , a problem that got progressively worse after the company sanctioned the system patches in System 7 under the name Extensions .
In Mac OS X , reference releases have been plagued by Input Manager hacks that similarly caused some serious compatibility problems .
That has led Apple down the road of a tightly managed iPhone platform where the execution of third party software requires code signatures and sandboxing , and where access to hardware has been roped off until the company could perfect abstracted public access to features in a way that can accommodate new underlying changes as future models are released .
UPDATE !!!

UPDATE !!!
The HuffingtonPost.com , one of the most visited political websites in the world , has just posted a version of my commentary online here .
Please post your feedback to the Post , and make it clear that marijuana law reform must be part of the ‘ progressive ’ agenda .
If you thought President Barack Obama ’s mocking response to the question of whether “ taxing and regulating cannabis would raise revenue and reduce prohibition - associated violence ” could n’t be any worse , just listen to White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs stumble below .
Kudos to the reporters who held the White House ’s feet to the fire on this one .
First , Gibbs is asked : “ When the President said he does n’t think that legalizing marijuana would give the economy a boost was he giving a political answer or an economic answer ?
Does he have numbers to back ( his position ) up ? ”
The pained expression on Gibbs ’ face says it all as he mumbles that , in fact , he is aware of no economic analyses — as in zip , nada — that support the President ’s dismissive position .
Naturally , we have numerous credible economic reports proving just the opposite .
Perhaps Mr. Gibbs would like to review them here , here , here , and here .
Minutes later , the White House Press Secretary appears even more desperate for a place to hide when a second reporter asked Gibbs to articulate the reasons why the President refuses to consider the issue .
Gibbs ’ response is priceless .
“ Uh , he , he does not think that , uh , uh , that that is uh , uh , [ pause ] he opposes it , he does n’t think that that ’s the , the right plan for America . ”
And there you have it .
Wow .
Such a vapid response would n’t cut it if Gibbs was a third - grader standing in front of his classroom , no less the Press Secretary to the White House !
Keep in mind , both Obama and his press secretary knew in advance that they were going to publicly respond the question of taxing and regulating cannabis .
They had at least 24 hours to prepare an articulate , rational , and substantive response .
And yet the best response they could come up with was snickers and “ uh . ”
Are the final days of marijuana prohibition upon us ?
It sure looks that way from here .
But why not write the President and ask him yourself .

If you ask Apple or AT&T how much the iPhone 3G S costs , they ’ll emphasize two prices : $ 199 for the 16GB version and $ 299 for the 32 GB one , as Apple does here .
It ’s only in the fine print and disclaimers that they ’ll explain that only new customers and those who are n’t on a contract ( or nearing the end of one , at least ) qualify for those deals .
Which means that all of us who bought AT&T iPhone 3Gs upon their release a little under a year ago do n’t qualify –we ’ll pay $ 399 for the 16GB model or $ 499 for the 32 GB one , assuming we ’re willing to extend our contracts for another two years .
Which still represents a discount off the no-commitment pricing : $ 599 for 16GB and $ 699 for 32GB .
Some folks are irate at this turn of events , arguing that the pricing punishes loyal AT&T customers .
Nope .
What it does is prevent customers who got a steep discount on an iPhone a year ago in return for signing up for a two - year contract to get an equally steep discount this year for signing up for another two - year contract .
Which strikes me as perfectly reasonable , given that this scenario involves you only being under contract to AT&T for a total of three years .
You can still get a discount on a new iPhone–just not one that ’s as steep as someone who commits to AT&T for a total of four years .
Come to think of it , the math is perfectly logical :
You get a total of $ 400 in discounts ( on one phone ) for two years of commitment , $ 600 in discounts ( on two phones ) for three years of commitment , and $ 800 in discounts ( on two phones ) for four years of commitment .
That ’s a $ 200 discount per year of contract you fulfill .
( Why does n’t AT&T let iPhone 3G owners get a $ 199 iPhone 3G S today in return for agreeing to fulfill their original two - year contract and extend it for an additional two years ?
I ’m not sure .
But I ’m wary of long - term commitments to any wireless character , and therefore would n’t endorse a scenario which involves agreeing to marry AT&T until at least 2012 in order to get a discount on a phone . )
If there ’s a problem here , it ’s the way phones are usually sold in America , via subsidies that encourage us to think that phones cost less than they really do , and which tie us up with a carrier and prevent us from moving a phone we ’ve bought to another carrier ( even temporarily , when we ’re overseas ) .
A top - of - the - line iPhone really costs $ 699 , which is not a crazy price given its capabilities ; it ’s just that very few of us ever pay that price or even realize it exists .
We ’re conditioned to think of those subsidized prices as the prices , in part because phone manufacturers and carriers stress them above all else .
So no , I ’m not that sympathetic towards iPhone 3G owners who want AT&T to sell them the iPhone 3G S at the same sweetheart price as someone who did n’t buy an iPhone 3G last year .
You agreed to fulfill a two - year contract with AT&T in return for the discount you got last year .
AT&T is willing to renegotiate it and give you a proportionate discount on a 3G in return for another year of commitment .
Explain to me again what ’s offensive about that ?

A voluntary recall of one of Best - Buy - house - brand Insignia 's HDTVs has been issued , after an irreparable design flaw causing burns and fire was discovered .
But customers are getting burned in more ways than one .
Update :
[ Note : Zing ! ]
The 26 - inch sets , of which more than 13,000 units were sold , was priced between $ 900 and $ 1,000 at Best Buy , yet the US Consumer Product Safety Commission allows Best Buy to get away with exchanging a mere $ 500 gift card for the defective product .
That means the customer is screwed out of either half or nearly half of the original price through no fault of their own , and they 'll have to pay sales tax yet again if they want to replace the TV .
Gift cards , unlike store credit , are still subject to said sales tax , which on a large purchase like this can be a significant chunk of change .
HDGuru recommends immediately replacing the set ( model number IS - LCTV26 ) , as it has already caused one injury and cannot be repaired .
Give Best Buy a call at ( 800 ) 233-0462 to return it .
We also concur that calling the US CPSC at 800-638-2772 to give 'em a piece of your mind is warranted .
At the very least , we invite all readers to load the Best Buy website and shake your fists angrily toward it .
Update : I 've neglected to add that $ 500 will be able to replace a TV of this size with today 's prices .
Most of Best Buy's 26 " HDTVs can be bought for $ 500 today .

The original Dead Rising was probably my favorite zombie game ever ( admittedly , Left 4 Dead is rapidly gaining on it … ) and one of my favorite games , period .
I put it back in the ol’ 360 again recently to try and relive the magic and realized that the game had some problems .
I ’d been able to overlook them on my first playthrough , so smitten was I by the awesome way it recreated the zombie apocalypse , but they stopped me from spending any serious time on the second go - round .
If those problems were to be resolved , say in some sort of sequel , like the one I wrote about yesterday ( no link , just hit the previous post button there at the top ) … well , then we ’d have something special .
Â
The developers have gone on record saying that the goal of getting 6,000 zombies onscreen at once is the number one priority .
Sorry , but that is horse shit .
A lack of zombies onscreen at once was not one of the first game ’s flaws .
Here ’s what you do need to fix / tweak / add / focus on to make Dead Rising 2 the single best zombie game ever .
I ’m going to waive my regular consultancy fee , developers , just get this right .
Better controls – I convinced myself the controls were fine , considering the game was really an RPG masquerading as an action game , but let ’s face it ; they are clunky as hell , like almost as bad as old - school Resident Evil clunky .
Play a few third - person games like Grand Theft Auto IV and try to give us controls at least as smooth and intuitive .
Oh , and allowing us to configure the control scheme would be great too .
A sane save system – I get that the developers were trying to enforce a certain style of play with the jacked - up save system of the first game .
I really get that .
Hell , I even overlooked it and argued it was justified at one point ( my enthusiasm was mighty ) .
Fine , you tried to achieve something , but it failed .
Really it just irritated players and made a second playthrough seem more like a chore than fun .
At very least , try something new … better yet , just give it a save - anywhere system and throw in an achievement for playing through the “ proper ” way .
Additional modes –
When I got the real game after playing the hell out of the demo I was slightly disappointed .
The focus shifted from wholesale zombie slaughter to more concrete , RPG - type goals .
I got over it , but there ’s something to be said for the simple pleasure of running around and chopping off heads .
Why does n’t a game that makes that so much fun reward you for it ?
The addition of a simple arcade mode ( kill as many zombies as possible in a given time frame ) with leaderboards would have meant me popping the game in daily for the past year or more to try for a higher score .
And it ca n’t be hard to add something like that .
If you can figure out some sort of strategic mode where I can gather supplies and test my zombie apocalypse plans , that would be great too .
The existing survival modes are cool , but the focus on long - term survival and lack of save within them limits their playability .
It ’s rare I can sit in front of the TV for four or five hours at a stretch …
Or hell , surprise me with a mode I have n’t even dreamed of yet .
Jettison the punishingly difficult and conceptually questionable boss fights –
The boss fights in the original were just ridiculous , especially the final confrontation with the nigh - indestructible brawler .
I know , video games have boss battles , right ?
But do they have to ?
And if they do , do they have to be so difficult that completing them brings not a sense of accomplishment but simply sweet relief that the ordeal is over at last ?
Jettison the boss battles in favor of something innovative , or at the very least give us believable boss fights that do n’t make us destroy controllers .
Multiplayer – A co-op mode would have extended the life of this game almost infinitely .
This is critical .
This should be your top priority , not that 6,000 zombies shit .
Swarms of snakes are attacking people and cattle in southern Iraq as the Euphrates and Tigris rivers dry up and the reptiles lose their natural habitat among the reed beds .
" People are terrified and are leaving their homes , " says Jabar Mustafa , a medical administrator , who works in a hospital in the southern province of Dhi Qar .
" We knew these snakes before , but now they are coming in huge numbers .
They are attacking buffalo and cattle as well as people . "
Doctors in the area say six people have been killed and 13 poisoned .
In Chabaysh , a town on the Euphrates close to the southern marshland of Hawr al - Hammar , farmers have set up an overnight operations room to prevent the snakes attacking their cattle .

Farmers have come to us for vaccines , but we do n't have any . "
The plague of snakes is the latest result of an unprecedented fall in the level of the water in the Euphrates and the Tigris , the two great rivers which for thousands of years have made life possible in the sun- baked plains of Mesopotamia , the very name of which means " between the rivers " in Greek .
The rivers that made Iraq 's dry soil so fertile are drying up because the supply of water , which once flowed south into Iraq from Turkey , Syria and Iran , is now held back by dams and used for irrigation .
On the Euphrates alone , Turkey has five large dams upriver from Iraq , and Syria has two .
The diversion of water from the rivers has already destroyed a large swathe of Iraqi agriculture and the result of Iraq being starved of water may be one of the world 's greatest natural disasters , akin to the destruction of the Amazonian rainforest .
Already the advance of the desert has led to frequent dust storms in Baghdad which close the airport .
Yet this dramatic climatic change has attracted little attention outside Iraq , overshadowed by the violence following the US - led invasion in 2003 and the overthrow of Saddam Hussein .
The collapse in the water levels of the rivers has been swift , the amount of water in the Euphrates falling by three - quarters in less than a decade .
In 2000 , the flow speed of the water in the river was 950 cubic metres per second , but by this year it had dropped to 230 cubic metres per second .
In the past , Iraq has stored water in lakes behind its own dams , but these reservoirs are now much depleted and can no longer make up the shortfall .
The total water reserves behind all Iraqi dams at the beginning of May was only 11 billion cubic metres , compared to over 40 billion three years ago .
One of the biggest dams in the country , on the Euphrates at Haditha in western Iraq , close to the Syrian border , held eight billion cubic metres two years ago but now has only two billion .
Iraq has appealed to Turkey to open the sluice gates on its dams .
" We need at least 500 cubic metres of water per second from Turkey , or double what we are getting , " says Abdul Latif Rashid , the Iraqi Minister of Water Resources .
" They promised an extra 130 cubic metres , but this was only for a couple of days and we need it for months . "
His ministry is doing everything it can , he says , but the most important decisions about the supply of water to Iraq are taken outside the country – in Turkey , Syria and Iran .
" In addition there has been a drought for the last four years with less than half the normal rainfall falling , " says Mr Rashid .
Large parts of Iraq that were once productive farmland have already turned into arid desert .
The Iraqi Ministry of Agriculture says that between 40 and 50 per cent of what was agricultural land in the 1970s is now being hit by desertification .
Drought , war , UN sanctions , lack of investment and the cutting down of trees for firewood have all exacerbated the crisis , but at its heart is the lack of water for irrigation in the Tigris and Euphrates .
Farmers across Iraq are being driven from the land .
Earlier this month , farmers and fishermen demonstrated in Najaf , a city close to the Euphrates , holding up placards demanding that the Iraqi government insist that foreign countries release more water .
" The farmers have stopped planting and now head to the city for work to earn their daily living until the water comes back , " said Ali al - Ghazali , a farmer from the area .
" We pay for our seeds at the time of the harvest , and if we fail to harvest , or the harvest has been ruined , the person who sold us the seeds still wants his money . "
Najaf province has banned its farmers from growing rice because the crop needs too much water .
The drop in the quantity of water in the rivers has also reduced its quality .
The plains of ancient Mesopotamia once produced abundant crops for the ancient Sumerians .
From Nineveh in the north to Ur of the Chaldees in the south , the flat landscape of Iraq is dotted with the mounds marking the remains of their cities .
There is little rainfall away from the mountains of Kurdistan and the land immediately below them , so agriculture has always depended on irrigation .
But centuries of irrigating the land without draining it properly has led to a build - up of salt in the soil , making much of it infertile .
Lack of water in the rivers has speeded up the salinisation , so land in central and southern Iraq , highly productive 30 years ago , has become barren .
Even such rainfall as does fall in northern Iraq has been scant in recent years .
In February , the Greater Zaab river , one of the main tributaries of the Tigris , which should have been a torrent , was a placid stream occupying less than a quarter of its river bed .
The hills overlooking it , which should be green , were a dusty brown .
Experts summoned by the Water Resources Ministry to a three - day conference on the water crisis held in Sulaimaniyah in April described the situation as " a tragedy " .
Mohammed Ali Sarham , a water specialist from Diwaniyah in southern Iraq , said : " Things are slipping from our hands : swathes of land are being turned into desert .
Farmers are leaving the countryside and heading to the city or nearby areas .
We are importing almost all our food , though in the 1950s we were one of the few regional cereal - exporting countries . "
The experts recommended that , in addition to Turkey releasing more water , there should be heavy investment to make better use of the waterways such as the Tigris and Euphrates .
But this year Mr Rashid says that his budget for this year has been cut in half to $ 500 m ( £ 300 m ) because of the fall in the price of oil .
The outcome of the agricultural disaster in Iraq is evident in the fruit and vegetable shops in Baghdad .
Jassim Mohammed Bahadeel , a grocer in the Karada district , says that once much of what he sold came from farms around the Iraqi capital .
" But today , the apples I sell come from America , France and Chile ; tomatoes and potatoes from Syria and Jordan ; oranges from Egypt and Turkey .
Only the dates come from Iraq because they do not need a lot of water . "
Rightly feared : Iraq 's deadly reptiles
* Saw - Scaled Viper ( Echis carinatus ) About 2ft long , this viper is blamed for more deaths than any other species in the world .
Its bite causes extensive internal haemorrhaging in its victims .
Recognisable by an arrow - shaped marking on the head .
* Desert Horned Viper ( Cerastes cerastes )
The Desert Horned Viper is typically found in sandy terrain and is a common sight in Iraq 's southern deserts , identified by the bony horns over its eyes .
It lurks in sand , only eyes , nostrils and horns above the surface .
* Desert Cobra ( Walterinnesia aegyptia )
Like most cobras , it is easily adaptable to various habitats .
But locations occupied by humans are a particular favourite where shelter and rodents are on offer .
Whilst this glossy snake does not actively seek confrontation , it can move with lethal speed when provoked .

Intended to be a bit less intense than BSG 's post - apocalyptic doom and gloom , Virtuality is about 12 astronauts on Man 's first starship , the Phaeton .
They 're on a 10 - year journey ( feeling confident , are n't we Mr. Moore ? ) and will kill the time by plugging in to their own customized virtual reality worlds — a sort of holodeck meets the Matrix .
That killing of time seems to be the focus of the show .
Our sister site io9 has been covering Virtuality quite a bit over the last year from inception to production , so they 're a good resource if you 'd like to read more about the pilot and potential new program . [ io9 ]

BAGHDAD — Barack Obama ’s speech in Cairo last Thursday was “ soft spoken and eloquent , ” said Moqtada al - Sadr , the radical Iraqi cleric , grudgingly , since he also said he despised it .
It was a speech that meant different things to different people , a quality that has been much noted in this president .
He supported Israel , but reached out to the Muslim world in an unprecedented way .
Some friends were troubled , others reassured .
Some of America ’s enemies denounced it , but none dismissed it .
Not even the arch - enemies at whom , in some important way , the speech was directed .
Just the day before , in fact , a pre-emptive audio tape attributed to Osama bin Laden warned his followers not to trust whatever Mr. Obama would say .
And as it turned out , his fear was justified .
In the view of Fawaz Gerges , the president ’s speech was above all else about the war on terror , a direct attack on Mr. bin Laden and the mindset he promulgates .
“ Barack Obama is not just trying to reach out to Muslims for the sake of it , ” says Mr. Gerges , a professor of Middle Eastern studies at Sarah Lawrence College and an authority on modern jihad .
“ He ’s trying to hammer a deadly nail in Osama bin Laden ’s message . ”
What President Obama understood more than his predecessors , Mr. Gerges says , is that it is not a war that can be won militarily , but only ideologically .
Jarret Brachman , a former West Point terrorism expert and author of a recent book , “ Global Jihadism , ” said the speech “ was the most important strategic step we ’ve taken in this war . ”

House members have voted not to investigate claims by Speaker Nancy Pelosi , D - Calif. , that the CIA misled her in 2002 about its use of waterboarding against terror suspects .
Here , Pelosi is seen on Thursday on Capitol Hill in Washington .
WASHINGTON ( AP )  Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday defeated a Republican push to investigate House leader Nancy Pelosi 's claims that the CIA misled her in 2002 about whether waterboarding had been used against terrorism suspects .
The House voted 252- 172 to block the measure , which would have created a bipartisan congressional panel .
" This is partisan politics and an attempt by the Republicans to distract from the real issue of creating jobs and making progress on health care , energy and education , " said Pelosi spokesman Nadeam Elshami .
WATERBOARDING DISPUTE : Pelosi draws CIA response Pelosi told reporters this month that she had not been told that waterboarding had been used against terrorism suspects , even though it had been .
President Obama and human rights groups have said waterboarding , which simulates drowning , is torture .
" To have this charge out there and not have it resolved I think is damaging to our intelligence efforts , and certainly will have a chilling effect on our intelligence professionals around the world , " said House Republican Leader John Boehner .
Former Vice President Dick Cheney waded into the debate .
In a speech at the conservative American Enterprise Institute , he said Pelosi and other lawmakers had been briefed on the interrogation techniques on " numerous occasions . "
" In my long experience in Washington , few matters have inspired so much contrived indignation and phony moralizing as the interrogation methods applied to a few captured terrorists , " Cheney said .
Pelosi has asked the Central Intelligence Agency to declassify information supporting her claims .
The CIA has sent lawmakers its notes and memos on 40 congressional briefings on the interrogation techniques .
But that document has been found to include several errors .
CIA Director Leon Panetta acknowledged in a May 6 letter to House Intelligence Committee Chairman Silvestre Reyes , a Democrat , that the CIA 's list may not be completely accurate .
" In the end , you and the committee will have to determine whether this information is an accurate summary of what actually happened , " Panetta wrote .
Democrats also are pointing out that Republicans too have accused the CIA of misleading them on intelligence matters .
Boehner himself called into question the soundness of the intelligence community when it determined in 2007 that Tehran had halted its nuclear weapons program .
Boehner told reporters on Thursday that it was an unfair comparison because he never accused the men and women of the intelligence community of misleading Congress .

Links readers are encouraged to purchase a copy of this important new book HERE .
The roots of the present ecological crisis , John Bellamy Foster argues in The Ecological Revolution , lie in capital ’s rapacious expansion , which has now achieved unprecedented heights of irrationality across the globe .
Foster compellingly demonstrates that the only possible answer for humanity is an ecological revolution : a struggle to make peace with the planet .
* * *
“ In this time of growing ecological and economic crisis , John Bellamy Foster ’s voice stands out like no other .
In his new book , The Ecological Revolution , he demonstrates that questions of ecology cannot be separated from questions of economics , and that building a truly sustainable future means putting people and the planet before profit . ”
— Howard Zinn .
author of A People ’s History of the United States
“ Foster is the most systematic thinker on red - green politics writing today — and he is quite clear about What is to be done !
In these essays , he applies Marx ’s theory of metabolic rift to elucidate a variety of contexts — the Pentagon ’s pursuit of oil , neoliberalism and the Jo’burg Manifesto , the poverty of contemporary sociology , imperialism and ecological debt , critique of the New Sustainability Paradigm — all the while keeping his synthesis of historical scholarship , natural scientific detail , and Marxist theory readily accessible to a wide readership .
Here is reason and discipline driven by passion and care . ”

Envisioning ecological revolution
By John Bellamy Foster
The goal of ecological revolution , as I shall present it here , has as its initial premise that we are in the midst of a global environmental crisis of such enormity that the web of life of the entire planet is threatened and with it the future of civilization .
This is no longer a very controversial proposition .
To be sure , there are different perceptions about the extent of the challenge that this raises .
At one extreme , there are those who believe that since these are human problems arising from human causes they are easily solvable .
All we need is ingenuity and the will to act .
At the other extreme , there are those who believe that the world ecology is deteriorating on a scale and with a rapidity beyond our means to control , giving rise to the gloomiest forebodings .
Although often seen as polar opposites , these views nonetheless share a common basis .
As Paul Sweezy observed , they each reflect “ the belief that if present trends continue to operate , it is only a matter of time until the human species irredeemably fouls its own nest . ” [ 1 ]
Warning bells
The more we learn about current environmental trends , the more the unsustainability of our present course is brought home to us .
Among the warning signs :
• There is now a virtual certainty that the critical threshold of a 2 °C ( 3.6° F ) increase in average world temperature above the pre-industrial level will soon be crossed due to the buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere .
Scientists believe that climate change at this level will have portentous implications for the world ’s ecosystems .
The question is no longer whether significant climate change will occur but how great it will be . [ 2 ]
• There are growing worries in the scientific community that the estimates of the rate of global warming provided by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) , which in its worst case scenario projected increases in average global temperature of up to 5.8° C ( 10.4° F ) by 2100 , may prove to be too low .
For example , results from the world ’s largest climate modeling experiment , based in Oxford University in Britain , indicate that global warming could increase almost twice as fast as the IPCC has estimated . [ 3 ]
• Experiments at the International Rice Institute and elsewhere have led scientists to conclude that with each 1 °C ( 1.8 °F ) increase in temperature , rice , wheat and corn yields could drop 10 per cent .
• It is now increasingly believed that the world is approaching peak crude oil production .
The world economy is , therefore , confronting more constrained oil supplies , despite a rapidly increasing demand .
All of this points to a growing world energy crisis and mounting resource wars . [ 4 ]
• The planet is facing global water shortages due to the drawing down of irreplaceable aquifers , which make up the bulk of the world ’s fresh water supplies .
This poses a threat to global agriculture , which has become a bubble economy based on the unsustainable exploitation of groundwater .
One in four people in the world today do not have access to safe water . [ 5 ]
• Two - thirds of the world ’s major fish stocks are currently being fished at or above their capacity .
Over the last half - century 90 per cent of large predatory fish in the world ’s oceans have been eliminated . [ 6 ]
• The species extinction rate is the highest in sixty - five million years with the prospect of cascading extinctions , as the last remnants of intact ecosystems are removed .
Already the extinction rate is in some cases ( as in the case of bird species ) one hundred times the “ benchmark ” or “ natural ” rate .
Scientists have pinpointed twenty - five hot spots on land that account for 44 per cent of all vascular plant species and 35 per cent of all species in four vertebrate groups , while taking up only 1.4 per cent of the world ’s land surface .
All of these hot spots are now threatened with rapid annihilation due to human causes .
According to Stephen Pimm and Clinton Jenkins , writing in Scientific American : “ Substantial tracts of intact wilderness remain : humid tropical forests such as the Amazon and Congo , drier woodlands of Africa , and coniferous forests of Canada and Russia .
If deforestation in these wilderness forests continues at current rates , the combined extinction rate in them and in the hot [ spots around the world ] will soon be 1000 times higher than the benchmark one in a million . ” [ 7 ]
• According to a study published by the National Academy of Sciences in 2002 , the world economy exceeded the earth ’s regenerative capacity in 1980 and by 1999 had gone beyond it by as much as 20 per cent .
This means , according to the study ’s authors , that “ it would require 1.2 earths , or one earth for 1.2 years , to regenerate what humanity used in 1999 . ” [ 8 ]
• The question of the ecological collapse of past civilizations from Easter Island to the Mayans is now increasingly seen as extending to today ’s world capitalist system .
This view , long held by environmentalists , has been popularized by Jared Diamond in his book Collapse . [ 9 ]
These and other warning bells indicate that the present human relation to the environment is no longer supportable .
The most developed capitalist countries have the largest per capita ecological footprints , demonstrating that the entire course of world capitalist development at present represents a dead end .
The main response of the ruling capitalist class , when confronted with the growing environmental challenge , is to fiddle while Rome burns .
To the extent that it has a strategy , it is to rely on revolutionizing the forces of production , i.e. , on technical change , while keeping the existing system of social relations intact .
It was Karl Marx who first pointed in The Communist Manifesto to “ the constant revolutionizing of production ” as a distinguishing feature of capitalist society .
Today ’s vested interests are counting on this built - in process of revolutionary technological change coupled with the proverbial magic of the market to solve the environmental problem when and where this becomes necessary .
In stark contrast , many environmentalists now believe that technological revolution alone will be insufficient to solve the problem and that a more far - reaching social revolution aimed at transforming the present mode of production is required .
Great Transition scenarios
Historically , addressing this question of the ecological transformation of society means that we need to ascertain : ( 1 ) where the world capitalist system is heading at present ; ( 2 ) the extent to which it can alter its course by technological or other means in response to today ’s converging ecological and social crises ; and ( 3 ) the historical alternatives to the existing system .
The most ambitious attempt thus far to carry out such a broad assessment has come from the Global Scenario Group , a project launched in 1995 by the Stockholm Environmental Institute to examine the transition to global sustainability .
The Global Scenario Group has issued three reports — Branch Points ( 1997 ) , Bending the Curve ( 1998 ) , and their culminating study , Great Transition ( 2002 ) .
In what follows , I will focus on the last of these reports , the Great Transition . [ 10 ]
As its name suggests , the Global Scenario Group employs alternative scenarios to explore possible paths that society caught in a crisis of ecological sustainability might take .
Their culminating report presents three classes of scenarios : Conventional Worlds , Barbarization , and Great Transitions .
Each of these contains two variants .
Conventional Worlds consists of Market Forces and Policy Reform .
Barbarization manifests itself in the forms of Breakdown and Fortress World .
Great Transitions is broken down into Eco-communalism and the New Sustainability Paradigm .
Each scenario is associated with different thinkers : Market Forces with Adam Smith ; Policy Reform with John Maynard Keynes and the authors of the 1987 Brundtland Commission report ; Breakdown with Thomas Malthus ; Fortress World with Thomas Hobbes ; Eco-communalism with William Morris , Mahatma Gandhi , and E. F. Schumacher ; and the New Sustainability Paradigm with John Stuart Mill . [ 11 ]
Within the Conventional Worlds scenarios , Market Forces stands for naked capitalism or neoliberalism .
It represents , in the words of the Great Transition report , “ the firestorm of capitalist expansion . ” [ 12 ]
Market Forces is an unfettered capitalist world order geared to the accumulation of capital and rapid economic growth without regard to social or ecological costs .
The principal problem raised by this scenario is its rapacious relation to humanity and the earth .
The drive to amass capital that is central to a Market Forces regime is best captured by Marx ’s general formula of capital ( though not referred to in the Great Transition report itself ) .
In a society of simple commodity production ( an abstract conception referring to pre-capitalist economic formations in which money and the market play a subsidiary role ) , the circuit of commodities and money exists in a form , C–M–C , in which distinct commodities or use - values constitute the end points of the economic process .
A commodity ( C ) embodying a definite use - value is sold for money ( M ) which is used to purchase a different commodity ( C ) .
Each such circuit is completed with the consumption of a use - value .
In the case of capitalism , or generalized commodity production , however , the circuit of money and commodities begins and ends with money , or M–C–M .
Moreover , since money is merely a quantitative relationship such an exchange would have no meaning if the same amount of money was acquired at the end of the process as exchanged in the beginning , so the general formula for capital , in reality , takes the form of M–C–M ’ , where M’ equals M + ∆m or surplus - value .
What stands out , when contrasted with simple commodity production , is that there is no real end to the process , since the object is not final use but the accumulation of surplus - value or capital .
M–C–M ’ in one year , therefore , results in the ∆m being reinvested , leading to M–C– M ’’ in the next year and M–C– M ’ ’’ the year after that , ad infinitum .
In other words , capital by its nature is self - expanding value . [ 13 ]
The motor force behind this drive to accumulation is competition .
The competitive struggle ensures that each capital or firm must grow and , hence , must reinvest its “ earnings ” in order to survive .
Such a system tends toward exponential growth punctuated by crises or temporary interruptions in the accumulation process .
The pressures placed on the natural environment are immense and will lessen only with the weakening and cessation of capitalism itself .
During the last half - century the world economy has grown more than seven - fold while the biosphere ’s capacity to support such expansion has , if anything , diminished due to human ecological depredations . [ 14 ]
The main assumption of those who advocate a Market Forces solution to the environmental problem is that it will lead to increasing efficiency in the consumption of environmental inputs by means of technological revolution and continual market adjustments .
Use of energy , water , and other natural resources will decrease per unit of economic output .
This is often referred to as “ dematerialization . ”
However , the central implication of this argument is false .
Dematerialization , to the extent that it can be said to exist , has been shown to be a much weaker tendency than M–C–M ’ .
As the Global Transition report puts it , “ The ‘ growth effect ’ outpaces the ‘ efficiency effect . ’ ” [ 15 ]
This can be understood concretely in terms of what has been called the Jevons Paradox , named after William Stanley Jevons , who published The Coal Question in 1865 .
Jevons , one of the founders of neoclassical economics , explained that improvements in steam engines that decreased the use of coal per unit of output also served to increase the scale of production as more and bigger factories were built .
Hence , increased efficiency in the use of coal had the paradoxical effect of expanding aggregate coal consumption . [ 16 ]
The perils of the Market Forces model are clearly visible in the environmental depredations during the two centuries since the advent of industrial capitalism , and especially in the last half - century .
“ Rather than abating ” under a Market Forces regime , the Great Transition report declares , “ the unsustainable process of environmental degradation that we observe in today ’s world would [ continue to ] intensify .
The danger of crossing critical thresholds in global systems would increase , triggering events that would radically transform the planet ’s climate and ecosystems . ”
Although it is “ the tacit ideology ” of most international institutions , Market Forces leads inexorably to ecological and social disaster and even collapse .
The continuation of “ ‘ business - as - usual ’ is a utopian fantasy . ” [ 17 ]
A far more rational basis for hope , the report contends , is found in the Policy Reform scenario .
“ The essence of the scenario is the emergence of the political will for gradually bending the curve of development toward a comprehensive set of sustainability targets , ” including peace , human rights , economic development , and environmental quality .
18 This is essentially the Global Keynesian strategy advocated by the Brundtland Commission Report in the late 1980s — an expansion of the welfare state , now conceived as an environmental welfare state , to the entire world .
It represents the promise of what environmental sociologists call “ ecological modernization . ”
The Policy Reform approach is prefigured in various international agreements such as the Kyoto Protocol on global warming and the environmental reform measures advanced by the Earth Summits in Rio in 1992 and Johannesburg in 2002 .
Policy Reform would seek to decrease world inequality and poverty through foreign aid programs emanating from the rich countries and international institutions .
It would promote environmental best practices through state - induced market incentives .
Yet , despite the potential for limited ecological modernization , the realities of capitalism , the Great Transition report contends , would collide with Policy Reform .
This is because Policy Reform remains a Conventional Worlds scenario — one in which the underlying values , lifestyles , and structures of the capitalist system endure .
“ The logic of sustainability and the logic of the global market are in tension .
The correlation between the accumulation of wealth and the concentration of power erodes the political basis for a transition . ”
Under these circumstances the “ lure of the God of Mammon and the Almighty dollar ” will prevail . [ 19 ]
The failure of both of the Conventional Worlds scenarios to alleviate the problem of ecological decline means that Barbarization threatens : either Breakdown or the Fortress World .
Breakdown is self - explanatory and to be avoided at all costs .
The Fortress World emerges when “ powerful regional and international actors comprehend the perilous forces leading to Breakdown ” and are able to guard their own interests sufficiently to create “ protected enclaves . ” [ 20 ]
Fortress
World is a planetary apartheid system , gated and maintained by force , in which the gap between global rich and global poor constantly widens and the differential access to environmental resources and amenities increases sharply .
It consists of “ bubbles of privilege amidst oceans of misery ....
The elite[s ] have halted barbarism at their gates and enforced a kind of environmental management and uneasy stability . ” [ 21 ]
The general state of the planetary environment , however , would continue to deteriorate in this scenario leading either to a complete ecological Breakdown or to the achievement through revolutionary struggle of a more egalitarian society , such as Eco-communalism .
This description of the Fortress World is remarkably similar to the scenario released in the 2003 Pentagon report , Abrupt Climate Change and Its Implications for United States National Security . [ 22 ]
The Pentagon report envisioned a possible shutdown due to global warming of the thermohaline circulation warming the North Atlantic , throwing Europe and North America into Siberia - like conditions .
Under such unlikely but plausible circumstances , relatively well - off populations , including those in the United States , are pictured as building “ defensive fortresses ” around themselves to keep masses of would - be immigrants out .
Military confrontations over scarce resources intensify .
Arguably naked capitalism and resource wars are already propelling the world in this direction at present , though without a cause as immediately earth - shaking as abrupt climate change .
With the advent of the “ War on Terror , ” unleashed by the United States against one country after another since September 11 , 2001 , an “ Empire of Barbarism ” is making its presence felt . [ 23 ]
Still , from the standpoint of the Global Scenario Group , the Barbarization scenarios are there simply to warn us of the worst possible dangers of ecological and social decline .
A Great Transition , it is argued , is necessary if Barbarization is to be avoided .
Theoretically , there are two Great Transitions scenarios envisioned by the Global Scenario Group : Eco-communalism and the New Sustainability Paradigm .
Yet Eco-communalism is never discussed in any detail , on the grounds that for this kind of transformation to come about it would be necessary for world society first to pass through Barbarization .
The Global Scenario Group authors see the social revolution of Eco-communalism as lying on the other side of Jack London ’s Iron Heel .
The discussion of Great Transition is thus confined to the New Sustainability Paradigm .
The essence of the New Sustainability Paradigm is that of a radical ecological transformation that goes against unbridled “ capitalist hegemony ” but stops short of full social revolution .
It is to be carried out primarily through changes in values and lifestyles rather than the transformation of social structures .
Advances in environmental technology and policy that began with the Policy Reform scenario , but that were unable to propel sufficient environmental change due to the dominance of acquisitive norms , are here supplemented by a “ lifestyle wedge . ” [ 24 ]
In the explicitly utopian scenario of the New Sustainability Paradigm , the United Nations is transformed into the “ World Union , ” a true global federation .
Globalization has become “ civilized . ”
The world market is fully integrated and harnessed for equality and sustainability not just wealth generation .
The War on Terrorism has resulted in the defeat of the terrorists .
Civil society , represented by non-governmental organizations ( NGOs ) , plays a leading role in society at both the national and global levels .
Voting is electronic .
Poverty is eradicated .
Typical inequality has decreased drastically .
Dematerialization is real , as is the “ polluter pays ” principle .
Advertising is nowhere to be seen .
There has been a transition to a solar economy .
The long commute from where people live to where they work is a thing of the past ; instead , there are “ integrated settlements ” that place home , work , retail shops , and leisure outlets in close proximity to each other .
The giant corporations have become forward - looking societal organizations , rather than simply private entities .
They are no longer concerned exclusively with the economic bottom line , but have revised this to incorporate environmental sustainability and social ecology as ends irrespective of profit .
Four agents of change are said to have combined to bring all of this about : ( 1 ) giant transnational corporations ; ( 2 ) intergovernmental organizations such as the United Nations , World Bank , International Monetary Fund , and World Trade Organization ; ( 3 ) civil society acting through NGOs ; and ( 4 ) a globally aware , environmentally - conscious , democratically organized world population . [ 25 ]
Underpinning this economically is the notion of a stationary state , as depicted by Mill in his 1848 work , Principles of Political Economy , and advanced today by the ecological economist Herman Daly and Whiteheadian process philosopher John Cobb .
Most classical economists — including Adam Smith , David Ricardo , Thomas Malthus , and Karl Marx — saw the specter of a stationary state as presaging the demise of the bourgeois political economy .
In contrast , Mill , who Marx ( in the afterword to the second German edition of Capital ) accused of a “ shallow syncretism , ” saw the stationary state as somehow compatible with existing productive relations , requiring only changes in distribution . [ 26 ]
In the New Sustainability Paradigm scenario , which takes Mill ’s view of the stationary state as its inspiration , the basic institutions of capitalism remain intact , as do the fundamental relations of power , but a shift in lifestyle and consumer orientation mean that the economy is no longer geared to economic growth and the enlargement of profits , but to efficiency , equity , and qualitative improvements in life .
A capitalist society formerly driven to expanded reproduction through investment of surplus product ( or surplus - value ) has been replaced with a system of simple reproduction ( Mill ’s stationary state ) , in which the surplus is consumed rather than invested .
The vision is one of a cultural revolution supplementing technological revolution , and radically changing the ecological and social landscape of capitalist society , without fundamentally altering the productive , property , and power relations that define the system .
In my view , there are both logical and historical problems with this projection .
It combines the weakest elements of utopian thinking ( weaving a future out of mere hopes and wishes ) with a “ practical ” desire to avoid a sharp break with the existing system . [ 27 ]
The failure of the Global Scenario Group to address its own scenario of Eco-communalism is part and parcel of this perspective , which seeks to elude the question of the more thoroughgoing social transformation that a genuine Great Transition would require .
The result is a vision of the future that is contradictory to an extreme .
Private corporations are institutions with one and only one purpose : the pursuit of profit .
The idea of turning them to entirely different and opposing social ends is reminiscent of the long - abandoned notions of the “ soulful corporation ” that emerged for a short time in the 1950s and then vanished in the harsh light of reality .
Many changes associated with the New Sustainability Paradigm would require a class revolution to bring about .
Yet this is excluded from the scenario itself .
Instead , the Global Scenario Group authors engage in a kind of magical thinking — denying that fundamental changes in the relations of production must accompany ( and sometimes even precede ) changes in values .
No less than in the case of the Policy Reform Scenario — as pointed out in The Great Transition report itself — the “ God of Mammon ” will inevitably overwhelm a value - based Great Transition that seeks to escape the challenge of the revolutionary transformation of the whole society .
An ecological - social revolution
Put simply , my argument is that a global ecological revolution worthy of the name can only occur as part of a larger social — and I would insist , socialist — revolution .
Such a revolution , were it to generate the conditions of equality , sustainability , and human freedom worthy of a genuine Great Transition , would necessarily draw its major impetus from the struggles of working populations and communities at the bottom of the global capitalist hierarchy .
It would demand , as Marx insisted , that the associated producers rationally regulate the human metabolic relation with nature .
It would see wealth and human development in radically different terms than capitalist society .
In conceiving such a social and ecological revolution , we can derive inspiration , as Marx did , from the ancient Epicurean concept of “ natural wealth . ”
As Epicurus observed in his Principal Doctrines : “ Natural wealth is both limited and easily obtainable ; the riches of idle fancies go on forever . ”
It is the unnatural , unlimited character of such alienated wealth that is the problem .
Similarly , in what has become known as the Vatican Sayings , Epicurus stated : “ Poverty , when measured by the natural purpose of life , is great wealth ; but unlimited wealth is great poverty . ” [ 28 ]
Free human development , arising in a climate of natural limitation and sustainability , is the true basis of wealth , of a rich , many - sided existence ; the unbounded pursuit of wealth is the primary source of human impoverishment and suffering .
Needless to say , such a concern with natural well - being , as opposed to artificial needs and stimulants , is the antithesis of capitalist society and the precondition of a sustainable human community .
A Great Transition , therefore , must have the characteristics implied by the Global Scenario Group ’s neglected scenario : Eco-communalism .
It must take its inspiration from William Morris , one of the most original and ecological followers of Karl Marx , from Gandhi , and from other radical , revolutionary and materialist figures , including Marx himself , stretching as far back as Epicurus .
The goal must be the creation of sustainable communities geared to the development of human needs and powers , removed from the all - consuming drive to accumulate wealth ( capital ) .
As Marx wrote , the new system “ starts with the self - government of the communities . ” [ 29 ]
The creation of an ecological civilization requires a social revolution , one that , as Roy Morrison explains , needs to be organized democratically from below : “ community by community ... region by region . ”
It must put the provision of basic human needs — clean air , unpolluted water , safe food , adequate sanitation , social transport , and universal health care and education , all of which require a sustainable relation to the earth — ahead of all other needs and wants .
“ An ecological dialectic ” along these lines , Morrison insists , “ rejects not struggle but the endless slaughter of industrial negation ” in the interest of unlimited profits . [ 30 ]
Such a revolutionary turn in human affairs may seem improbable .
But the continuation of the present capitalist system for any length of time will prove impossible — if human civilization and the web of life as we know it are to be sustained .

Much of Marx ’s analysis in Capital is concerned with where ∆m or surplus value comes from .
To answer this question , he argues , it is necessary to go beneath the process of exchange and to explore the hidden recesses of capitalist production — where it is revealed that the source of surplus - value is to be found in the process of class exploitation .

by publius
If the country ever gets around to ending life tenure for Supreme Court Justices , I hope we add a provision ending it for Washington Post columnists too .
Or at least ending it for Robert Samuelson .
Today , again , we see another extremely misleading op - ed from him on the fiscal health of Social Security .
Here ’s a good rule of thumb – anytime you see an op - ed whining about entitlements that uses the phrase “ Medicare and Social Security , ” it ’s safe to stop reading .
Samuelson ’s is no exception .
This is n’t news , but let ’s repeat it for the one millionth time .
There is no Social Security crisis .
None .
Medicare and Social Security ’s fiscal outlooks are completely different .
There is no Social Security funding emergency – even after the latest trustees report .
Assuming historical rates of growth , there is no shortfall whatsoever for 75 years .
Even under more conservative or pessimistic economic assumptions , extremely modest tweaks eliminate the modest shortfall entirely .
And finally – Social Security is not going “ bankrupt . ”
Even assuming 2037 is the magic date , and assuming low growth and no tinkering before then , Social Security will still be able to pay 75 % of scheduled benefits .
To lump Social Security together with the more problematic Medicare shortfall ( which should be addressed through national health care reform ) is blatantly misleading .
It ’s like saying the combination of a Big Mac and a jelly bean is an extremely high - calorie meal .
But that ’s exactly what Samuelson is doing .
In fact , Michael Lind had a Salon column a while back outlining all the rhetorical tricks that dishonest Social Security skeptics make .
It ’s as if Samuelson read that column , and decided to use them all .
For instance , here ’s Lind :
In order to frighten gullible Americans , anti-Social Security crusaders conflate Social Security with Medicare and talk about the " entitlement crisis " in general .
This masks the fact that Social Security 's projected shortfalls are minor , compared to those of Medicare .
And Samuelson :
It 's increasingly obvious that Congress and the president ( regardless of the party in power ) will deal with the political stink bomb of an aging society only if forced .
And the most plausible means of compulsion would be for Social Security and Medicare to go bankrupt .
And Lind :
About a decade ago , conservative and libertarian economists who oppose Social Security , Medicare and other entitlements came up with a clever rhetorical strategy .
They would calculate the gap between the payroll taxes that pay for these programs and estimated costs over time .
But there was one problem :
The gap is n't all that scary , at least in the near future .
So in order to frighten the American people and their elected leaders , deficit hawks cite the sum total of Social Security 's " unfunded liabilities " over 75 years .
But even this -- a paltry $ 4.3 trillion over three - quarters of a century , according to the 2008 report -- is n't sufficiently terrifying .
[ So they combine Medicare and SS ] .
[ This ] produces a suitably spooky 75 - year shortfall of $ 42.9 trillion .
And if this is not alarming enough , deficit hawks can cite the truly apocalyptic figure of $ 101.7 trillion in combined " entitlement " spending over an infinite time horizon .
The anti-Social Security lobby always presents the " unfunded liabilities " of " entitlements " in scary dollar terms , rather than as percentage points of GDP .
Here 's why :
Over the next 75 years , the Social Security shortfall at most hovers around 1 percent of total U.S. GDP over that same period .
And Samuelson :
That the programs will ultimately go bankrupt is clear from the trustees ' reports .
On Pages 201 and 202 of the Medicare report , you will find the conclusive arithmetic :
Over the next 75 years , Social Security and Medicare will cost an estimated $ 103.2 trillion , while dedicated taxes and premiums will total only $ 57.4 trillion .
The gap is $ 45.8 trillion .
( All figures are converted to " today 's dollars . " )
Lind :
[ According to anti-Social Security advocates , ] [ w ] e have only two choices , or a combination -- cutting benefits or raising the payroll tax .
False .
There are at least two other choices that the deficit hawks never mention .
One is more rapid economic growth , which would make it easier to pay Social Security taxes in the future without either benefit cuts or tax increases .
And Samuelson :
The inadequate trust funds will steadily diminish .
The government bonds in these trust accounts will be presented to the Treasury for payment .
Those payments can be financed in only three ways : bigger deficits , higher taxes or spending cuts .
One more time – there is no Social Security crisis , no matter how much people like Robert Samuelson dislike the level of Social Security benefits .
The DNA of humanity is under siege by faceless sociopaths that see the human herds in the world today as nothing more than useless eaters that are preventing them from having the luxury of the total control they seek over the entire planet .
Part of their plans include the extermination of 4.5 billion people ; in order to be able to control the remaining 1.5 billion slaves that will be needed to support them .
That is the Illuminati plan for you and me .
All life forms come with built - in threat and survival instincts , to protect us from those things that will do major harm , or could possibly result in death ; if they are not acted upon .
Just as everything that lives requires water and food along with a bit of shelter to survive and grow - humans need these things as well .
But over the last four or five decades a massive threat to our existence has been allowed to grow , like a parasitic cancer , within the human race .
This disease is blind and deaf as well dumb , when it comes to investigating anything that has to do with where we get the things we say we ' need ' to live .
For instance , beginning with the invasion of Palestine over sixty years ago , the developed world has been carrying out ever more deadly raids upon resources and peoples in any number of nations - worldwide .
Those that directly ' profit ' from what is stolen from these people and their lands have become numb to the true price that we are paying with this privatized slaughter of innocent people , just as we have remained blind to how much blood is intermixed with the oil we have extorted at the point of our weapons from those that live in the regions where profits are produced ; or in the nations through which these pipelines continue to flow .
So , as it recently has been from Gaza to Pakistan , from Iraq and Afghanistan , all the way to Iran , Lebanon and possibly Syria we are all involved through acquiescence in the carnage that 's about to be :
The latest form of which has just exploded in Niger , over the last nine days .
" We turn now to Nigeria , where the Nigerian military continues to carry out attacks by land , air and sea on the oil - rich Niger Delta .
Reports indicate hundreds , possibly thousands , of Nigerian civilians may be dead .
Entire villages have reportedly been burned to the ground .
The military offensive began eight days ago but has received little international attention .
Aid groups and journalists have been blocked from entering the remote region , which is accessible only by boat .
On Wednesday , a coalition of environmental and human rights groups called on the International Criminal Court to launch an immediate investigation into the killings .
The Nigerian military has claimed the attacks have only targeted militant camps as part of a peace - keeping effort .
DENZIL AMAGBE KENTEBE :
Well , what has happened at this point is that there 's a lot of criminal , unjustified and inconsiderate , callous action , which tends to be genocidal , by the Nigerian military on the people of the Niger Delta region .
Women and children have been displaced .
The military is saying they are restricting their actions only to the militant camps [ and ] that civilians do not live in the militant camps .
And we have thousands and thousands and thousands of people being displaced , being killed , and no one is allowed to go into the war zone , because this is a war .
And this is genocidal , as I have said earlier on .
. . . the government does n't really have any reason .
They are claiming that the militants have been disrupting the oil flow .
And what the citizens of the Niger Delta region are claiming is that 80 percent of the oil , of the crude oil , that flows from the country comes from this region .
But there is no development .
There is no potable drinkable water .
There is no infrastructure in place .
And so , these people are demanding that , you know , you should do something in this area .
That is a crime of the people that have been killed by the Nigerian military .
. . . people that have been killed , as of the last count yesterday , we have almost 500 people , civilians , men and women , children , dead .
Yesterday , a woman and a little boy were shot dead in the city of Warri , which is far away from any of the militant camps .
The burning and destruction is completely going on in Okerenkoko , Oporoza , Kunukunuama , Kurutie and many other places around the Niger Delta region , especially in the Delta State area .
. . . when this started about nine days ago , we foresaw what was a deliberate , calculated attempt to destroy the people of this region for their oil .
And we immediately called on the United Nations and all international agencies to come to our aid .
So far , no one has been in here , no one has called , and no one is even allowed in the area , even the local press .
The military is saying they are not destroying , but they have no evidence to prove otherwise .
We have gotten information from the citizens that have been displaced .
Thousands and thousands of people are living in the forest , as we speak .
Without access to any kind of food , water , clothing , they 're living in the big forest , as we speak , children inclusive " ( 1 ) This is only the latest murderous onslaught , bought and paid for by the oil companies in tandem with corrupt political regimes , that have connived to produce hundreds of billions in profit while they lay waste to the nations that have the resources , and everyone else turns a blind eye to the slaughter of those who live on the lands being destroyed for the maximized illegal profits that are stolen from the nations where the genocides occur .
This is only one instance of how we have lost our once common ability to recognize the threat to all of us , if we allow these barbarous conditions to go unchallenged .
Americans did not blink when we did this all directly in Iraq , in 1991 , in Afghanistan in 2002 , and in Iraq again in 2003 .
Nor have we done anything except protect the aggressors , in the numerous aggressions that Israel continues to initiate throughout the region with our weapons and our money backing their every move .
( 2 ) But beyond these continuing crimes against humanity ; believe it or not there is something far more dangerous afoot .
What is actually beginning to become the actual fact now , is that our DNA is being quietly re-written to remove the basic human instincts and reactions to the threat mechanisms that we were all born with .
If this is too incredible to accept ; then you have not really been paying attention to how widespread this disease has become !
Western educational systems have been knawing away at critical thinking and compound thought for decades .
In the 1970 's the extreme left here began a war upon the idea of " discrimination " as that word was applied whenever it came to questions of race .
However discrimination is a civilized concept that actually denotes ' the need to choose between viable options . '
That word and its importance has consequently all but disappeared from the One World Dictionary ; along with freedom from government interference in our lives and government mandates , whenever and wherever religion wants to forcibly insert itself into the daily lives of non-sectarian life in the USA .
All of this was plotted , to assist the owners with the destruction of the will to resist the government and all those privatized monsters that are stealing our lives and our freedoms each and every second of every day , 24 - 7 and 365 days every year .
( 3 ) To date we have these age - old words to measure our tolerances by : " Wealth without work , pleasure without conscience , knowledge without character , commerce without morality , science without humanity , worship without sacrifice and politics without principle . "
What needs to happen now is that an alternative means of self - education must begin to arise from within the population on several fronts ; because unless people become aware of what they do not know , they will remain captive to this limbic mindset that has enabled the police state that has finally begun to lock - us - down in - place ; here and now .
There are primary facts of life among mammals and higher life forms ; with the exception of most of the human race , among the lobotomized western countries ; that thanks to this redesign of what humans must now artificially continue to ignore ; which of course does not include any real threats to anything in our pathetic lives , according to those that believe they own us all - outright .
The entire animal kingdom knows how to respond to real threats : except for the supposedly higher forms of life that humans have claimed to be , since the imposition of the Judeo - Christian Ethic that made nature into the enemy and women into invisible chattel that could be abused and sold or killed at will .
Until we confront this idiotic dictate from the paternalistic self - designated power - brokers ( those that claim that ' special status ' of absolute rule over everything they survey ) - nothing will ever change !
( 4 ) We have come to this point because we have preferred to enjoy the profits from these very public thefts and the slaughters that have allowed us to complete our murderous thefts .
We are kept where we are because we will not challenge the thoroughly corrupt congress or the criminal establishment that in conjunction with the Zionists has taken control of the White House and its puppets that are nothing but pretenders to power - rather than the real powers that we have allowed to remain safely in the darkness while international piracy continues to flaunt every law - on their way to unleashing chaos to insure their illicit profits .
This is a fools contract after all , for short - term ' profits ' only , purchased at the price of our own humanity ; that can never stand the test of viability ­ for any length of time .
If we do not try to resist - then we shall disappear into mists of time ; and whatever our lives might have been will be lost not just to ourselves but to all of human history :
Because the chaos we will generate will produce global rubble where many varied societies once flourished .

Beautiful Look in Horrible Light
I Can't Stop Looking at This One
__________ Jerome Love 's photo of " Thulani , " a youth program director in Soweto , South Africa is a wonderful example of how bad midday light can be finessed with small flashes .
( Click the pic for bigger . )
If you look at the area in the right of the frame , you can see what ambient Jerome was dealing with .
So he worked the shadow side of a building to build his light in the shade .
He cheated the building a little to use the sun as a rim .
This added a nice layer of texture to the portrait .
He used two bare SB - 28s .
The lack of a mod helps in the light output department .
The key was high camera right , at 1/4 power , zoomed to 85 mm throw .
The fill was on the ground in front ( on the vertical lens axis ) and was set to 1/ 8 .
Note that the key was upper camera right -- same side as the rim .
This little departure from convention always adds a different feel to a lit portrait .
Bad ambient light : Free . Two SB - 28s : About $ 200.00 .
Owning midday with two small flashes : Priceless .
Toni .R's timeless portrait of her 14 - year - old daughter works even before the addition of the seagull , which is posed so perfectly it looks like a suspended movie prop .
The lighting is simple -- a bare SB - 26 , dialed way down , from camera left .
It is working against the sun , which comes from camera right .
( Check out the gull for ambient - only light . )
Toni's light modifier -- a Tupperware bowl -- was rendered inoperative when it was accidently mistaken for the coleslaw dish .
I 'll bet that never happens to Annie .
__________These both had beautiful light , interesting composition and an atypical look .
But beyond that there was a strong connection between the subject and the viewer in each portrait .
While both of these photos were technically not headshots , they get the highest compliment I can give a photo -- that I really wish I had taken them .
WHO , WHAT , WHY ?
The Magazine answers ...
Kitchen knives are the most common weapon used in fatal stabbings , say police .
Now a new " anti- stab " knife has been developed , but how does it work ?
The knife has a new tip Knife crime is hardly out of the headlines these days and it makes grim reading .
Stabbing deaths hit a record high of 322 in the UK last year , according to the government .
Most knives used in such attacks are from the kitchen , former Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Ian Blair suggested .
The first " anti-stab " knife will soon go on sale in Britain and has been designed to work as normal in the kitchen , but be ineffective as a weapon .
THE ANSWER Knife has unique " combination tip " Tip has rounded edge instead of a point Blade for cutting is underneath Ergonomic handle reduces aggressiveness of the knife
The knife has a unique " combination tip " that reduces the risk of injury .
The tip has a rounded edge instead of a point and the blade for cutting is underneath .
While it can chop vegetables , the tip makes penetration more difficult .
It also snags on clothing and skin , making it very unlikely to inflict a fatal wound .
Doctors have lobbied in the past for kitchen knives to be redesigned .
They argue that while a redesign is not a complete solution to the complex problem of knife crime , it could help to save lives .
The New Point knife has been developed by industrial designer John Cornock , who was inspired to create the product after watching a documentary on knife crime .
It has taken four years to develop .
' Intelligent design '
The knife has a blunt " upper protrusion " with a rounded edge which acts as a guard for the sharp point underneath .
It has an undercut that snags on clothes , skin or tissue .
A sharp point underneath is used in the usual way as a standard knife point but with limited penetration .
An ergonomic handle also reduces the aggressiveness of the product .
The new knife is a ' more intelligent ' design " The common kitchen knife has remained unchanged for centuries so now we 're hoping to introduce a safer , more intelligent design for the modern home , " says Mr Cornock .
He says a knife can never be totally safe , but the idea is it can't inflict a fatal wound .
Nobody could just " grab one out of the kitchen drawer and kill someone " .
The knife , which is expected to be launched in late autumn , has been tested with " very favourable " results by the Home Office 's Design and Technology Alliance - set up to research products that can deter crime .
It has also been welcomed by those in the medical profession and the police .
WHO , WHAT , WHY ?
A regular part of the BBC News Magazine , Who , What , Why ?
aims to answer some of the questions behind the headlines Dr Mike Beckett , clinical tutor at West Middlesex Hospital , has previously called for knives to be redesigned .
He says all products should combine efficiency in their intended purpose with the greatest possible degree of safety .
" This is especially true of household products which are freely available to the very young and very old , and used by people who may be clumsy , short tempered , drunk or mentally or physically unwell .
Most people fit into one or more of these categories at some time in their lives . "
Det Insp Mark Clarkson from the Metropolitan Police 's Anti-Knife Crime Unit says he has tested the new knives and believes the design can reduce both accidental harm within the kitchen and stab - like injuries in general .
Designs for another " safe " kitchen knife were unveiled by Staffordshire County Council 's trading standards officers in April this year .
The council is looking to work with manufacturers and retailers to introduce it nationally .

Engineers from the US space agency NASA think they have discovered the cause of a hydrogen leak which twice delayed a high - profile shuttle launch this month , according to the agency .
It may now be all systems go for the space shuttle Endeavour , which is waiting to embark on its final mission to the International Space Station , after a dodgy gas line connection was uncovered during tests .
Engineers from the US space agency NASA think they have discovered the cause of a hydrogen leak which twice delayed a high - profile shuttle launch this month , according to the agency .
It may now be all systems go for the space shuttle Endeavour , which is waiting to embark on its final mission to the International Space Station , after a dodgy gas line connection was uncovered during tests .
NASA program manager John Shannon said a misaligned plate linking the hydrogen gas vent line with the external fuel tank had been causing the leak , which was first detected during fueling .
The Endeavour is set to carry a seven - member crew on a 16 - day voyage to install a platform on the ISS , allowing astronauts to conduct experiments in the vacuum of space , 350 kilometers ( 220 miles ) above Earth 's surface .
To install the equipment five space walks are planned , lasting some 32 and a half hours .
It is the last of three missions to assemble the Japanese Kibo laboratory aboard the orbiting space station .
The race is on to finish construction before NASA ends its shuttle missions in September 2010 .
" Technicians are preparing to test the repair plan by filling Endeavour 's external tank with liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen in the next week and a half , " NASA said in a statement .
Another launch attempt is scheduled for July 11 .

Imagine a quiet night like any other .
Suddenly , your infant ’s cries break the silence .
Fully loaded with emotion , the sound triggers an urge to stand up and run to your infant ’s room .
But , considering that your spouse is a musician and you are not , who will be the first to reach the crib ?
According to Dana L. Strait and a team of researchers at Northwestern University in Illinois , the musician should win the race .
Their latest study showed that years of musical training leave the brains of musicians better attuned to the emotional content , like anger , of vocal sounds .
Ten years of cello , say , can make a person more emotionally intelligent , in some sense .
So the alarm carried in a baby ’s cry make a deeper impression ; your spouse wins the race .
The new work is part of an emerging portrait of the broader connections between music , emotion and speech .
These studies are finding that musicians are more accurate in detecting emotion -- such as joy , sadness and anger -- in speech samples .
The effect has been found even in children as young as 7 years old , with as little as one year of music training .
It is a fascinating example of how experience in one domain ( music ) benefits another ( emotion perception ) .
However , it is not until very recently , with the publication of the new study by Strait and her colleagues , that the biological foundation of the effect has been demonstrated .
Strait ’s team decided to study the brain ’s very first responses to sound , in the brain stem .
The brain stem is the most ancient part of the brain , andis the main entry door for all sensory stimuli .
Once a sound reaches the nerves in your ears , it travels to the brain stem to be processed in an automatic , unconscious fashion .
Both music and speech thus start their journey to the higher brain regions through the brain stem .
To record brain stem responses , the researchers placed electrodes on the heads of 30 people who were either musicians or non-musicians .
The electrodes measured the electric currents that send signals through the brain stem , while the participants listened to an infant ’s unhappy cry .
The surprising result was that the musicians ’ brain showed enhanced responses to the infant ’s cries .
And the greater the number of years of practice and the earlier the person began training , the stronger the signal .
But how can musical training account for musicians ’ advantage in detecting vocal emotion ?
Strait and her colleagues suggest that as we engage in activities that involve high levels of cognitive processing , such as memory or attention in music , we also enhance our sensory system ’s responses .
The higher brain areas in the cortex are connected to lower brain areas , such as the brain stem , and , through these connections , the two areas influence each other .
However , there is still the question of causality : Does musical training really affect the brain or could it be that musicians are simply born with a different brain -- that they are naturally drawn to music by their cognitive strengths ?
Another study suggests that musical training really does drive changes in the brain .
Daniel J. Bosnyak and a team of researchers at McMaster University in Hamilton , Ontario , demonstrated that the brain responses of a group of non-musicians could change as a result of their participation in a just two weeks of training to perceive pitches accurately .
With the emergence of brain imaging technologies , our understanding of the effects of music training on the brain has been advancing rapidly .
For example , we now have clear evidence of morphological changes in the brain , such as enhanced volume in the cortical motor representation of the hands of string players or larger gray matter volume in parts of the musicians ’ auditory cortex dedicated to pitch processing .
Numerous studies have also identified differences in patterns of brain activity between musicians and non-musicians .
However , even with all this building evidence , we are still far from understanding exactly how music reshapes the structures and activity of the brain .
Surprisingly , even with all the remaining questions regarding musical training , the field of neuroscience of music has even more challenges to face .
Although music processing has fascinated neuroscientists for more than a century , it is only in the last decade that it has become a subject of intense and systematic research .
Aside from the effects of musical training , many more aspects of music , such as how we perceive it , how we enjoy it and how we make it , have been under the scope of researchers .
There is general agreement that the brain is tuned for music , but untangling the complex circuitry behind the wondrous experience of it will require more research in this young and rich field .

Update : June 17th : Suitcase With $ 134 Billion Puts Dollar on Edge : Bloomberg
Update June 16th : We ’ve updated this story $ 134 Billion U.S. Bond Mystery Continues In Italy
Update : Italy ’s financial police said they asked the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to authenticate $ 134 billion worth of undeclared U.S. government bonds found in the false bottom of a suitcase carried by two Japanese travelers attempting to cross into Switzerland .
A determination is expected within a few days .
It ’s been a while since I ’ve ran a regular campaign .
My group is seemingly unique in that every player is a GM , so stints between turns are spaced pretty far apart , even given that our campaigns tend to run aground in record time .
My personal schedule is n’t very forgiving , so I ’ve been dodging being the next GM in rotation for two years .
The stars were right the last time the chair was up for grabs , however .
The group wanted to play DnD 4e and aside from our usual 4e GM , who confessed she ’d really like to play this time around , no one was interested in running a 4e game .
I ’d poked my nose far enough into 4e to see it was n’t really my dream game , but that I did n’t actively dislike it either , so with some help from the group in world building , and armed with a DnD Insider account that makes encounter building a snap , I ’ve gotten a few good sessions under my belt for the first time in years .
Sure , I ’m still in an epic fight with the prep demon , a longtime foe of mine , and sure I ’m so rusty you can hear me creak when I sit down at the table , but no one ’s thrown their dice bag at me in disgust yet so I must be doing OK .
In three short sessions running a game after my extended GMing break , I ’ve learned a big “ secret ” that I suspect is one that many GMs learn quickly and then , like me , forget just as quickly .
It ’s one of those “ little things ” that ’s easy to overlook , but well worth making sure you never forget .
Not only that , but it ’s system neutral , and it ’s guaranteed to improve everyone ’s game , from novice , to grizzled veteran .
Ready ?
Get a pen .
The best way to improve your game , is to run a game .
That ’s all .
Well , not all , but that ’s 90 % of it .
It ’s far too easy to sit back and “ armchair GM ” , picking apart the way another GM runs their game , reading GMing theory , and yet never actually running a game .
And while learning via observation and theory is good , it leaves out a huge factor in the equation : YOU .
The way you personally work , the quirks you bring to the game and the table , has a huge dynamic impact on the way the game runs and how you apply all that theory you ’ve been absorbing .
Let ’s take a look at my new game for an example .
Treasure distribution in 4e is supposed to be a fairly painless affair .
Every challenge your players overcome , they get one of the treasure parcels from the list of treasure parcels for their level .
Players give you wishlists beforehand so you can cherry - pick the magic items to put in treasure parcels just for them .
To date , I have not yet remembered to place treasure in my adventure notes .
That ’s right !
Not one single time .
You ’d think after the first time or even the first two times , it would pop into my head during adventure planning , but every time my players defeat a challenge , they turn to me expectantly and say “ So what treasure do we find ? ” and I say “ Oh shit ! ” I think deep down inside , they love that moment …
Maybe not .
Point being , I read GMing theory all the time , and not once , have I ever seen anyone address the “ How do I not be an utter n00 b and forget treasure in my notes ? ” issue .
That ’s because it ’s an issue more or less unique to me .
A lot of GMing issues are like that .
They ’re not some big philosophy issue .
They ’re not game - breaking or universal , they ’re little details unique to the game group and GM in question , and you ’ll never know what yours are unless you actually sit down and play .
And then there are those issues that are big philosophy issues .
Sure , I know I ’m supposed to include at least one challenge , hook , or background element for each of my players in every session .
Sure , I know I ’m supposed to include a clue to a world secret or a scrap of lore in every session .
Do I ? No. Usually not .
Why not ?
Because I forget , or I do n’t see an opening for one , or I ’m pressed for time .
That ’s the whole reason that you need to run to tackle the big issues too .
They take practice to master , not just academic understanding of how they ’re “ supposed ” to work .
Since running is the only way to shake your personal little issues to the top of the game , and to get practice on the big issues you want to incorporate into your game , the best way to make use of your game time to improve your game is to take notes .
These do n’t have to be complicated .
Just a sentence or phrase on a 3×5 card while you play of things you ’d like to address later on .
“ Remember to include treasure in notes ” or “ No one thinks poo jokes are funny ” or “ rogue does n’t seem interested in combat ” .
Then , when prepping for the next session , you can look at your notes and make sure you ’ve addressed them line by line .
If a note needs to be addressed during actual play , keep a sticky note handy or put something in your adventure notes : “ Be sure to use good tactics here . ” or “ Ham this guy up . ”
Once you seem to have an issue licked , you can remove it from your list .
Do n’t worry .
You ’ll always have something to work on .
The extra votes add to a list of complaints leveled against the election by the reform candidate , Mir Hussein Moussavi , and other challengers inside and outside Iran .
Among them :
How did the government manage to count enough of the 40 million paper ballots to be able to announce results within two hours of the polls closing ?
How is it that Mr. Ahmadinejad ’s margin of victory remained constant throughout the ballot count ?
Why did the government order polls closed at 10 p.m. when they often stay open until midnight for presidential races ?
Why were some ballot boxes sealed before candidates ’ inspectors could validate they were empty ?
Why were votes counted centrally , by the Interior Ministry , instead of locally , as in the past ?
Why did some polling places lock their doors at 6 p.m. after running out of ballots ?

The New York Times
In specific terms , analysts who have scrutinized the election results available in Persian and English said that for Mr. Ahmadinejad to have won 63 percent to Mr. Moussavi ’s 34 percent , he would have had to have won over most people who four years ago supported the liberal reform candidate , Mehdi Karroubi , a former speaker of the Parliament who ran again this year .
They said the president also would have had to have garnered the votes in that 2005 race that went to Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani , a bitter opponent of Mr. Ahmadinejad who backed Mr. Moussavi this time .
“ In the province where Karroubi did best in 2005 , his home province of Lorestan , Ahmadinejad got some 71 percent of the vote , ” wrote Nate Silver in an analysis that was posted on fivethirtyeight.com , a politics and polling Web site .
He added , “ If Ahmadinejad won the election , he did it by winning over these rural Karroubi voters .
And if he stole it , those were the votes he stole or intimidated . ”
The review of voting statistics released this week by St. Andrews University and Chatham House reached a similar conclusion .
“ The plausibility of Mr. Ahmadinejad ’s claimed victory is called into question by figures that show that in several provinces he would have had to attract the votes of all new voters , all the votes of his former centrist opponent , and up to 44 percent of those who voted for reformist candidates in 2005 , ” said Thomas Rintoul , one of the study ’s authors .
The leadership of the Islamic republic takes voting very seriously as a symbol of legitimacy and loyalty to the system .
Voting always occurs on a day off , to maximize turnout .

Hitting movie theaters this weekend is Julie Taymor ’s Across the Universe , a pop musical that tells the story of the sixties through the songs of the Beatles .
In it , Bono sings “ I Am the Walrus . ”
Is it any good ?
Who knows !
But , to test out our sexy new streaming audio player , here are Vulture ’s top ten all - time favorite Beatles covers .
Note :
If you think we missed one , you ’re wrong — we listened to it and decided we just did n’t like it .
10 . The Libertines , “ Eight Days a Week ” ( 2003 )
By the time the Beatles got around to writing this song in 1964 , George Martin had whipped the former bar band into a crack team of metronomic studio professionals .
So , we ’d like to extend our sincerest thanks to Pete Doherty and Carl Barat for this madcap pisstake , which we ’re pretty sure was recorded on the walk home from a pub .
9. Echo & the Bunnymen , “ Ticket to Ride ” ( 2001 )
The psychedelic Liverpudlians soak the Help ! track in reverb and synthesizers .
This is how the original version might ’ve sounded had the Beatles tried LSD two years sooner ( also if synthesizers had been available in 1965 ) .
8. Elliott Smith , “ Blackbird ” ( 2003 )
Smith made his love of the Beatles pretty apparent by remaking almost their entire discography at his concerts .
This is our favorite of his covers ; with his half - sung , half - croaked delivery , he sounds every bit the song ’s broken - winged protagonist .
7. Rufus Wainwright , “ Across the Universe ” ( 2001 )
Many of Wainwright ’s own songs owe their best moments to over - the - top arrangements for gospel choirs and 90 - piece orchestras .
But here , he just strums an acoustic guitar and sings the crap out of Let It Be ’s ineffable highlight .
6. Aretha Franklin , “ Eleanor Rigby ” ( 1969 )
The melancholy of the Beatles ’ version is erased in this upbeat cover , replaced by Aretha ’s grim determination to push on through to the other side .
Who knew that inside the Beatles ’ most chamber - music - inspired track was hidden classic R&B ?
5 . The Breeders , “ Happiness Is a Warm Gun ” ( 1990 )
Kim Deal , on leave from the Pixies , transforms The White Album ’s signature song into something jagged , cranky , and twice as dangerous .
A great example of a band remaking a Beatles track in its own style , without concern for the preciousness of the original .
4. Cornershop , “ Norwegian Wood ” ( 1997 )
Tjinder Singh ’s short - lived but brilliant Anglo - Indian dance band reclaims all those sitars , and Singh translates the whole song into Punjabi to boot .
A witty and enjoyable comment on cross-cultural appropriation .
And you can boogie to it !
3. Wilson Pickett , “ Hey Jude ” ( 1969 )
Duane Allman ’s guitar soars on this cover , which accomplishes the unimaginable — it matches the Beatles ’ version in pure , rhapsodic emotion .
It just makes things a little more grungy .
2. Sonic Youth , “ Within Without You ” ( 1988 )
Thurston and friends sic their guitar pedals on Sgt. Pepper ’s Hindu-tastic centerpiece .
Is that an actual sitar or a problem with somebody ’s Telecaster ?
Not even Vishnu knows for sure .
1. Stevie Wonder , “ We Can Work It Out ” ( 1970 )
Stevie finds the funk in the Beatles ’ folksy workout and makes it even more joyous and exciting .
Why is this No. 1 ? Because none of the covers on this list , excellent though they may be , improve on the Beatles ’ originals … except this one .
10 Favorite Beatles Covers of All Time
HGH Spray
As people get older , their production of Human Growth Hormone starts diminishing , and due to this change their bodies start to feel the effects of getting older .
Many people have tried to stop the aging process because everybody hopes that they can turn back the clock to enjoy and experience a young , healthy and vibrant way of living again .
Fortunately , naturopathic scientists have discovered a potential anti-aging concoction to combat the aging process - by increasing human growth hormone levels .
HGH sprays are a synthesized and stored polypeptide and protein hormone composed of 191 - amino acids .
It is secreted from somatotroph cells in the anterior pituitary gland that stimulates cell production as well as growth in humans .
HGH products come in the form of oral sprays , tablets , nasal sprays , powders and capsule .
HGH
Sprays are by far the most effective , as they work with the homeopathic theory of using the minimum amount of natural body element , to induce the body to produce more of its own natural HGH .
The ingredients of a good HGH Spray includes all the necessary human growth components - L - Glutamine , amino acids , L - Isoleucine , L - Valine , L - Arginine and growth factors .
HGH spray does n't require a doctor 's prescription and can be easily obtained online and through health and wellness stores .
HGH sprays can help to repair , heal and replace body cells , specifically those that make up muscles , essential organs , bones and other tissues .
HGH acts as ' trigger ' to facilitate new and replacement cells .
After studying HGH , scientists in the early 80s created the first ever artificial human growth hormone spray .
This HGH in tests showed significant results with increases in muscle mass while reducing the unnecessary body fat .
In addition to these , other benefits were better sleep , energy and also improvement in skin tone .
As compared to human growth hormone supplements in pill form , HGH sprays are a safer and simpler option .
When sprayed directly into the mouth , the formula is effortlessly absorbed with the lining of the mouth , delivering it straight into the bloodstream .
The ingredients of HGH sprays reach the brain all the way through the blood and encourage the pituitary gland to release ( or secrete ) human growth hormone .
No side effects have been noticed by the use of HGH sprays , though these HGH sprays are not recommended to people who are below 18 years of age .
Likewise , people who are under any kind of medical treatment or any type of drugs must not use the HGH spray .

They say the bank approved them for a $ 550,000 loan , but bought the house for $ 335,000 , enabling them to afford the swimming pool and other improvements since their budget was not stressed by a mortgage they could n't afford .

Enlarge College student Francesca Saracino , left , says she 's not sure what to major in at Wayne State University because she 's concerned about what fields will offer jobs when she 's ready to graduate .
Mike Woodward , left , said he no longer feels to " have a job and contribute to a retirement plan and save here and there " is enough to be secure .
At age 26 , Angela Trilli does n't think she 's one of those so - called materialistic Millennials she has heard about — young people who are absorbed with themselves and their consumption .
She says she 's a saver , not a spender , but unlike many of her peers who did n't have much to lose in this struggling economy , she says she lost $ 15,000 — about half of the savings she built up since childhood .
SHARING : ' Civic generation ' rolls up sleeves in record numbers IN - DEPTH : Refocusing the American Dream " It 's a very insecure world out there , " says Trilli , of Kendall Park , N.J. , who works in marketing for a non-profit .
" It was a little shocking to the system .
You think things are going in a certain way , but you can't expect that things are always going to be the same . "
The Millennial generation , or Gen Y , ranges from people in their 20s to those still in grade school .
But what they all have in common is the knowledge that the recession has in some way shattered the world they thought they knew .
And , depending upon how long the downturn lasts , historians , economists and psychologists say it could shape Millennials ' values and attitudes in much the same way the Depression shaped the attitudes of those growing up in the 1930s .
" I call it the end of Disney World , " says Michael Bradley , an adolescent psychologist in suburban Philadelphia .
But now , young people are reordering their values .
" It is their version of the American Dream , " he says .
" They talk more about having autonomy and freedom , and in so doing , not being as enslaved to material goals that they perceived their parents being caught up in .
They do talk about life happiness not based on economic success or achievement as much . "
Although many surveys have tried to gauge the economy 's effect on Americans , few have focused on Millennials .
But one survey in February by the New York City - based marketing and advertising agency JWT ( formerly J. Walter Thompson ) focused on the recession 's effect on this group .
The survey of 1,065 Americans 18 and older , including 243 ages 18 - 29 , suggests 60 % feel their generation is being dealt an unfair blow because of the recession .
But some see opportunity , as well .
For example , 44 % say they might be able to afford a house now that home prices have plummeted ; 25 % say that if they have trouble finding a job , they 'll just start their own business .
Young and newly frugal
The virtues of simple living now coming into vogue especially strike a chord with Millennials , whom pollster John Zogby describes as more socially conscious , environmentally aware and demanding as consumers than previous generations .
ZOGBY : ' First Globals ' are shaping the future " I do n't go shopping as often , even though I like to , " says Gabriella Ring , 16 , of Oak Park , Mich. , who will be a high school junior in the fall .
" I go when there 's end - of - season clearance sales and when I really need something .
I used to want to go all the time . "
Experts differ on whether such restraint will continue when the economy turns around , but they agree that these are formative years .
" This is the time where a lot of their attitudes are set .
The long - term is still in question , but it has the potential to have a big impact and change the views that they 'll have throughout their lives , " says economist Richard Curtin , who directs consumer surveys at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor .
" They 'll be more oriented toward economic security and relationships , more toward savings and less toward spending . "
James Burroughs , an associate professor of commerce who studies consumer culture at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville , says he has seen a shift in student attitudes in his classes since the downturn .
" While students were going to consume less , there was also a psychological shift , " he says .
" It was n't necessarily that they were n't going to consume , but they were giving a lot more thought to consumption . "
Anthony Durr , 21 , of Columbus , Ohio , says the recession has influenced how he views money , especially since his grandmothers , both raised during the Depression , are preaching caution .
" Their generation — they were all about saving money .
They understood the value of every single dollar , " says Durr , who will be a senior this fall at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland .
" I would like to believe that with my generation , it 's going to definitely come to that point .
Even if you 're very successful with your company , there 's always that chance of losing your job , and then what ? "
Downsizing expectations
Already , young people are envisioning their futures , and it's not necessarily what they had in mind before the economy tanked .
" I just think we 're having to get used to living a little less luxurious than we grew up , " says Dan Appel , 21 , a psychology student at Montgomery County Community College in Blue Bell , Pa .
" We 'll have to realize we need to settle for slightly less than our parents had when they were first entering the job market . "
Says Trilli , " I do n't know if our generation — from my perspective — needs as much . "
She notes that growing up , " we had a four - bedroom house , and it was just me and my parents . "
Now she shares a modest three - bedroom ranch house with her fiancé , Nick Kapalski , 28 .
" I feel like we live at our means . "
Francesca Saracino , 19 , of Grosse Pointe Woods , Mich. , says the economy seems to be setting her life course .
Not only did her father get laid off in May after taking a pay cut last November , but Saracino had to delay plans to transfer to Michigan State University for her sophomore year of college .
She has been living at home and commuting to Wayne State University in Detroit .
And she 's not sure what to major in because she 's concerned about what careers will produce jobs .
" The recession does have a lot of impact on my future , " she says .
Laurisa Rodrigues , 18 , also believes the recession will have longer - term effects on her financial future .
She just graduated from high school in Pueblo , Colo. , and will be a freshman this fall at the University of Puget Sound in Tacoma , Wash .
" A lot of us have seen our parents live paycheck to paycheck , and we do n't want that for us , " she says .
" Our generation is learning , but I do n't think we 're learning quite as fast as we should .
Once we get jobs and get settled , I know I 'm going to be a little tighter with my money , so I do n't have to live paycheck to paycheck . "
Although experts consider Millennials overall an optimistic bunch , the down economy has made many cynical , saying they have less confidence in traditional approaches to saving money .
" I think my generation feels a lot less financially secure .
I feel like I need to be more creative and pay more attention to how I use and manage my money , " says Mike Woodward , 23 , of Fredericksburg , Va . " Growing up , I felt like if you have a job and contribute to a retirement plan and save here and there , you 'll be OK .
That was the mind - set of many people my age from seeing their parents .
But now … I have to have a different way to do things . "
A change in direction Woodward , a 2008 bioengineering graduate of Stanford University in Palo Alto , Calif. , is living with his parents and preparing to launch a non-profit this summer to train the homeless , the unemployed and non-violent offenders in construction to help rebuild New Orleans .
He had planned to go to medical school , but the recession piqued his interest in the economy .
" I think people are going to shift what they go after because they have to — not necessarily on their own accord .
' I can't have what I wanted , so I 'm going to more or less settle , ' " he says .
" However , I think that sparks creativity .
We will have people who are going to rise to the occasion and look for creative solutions . "
Although more entrepreneurs may emerge from the down economy , psychologist Bradley says there are potential emotional repercussions , particularly among younger Millennials , if the downturn lasts more than a couple of years and the impact is more severe .
" A kid who is actually losing his house is going to be traumatized much more than a neighbor who watches this happen .
It 's more of a fear response , and that could lead to the Depression - era reaction in the generation down the road .
They might be more survival - oriented . "
Economic uncertainty can create greater materialism , according to research co-written by psychologist Tim Kasser of Knox College in Galesburg , Ill. , and published last year in the journal Motivation and Emotion .
" Most people , when they go through economic recession , may become more frugal , " he says , but they " respond to moments of psychological insecurity by becoming more materialistic . "
A smaller strand of research , he adds , " suggests that during times of insecurity and trauma , there is an opportunity for changing one 's values .
If they use that trauma as a way to re-evaluate their lives , to think about what 's really important , there is evidence that people will care less about money and possessions than they did before . "
Historians note that the economy became more dependent on consumption after the Depression and World War II and fueled the dictum that each succeeding generation would be financially better off than the previous one — something most experts say is n't likely for the Millennials .
Lizabeth Cohen , a history professor at Harvard University , is among those with a wait - and - see attitude about whether any values change will happen .
But Jim Cullen , author of the 2003 book The American Dream : A Short History of an Idea That Shaped a Nation , says he expects long - term attitudinal changes prompted by what he calls " structural changes in the global economy . "
" Jobs will be less secure .
Our way of life is going to become more expensive .
We will be paying more for the things we 've had all along , " he says .
" We will see recovery , but in some sense , I feel like the hard work of changing our values has barely begun .
I do n't think people have any idea about what they 're really going to have to do . "
But Trilli , like many others , has n't given up on her dream : " I want to own a restaurant one day , and I still think I can . "

Dinner ’s ready , but at what cost to the world ’s amphibians ?
( Image : Rex Features )
Millions of frogs are shifted around the world each year for sale as pets and food .
Now research shows , for the first time , that this global trade is spreading two severe diseases – one of which is blamed for driving amphibians towards extinction .
Last year the World Organisation for Animal Health ( OIE ) took a step towards monitoring both diseases by making them “ notifiable ” , but as yet there are no regulations to prevent the trade of infected frogs .
“ This is a major issue , ” says Peter Daszak , president of the Wildlife Trust , and an expert on amphibian diseases .
“ Over a million bullfrogs a year come into the USA for food .
If only five per cent are infected , that ’s 50,000 infected animals . ”

Importing disease
Daszak and colleagues surveyed frogs that were imported through three major US ports : Los Angeles , San Francisco and New York .
In each city , they visited market stalls and stores selling live imported bullfrogs or frog parts , purchased samples , and took them back to the lab where they were tested for the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis ( Bd ) and for ranaviruses – viruses specific to amphibians .
Bd causes devastating chytrid disease , first identified about a decade ago .
In the past few years , a number of studies have shown that it is an important factor in the recent drop - off in amphibian numbers .
Worldwide , chytrid disease has caused extinctions and declines in 200 species of frogs .
Ranaviruses also cause large die - offs , but scientists do not yet know whether they can contribute to extinctions .
Just over eight per cent of the frogs the researchers sampled had ranaviral diseases , whereas two thirds carried the chytrid fungus .
‘ Major factor ’
“ Considering the devastating impact Bd has had on global amphibian populations and the millions of animals being traded on an annual basis , this number is especially alarming , ” says Lisa Schloegel of the Wildlife Trust who led the work .
“ We may never completely know the extent to which trade has contributed to the global spread of amphibian diseases , but it does appear to be a major contributing factor . ”
Studies of chytrid fungus show its genetic makeup is very similar around the world , suggesting it is a relatively new pathogen , says Trenton Garner , a herpetologist at the Institute of Zoology in London .
“ The only way we can think of it getting this wide distribution without any evidence of it being an old pathogen is that it must have been moved around an awful lot , and recently . ”
The two main factors that move frogs around on a global scale are the pet and food trade .
To get some idea of these movements , Daszak and colleagues obtained import data from the US Fish and Wildlife Service under the US Freedom of Information Act .
They found that between 1 January 2000 and 31 December 2005 , over 7 million kilograms of amphibians and amphibian parts were imported into the US .
That comes to more than 28 million animals in five years , or about 5 million animals a year .
‘ Important step ’
Yet , although many nations , including the US , Australia and the European Union , have strong research programmes into the origins and spread of chytrid , none of the researchers New Scientist spoke to had heard of any national regulations to control infections in imported animals .
Animals are examined by vets when they enter the US , but both Bd and ranaviruses are easily missed in physical examinations .
Skin swabs need to be taken and analysed in a laboratory to detect both conditions .
Ideally , says Garner , exporting nations would be required to certify that their animals are disease - free and importing nations should check this upon arrival .
The OIE ’s decision to make Bd and ranaviral diseases notifiable means that all 172 member countries must report on the status of the disease within their borders every six months .
“ The OIE measures are the first step , and a very significant one , ” says Daszak .

On Telling My Son That He Is A Geek by Marshall Brain I have put " the talk " off for as long as I have been able , because it is going to be an uncomfortable conversation .
It will be far harder than the " birds and bees " conversation that parents dread .
The " birds and bees " conversation , by the way , was fairly painless with my son .
He 's read enough science books and seen enough stuff on Discovery Channel to know most everything he needs to know about the mechanics of sex .
The depth of his knowledge , from a clinical perspective , was impressive when we discussed the topic .
But this next conversation will , I fear , be near impossible for him to understand , and even harder to explain .
I am going to have to tell him that he is a geek .
And because he is a geek , he is about to be sentenced to seven years of unmitigated hell at the hands of his peers .
The thing that is forcing " the talk " is a question he asked last week .
He asked it in the same way he might ask why a gasoline engine has a spark plug while a Diesel engine does not .
He 's expecting to hear a simple , logical , reasonable answer that tells him something new about the world we live in .
But the question he asked has no simple , logical or reasonable answer .
Instead , his question probes one of the darkest , and frankly the most repulsive , aspects of the human condition .
His question was this : " Dad , why am I always the last one they pick in PE ? "
He asked it with sadness and resignation , as though he already has some sense of the future that will unfold .
But I think he asked it more in the form of a question that might have an answer - a problem for which there could be a solution .
And unfortunately the solution space is limited here .
So let 's back up for a moment .
In the United States , the average age for the onset of male puberty is approximately 11.5 years .
My son turns 11.5 years old next week .
He is in the fifth grade at the local public school .
My son is also a geek .
Without question .
Like his father at that age , he is small and scrawny and wildly uncoordinated .
He is decently intelligent , madly in love with all things scientific , mathematical and technological , but unskilled in most social situations .
I asked him how they select teams in PE .
It 's the same way they 've done it for centuries .
The teacher picks two star athletes to be the captains of the two teams , and then they alternately pick their team members one by one .
I am amazed that in this day and age , with all the emphasis on diversity and political correctness and inclusion , that this form of medieval torture would still be allowed .
Think about it from the geek perspective .
You are standing in a large room with all of your peers .
Your peers are picked one by one until you are the last person left on the opposite side of the room .
In front of everyone , you stand alone .
You are publicly told , in the most visceral way possible , that you are the biggest loser in the class .
And an adult authority figure is standing there supervising the proceedings , so it must be right and true .
What could possibly be more embarrassing and humiliating for an 11.5 - year - old kid than that kind of situation ?
This process is automatically rigged against all disabled and uncoordinated kids , and the level of public humiliation it inflicts is brutal .
We all know it happens .
It is nearly cliche .
The persona of Harry Potter is built on the foundation of geek abuse .
There are TV shows designed around it , including this one that finally , in a small way , takes the geek 's side ( although it also shows a problem so severe that it requires professionals to deal with it ) : Bullies are evil .
The people who surround and empower bullies are worse .
Unfortunately , this group is often the majority in a secondary school situation .
On the other hand , the abuse in fifth grade may be helpful .
Because this is just the first level of a many - layered hell that the geek endures in Middle and High School .
The PE embarrassment festival in fifth grade is an early taste that prepares the geek for the many embarrassments and humiliations that are to follow .
If you are not a geek , you have no appreciation for this , but if you are a geek , you are nodding your head in sad affirmation .
By age 15 or 16 , the pain will be excruciating in comparison to this minor fifth grade stuff .
I mentioned above that this is one of the most repulsive features of the human condition .
Why ?
There are two reasons .
First , the abuse of geeks demonstrates that there is a group of people in this world who make it their business to make others miserable .
That group first gains significant power as early as Elementary School .
They will take that misery as far as they possibly can , and their peers will join in either out of fear or glee or ignorance .
A good example of how bad the misery can get is this situation , where a teenage girl eventually committed suicide to escape her peers :
Her teen committed suicide over " sexting "
That is not uncommon .
And there are legions of kids , both male and female , who feel bad enough to seriously consider suicide because of the actions of their peers .
If you think a little further , you realize that it is this same phenomenon at the root of racism , sexism , homophobia , discrimination in general , caste systems , genocide and most of the other human - induced miseries in our world .
All of it is completely unnecessary and hopelessly cruel .
Second , there is a group of adults , most likely early members of that same misery - producing group from elementary school , who , given the chance , make it possible for the misery to flourish in school environments .
It would be possible for the adults to create a school environment that treated everyone equally ( zero tolerance for bullying , zero emphasis on jocks , etc. ) , or that treated geeks as geniuses and pushed jocks to the background ( because the ability to put a ball through a hoop is largely meaningless in today 's world ) .
But we do not .
Why would we create an environment that is tuned to make a group of uncoordinated and socially uncomfortable people miserable ?
Why create an environment that makes anyone miserable ?
Yet we do it constantly .
The part that is even more bizarre is that it is the geeks who make our modern world possible .
Just about any major invention of the modern world - from cell phones to automobiles to sewer systems - was thought up and refined and introduced to the general public through the work of geeks : engineers , scientists , programmers , mathematicians , etc .
Why in the world would we crush these people in Middle School and High School ?
How much would we and they gain if we did not crush them ?
But crush them we do , and this is what my son and I will be trying to discuss .
We will talk about all kinds of stuff .
His path , unfortunately , is centuries old , including the whole PE thing .
He will continue to get picked last .
He will get hazed in the showers .
He will be laughed at and humiliated for every athletic thing he is made to do .
How do you talk about that sort of thing ?
" Well , my son , you have been born into a species that has the potential for so much good , but instead often descends into amazing cruelty .
And you , unfortunately , are going to bear the brunt of that cruelty for many years . "
It will all be intensely embarrassing , yes , but there is absolutely nothing he can do about it .
And it goes well beyond PE .
He will be eating alone or with a group of geek outcasts in the cafeteria .
People will throw food at him .
They will trip him .
He will live in constant fear that he might have to use the restroom when other boys are using it , because he knows he will be hazed or worse in that small , enclosed space .
He will at least once get stuffed in a locker - possibly many times .
He will be rejected by every girl he approaches .
As a result there is a high likelihood that he will skip / avoid all dances , including the prom .
It 's not because he wo n't want to go .
But he will probably realize that it is another opportunity to be publicly humiliated .
He will be forced to go to pep rallies and watch sports for which he has absolutely no interest because the whole High School World is geared to Jock culture at most schools .
Think about it : In High School the world divides into two types of people .
There is the group for whom puberty is fast acting .
They will be , for all practical purposes , adults at age 16 or so .
The guys in this group will be shaving twice a day , bulking up as though on steroids , cussing , drinking , fathering children and so on .
Levi Johnson and Bristol Palin are the spokespersons for this group .
These people will be celebrated .
And then there is the group for whom puberty is slow acting .
They wo n't be shaving until college .
They wo n't be sexually active either , because they will have no choice .
No one of the opposite sex will have anything to do with them .
They will likely feel intensely uncomfortable and humiliated throughout their teen years .
So my son and I will have " the talk . "
We will discuss mitigating strategies .
Avoidance strategies .
Strategies for trying to eliminate or defuse the worst of the hazing and cruelty .
Yesterday , for example , he came home in tears because everyone on the bus had ganged up chanting " UNIBROW " .
He unfortunately has eyebrows that resemble those of Sylar on the show Heroes .
Sylar , of course , can eat his tormentors .
Geeks generally have to use other techniques in situations like that .
But we will also discuss the silver lining .
Although impossible to imagine in high school , it does get better in college because , in general , the geeks get to go to college while the others do n't .
And then as you exit college it gets better because there are plenty of opportunities for geeks .
Geeks have a chance to work in places that are geek - friendly because they are filled with geeks .
The hazing also gives the geek experience in persevering even though there are nay - sayers .
It lets you value yourself without the outward acceptance of others , which can increase your independence and drive .
I believe there are other systems we could create that would have the same outcome without the pain , but in High School such systems are rare .
The one other thing I will tell him is that when he comes home , he will be accepted here unconditionally , and with love , and celebrated for his geekiness .
Because we are a family of geeks .
Even though that will be relatively minor consolation when compared to the abuse he is getting from his peers , it will mean something to him .
Hopefully it will be enough to keep him from committing suicide .

I applied for a simple security escort position with the NSA .
I just had my polygraph .
I 'm a 23 year old female and just graduated last year from a public college .
I 've never had a security clearance or had any kind of government job before .
I am a generally anxious person - anything from long car rides , school tests , and even going to the movies makes me sick or anxious .
I went in feeling ok and confident because my girl friend had just taken it earlier that day and everything went fine for her .
The examiner was perfectly polite etc- a young male .
I am a very honest blunt kind of person - in fact telling the truth gets me into trouble sometimes , so I had no qualms about opening up like a book to him .
Finally got me hooked up and got a baseline on me fine .
His focus questions were general and the other questions were of the espionage / spy variety .
He tells me that since I 've never had a security clearance or had access to goverment documents etc - that it would be almost impossible for me to engage into any kind of espionage , terrorism etc .
Of course I kind of giggle when someone asks me if I was a spy / terrorist / saboter because I can never imagine myself in a million years being any of those things .
So - first test he runs comes up inconclusive and immediately his tone changes with me .
Harsh sounding .
He tells me that I must listen to everything he says and that I need to breath - apparently I did n't breath for like 15 seconds .
I told him sorry - that I did n't realize I was doing it .
So I tried to fix it for the second test since he seemed mad that I had n't done exactly as he said the first time .
But of course - that one came up inconclusive to because I focused on my breathing .
And he is becoming more harsh with me and I apologize even more - tell him I 'm sorry that I 'm just trying to be calm and trying to get him some test results he can read .
And I 'm not quite sure what I can do - he told me that my nervousness would not effect the results but they were .
He accuses me of not taking it seriously and raises his voice and his tone is harsh when he repeats the questions again ( the test is n't going , but he is asking ) , " Are you a blah blah involved in etc ? "
And I 'm very serious and tell him , " No " to every question .
And he was like " Ok then , show me .
" And he says why should the NSA give me a clearance if I can't pass this test ?
He says what do I have to be so nervous about ?
I was very sensitive to his grilling and I 'm very upset at this point because I am seem to be unable to give him what he wants and I start to cry .
Not sobbing , but my emotions are getting the best of me since I seem to be failing at something that should be so easy .
And he asks me why I am crying and why I am so upset and I tell him because I can't seem to do what he wants - and he seems more agitated by this -
" Do n't worry about me .
There is nothing to cry about .
Do n't worry about the results , just answer the questions . "
He becomes less harsh after he sees such a emotional reaction and tells me to use that emotion for the test .
At this point - I 'm feeling completely embarrassed and a little less racked with anxiety .
I just can't believe this man made me so upset and that I cried !
I calm myself quickly and finally we get some results .
I say , " Well i guess since you are n't reprimanding me - you must have gotten something readable . "
And he gives me a funny look and says " I never reprimanded you . "
And I 'm just confused .
He takes the stuff and leaves the room and comes back saying we are going to do another test .
He says the test is better for people like me .
Basically on some of the control questions - he has me lie purposefully on those .
And we do that and then I 'm able to get out of there .
Whether my results come back fine or not - I now believe this is n't a reliable method of finding out if people are lying or not .
The whole thing just struck me as ridiculous .

Cantor ’s Non-Diagonal Proof
Cantor ’s first proof that the reals are uncountable
Georg Cantor created set theory , a paradise that David Hilbert declared : “ no one shall expel us from ” Hilbert ’s full quote is : “ No one shall expel us from the paradise that Cantor has created for us . ”
“ No one ” referred to Leopold Kronecker who thought Cantor a “ corrupter of youth ” , and to Henri Poincaré who thought Cantor ’s set theory a malady that would one day be cured .
Even great scientists can be wrong about new directions –perhaps something we should all remember .
If Cantor ’s work was going on today , would he get funded or even get his papers into the top conferences ?
I wonder .
Cantor created set theory to solve problems in Fourier series , especially looking for conditions that imply that a Fourier series uniquely determines a function .
This led him to consider actual infinite processes , which was a giant conceptual step beyond any previous work .
Infinities had been used before in mathematics , but never studied in a way that Cantor did .
While set theory may seem to be the most abstract of theories , its roots were based on concrete questions from function theory .
We all know the famous diagonal proof of Cantor , that proves that the reals are uncountable , so I will not repeat the argument here .
If you need a refresher , or have not seen the proof before , there are many good expositions available .
The diagonal proof has been used over and over in mathematics .
In the beginning of complexity theory , Alan Turing used a diagonal argument for his proof that the Halting Problem is undecidable .
Later , time and space hierarchies were proved using Cantor ’s method , with additional insights into Turing machine simulations .
There are countless–bad pun–applications of Cantor ’s diagonal proof method .
What you may not know is that Cantor discovered his wonderful proof in 1891 .
However , almost twenty years earlier , in 1874 , he first proved that the reals were uncountable .
His earlier proof ( EP ) is not based on diagonalization , does not seem to generalize , and is not well known .
The proof apparently was discovered in December 1873 and published in 1874 as “ On a Property of the Collection of All Real Algebraic Numbers . ”
The main consequence that Cantor noted , at the time , was the existence of transcendental numbers in any interval .
This had been proved earlier in 1844 by Joseph Liouville using constructive methods .
The reason for the strange title was that Cantor was worried about opposition from Kronecker and others : yet his main result is that the reals are uncountable , not that there are transcendental numbers .
Today I would like to present the earlier proof , which I think you might enjoy seeing for two reasons .
First , it is very different from the diagonal proof , and shows how Cantor ’s thinking evolved over time .
It also shows how deep the simple diagonal proof is : if it took the master almost twenty years to find it , one could argue that it really is deep .
As I have said before , often things that seem trivial today were once impossible , were once unknown .
Second , I think the EP is an instance of an important principle on how we prove that objects exist .
There are many ways that you can try to prove that some mathematical object exists .
An obvious method , that sometimes works , is to “ write down ” the object in closed form .
I will not be precise on what closed form means , but I hope you get the general idea .
For example , when asked for a number that is not rational , you could write down .
Or when asked for a function that is periodic you can give as an example .
Often , however , there is no simple way to write down what you want : the object that you are trying to construct is too complex .
In this case a powerful method is to construct the object as a limit of simpler objects .
This is exactly what Cantor ’s EP does .
I wonder about his EP , and whether or not it could help solve some of our open problems .
More on that later .
The Earlier Theorem and Proof
Theorem :
The real numbers are uncountable .
Cantor ’s earlier proof ( EP ) assumes that
is a list of reals all in the interval .
He then constructs , by a limiting process , a real number that is in the interval and satisfies , for all , .
This of course shows that the reals are uncountable , but the proof seems more concrete , to me , than the diagonal proof .
Let .
We will follow Cantor and construct a series of proper intervals
Suppose that we have constructed for , then we will construct the next interval as follows .
Let .
Select so that
and is not equal to .
Then , is in at most one of the two intervals :
Let be the first interval that does not contain .
We claim that the nested intervals tend to an interval , which can be degenerate .
Let be any point in .
By construction , is in .
Moreover , cannot be equal to any .
This follows since at step we selected so that .
But , since , it follows that is not in
Note , the fact that nested closed intervals tend to a limit interval is the place where Cantor uses the fact that the reals are complete .
That is any bounded increasing ( decreasing ) sequence of reals has a limit point .
Open Problems
I hope you like Cantor ’s proof .
I find it more intuitive than the diagonal proof , perhaps that is why Cantor found the EP first ?
An obvious open question is : can Cantor ’s EP method be used to solve some theory problem ?
Is it just a curiosity , or is there something that is fundamentally useful about the method ?
What would the notion of limit be ?
In complexity theory we have used the diagonal method over and over , could it be possible that the EP method could have some advantage in solving some problems ?
Analgesic drugs do not always work against cancer pain A breakthrough could lead to drugs to alleviate the pain experienced by cancer patients .
The biology of cancer pain is different to other types of pain , often rendering analgesic drugs ineffective .
Work by a German team , published in Nature Medicine , shows that blocking a specific type of hormone - like molecule produced by tumours could help .
The team showed that the molecules make nerve endings grow in nearby tissue , causing an acute sensation of pain .
What 's particularly encouraging is that this research could one day lead to drugs that can block pain locally at the tumour site
Dr Joanna Owens
Cancer Research UK
Pain is one of the most debilitating symptoms associated with the many forms of the disease .
It can become excruciating as cancer advances , but tackling it has proved difficult for doctors .
The molecules highlighted by the latest study , by a team at Heidelberg University , were known to play a role in the development of blood cells in the bone marrow .
But this is the first time they have also been shown to have a role in causing pain .
New drugs
The researchers hope their work could lead to new drugs to block this action .
Dr Mark Matfield is scientific adviser to the Association for International Cancer Research , which partly funded the work .
He said : " Identifying one of the ways in which cancer causes pain - in fact , perhaps the main mechanism - is a crucial step towards drugs that could bring relief to cancer sufferers across the world . "
Dr Joanna Owens , of the charity Cancer Research UK , said : " It 's important that we continue to improve pain relief for people with cancer , and this study reveals an intriguing new avenue to explore .
" What 's particularly encouraging is that this research could one day lead to drugs that can block pain locally at the tumour site - which could ultimately lead to more effective pain relief with fewer side effects . "

UK in 5th , behind only the most ardent dictatorships
Steve Watson
Infowars.net
Tuesday , May 12 , 2009
A study designed to rank countries in terms of how aggressively they monitor their populations electronically , has placed the US as 6th and the UK as 5th on a global index .
The two countries lag behind only China , North Korea , Belarus and Russia in terms of governmental surveillance .
The report , titled The Electronic Police State , ( PDF link ) was compiled from information available from different organizations such as the Electronic Privacy Information Center , Reporters Without Borders , Freedom House , the Ludwig von Mises Institute and The Heritage Foundation .
52 countries were rated on 17 criteria with regard to how far down the line they are toward a total electronic police state .
The study was undertaken by a private company called “ CryptoHippie “ , which specializes in privacy technologies .
“ In an Electronic Police State , every surveillance camera recording , every e-mail you send , every Internet site you surf , every post you make , every check you write , every credit card swipe , every cell phone ping … are all criminal evidence , and they are held in searchable databases , for a long , long time , ” the report states .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
“ Whoever holds this evidence can make you look very , very bad whenever they care enough to do so .
You can be prosecuted whenever they feel like it – the evidence is already in their database , ” the report continues .
“ Perhaps you trust that your ruler will only use his evidence archives to hurt bad people .
Will you also trust his successor ?
Do you also trust all of his subordinates , every government worker and every policeman ? ”
“ If some leader behaves badly , will you really stand up to oppose him or her ?
Would you still do it if he had all the e-mails you sent when you were depressed ?
Or if she has records of every porn site you ’ve ever surfed ?
Or if he knows every phone call you ’ve ever made ?
Or if she knows everyone you ’ve ever sent money to ? ” the report asks .
“ This system has n’t yet reached its full shape , but all of the basics are in place and it is not far from complete in some places , ” .
( Article continues below )
The report contains a colour coded world map , with red representing the most advanced electronic police states , orange for strongly developing electronic police states and yellow for nations that are further behind in terms of surveillance :
It is no surprise to see the UK ranking higher than the US , with it ’s estimated 4.5 million CCTV cameras , it ’s active DNA database , and given that the British government has openly announced the fact that it wants the authority to monitor and store all phone calls , text messages and emails , a practice already strongly rumoured to be in operation .
The 17 criteria that were used to define an electronic police state are listed below :
Daily documents :
How much is required day - to - day for residents to present state - issued identity documents or registration .
Border issues :
What is demanded for a border entry .
Financial tracking :
The state ’s ability to search and record financial transactions .
Gag orders :
The penalties for revealing to someone else the state is searching their records .
Anti-crypto laws : Bans on cryptography .
Constitutional protections : Either a lack of protections or someone overriding them .
Data storage :
The state ’s ability to record and keep what it uncovers .
Data search :
The processes to search through data .
ISP data retention : The demand for ISPs to save customers ’ records .
Telephone data retention : States ’ requirements for communications companies to record and save records .
Cell phone records :
The saving and using of cell phone users ’ records .
Medical records : Demands from states that medical records retain information .
Enforcement :
The state ’s ability to use force ( SWAT teams ) to seize someone .
Habeus corpus : Either an absence of such rights or someone overriding them .
Police - Intel barrier : the absence of a barrier between police and intelligence organizations .
Covert hacking : State operatives meddling in data on private computers covertly .
Loose warrants : Warrants that are being issued without careful review of police claims by a truly independent judge .
The countries making up the top ten in the rankings are Singapore , Israel , France and Germany .
Following the top ten the rankings are : 11 . Malaysia , 12 .
Ireland , 13 .
United Kingdom , Scotland , 14 .
Netherlands , 15 .

Arlen Specter lists a handful of examples in the past where the CIA has withheld key information from Congress .
Specter sympathetic to Pelosi on CIA
Sen .
Arlen Specter appeared to side with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi Wednesday in her spat with the CIA over harsh interrogation methods , saying the agency has a history of being less than forthright with Congress .
“ The CIA has a very bad record when it comes - I was about to say [ being ] candid , but that 's too mild - to honesty .
It goes back a long time , ” Specter said in a speech before the American Law Institute at a Washington hotel .

The Republican - turned - Democrat listed a handful of examples in the past where the CIA has withheld key information from Congress , including an instance when a CIA operative knowingly passed along to the White House “ tainted ” information about the then - Soviet Union and the agency ’s statements about its ties to the Iran - Contra scandal during the Reagan administration .
During my tenure as chairman of the Intelligence Committee during the 104th Congress , there were repeated instances where we did n’t get information that was there , ” Specter said .
" It 's a real problem as to how you get the information . "
After his remarks , Specter said he spoke about the controversy because it fit into his speech 's theme about the growth of executive power .
Still , his comments were consistent with arguments that Pelosi and her lieutenants have been making for days .
Since becoming a Democrat last month , Specter has made offhand remarks that have angered Democrats , but on Wednesday he seemed to be clearly on the speaker 's side .

After the CIA disclosed documents showing that Pelosi had been briefed in 2002 that an Al Qaeda leader had been waterboarded , she publicly accused the agency of lying to Congress .
Republicans have pounced on the spat in an attempt to tarnish her credibility , and Specter said it was " unfortunate " that some have sought to make a " political game " of the controversy .
“ The current controversy involving Speaker Pelosi and the CIA is very unfortunate in my view because it politicizes the issue and takes away attention from what ought to be the focus – and that is how does the Congress get accurate information from the CIA , ” Specter said .
Much of his speech was devoted to the controversy , and he cited CIA Director Leon Panetta 's defense of the agency that its policy is not to mislead Congress .
" That does n't mean they are giving out all the information , " Specter said , adding there could be a " great reluctance " for the CIA to say too much .
Specter said he suggested the CIA briefings with lawmakers should be recorded in the future so there are no disputes over what was said .
Pelosi , whom he called " reliable , " should be " entitled to have as much light on this as possible , " including the release of CIA notes on her briefing , Specter said .
Asked if the CIA had lied to her , Pelosi told reporters the agency had done so over the use of harsh interrogation techniques , and mislead Congress in the process .
On Wednesday , Specter sought to soften Pelosi ’s remarks .
“ Speaker Pelosi said she was misinformed , and that ’s immediately translated to calling them a liar , ” Specter said .
“ A little different , in fact a lot different . ”

VANCOUVER - Today was the last day of the federal Parliament 's spring session , and that means a number of bills are now new laws .
Not as many new laws , though , as the Conservatives wanted .
Members of the House of Commons took off last Friday after having approved the government spending estimates following an agreement between Prime Minister Stephen Harper and Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff .
But as is their custom , the oft - maligned Senators put in a couple extra days ' work before the summer recess in order to process the pile of legislation forwarded by the House over the past few weeks .
Today , the Senate approved legislation to update the federal incorporation system for non-profit organizations and to create a new legal framework for laboratories that work with disease - causing organisms or toxins .
Yesterday , the Senate passed laws to update liability standards in marine accidents and to create new Criminal Code offences related to drive - by shootings and other violent offences associated with organized crime .
And , of course , the Senate stamped their approval on the two most essential bills , the Appropriation Acts that will keep money flowing from the federal treasury to government - funded programs and the public service over the next few months .
Other new laws passed in June include amendments to the Customs Act , the Judges Act and the Arctic Waters Pollution Prevention Act ; an act to implement a free trade agreement with Peru ; an act to increase fines and improve enforcement of offences under federal environmental legislation ; and acts to implement agreements with the Maa - Nulth First Nations of B.C. and the Cree - Naskapi of Quebec ( among others ) .
But all that was not enough for the federal Justice Minister , Rob Nicholson .
On Monday , he held a press conference to berate the “ Liberal - dominated Senate ” for not rushing through other government bills recently passed by the House .
In particular , Nicholson highlighted Bill C - 15 , which would create mandatory minimum sentences for a number of drug crimes .
When the bill was introduced in February , following a series of gang - related shootings in the Lower Mainland , Nicholson said it represented the government “ fighting back against gangs and other organized criminal groups . ”
The alleged purpose of yesterday 's press conference was to urge the Senate to pass the bill before today 's recess , even though the Conservative Senators who control the chamber 's schedule had not brought it up for debate until this week .
( The Senate received the bill from the House on June 9 . )
However , as Gloria Galloway of The Globe and Mail noted in a column this morning , it was really about kicking off a new effort by the Conservatives to brand the Liberals as “ soft on crime , ” now that the two parties are apparently in agreement about the economy .
Who says we are n't going to have a summer election campaign ?
Amelia Bellamy - Royds reports for The Tyee .
OLD BRIDGE -- A drama teacher at Old Bridge High School pleaded guilty today to having a four - month sexual relationship with one of her students last year .
Lisa Glide , 35 , of Howell Township , tearfully admitted to Superior Court Judge Frederick De Vesa in New Brunswick that she had sexual relations with one of her male students twice .
But under questioning by her attorney , Michael Nolan , she said neither time was on high school property .
Glide pleaded guilty to fourth degree endangering the welfare of a child and faces up to 364 days in the Middlesex County jail when she is sentenced in August .
She also agreed to give up her teaching certificate and not reapply for a teaching certificate in any public school New Jersey .
The agreement with the state also calls for Glide to be placed on up to five years of probation and receive mental health counseling as required by her probation officer .
During her probation , she can have only supervised contact with males under the age of 18 .
In return for the guilty plea , the state agreed to drop a second - degree sexual assault charge and reduce the degree of the endangering charge from third to fourth .
Middlesex County Assistant Prosecutor Christie Bevacqua said the state agreed to the reduced charges because " the victim wanted to be spared having to testify . "
Bevacqua said the victim , who was 17 at the time and graduated from the high school last June , " was fine with this plea agreement . "
Glide , who organized the high school 's plays , was arrested in December .
She began teaching at the high school in September 2004 and was suspended after her arrest .
The relationship with the student took place between February and May of last year .
Before working for Old Bridge , Glide was employed with the Marlboro Township schools from 2001 to 2004 , and worked for Jersey City schools from 2000 to 2001 , authorities said .
She began her teaching career as a substitute in Weehawken in 1999 and 2000 .
She was earning $ 50,943 annually as a teacher in Old Bridge .
She majored in theater at Montclair State University and studied acting at the Lee Strasberg Theater Institute .
In a December 2005 article in The Suburban , a weekly newspaper in Old Bridge , Glide said she appeared on the soap operas " One Life to Live " and " All My Children , " and was on an episode of the television drama , " Dawson 's Creek . "
She gave the interview after directing the high school 's production of Neil Simon 's " Plaza Suite . "
The Governator is back .
And this time , he takes no prisoners :
Declaring that “ California ’s day of reckoning is here , ” Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger said today the state should turn its dire budget straits into an opportunity to make government more efficient .
Speaking to a rare mid-year joint session of the Legislature and other constitutional officers , Schwarzenegger acknowledged the billions of dollars in spending cuts he has proposed to close a $ 24.3 billion hole in the budget will be devastating to millions of Californians .
“ People come up to me all the time , pleading ‘ governor , please do n’t cut my program , ' ” he said .
“ They tell me how the cuts will affect them and their loved ones .
I see the pain in their eyes and hear the fear in their voice , the lamentations of their women **.
It ’s an awful feeling .
But we have no choice .
“ Our wallet is empty .
Our bank is closed .
Our credit is dried up . ”
Governor Schwarzenegger was elected in a pretty rare phenomenon , the recall .
His predecessor , Gray Davis , had worked long and hard to make a mess of Sacramento ’s business , and was generally a smarmy and unlikable guy .
When Davis attempted to hike a very public tax , the vehicle license fee , voters who were already upset with Sacramento pushed him out of office .
Schwarzenegger was elected to be a reformer .
He was ( fairly ) seen as outside the political process , and carrying the force of popularity that would allow him to shake things up .
He appealed to a lot of voters who professed small - l libertarian leanings *** , as he billed himself more as a fiscal conservative and social moderate / liberal .
He was seen as having the political capital and bipartisan likability to actually go in and clean up the mess .
He tried to enact reforms , and was rebuffed by the entrenched power structure .
Given California ’s ballot proposition , he decided to pull an end - run around the legislature and “ take the agenda directly to the people . ”
He called a special election , putting propositions including redistricting , spending restraints , and others directly up for the people of California to enact .
And he was rebuffed spectacularly in that election .
Ever since then , he ’s been a lame - duck governor , unable to really do anything but show up on TV at every wildfire explaining how much he cares .
He ’s been ineffective and the legislature has run roughshod , failing to restrain spending at every turn .
I think , though , that Schwarzenegger may be feeling ready for a resurgence .
He was rebuffed for trying to rein in the legislature , and the legislature predictably went on to make a mess of things .
I ’m not sure he ’ll necessarily come out with an explicit “ I told ya so ” , but you can be sure that will be a part of his sell .
California did n’t listen when he tried to hit the brakes back in the boom years around 2005 , but perhaps they ’ll understand that folly now that the state is in shambles .
California is a mess .
It was n’t politically possible to clean it up during the boom .
I ’m not sure what incentive it will require to get Schwarzenegger to try to gain back his political capital and start slashing and burning through the legislature , but if revenge motivates him , I ’ll take it .
Hat Tip : SoCal Real Estate Bubble Blog
* Post title from here .
** Okay , so I added that bit .
*** Many of us more ideological libertarians and conservatives tended to support Tom McClintock in the recall election , largely because his record as a force for smaller government was much more well - known and well - trusted than Schwarzenegger ’s .
In the end , I do n’t recall which of them I voted for ; I may have pragmatically chosen Arnold out of worry that the Democrat be elected .

Tauss - folgendes hatte ich gestern schon in einem anderen Forumgepostet - wo es um die Debatte - Tausunschuldig / schuldig / Bärendienst für die Piraten ging .
Irgendwie hat es mich genervt und ich habe mich selbst mal eineStunde lang rumgegoogelt .
Das im Anhang ist der Text aus dem Beitrag den ich ins andere Forumgesetzt habe - die [ quote ] tags lasse ich mal drin - das sind dieZitate aus den jeweils angegeben links .
Vielleicht hilft es hier jemanden , sich ein Bild davon zu machen .
Fürmich steht fest , das hier mehr gelaufen ist als das was wir normalosvorgekaut bekommen haben .
Mich hält die Tauss Geschichte jedenfallsnicht davon ab Pirat zu werden .
Ab zum Text :------------Ich hab jetzt ca. 1 h im Netz recherchiert .
Das ganze ist echtkomisch - ja er gibt das ganze zu - wer die Stellungsnahme lesen willhierhttp://daten.tauss.de/StellungnahmeTauss110309.pdfDarin ist der folgende Teil : [ quote ] da ich mich in dieser speziellen Frage etwa aufdas BKA nicht verlassen wollte :
Nicht erst seit dem bereits erwähntenAuftritt des BKAPräsidentenim Deutschen Bundestag und meiner Teilnahme bei der Herbsttagung 2007in Wiesbaden zu diesem
Thema , hat sich bei mir der Eindruckverfestigte , dass das BKAdas Thema Kinderpornographie auch dazu nutzt , neue Kompetenzen undZuständigkeiten politisch durchzusetzen .
Längst ist das BKA hierPartei und keineneutrale Beratungsinstanz mehr für die Abgeordneten des DeutschenBundestages [ / quote ] der mit stutzig werden lässt .
Dazu folgendes .
Tauss ist glaubwürdig was seine Einstellung zumÜberwachungsstaat und Internetzensur anbelangt .
Die ersten Einträgeals Beleg finden sich in der TAZ schon 1998 : http://www.taz.de/index.php?id=archivseite&dig=1998/12/01/a0067daraus:[quote]Schlimmer als der deutsche LauschangriffDie EU will alles von den Bürgern wissen : Nicht nur Kontonummer , Paßwörter und GebührBonn ( taz ) - Der neue satellitengestützte Telefonverkehr und dasInternet läßt die Fahnder der europäischen Länder erschauern .... Ein am Wochenende bekanntgewordener Entwurf des Rates derEuropäischen Union sieht europaweit den Zugriff derSicherheitsbehörden auf Kontoverbindungsdaten , die Gebührenabrechnungdes Überwachten und sogar den Zugriff auf Paßwörter und andereZugangscodes vor ....( dazu ) : Kritik äußert auch der SPD - Medienexperte [ b ] Jörg Taus [ / b] an den Überwachungsplänen .
Der Enfopol - Entwurf stelle alledeutschen Bestimmungen zum Lauschangriff in den Schatten .
Deneuropäischen Polizeibehörden würde " ein demokratisch undnationalstaatlich nicht mehr kontrollierbares Instrument an die Handgegeben " .
Das Forum InformatikerInnen für Frieden undgesellschaftliche Verantwortung moniert : " Damit wird denSicherheitsbehörden prinzipiell die Möglichkeit jeglicherManipulation elektronischer Kommunikation eröffnet . " ( und ) Kritiker Taus meint , der geplante " Zugriff , wann immer dasÜberwachungsobjekt an das Internet angeschlossen ist " , ließe sichunter deutschem EU - Vorsitz am ehesten " wegkriegen " [ / quote ]
Also schon 1998 war Tauss ein Gegner der behördlichenBegehrlichkeiten für Überwachung .
Dies geht auch nach 2001 so weiter : http://www.chip.de/news/Experte-Keine-strengere-Internet-ueberwachung_34134537.htmlZitat ( news vom 19.09.2001 !!!) [ quote ]
Experte : Keine strengere Internet - ÜberwachungDie nach den Anschlägen in den USA geforderte schärfere Überwachungdes Internets wird von Jörg Taus , Experte für Neue Medien der SPD , abgelehnt .
" Mehr Internet - Überwachung hätte die Terroristen nichtdaran gehindert , ins World Trade Center zu fliegen " , sagte Tauss ineinem Gespräch mit der Nachrichtenagentur Reuters . [/ quote] 2007 war

Sperrverfügungen nur auf gesetzlicher Grundlage und alsUltima RatioTja und dann kam der 5.03 - zufälligerweise wird zur selben Zeit dasThema Zensur und Kinderpornographie diskutiert und Tauss ist auchdabei - wie passend .
Dazu das was mich an der Aktion extrem stört - die Art und weise wiehier Infos an die Presse schon vorab launciert wurden : Zitat : [ quote ] Bereits Minuten nach der Hausdurchsuchung wartete Spiegel Online mitder Schlagzeile " Ermittlungen wegen Kinderpornografie gegenSPD - Abgeordneten Tauss " auf .
Detailgetreu wurde hier schon über dieZusammenhänge , über den Bremerhavener , durch den man auf Taussaufmerksam geworden war , sowie über die Verdachtsmomente berichtet .
Die Staatsanwaltschaft bestätigte die Untersuchung , insofern stelltsich die Frage : Wer hat hier Spiegel Online so detailverliebtinformiert , dass die Beamten quasi kaum die Wohnung verlassen hatten , als die Meldung online ging ? [/ quote ]
Auch Spiegelfechter schreibt einiges zu dem Vorgang als solches : http://www.spiegelfechter.com/wordpress/493/die-affare-tauss-wie-demontiert-man-einen-datenschutzer(Auf dem Artikel ist auch der Zwischenruf ( video ) von Tauss zu sehen - das im Feb. 2009 aufgenommen wurde .

Oh und noch ein spannendes Detail , auf das mich dankenswerterweiseFelix hinwies :
Tauss hat einen Twitterfeed , wo er immer mit" TwitterFon " twittert , einer Twitter - Anwendung fürs Iphone .

Und das Iphone kann gar keine MMSsen verschicken .
ACH .
Auch ansonsten ist das mit der MMS unglaubwürdig .

Einige Gedanken zum Abschluss des Themas : http://geisteswelt.blogsome.com/2009/03/08/die-verlorene-ehre-des-jorg-tauss/Ach ja -
Tauss war übrigens schonmal 2004 verleumdet : http://deutschlandpolitik.wordpress.com/2009/03/07/jorg-tauss-wurde-bereits-2004-verleumdet/Uff - habe fertig - das ganze diente mir aber als eigenen Überblick - ich halte meist nichts von Verschwöhrungstheorien ABER : Irgendwas passt hier nicht : Tauss kann man als Experten bezeichnen - der schafft schon seit über10 Jahren im bereich " neue Medien " hat Kontakte zum Chaos ComputerClub und kennt sich wohl mit Verschlüsselung und Co. aus - und sojemand hat das Material grade mal so auf ner Disk und hortet die( seine Stellungsnahme ) über ein Jahr lang ?
Er benutzt sein ( oder ein ) Telefon ohne Verschlüsselung odersonstwas ?
In seinem Besitz wird EINE Cd gefunden sowie 23 Bilder auf demHandy ?!
( soviel zu dem Konsumenten vorwurf ) Der Tausch fand vor fast einem Jahr statt - wird aber jetzt erstaufgedeckt und die Staatsanwaltschaft ermittelt GENAU DANN WENN ES INDIE HEIße Phase eines Zensurgesetzes via Kipo geht ?
Wer informierte hier die Presse so genau ?
Wieso wurde seine Immunität ruck zuck vom Schäubeles Schwiegersohnaufgehoben - bei anderen fällen ( CDU Politiker ) wurde das nichtgemacht ?
Er spuckt seit 10 Jahren dem BKA in die Suppe ( siehe ganz oben seineStellungsnahme ) und wird letztlich von diesen auch ausgebremst .
Ich vertrete übrigens genau seine
These das das BKA zur neuen geheimPolizei mit gigantischen Befugnissen ausgebaut werden soll .
Da gab eszur Vorratsdatenspeicherung schon Rechtsexperten die bescheinigtendas das BKA schon jetzt mehr Befugnisse hat als das amerikanischeFBI .
Ich sag nicht das er unschuldig war - aber es ist wirklich nichtsauber - steckt mehr dahinter als er selbst sagt ?
SeineStellungsnahme ist natürlich merkwürdig - und jetzt doch eine großeVerschwöhrung : Wurde er dazu gezwungen ?
( ok nicht ganz ernst gemeint - oder doch ) - keine Ahnung .
Nur mal so zum Nachdenken ....
PS : Ich bin kein Leumund für Tauss - eigentlich habe ich mich nie mitihm beschäftigt ( bis jetzt ) und kann auch nichts dazu sagen ob er gutoder schlecht ist - aber er hält mich nicht davon ab Mitglied bei denPiraten zu werden - nicht nach dem was ich da oben alles ergoogelthabe .
Ich glaube mittlerweile nicht das er Kipo Fan ist , er istvielleicht naiv gewesen ( dumm ist er wohl nicht ) - aber auch daspasst nicht ...
The winner of the May 27 $ 232 million jackpot has finally come forward .
Neal Wanless , a 23 - year old rancher from South Dakota , claimed the 9th largest Powerball jackpot won in the history of the multi-state lottery game .
Wanless appeared on June 5 with South Dakota Lottery officials at an award ceremony in Pierre after claiming the $ 232.1 million he won .
Wanless chose to receive the jackpot as a one - time cash prize of
$ 118,005,530 .
After federal tax withholding , he will receive a prize
payment $ 88,504,147 .
That does n’t include the $ 100 he won on the same ticket .
The jackpot - winning numbers , he said , represent the day and month of family members ’ birthdays .
The lucky combination was the fourth of five plays on a $ 5 ticket .
The winning ticket was purchased at the Ampride store in Winner .
Wanless and his family stop at the store when they make the 35 - mile trip to Winner to buy feed .
On the night of Wednesday , May 27 , Neal joked with his parents , Arlen
and Nancy , about his Powerball tickets and needing to drive to Pierre
the next day “ to deposit a big check . ”
He did n’t discover until the
next morning that the whimsical remark would prove foretelling .
Neal checked the Lottery ’s Web site for the winning numbers .
“ I was in shock , ” he said .
“ I do n’t remember what I said . ”
His dad remembers .
“ He whispered real quiet ‘ we won , ' ” Arlen said .
The rest of that day is somewhat of a blur for the family .
They told a
few friends and family , and contacted the Lottery to figure out what
needed to be done next .
“ It ’s just something you do n’t believe could
happen to you , ” Nancy said .
The excitement of winning affected them differently that first night .
“ I slept just fine , ” Neal said .
“ We did n’t , ” his father said , laughing .
They all agree that the experience has been both fun and a bit nerve - racking .
Since then , Neal has kept busy working on the family ranch , some 11
miles east of Mission .
A tractor needed to be picked up from the shop , a baler fixed , and other preparations made to put up hay in coming days .
That ’s just what Neal intends to continue doing .
Ranching , he says , is
something he ’s always dreamed of doing .
“ I just want to go home and
ranch and ride horse and check cows . ”
But , he says he ’s also dreamed of doing it on a little bigger ranch .
While out riding his horse , Eleanor , recently he ’d thought to himself ,
and remarked to Eleanor , that “ It ’d be nice if we could go for a longer
ride than usual on a bigger ranch of our own . ”
No problem .
He could probably buy up a good deal of the land in South Dakota .
What an awesome story .
We congratulate the entire family on this life changing event .
GAMES WE PLAY :
The June 6 Powerball game carries a $ 34 million jackpot .
The June 5 Mega Millions game had no jackpot winner so the June 9 game will offer up a $ 25 million jackpot .
The June 5 winning numbers are 5,20,38,41,52 and the Mega ball is 20 .
4 tickets matched the first five numbers .
They were bought in California ( the ticket is worth $ 555,415 ) , Maryland ( $ 250,000 ) , Michigan ( $ 250,000 ) and Ohio ( $ 250,000 ) .
Big news in Europe .
No one won the June 5 Euro Millions jackpot so the jackpot rolls up to a very tidy 58 million euros ( $ 81 million , U.S. ) on June 12 .
The winning numbers on June 5 are 11,19,26,35,40 and the lucky stars are 2,5 .
Good luck , players , wherever you are in the world .
SEP public meeting
Capitalist breakdown and the need for a socialist Europe
30 May 2009
Should the future of Europe be left in the hands of the financial aristocracy and its representatives in the European Union bureaucracy and existing European governments , then disaster is inevitable .
It is time for workers to intervene in developments and take the fate of society into their own hands .
This requires the building of a new party :
• a party that openly states that capitalism has failed and must be replaced by a socialist society with democratic control of the economy ;
• a party that fights against nationalism and xenophobia and does not permit the ruling classes to plunge Europe into war and dictatorship — as was the case in 1914 and 1939 .
Meeting details :
Sunday , June 7 , 3:30 p.m .
Main Hall , Friends ’ Meeting House
( behind Manchester Central Library )
6 Mount Street , Manchester , M2 5NS
Guest speakers :
David North , SEP national chairman , United States
Ulrich Rippert , SEP national secretary , Germany
Chris Marsden , SEP national secretary , UK
Given the current housing crisis , there is wide support for measures to make it easier for homeowners to modify their mortgages .
That is understandable .
Nobody likes seeing the wave of foreclosures .
Plus , mortgage modifications may help stabilize home values .
But in the rush to do something , Congress is showing a regrettable willingness to adopt constitutionally suspect legislation that runs roughshod over the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution , which prohibits the taking of private property without just compensation .

Classify this under news of the weird .
A Russian scientist claims that aliens downed the Tunguska meteorite 101 years ago to protect our planet from devastation .
Yuri Lavbin says he found unusual quartz crystals at the site of the massive Siberian explosion .
Ten crystals have holes in them , placed so the stones can be united in a chain , and other have drawings on them .
“ We do n’t have any technologies that can print such kind of drawings on crystals , ” said Lavbin .
“ We also found ferrum silicate that can not be produced anywhere , except in space . ”
OK , just a few holes in this story , too .
The Tunguska Event was a powerful explosion that occurred in an uninhabited and desolate area near the Tunguska River in Russia , on June 30 , 1908 .
Although the cause of the explosion is the subject of debate , it is commonly believed to have been caused by the explosion of a large meteoroid or comet fragment , occurring the in Earth ’s atmosphere about 5 – 10 kilometers ( 3–6 miles ) high .
The blast flattened an estimated 60 million trees over 2,150 square kilometers , but no crater or “ smoking gun ” meteorite has ever been found .
Different studies have yielded varying estimates of the object ’s size , but there is general agreement that it was a few tens of meters across .
A couple of expeditions have gone to the remote site of the crash .
Lavbin says that one expedition located the unusual crystals .
While I ’m not a chemist , I could n’t find any information on “ ferrum silicate . ”
Seemingly , it does n’t exist .
One small , nondescript photo accompanied Lavbin ’s claims , published by the Macedonian International News Agency .
This is n’t the first time a UFO has been claimed to associated with the Tunguska event .
Another report from 2004 said a scientific expedition to the site found blocks of an extraterrestrial technical device , and one 50 - kilogram piece of the stone was brought to the city of Krasnoyarsk to be studied and analyzed .
No subsequent reports or analysis could be located during an internet search .
Other claims of exploding alien spaceships or alien weapons detonating to “ save the Earth from an imminent threat ” appear to originate from a science fiction story “ A Visitor From Outer Space ” written by Soviet engineer Alexander Kazantsev in 1946 , in which a nuclear - powered Martian spaceship , seeking fresh water from a lake blew up in mid-air .
This story was was said to be inspired by Kazantsev ’s visit to Hiroshima in late 1945 .
Many events in Kazantsev ’s tale were subsequently confused with the actual occurrences at Tunguska .
A “ reveal - all ” book was published in 1976 ( The Fire Came By ) but was written by two television drama critics — so much for a scientific background .
In 1998 the television series The Secret KGB UFO Files was broadcast on Turner Network Television , and referred to the Tunguska event as “ the Russian Roswell ” and claimed that crashed UFO debris had been recovered from the site .
However , not one proponent of the Tunguska / UFO hypothesis have ever been able to provide any significant evidence for their claims .
Lavbin says the stones , when put together form a map , and might be part of a navigational system of a spaceship .
But Lavbin says what proves his hypothesis is a strange portrait of a strange person on one of the stones .
Hmm , strange looking person on a stone …. sounds like …. pareidolia .
Check out the Bad Astronomer ’s take on that phenomenon .
Just as in any other UFO claim , this one fails to deliver any evidence .

School districts across the state are slashing summer school to deal with the state financial cuts .
Los Angeles Unified School District officials announced today that all summer school classes are being canceled at elementary and middle schools , and only credit recovery courses will be offered at high schools .
The reductions were prompted by the district 's budget deficit , which calls for $ 131 million in new cuts by June 30 and up to $ 273 million next year after voters overwhelmingly rejected a package of state ballot measures earlier this month .
Once the measures failed , state legislators were left grappling with a $ 21.3 billion deficit and are considering cutting $ 5.3 billion from public school districts and community colleges over the next 13 months .
L.A. Unified is not alone .
According to a recent survey by the California State PTA , nearly 41 % of parent - teacher organizations around the state report cuts to summer school .
Other districts reducing or eliminating summer offerings include San Carlos , Petaluma and Mount Diablo .
Community colleges are feeling the pinch as well , with several .
including the Los Angeles Community College District and the College of the Sequoias , cutting summer sessions popular with high school students looking to get ahead on their coursework .

Chelsea have conceded defeat in their pursuit of Kaka with the Brazilian due to be confirmed as a Real Madrid player for a world record £ 56.2 m on Monday , leaving the Premier League club 's attention fixed on Bayern Munich 's Franck Ribéry and David Villa of Valencia as they attempt a marquee summer signing of their own .
Kaka , who is in Brazil preparing for his country 's forthcoming World Cup qualifiers , is understood to have agreed terms with Real and , just as significantly , the Spanish club have agreed a commission fee with the player 's father and agent , Bosco Leite .
There were reports that Chelsea had formalised their long - standing interest with a £ 73.5 m bid but the London club issued a statement denying any offer had been made .
" We have never made an offer to Milan for Kaka and , therefore , not one at this extraordinary level , " said a spokesman .
" As a consequence we have not discussed a salary with the player either .
Any reports to the contrary are totally untrue . "
Indeed it is understood that Kaka , despite his public utterances , had actually informed team - mates at Milan by late on Tuesday night that he is to leave the club for Madrid to become the returning president Florentino Pérez 's first eye - catching signing of his second spell in charge .
The prospect of missing out on the former world player of the year will come as a blow for the new Chelsea manager , Carlo Ancelotti , who worked with Kaka at San Siro , but also to the club 's owner , Roman Abramovich .
Yet their interest serves as a statement of intent that the oligarch is prepared to spend heavily this summer in a throwback to the lavish first few years at Stamford Bridge .
There is interest in Milan 's young Brazilian striker , Alexandre Pato , though the Rossoneri will be resistant to selling another of their younger attacking players .
Pato himself said today that he wished to remain at Milan .
Instead , Chelsea are likely to focus their attentions on Villa and Ribéry , who had been expected to favour a move to Real should he leave Bayern Munich .
Now that the Spanish club have secured Kaka , and with interest in Manchester United 's Cristiano Ronaldo maintained , the France international appears less of an obvious option .
Ancelotti expressed his admiration for the 26 - year - old in his autobiography , published last week , and has been in regular contact with Chelsea 's head of youth development and scouting , Frank Arnesen , in recent days .
The new manager is believed to have visited Cobham for the first time today .
Bayern , too , will be resistant to losing their creative inspiration .
Their general manager , Uli Hoeness , has discussed Ribéry 's future with the club 's new coach , Louis van Gaal , and stressed today that the player is not for sale .
" Van Gaal really wants to keep him , " he said .
" We will not let Ribéry go .
There will be inquiries for Ribéry in the next four to six weeks , I 'm sure .
We will be polite but we will not negotiate .
We are not going to celebrate on the telephone when somebody offers a certain amount . "
The pursuit of Villa is just as complicated .
The striker is likely to be made available by Valencia , who are heavily in debt and failed to qualify for the Champions League , yet he has made no secret of his desire to remain in Spain .
Much may depend upon whether Barcelona lodge a bid for his services .
Chelsea are pursuing other targets just as wholeheartedly , with the teenage Manchester City striker Daniel Sturridge , a free agent having failed to agree a new contract at Eastlands , expected to join along with the CSKA Moscow midfielder Yuri Zhirkov , who can also play at left - back .
The club 's interest in Arsenal 's Emmanuel Adebayor is unlikely to be followed up , however , after they offered Didier Drogba a new three - year contract to remain at Stamford Bridge .
Another of Chelsea 's stalwart players , Ricardo Carvalho , is expected to rejoin Jose Mourinho at Internazionale after confirming that he is " open to offers " to leave London after five years .
The prospects of Ancelotti being accompanied by his assistant at San Siro , Filippo Galli , appeared to be receding tonight with the Italian considering a proposal to remain at Milan on improved terms .
One of 11 men charged with murdering loyalist leader Tommy English has received High Court permission to attend a religious ministry in England .
Philip Laffin , 31 , was granted a bail variation to take part in a three - day course next month .
Laffin has already surrendered his passport and will travel to the gathering in Leicestershire by boat .
The men are charged in connection with the assassination of Mr English , a high - ranking UDA member .
The 40 - year - old victim was gunned down in front of his wife at their home in Newtownabbey , near north Belfast , in 2000 during a violent feud with the rival UVF .
Laffin , of Bridge Street , Antrim , denies the charge against him , which is based on so - called supergrass evidence supplied by Newtownabbey brothers David and Robert Stewart .
Prison ministry
They have pleaded guilty to aiding and abetting in the murder , and made statements which allegedly implicate the other suspects .
During an earlier bail application the court was told that Laffin had found God , taken part in missionary work in Africa and been involved in Christian prison ministry .
But with the prosecution alleging that witnesses in the case have been subjected to intimidation , he was warned about his conduct before the variation was granted .
Mr Justice McLaughlin told him " threatening noises " had been made and said he was to be careful about who he contacted .
Meanwhile , another of the murder suspects , alleged police agent Mark Haddock , withdrew a planned High Court bail application .
Lawyers for Haddock , originally from the Mount Vernon area of Belfast , did not disclose why their client no longer wished to proceed .
The Six Ways of Atheism
New Logical Disproofs of the Existence of God

Every so often a book comes along which has the power to change the way you think .
This is not one of them .
It should , however , challenge the way you think — about God , about life , purpose and existence ; and that , I think , makes it worth the read .
More importantly , however , it ’s a book that despite being privately published , Christians ( and those of other faiths ) will need to engage with as it finds its way into bookshops and libraries courtesy of the author ’s decision to send out complimentary copies “ not only to many book retailers but also to practically every public library in … the English speaking world ” .
Berg sets out to demonstrate that God — or , to be more precise , a particular concept of God which he insists is the only possible concept of God — simply cannot exist if we follow the tenets of Logic ( his capitalisation ) .
He presents a fascinating but ultimately futile series of six arguments against God — summarised at thesixwaysofatheism.com — with which I personally cannot but agree : the God whom Berg denies does not exist .
Berg ’s God — or , as he prefers , his candidate or potential God — is “ eternal , omnipotent , omniscient , omnipresent , consciously controlling , supremely good , our ultimate creator and our purpose giver ” ( p.14 ) .
Having dismissed any other concept of God as not worthy of the designation and certainly not worthy of our worship , he then goes on to argue that since it is impossible for any single entity to exhibit all of these characteristics , God quite simply cannot exist .
In a nutshell :
even the greatest conceivable entity in the Universe ( let alone the greatest entity that actually does exist in the Universe ! ) must necessarily fall short of being God. ( p.124 )
— to which I say a wholehearted Amen !
Rather than rant Dawkins - style , Berg ’s approach is more calm and collected but with a tendency towards petulance as he exalts logic to the status of the godhead that he simultaneously denies :
… I deny that anything can exist contrary to Logic .
I doubt anything can exist with that degree of inconsistency .
Speaking personally , I also doubt that any real entity can exist completely immaterially .
In any case we actually know nothing of the supposed alternative principles upon which God operates .
That is merely human conjecture .
Indeed it is irrational conjecture devised by the religious to suit the religious without any foundation at all beyond the imagination of some humans .
Faith in religious terms is generally only a posh word for the reckless imaginings of ideas that cannot sensibly , let alone rationally , be believed in . ( p.69 )
Further on , failing to recognise his own reasoning as itself based on “ nothing but human conjecture ” — and unfortunately coming over rather like a child saying , “ So there ! ” — he asserts :
What is beyond doubt is that I have now provided absolute and indubitable disproof of the existence of a monotheistic God which no objection can overcome .
Therefore like it or not , make of it what you will , monotheism is wrong and atheism is right ! ( p.143 )
Putting issues of tone and style aside , however , the question remains : does the cumulative force of Berg ’s arguments genuinely represent the decisive proof against God ’s existence that he claims ?
The answer is , in my view at least , yes ; and I also think it matters not one whit .
Quite simply because Berg , like Dawkins before him and in common with so many other aggressive atheists , has fallen into the trap of regarding God as an entity within the universe .
As he rightly insists , such an entity cannot and does not exist , has never existed beyond the human imagination .
The God who is , however : that ’s another story .
The God who is , who crosses the gulf between humanity and God in the form of Jesus of Nazareth , who dares to take on the impossibility of existence , who walks amongst us and dies at our hands — that God can not be argued into or out of existence .
That God — the living , loving , breathing hot - blooded Word , the Logos , stands for ever against the frozen chill of human logic .
Berg is right in what he affirms : we do indeed know nothing of the alternative principles upon which God operates ; but he is wrong in what he denies : the reality of a God who does not exist within the framework of human experience and comprehension but who chooses to enter that framework .
God does not exist : we do — thank God for that !

The Demonization of Credit Card Companies
( Photo by Omar Omar )
Yesterday both houses of Congress passed the Credit Card Accountability , Responsibility , and Disclosure Act of 2009 ( CARD ) .
It will soon be sent to the desk of the President for his approval .
I said yesterday that I ’m all for regulating abusive practices in any industry .
Yet it does make me wary that the government wants to get involved with literally everything .
I still believe in personal responsibility .
Which brings me to today ’s topic .
I ’m hoping I do n’t get burned at the stake .
I read this amazing article over at brip blap and was inspired .
Why Are We Focusing Only On Credit Card Companies ?
Credit cards are just like any other business operating in America today .
They are profit - maximizing entities designed to provide income and profits to their shareholders ( owners ) .
They provide jobs for thousands of workers across the nation .
Oh , and until recently , it was seen as a good thing to be financing your life , career , or small business on a credit card .
Funny how quickly things change .
Have some credit card companies used deceptive and abusive practices to increase profits ?
Of course .
Have some college students cheated on exams ?
Of course .
Have some baseball players used illegal substances ?
Of course .
It is really easy to use one or two examples in an industry to point the finger and bring the mob of angry protesters to a company ’s door .
Again , I ’m not saying it is n’t deserved in some cases .
Call me naive , but I just do n’t believe that every single person with credit card debt was a victim .
There are some individuals with piles of credit card debt that are also surrounded by new televisions , new computers , new clothes , and new kitchen appliances .
They made choices .
Debt today , stuff today .
Let ’s Lynch Other Industries While We Are At It
So if we ’re going to purge America of all things “ evil ” let ’s take a look at some other industries :
soda companies
alcohol companies
cigarette companies
unhealthy snack food companies
gambling organizations
Hopefully you understand where I ’m going with this .
Why not soda companies ?
I am surrounded by people at work that start drinking “ Diet ” Coke and Dr. Pepper at 7:30 in the morning .
They equate it to coffee .
Yet sodas ( along with many other factors ) have led to an increase in diabetes in this country — and we ’re addicted to it .
Carbonated water with sugar syrup in it .
Mmmmm .
Do n’t get me wrong , I love a good Coke or Barq ’s root beer .
But these things are bad for me .
So why does n’t the government shut them down , too ?
Beer is n’t terribly good for you either and has been implicated in thousands of DUI instances across the country .
Drivers that drive under the influence can kill innocent people .
We should ban beer and wine , too .
I Do n’t Want the Government to Protect Me from Everything
Here ’s the kicker : I ’m responsible for myself .
It all goes back to personal responsibility .
If I use credit cards in a dumb way , then I deserve to pay interest on the purchase .
If I use soda the wrong way then I had best understand I ’m facing diabetes and being unhealthy squarely in the face .
If I use cigarettes I must understand that I am increasing my chances of lung cancer .
What ’s odd is that in some instances instead of banishing the industry entirely our government decides to profit from it as well !
Let ’s just throw a hefty tax on every pack of cigarettes and ignore the other consequences of allowing them to exist .
Where there is high tax revenue the government usually opts to look the other way .
I ’m sort of surprised it did n’t happen in this case as well .
I use credit cards every day .
I carry absolutely no cash with me .
I also do n’t overspend and we stick to our budget .
What ’s the key for me ?
Personal responsibility – a dying concept in America .

On March 12 , 2009 , Re / Max officially dropped their claim against rehava , which stated rehava ’s logo looked too similar to theirs .
It ’s easy to see the logos look nothing alike and in a poll hosted on Charleston .
net , 15,763 vs. 221 voters agreed the logos bear no resemblance .
Over 90,000 people viewed this article about the logos , igniting a groundswell of social media activity and a PR fiasco for Re / Max .
People went ballistic and voiced their outrage at Re / Max , a global real estate giant .
Especially when they saw Adam Scoville , Re / Max ’s legal counsel , explain the logo similarites :
“ First of all , both names start with “ r ” and have logos with accent lines near the letter “ e , ” he said .
“ It goes beyond that , ” Scoville added .
“ If you chop the top off of the ‘h , ’ you ( almost ) have the ‘ m ’ in Re / Max .
The next letter is an ‘ a , ’ and if you take the ‘ v ’ then you have half of an ‘ x . ’ “
Many felt this was simply a petty attempt by a major corporation to put a small business out of business .
Steve deGuzman , Rehava ’s broker - in - charge , said , “ I think they did it because they ’re worried about the future of real estate , and they really know that we might be onto something , ”
rehava has developed a new model for real estate in which they reward home buyers with a rebate for half their commission .
People on Twitter , various bloggers and those who commented on news sites repeatedly slammed Re / Max for their actions , proving just how powerful the voice of the people – and social media – can be .

Massachusetts Scouting for Wind Power Sites to Meet Goal
June 15th , 2009 by Dave Tyler
The state of Massachusetts is hunting for unusual places to put wind turbines as it looks to meet an ambitious goal of producing 2,000 megawatts of windpower by 2020 .
[ social_buttons ]
The Associated Press reports that state officials are encouraging municipal planners to look at using capped landfills as potential wind farm locations .
Plans were also just announced for a military reservation on Cape Cod .
The state is hoping to jump start development , because right now , the AP reports , there are only 11 commercial scale turbines in the state .
But , ther are dozens of smaller ones installed and nearly 200 other projects in various stages of planning .
The most visible of those is the 130 - turbine Cape Wind Project in Nantucket Sound that has been the subject of intense scrutiny .
Other creative projects include one at the Jiminy Peak ski resort , anda small turbine farm in Hancock .
State officials are holding a workshop this Wednesday to encourage local leaders to explore different siting options for wind farms .
Gov. Deval Patrick has said he wants 10 percent of the state ’s energy needs to come from wind by 2020 .
The state is also boosting its green credential by planning to install a EV charging network jointly with Connecticut .

In its earnings for the quarter ending March 31 , Microsoft is showing its first year - over - year drop in revenue since the company went public .
That ’s right , this is its first drop in 23 years .
Redmond , Wash .- based Microsoft said it made $ 13.65 billion in revenue , a decline of 6 percent from the same period last year .
Meanwhile , net income was $ 2.98 billion and the company earned 33 cents per share , representing drops of 32 percent and 30 percent , respectively .
Those numbers fall short of analysts ’ predictions of 39 cents per share , and the news comes just a day after Apple easily beat analyst estimates and reported a healthy year - over - year increase .
Of course , everyone is hurting , especially the web companies that we spend much of our time covering here at VentureBeat , and Microsoft ’s online services division is no exception .
The division reported a 14 percent drop overall , with a 16 percent decline in online ad revenue .
Microsoft also took a big hit in client revenue , a 16 percent fall driven by declines in sales of the PCs that use Microsoft ’s Windows operating system and other software .
There were a few bright spots .
Server and tools revenue grew by 7 percent , and even though the entertainment and devices division is down 2 percent , Xbox 360 sales are up 30 percent from last year .
( Disclosure : I accounted for one of those sales . )
“ We expect the weakness to continue through at least the next quarter , ” said Chief Financial Officer Chris Liddell in a statement .

As if the real political world were n’t already weird and ridiculous enough , over the years a number of satirical and joke political parties have been formed all across the world .
Whether it ’s thanks to their bizarre policy plans , eccentric candidates , or hilarious media stunts , some of these groups have managed to make the headlines , even if they did n’t necessarily win elections .
Here are some of the stranger political parties that may come asking for your vote .
10 . The Rhinoceros Party of Canada
Canada has a long tradition of satirical political parties , and the Rhinoceros Party was probably the most famous of all .
The party was started in 1963 , and for nearly 30 years they consistently made headlines for their media stunts and bizarre campaign promises , which included a solemn vow “ to keep none of our promises . ”
Other parts of the platform included repealing the law of gravity , annexing both the United States and Antarctica , and storing all the country ’s nuclear waste on the floor of the senate , because “ we ’ve been storing political waste there for years . ”
Despite their tongue - in - cheek platform , The Rhinoceros Party was able to garner a surprising number of votes in most elections , finishing second in one Federal election where they nominated a professional clown , and stealing hundreds of votes in another when they ran a candidate with the exact same name as the frontrunner .
9 . The Guns and Dope Party
The Guns and Dope Party was started as a joke in 2003 by cult author Robert Anton Wilson in response to the high - profile California recall election that was eventually won by Arnold Schwarzenegger .
The party was libertarian in philosophy , and worked around Wilson ’s idea that if right wing gun lovers and left wing drug users could come together , they could form an unstoppable majority .
With this in mind , the party ’s unofficial slogan was “ I ’ll tolerate your hobbies if you ’ll tolerate mine . ”
In addition to their pro-gun , pro-drug stance , the party also promised to replace one third of Congress with ostriches , and encouraged voters to write in their own name on the presidential ballot .
8. The Canadian Extreme Wrestling Party
The Canadian Extreme Wrestling Party was formed in Newfoundland in 1999 by a group of amateur and professional wrestlers .
The party is known , among other things , for choosing its leader by staging an 11 - man wrestling battle royale , where the last person standing was declared the winner .
Despite their bizarre methods , the party ’s platform was surprisingly serious , and addressed environmental and economic issues , as well as Canada ’s involvement in NATO .
In 2000 , the Extreme Wrestling Party ran former WWF star Sailor King Moondog
White for a seat in the Canadian parliament , but finished last out of the five candidates in the race .
7. The Miss Great Britain Party
Political campaigns are often jokingly referred to as beauty pageants , especially for the candidates of The Miss Great Britain Party , as nearly every single one of them is a veteran of the Miss Great Britain Beauty Contest .
The party was started by the pageant chairman in 2008 with the slogan “ to make Westminster sexy not sleazy , ” and since then it has fielded candidates in several elections with little success .
The party ’s platform is a mix of serious and satirical policies that include a reworking of the British tax system , equal pay for women , and “ A British Bank Holiday which encourages people to look fabulous for the day . ”
6. The McGillicuddy Serious Party
The McGillicuddy Serious Party operated out of New Zealand for several years in the 80s and 90s , where they ran under the campaign slogan : “ if you want to waste your vote , vote for us . ”
The party was known for its bizarre methods of choosing candidates , which at different points included hand - to - hand combat with swords made out of newspaper , a water balloon fight , and a giant game of musical chairs .
Their policies were even stranger , and were usually proposed in response to the platforms of the major political parties .
Some campaign promises included changing the voting age to include only those under the age of eighteen , mandatory homosexuality for one third of the population , using sand as legal tender , and , of course , a promise to break all their promises .
5 . The Union of Conscientiously Work - Shy Elements
Unlike most of the political parties on this list , the Union of Conscientiously Work - Shy Elements , against all odds , actually managed to win an election .
The party was started as a joke by Danish comedian Jacob Haugaard , who for years used it as a platform to run satirical political campaigns for a seat in Denmark ’s parliament .
Although the party ’s policies included absurd promises like better weather , better Christmas presents , and the right to impotency , in 1994 Haugaard received more than twenty thousand votes and managed to win a seat in parliament .
He served one four - year term before retiring , but while in parliament he did manage to make good on a few of his other campaign promises , like his pledge to increase the amount of bread for ducks in the local park .
4. The Official Monster Raving Loony Party
One of the most well - known and surprisingly successful fringe political parties in England , The Official Monster Raving Loony Party was established by musician and activist David Sutch in the early 80s .
The OMRLP ’s platform is always full of bizarre and satirical political promises , which have included adding the Loch Ness Monster to the endangered species list , banning the use of asterisks , and a pledge to see that Ozzy Osbourne receives a knighthood .
Despite their intentionally frivolous platform , the OMRLP does have a number of serious policy plans , and quite a few of their original ideas , like lowering the voting age to 18 , have since been signed into law .
Over the years , the party has managed to win a number of seats in local government throughout the U.K. , most notably in small town mayoral races , but they have n’t had much success since 2005 .
3. The Surprise Party
The Surprise Party was a party created in 1940 when popular comedian Gracie Allen , the wife of George Burns , ran for President as part of an elaborate media stunt .
Running under the slogans “ it ’s in the bag ” and “ down with common sense , ” Allen even went so far as to go on a whistle - stop tour around the country by train , appearing on radio shows and giving joke policy speeches .
She encouraged Americans to take pride in the massive national debt , joking “ it ’s the biggest in the world , ” and used a live kangaroo named Laura as her official party symbol .
Allen ’s campaign came to a head when she was unexpectedly elected mayor of the town of Menominee , Michigan ( though she did n’t accept ) , and in the actual Presidential election she is estimated to have received at least several hundred write - in votes .
2. The Polish Beer Lovers ’ Party
The Polish Beer Lovers ’ party is probably the most surprisingly successful of all the groups on this list , as they actually managed to win 16 seats in Poland ’s parliament during a hotly contested election in 1991 .
Founded by satirist Janusz Rewi?sk , the party began as a joke campaign to fight alcoholism by promoting drinking beer instead of vodka .
Because Poland was going through a great deal of change following the collapse of communism , political parties were not well established , and the Beer Lovers ’ Party ’s humorous platform and the slogan “ it wo n’t be better but for sure it will be funnier ” managed to gain them some public support .
The Beer Lovers ’ Party eventually split into the Little Beer and Big Beer parties , and later transformed into a legitimate political organization with a serious platform .
1. The Youth International Party
Also known as the Yippies , the Youth International Party was a famously radical political party that operated in the U.S. during the 60s and 70s .
Started by counterculture activists Abbie Hoffman , Jerry Rubin , and Paul Krassner , the organization was known for its theatrical style and anti-authority views .
The Yippies famously ran a pig for President in 1968 , and engineered a number of media stunts , including an attempt to use psychic energy to levitate the Pentagon and an incident at Woodstock where Pete Townshend of The Who had to fight Hoffman off the stage with his guitar .
Although they were originally formed as a political party , the group eventually became best known for these stunts as well as a number of now - infamous protests , including one at the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago that ultimately led to a riot .

Right on schedule , Apple has introduced the third iteration of the iPhone to the public .
The new model , called the iPhone 3GS , is much like the iPhone 3G introduced in 2008 but , as Apple says , the " S " stands for speed .
There are a number of other improvements made to the iPhone 3GS that differentiate it from its less - speedy sibling , but the one thing that will stick out in any phone owner 's mind after playing with one will definitely be its zip .
We have already reviewed the large majority of iPhone OS 3.0 that comes with the iPhone 3GS ( and is available for all past iPhone and iPod touch models ) , so this review will mostly focus on changes to the device that differentiate it from previous versions .
In the box
The iPhone 's packaging keeps getting smaller , but Apple squeezed the same amount of stuff into the 3GS box as the 3G box from 2008 .
Inside is an iPhone , a USB transfer cable , a set of Apple earbuds , and a USB power plug .
The physical design of the 3GS is nearly identical to that of the 3G — unlike the comparison between the original iPhone and 3G , there is virtually no way to tell from one glance the difference between a 3GS and a 3G iPhone .
The iPhone 3GS is on the right , by the way .
The one differentiating factor is that the text on the back of the phone is now silver to match the Apple logo , while on the 3G it 's gray .
Oh , and if you 're like us , your 3G is looking a lot more beaten up .
From left to right : Original iPhone 8GB , iPhone 3G 8GB , iPhone 3GS 32GB .
The iPhone 3GS also comes equipped with an oil - resistant coating on its glass screen — this does not mean that your greasy fingers will magically not affect it , though .
It just means that , if you touch both an iPhone 3G and an iPhone 3GS with greasy fingers , it will show a little less on the 3GS and will be easier to clean off .
Now to look at the features that are new to the 3GS before focusing on the " S . "
Support for the new volume - adjusting headphones
The first thing we noticed was that the iPhone 3GS comes with Apple 's new volume - adjusting headphones .
These are essentially the same as the headphones with the built - in mic and clicker that come with the iPhone and iPhone 3GS , but with the added benefit of being able to turn the volume up or down right from the headphone cord .
The iPod touch supports this feature but , until now , no iPhones did .
We tested these headphones with an iPhone 3G running iPhone OS 3.0 and found that the functionality did not work there , indicating that this is limited to the 3GS .
This is awesome for 3GS owners , and sucks for 3G owners .
New ( but sometimes not better ) camera
i Phone fans have been clamoring for an improved camera since the original device was released in 2007 , and Apple gave it to them in the iPhone 3GS .
The built - in camera now sports 3 megapixels ( up from 2 ) and the ability to autofocus anywhere in the frame .
It can also shoot video ( new in 3GS , which we 'll address in another section ) , and it automatically geotags your photos ( not new ) .
So how does it do ?
Let 's start with the good news .
The autofocus capabilities are definitely a welcome addition , and Apple 's implementation is typical — smart and intuitive .
When taking a photo , the camera app automatically puts a white square around the area it thinks you want it to focus on , but if you want it to focus on something else , just tap on that area of the screen and the square will move .
This not only shifts the focus to that object , but it also adjusts the lighting of the photo so that the part of the frame you 're focusing on is getting the most optimal light balance .
Our favorite part of this is that you can now macro - focus on items close to you by tapping on them — no more blurry pics of that weird sign you found on the street or a bug crawling across your desk .
This is by far the best feature of the new camera .
Below you can see an example of the same Kindle DX keyboard shot with both the 3G and the 3GS cameras .

Mr Blaisart
SHUSHUFINDI , Ecuador  Mention to Anita Ruíz the name of the giant oil company Chevron , and she trembles with rage .
At her wooden hut here in the Amazon forest , where oil - project flares illuminate the night sky , she points to a portrait of her youngest son , who died seven years ago of leukemia at age 16 .
“ We believe the American oilmen created the pollution that killed my son , ” said Ms. Ruíz , 58 , who lives in a clearing where Texaco , the American oil company that Chevron acquired in 2001 , once poured oil waste into pits used decades ago for drilling wells .
Texaco ’s roughnecks are long gone , but black gunk from the pits seeps to the topsoil here and in dozens of other spots in Ecuador ’s northeastern jungle .
These days the only Chevron employees who visit the former oil fields , in a region where resentment against the company runs high , do so escorted by bodyguards toting guns .
They represent one side in a bitter fight that is developing into the world ’s largest environmental lawsuit , with $ 27 billion in potential damages .
Government 's £ 285 m Mortgage Rescue Scheme helps just TWO families
Housing Minister Margaret Beckett admitted the scheme had not helped a large number of people
Just two homeowners have been helped by a flagship initiative to save families from repossession , it emerged last night .
The Mortgage Rescue Scheme has been running since January , during which time nearly 20,000 homes are thought to have been seized .
Yet Margaret Beckett yesterday admitted that the £ 285 million package had helped just two owners to hold on to their properties .
Defending the lifeboat scheme - announced amid fanfare last year - the housing minister said ten other families had been offered help and another 77 families were in line for assistance .
Critics said the figures were a scandalous failure caused by ministerial dithering .
The Department for Communities and Local Government said 4,202 struggling households had approached councils .
Of these , 593 applied for assistance under the rescue package which is designed to help the most vulnerable families .
But just two - both in the East of England - have been given the go - ahead for help .
Bob Neill ,
Tory local government spokesman , told the Commons that the Government 's failure to help more people was ' tragic , if not scandalous ' .
Philip Davies , a Conservative backbencher , said the scheme was failing at a time when a house is repossessed every seven minutes .
He added : ' Is this not another example of the Government headline - seeking in a blaze of glory to try to pretend they are helping people , when they actually fail in reality to deliver any tangible help to people suffering hardship through no fault of their own . '
How the Daily Mail reported the story on December 4 , 2008
Mrs Beckett admitted the number of households receiving help was small .
She added : ' It is a shattering blow to people to lose their homes - much worse than losing your job , much harder to recover from .
' We expect many more households to be helped in the coming months .
' Our objective is to ensure that repossession is always the last resort and this scheme is just one part of a comprehensive package of measures we 've put in place to assist families at risk of losing their homes . '
The Mortgage Rescue Scheme is targeted at those earning less than £ 60,000 a year who would be entitled to be rehoused under homelessness legislation .
To qualify for assistance , a household must meet a string of criteria .
These include the value of a person 's home not exceeding the cap for their region .
For instance , in London it is £ 305,000 , while in the North East it is £ 125,000 .
And a family must show a clear need to stay in their home rather than move somewhere smaller or cheaper .
A Government spokesman said many households had received financial advice under the scheme .
The defensive - lethal language led some Democrats , according to congressional sources familiar with their views , to call in the director of the C.I.A. , Air Force General Michael V. Hayden , for a special briefing .
Hayden reassured the legislators that the language did nothing more than provide authority for Special Forces operatives on the ground in Iran to shoot their way out if they faced capture or harm .
The legislators were far from convinced .
One congressman subsequently wrote a personal letter to President Bush insisting that “ no lethal action , period ” had been authorized within Iran ’s borders .
As of June , he had received no answer .
Members of Congress have expressed skepticism in the past about the information provided by the White House .
On March 15 , 2005 , David Obey , then the ranking Democrat on the Republican - led House Appropriations Committee , announced that he was putting aside an amendment that he had intended to offer that day , and that would have cut off all funding for national - intelligence programs unless the President agreed to keep Congress fully informed about clandestine military activities undertaken in the war on terror .
He had changed his mind , he said , because the White House promised better coöperation .
“ The Executive Branch understands that we are not trying to dictate what they do , ” he said in a floor speech at the time .
“ We are simply trying to see to it that what they do is consistent with American values and will not get the country in trouble . ”
Obey declined to comment on the specifics of the operations in Iran , but he did tell me that the White House reneged on its promise to consult more fully with Congress .
He said , “ I suspect there ’s something going on , but I do n’t know what to believe .
Cheney has always wanted to go after Iran , and if he had more time he ’d find a way to do it .
We still do n’t get enough information from the agencies , and I have very little confidence that they give us information on the edge . ”
None of the four Democrats in the Gang of Eight — Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , Senate Intelligence Committee chairman John D. Rockefeller IV , and House Intelligence Committee chairman Silvestre Reyes — would comment on the Finding , with some noting that it was highly classified .
An aide to one member of the Democratic leadership responded , on his behalf , by pointing to the limitations of the Gang of Eight process .
The notification of a Finding , the aide said , “ is just that — notification , and not a sign - off on activities .
Proper oversight of ongoing intelligence activities is done by fully briefing the members of the intelligence committee . ”
However , Congress does have the means to challenge the White House once it has been sent a Finding .
It has the power to withhold funding for any government operation .
The members of the House and Senate Democratic leadership who have access to the Finding can also , if they choose to do so , and if they have shared concerns , come up with ways to exert their influence on Administration policy .
( A spokesman for the C.I.A. said , “ As a rule , we do n’t comment one way or the other on allegations of covert activities or purported findings . ”
The White House also declined to comment . )
A member of the House Appropriations Committee acknowledged that , even with a Democratic victory in November , “ it will take another year before we get the intelligence activities under control . ”
He went on , “ We control the money and they ca n’t do anything without the money .
Money is what it ’s all about .
But I ’m very leery of this Administration . ”
He added , “ This Administration has been so secretive . ”
One irony of Admiral Fallon ’s departure is that he was , in many areas , in agreement with President Bush on the threat posed by Iran .
They had a good working relationship , Fallon told me , and , when he ran CENTCOM , were in regular communication .
On March 4th , a week before his resignation , Fallon testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee , saying that he was “ encouraged ” about the situations in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Regarding the role played by Iran ’s leaders , he said , “ They ’ve been absolutely unhelpful , very damaging , and I absolutely do n’t condone any of their activities .
And I have yet to see anything since I ’ve been in this job in the way of a public action by Iran that ’s been at all helpful in this region . ”
Fallon made it clear in our conversations that he considered it inappropriate to comment publicly about the President , the Vice - President , or Special Operations .
But he said he had heard that people in the White House had been “ struggling ” with his views on Iran .
“ When I arrived at CENTCOM , the Iranians were funding every entity inside Iraq .
It was in their interest to get us out , and so they decided to kill as many Americans as they could .
And why not ?
They did n’t know who ’d come out ahead , but they wanted us out .
I decided that I could n’t resolve the situation in Iraq without the neighborhood .
To get this problem in Iraq solved , we had to somehow involve Iran and Syria .
I had to work the neighborhood . ”
Fallon told me that his focus had been not on the Iranian nuclear issue , or on regime change there , but on “ putting out the fires in Iraq . ”
There were constant discussions in Washington and in the field about how to engage Iran and , on the subject of the bombing option , Fallon said , he believed that “ it would happen only if the Iranians did something stupid . ”
Fallon ’s early retirement , however , appears to have been provoked not only by his negative comments about bombing Iran but also by his strong belief in the chain of command and his insistence on being informed about Special Operations in his area of responsibility .
One of Fallon ’s defenders is retired Marine General John J. ( Jack ) Sheehan , whose last assignment was as commander - in - chief of the U.S. Atlantic Command , where Fallon was a deputy .
Last year , Sheehan rejected a White House offer to become the President ’s “ czar ” for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
“ One of the reasons the White House selected Fallon for CENTCOM was that he ’s known to be a strategic thinker and had demonstrated those skills in the Pacific , ” Sheehan told me .
( Fallon served as commander - in - chief of U.S. forces in the Pacific from 2005 to 2007 . )
“ He was charged with coming up with an over - all coherent strategy for Iran , Iraq , and Afghanistan , and , by law , the combatant commander is responsible for all military operations within his A.O. ” — area of operations .
“ That was not happening , ” Sheehan said .
“ When Fallon tried to make sense of all the overt and covert activity conducted by the military in his area of responsibility , a small group in the White House leadership shut him out . ”
The law cited by Sheehan is the 1986 Defense Reorganization Act , known as Goldwater - Nichols , which defined the chain of command : from the President to the Secretary of Defense , through the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , and on to the various combatant commanders , who were put in charge of all aspects of military operations , including joint training and logistics .
That authority , the act stated , was not to be shared with other echelons of command .
But the Bush Administration , as part of its global war on terror , instituted new policies that undercut regional commanders - in - chief ; for example , it gave Special Operations teams , at military commands around the world , the highest priority in terms of securing support and equipment .
The degradation of the traditional chain of command in the past few years has been a point of tension between the White House and the uniformed military .
“ The coherence of military strategy is being eroded because of undue civilian influence and direction of nonconventional military operations , ” Sheehan said .
“ If you have small groups planning and conducting military operations outside the knowledge and control of the combatant commander , by default you ca n’t have a coherent military strategy .
You end up with a disaster , like the reconstruction efforts in Iraq . ”
Admiral Fallon , who is known as Fox , was aware that he would face special difficulties as the first Navy officer to lead CENTCOM , which had always been headed by a ground commander , one of his military colleagues told me .
He was also aware that the Special Operations community would be a concern .
“ Fox said that there ’s a lot of strange stuff going on in Special Ops , and I told him he had to figure out what they were really doing , ” Fallon ’s colleague said .
“ The Special Ops guys eventually figured out they needed Fox , and so they began to talk to him .
Fox would have won his fight with Special Ops but for Cheney . ”
The Pentagon consultant said , “ Fallon went down because , in his own way , he was trying to prevent a war with Iran , and you have to admire him for that . ”
In recent months , according to the Iranian media , there has been a surge in violence in Iran ; it is impossible at this early stage , however , to credit JSOC or C.I.A. activities , or to assess their impact on the Iranian leadership .
The Iranian press reports are being carefully monitored by retired Air Force Colonel Sam Gardiner , who has taught strategy at the National War College and now conducts war games centered on Iran for the federal government , think tanks , and universities .
The Iranian press “ is very open in describing the killings going on inside the country , ” Gardiner said .
It is , he said , “ a controlled press , which makes it more important that it publishes these things .
We begin to see inside the government . ”
He added , “ Hardly a day goes by now we do n’t see a clash somewhere .
There were three or four incidents over a recent weekend , and the Iranians are even naming the Revolutionary Guard officers who have been killed . ”
Earlier this year , a militant Ahwazi group claimed to have assassinated a Revolutionary Guard colonel , and the Iranian government acknowledged that an explosion in a cultural center in Shiraz , in the southern part of the country , which killed at least twelve people and injured more than two hundred , had been a terrorist act and not , as it earlier insisted , an accident .
It could not be learned whether there has been American involvement in any specific incident in Iran , but , according to Gardiner , the Iranians have begun publicly blaming the U.S. , Great Britain , and , more recently , the C.I.A. for some incidents .
The agency was involved in a coup in Iran in 1953 , and its support for the unpopular regime of Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi — who was overthrown in 1979 — was condemned for years by the ruling mullahs in Tehran , to great effect .
“ This is the ultimate for the Iranians — to blame the C.I.A. , ” Gardiner said .
“ This is new , and it ’s an escalation — a ratcheting up of tensions .
It rallies support for the regime and shows the people that there is a continuing threat from the ‘ Great Satan . ’ ” In Gardiner ’s view , the violence , rather than weakening Iran ’s religious government , may generate support for it .
Many of the activities may be being carried out by dissidents in Iran , and not by Americans in the field .
One problem with “ passing money ” ( to use the term of the person familiar with the Finding ) in a covert setting is that it is hard to control where the money goes and whom it benefits .
Nonetheless , the former senior intelligence official said , “ We ’ve got exposure , because of the transfer of our weapons and our communications gear .
The Iranians will be able to make the argument that the opposition was inspired by the Americans .
How many times have we tried this without asking the right questions ?
Is the risk worth it ? ”
One possible consequence of these operations would be a violent Iranian crackdown on one of the dissident groups , which could give the Bush Administration a reason to intervene .
A strategy of using ethnic minorities to undermine Iran is flawed , according to Vali Nasr , who teaches international politics at Tufts University and is also a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations .
“ Just because Lebanon , Iraq , and Pakistan have ethnic problems , it does not mean that Iran is suffering from the same issue , ” Nasr told me .
“ Iran is an old country — like France and Germany — and its citizens are just as nationalistic .
The U.S. is overestimating ethnic tension in Iran . ”
The minority groups that the U.S. is reaching out to are either well integrated or small and marginal , without much influence on the government or much ability to present a political challenge , Nasr said .
“ You can always find some activist groups that will go and kill a policeman , but working with the minorities will backfire , and alienate the majority of the population . ”
Family First Senator Steve Fielding has made up his mind on global warming - there 's not enough evidence that it 's real .
After talks with the Government and top scientists , Senator Fielding , who holds a crucial Senate vote , has released a document setting out his position .
" Global temperature is n't rising , " it says .
On emissions trading , Senator Fielding said he would n't risk job losses on " unconvincing green science " .
The document was prepared with the help of some of the country 's most prominent climate - sceptic scientists .
Chairman of park society wanted to document police misconduct , but was told he had breached Section 44 of the Terrorism Act
Paul Joseph Watson
Prison Planet.com
Thursday , April 16 , 2009
Despite police claiming that an ambiguous section of the UK Counter Terrorism
Act of 2008 would not outlaw taking photographs or film of police , a man was detained as a terror suspect this week simply for taking a photograph of a police car in order to document police misconduct .
62 - year - old Malcolm Sleath , who is chairman of his local park society , saw a police car driving erratically down a North London park footpath , despite the fact that by law police are supposed to investigate on foot in such circumstances .
He began filming the police car to document the misconduct so that he could later present it to the chief sergeant .
Sleath was subsequently approached by the two officers in the car and was told he was being detained because he had breached Section 44 of the Terrorism Act .
“ ( The officer ) was clearly embarrassed to be photographed where he should n’t have been and wanted to intimidate me , ” said Sleath .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Section 44 previously only allowed police officers to stop and search somebody on “ reasonable grounds ” but that has now been changed and is no longer necessary , leading to an explosion in frivolous stop and search incidents .
44 % of complaints made about stop and search allege assault by police officers .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
However , the nature of Sleath ’s detainment raises questions about whether police were actually enforcing 58A of the 2000 Terrorism Act , a passage replicated in the 2008 Counter Terrorism Act .
As we have previously highlighted , this section contains ambiguous language which suggests that merely filming or photographing police officers is an act of terrorism .
When journalist organizations expressed fears that this law could effectively outlaw a huge part of their profession , they were told by PC Alan Cousins of the Metropolitan Police Film Unit that the law would not impede them .
Cousins stated that taking photos of police officers “ would not be caught by this offence , ” but added that it could be in “ exceptional circumstances ” .
In London , filming anything is treated as a sign of potential terrorism .
We were filming floral tributes left at the entrance to Stockwell tube station where Jean Charles De Menezes was brutally gunned down by police in July 2005 .
We were approached by a police officer and subsequently entered into the terror database – ostensibly for filming flowers without permission from the government .
Britain has around 4.2 million CCTV cameras – one for every fourteen people – and Big Brother has carte blanche to watch us 24/7 – but woe betide we actually turn the camera back on the authorities , because that makes us a potential terrorist .
Indeed , a recent London Metropolitan Police poster campaign directly implied that filming a CCTV camera was a probable act of terrorism and encouraged people to report anyone for doing so .
The video below shows UK police threatening a man with reprisals for filming them , claiming that it is an offence to record the police .
The cops phone the police station and are told that there is no law that forbids the public from filming them .
However , this was two years ago , before the recent amendment to the law was passed .

Il nous a semblé important de vous proposer à la lecture Is Google Making Us Stupid ? , l’article de Nicolas Carr , publié en juin 2008 dans la revue The Atlantic , et dont la traduction , réalisée par Penguin , Olivier et Don Rico , a été postée sur le FramaBlog en décembre .
Dans cet article , Nicolas Carr ( blog ) , l’auteur de Big Switch et de Does IT matter ? , que l’on qualifie de Cassandre des nouvelles technologies , parce qu’il a souvent contribué à un discours critique sur leur impact , part d’un constat personnel sur l’impact qu’à l’internet sur sa capacité de concentration pour nous inviter à réfléchir à l ’influence des technologies sur notre manière de penser et de percevoir le monde .
Rien de moins .
“ Dave , arrête .
Arrête , s’il te plaît .
Arrête Dave .
Vas - tu t’arrêter , Dave ? ”
Ainsi le super - ordinateur HAL suppliait l’implacable astronaute Dave Bowman dans une scène célèbre et singulièrement poignante à la fin du film de Stanley Kubrick 2001 , l’odyssée de l’espace .
Bowman , qui avait failli être envoyé à la mort , au fin fond de l’espace , par la machine détraquée , est en train de déconnecter calmement et froidement les circuits mémoires qui contrôlent son “ cerveau ” électronique .
“ Dave , mon esprit est en train de disparaître ” , dit HAL , désespérément .
“ Je le sens .
Je le sens . ”
Moi aussi , je le sens .
Ces dernières années , j’ai eu la désagréable impression que quelqu’un , ou quelque chose , bricolait mon cerveau , en reconnectait les circuits neuronaux , reprogrammait ma mémoire .
Mon esprit ne disparaît pas , je n’irai pas jusque là , mais il est en train de changer .
Je ne pense plus de la même façon qu’avant .
C’est quand je lis que ça devient le plus flagrant .
Auparavant , me plonger dans un livre ou dans un long article ne me posait aucun problème .
Mon esprit était happé par la narration ou par la construction de l’argumentation , et je passais des heures à me laisser porter par de longs morceaux de prose .
Ce n’est plus que rarement le cas .
Désormais , ma concentration commence à s’effilocher au bout de deux ou trois pages .
Je m’agite , je perds le fil , je cherche autre chose à faire .
J’ai l’impression d’être toujours en train de forcer mon cerveau rétif à revenir au texte .
La lecture profonde , qui était auparavant naturelle , est devenue une lutte .
Je crois savoir ce qui se passe .
Cela fait maintenant plus de dix ans que je passe énormément de temps sur la toile , à faire des recherches , à surfer et même parfois à apporter ma pierre aux immenses bases de données d’Internet .
En tant qu’écrivain , j’ai reçu le Web comme une bénédiction .
Les recherches , autrefois synonymes de journées entières au milieu des livres et magazines des bibliothèques , s’effectuent désormais en un instant .
Quelques recherches sur Google , quelques clics de lien en lien et j’obtiens le fait révélateur ou la citation piquante que j’espérais .
Même lorsque je ne travaille pas , il y a de grandes chances que je sois en pleine exploration du dédale rempli d’informations qu’est le Web ou en train de lire ou d’écrire des e-mails , de parcourir les titres de l’actualité et les derniers billets de mes blogs favoris , de regarder des vidéos et d’écouter des podcasts ou simplement de vagabonder d’un lien à un autre , puis à un autre encore .
( À la différence des notes de bas de page , auxquelles on les apparente parfois , les liens hypertextes ne se contentent pas de faire référence à d’autres ouvrages ; ils vous attirent inexorablement vers ces nouveaux contenus . )
Pour moi , comme pour d’autres , le Net est devenu un media universel , le tuyau d’où provient la plupart des informations qui passent par mes yeux et mes oreilles .
Les avantages sont nombreux d’avoir un accès immédiat à un magasin d’information d’une telle richesse , et ces avantages ont été largement décrits et applaudis comme il se doit .
“ Le souvenir parfait de la mémoire du silicium ” , a écrit Clive Thompson de Wired , “ peut être une fantastique aubaine pour la réflexion . ”
Mais cette aubaine a un prix .
Comme le théoricien des média Marshall McLuhan le faisait remarquer dans les années 60 , les média ne sont pas uniquement un canal passif d’information .
Ils fournissent les bases de la réflexion , mais ils modèlent également le processus de la pensée .
Et il semble que le Net érode ma capacité de concentration et de réflexion .
Mon esprit attend désormais les informations de la façon dont le Net les distribue : comme un flux de particules s’écoulant rapidement .
Auparavant , j’étais un plongeur dans une mer de mots .
Désormais , je fends la surface comme un pilote de jet - ski .
Je ne suis pas le seul .
Lorsque j’évoque mes problèmes de lecture avec des amis et des connaissances , amateurs de littérature pour la plupart , ils me disent vivre la même expérience .
Plus ils utilisent le Web , plus ils doivent se battre pour rester concentrés sur de longues pages d’écriture .
Certains des bloggeurs que je lis ont également commencé à mentionner ce phénomène .
Scott Karp , qui tient un blog sur les média en ligne , a récemment confessé qu’il avait complètement arrêté de lire des livres .
“ J’étais spécialisé en littérature à l’université et je passais mon temps à lire des livres ” , écrit-il .
“ Que s’est - il passé ? ”
Il essaie de deviner la réponse : “ Peut - être que je ne lis plus que sur Internet , non pas parce que ma façon de lire a changé ( c’est à dire parce que je rechercherais la facilité ) , mais plutôt parce que ma façon de PENSER a changé ? ”
Bruce Friedman , qui bloggue régulièrement sur l’utilisation des ordinateurs en médecine , décrit également la façon dont Internet a transformé ses habitudes intellectuelles .
“ J’ai désormais perdu presque totalement la capacité de lire et d’absorber un long article , qu’il soit sur le Web ou imprimé ” , écrivait - il plus tôt cette année .
Friedman , un pathologiste qui a longtemps été professeur l’école à de médecine du Michigan , a développé son commentaire lors d’une conversation téléphonique avec moi .
Ses pensées , dit - il , ont acquis un style “ staccato ” , à l’image de la façon dont il scanne rapidement de petits passages de texte provenant de multiples sources en ligne .
“ Je ne peux plus lire Guerre et Paix “ , admet -il .
“ J’ai perdu la capacité de le faire .
Même un billet de blog de plus de trois ou quatre paragraphes est trop long pour que je l’absorbe .
Je l’effleure à peine . ”
Les anecdotes par elles - mêmes ne prouvent pas grand chose .
Et nous attendons encore des expériences neurologiques et psychologiques sur le long terme , qui nous fourniraient une image définitive sur la façon dont Internet affecte nos capacités cognitives .
Mais une étude publiée récemment ( . pdf ) sur les habitudes de recherches en ligne , conduite par des spécialistes de l’université de Londres , suggère que nous assistons peut - être à de profonds changements de notre façon de lire et de penser .
Dans le cadre de ce programme de recherche de cinq ans , ils ont examiné des traces informatiques renseignant sur le comportement des visiteurs de deux sites populaires de recherche , l’un exploité par la bibliothèque britannique et l’autre par un consortium éducatif anglais , qui fournissent un accès à des articles de journaux , des livres électroniques et d’autres sources d’informations écrites .
Ils ont découvert que les personnes utilisant ces sites présentaient “ une forme d’activité d’écrémage ” , sautant d’une source à une autre et revenant rarement à une source qu’ils avaient déjà visitée .
En règle générale , ils ne lisent pas plus d’une ou deux pages d’un article ou d’un livre avant de “ bondir ” vers un autre site .
Parfois , ils sauvegardent un article long , mais il n’y a aucune preuve qu’ils y reviendront jamais et le liront réellement .
Les auteurs de l’étude rapportent ceci :
“ Il est évident que les utilisateurs ne lisent pas en ligne dans le sens traditionnel .
En effet , des signes montrent que de nouvelles formes de “ lecture ” apparaissent lorsque les utilisateurs “ super - naviguent ” horizontalement de par les titres , les contenus des pages et les résumés pour parvenir à des résultats rapides .
Il semblerait presque qu’ils vont en ligne pour éviter de lire de manière traditionnelle . ”
Grâce à l’omniprésence du texte sur Internet , sans même parler de la popularité des textos sur les téléphones portables , nous lisons peut - être davantage aujourd ’hui que dans les années 70 ou 80 , lorsque la télévision était le média de choix .
Mais il s’agit d’une façon différente de lire , qui cache une façon différente de penser , peut - être même un nouveau sens de l’identité .
“ Nous ne sommes pas seulement ce que nous lisons ” , dit Maryanne Wolf , psychologue du développement à l’université Tufts et l’auteur de Proust et le Calamar : l’histoire et la science du cerveau qui lit .
“ Nous sommes définis par notre façon de lire . ”
Wolf s’inquiète que le style de lecture promu par le Net , un style qui place “ l’efficacité ” et “ l’immédiateté ” au - dessus de tout , puisse fragiliser notre capacité pour le style de lecture profonde qui a émergé avec une technologie plus ancienne , l ’imprimerie , qui a permis de rendre banals les ouvrages longs et complexes .
Lorsque nous lisons en ligne , dit -elle , nous avons tendance à devenir de “ simples décodeurs de l’information ” .
Notre capacité à interpréter le texte , à réaliser les riches connexions mentales qui se produisent lorsque nous lisons profondément et sans distraction , reste largement inutilisée .
La lecture , explique Wolf , n’est pas une capacité instinctive de l’être humain .
Elle n’est pas inscrite dans nos gènes de la même façon que le langage .
Nous devons apprendre à nos esprits comment traduire les caractères symboliques que nous voyons dans un langage que nous comprenons .
Et le médium ou toute autre technologie que nous utilisons pour apprendre et exercer la lecture joue un rôle important dans la façon dont les circuits neuronaux sont modelés dans nos cerveaux .
Les expériences montrent que les lecteurs d’idéogrammes , comme les chinois , développent un circuit mental pour lire très différent des circuits trouvés parmi ceux qui utilisent un langage écrit employant un alphabet .
Les variations s’étendent à travers de nombreuses régions du cerveau , incluant celles qui gouvernent des fonctions cognitives essentielles comme la mémoire et l’interprétation des stimuli visuels et auditifs .
De la même façon , nous pouvons nous attendre à ce que les circuits tissés par notre utilisation du Net seront différents de ceux tissés par notre lecture des livres et d’autres ouvrages imprimés .
En 1882 , Friedrich Nietzsche acheta une machine à écrire , une “ Malling - Hansen Writing Ball ” pour être précis .
Sa vue était en train de baisser , et rester concentré longtemps sur une page était devenu exténuant et douloureux , source de maux de têtes fréquents et douloureux .
Il fut forcé de moins écrire , et il eut peur de bientôt devoir abandonner .
La machine à écrire l’a sauvé , au moins pour un temps .
Une fois qu’il eut maîtrisé la frappe , il fut capable d’écrire les yeux fermés , utilisant uniquement le bout de ses doigts .
Les mots pouvaient de nouveau couler de son esprit à la page .
Mais la machine eut un effet plus subtil sur son travail .
Un des amis de Nietzsche , un compositeur , remarqua un changement dans son style d’écriture .
Sa prose , déjà laconique , devint encore plus concise , plus télégraphique .
“ Peut - être que , grâce à ce nouvel instrument , tu vas même obtenir un nouveau langage ” , lui écrivit cet ami dans une lettre , notant que dans son propre travail ses “ pensées sur la musique et le langage dépendaient souvent de la qualité de son stylo et du papier ” .
“ Tu as raison ” , répondit Nietzsche , “ nos outils d’écriture participent à l’éclosion de nos pensées ” .
Sous l’emprise de la machine , écrit le spécialiste allemand des médias Friedrich A. Kittler , la prose de Nietzsche “ est passée des arguments aux aphorismes , des pensées aux jeux de mots , de la rhétorique au style télégraphique ” .
Le cerveau est malléable presque à l’infini .
On a longtemps cru que notre réseau mental , les connexions denses qui se forment parmi nos cent milliards et quelques de neurones , sont largement établis au moment où nous atteignons l’âge adulte .
Mais des chercheurs du cerveau ont découvert que ce n’était pas le cas .
James
Olds , professeur de neurosciences qui dirige l’institut Krasnow pour l’étude avancée à l’université George Mason , dit que même l’esprit adulte “ est très plastique ” .
Les cellules nerveuses rompent régulièrement leurs anciennes connexions et en créent de nouvelles .
“ Le cerveau ” , selon Olds , “ a la capacité de se reprogrammer lui - même à la volée , modifiant la façon dont il fonctionne . ”
Lorsque nous utilisons ce que le sociologue Daniel Bell appelle nos “ technologies intellectuelles ” , les outils qui étendent nos capacités mentales plutôt que physiques , nous empruntons inéluctablement les qualités de ces technologies .
L’horloge mécanique , qui est devenu d’utilisation fréquente au 14e siècle , fournit un exemple frappant .
Dans Technique et Civilisation , l’historien et critique culturel Lewis Mumford décrit comment l’horloge “ a dissocié le temps des évènements humains et a contribué à créer la croyance en un monde indépendant constitué de séquences mathématiquement mesurables ” .
La “ structure abstraite du découpage du temps ” est devenue “ le point de référence à la fois pour l’action et les pensées ” .
Le tic-tac systématique de l’horloge a contribué à créer l’esprit scientifique et l’homme scientifique .
Mais il nous a également retiré quelque chose .
Comme feu l’informaticien du MIT Joseph Weizenbaum l’a observé dans son livre de 1976 , Le pouvoir de l’ordinateur et la raison humaine : du jugement au calcul , la conception du monde qui a émergé de l’utilisation massive d’instruments de chronométrage “ reste une version appauvrie de l’ancien monde , car il repose sur le rejet de ces expériences directes qui formaient la base de l’ancienne réalité , et la constituaient de fait . ”
En décidant du moment auquel il faut manger , travailler , dormir et se lever , nous avons arrêté d’écouter nos sens et commencé à nous soumettre aux ordres de l’horloge .
Le processus d’adaptation aux nouvelles technologies intellectuelles est reflété dans les métaphores changeantes que nous utilisons pour nous expliquer à nous - mêmes .
Quand l’horloge mécanique est arrivée , les gens ont commencé à penser que leur cerveau opérait “ comme une horloge ” .
Aujourd ’hui , à l ’ère du logiciel , nous pensons qu’il fonctionne “ comme un ordinateur ” .
Mais les changements , selon la neuroscience , dépassent la simple métaphore .
Grâce à la plasticité de notre cerveau , l’adaptation se produit également au niveau biologique .
Internet promet d’avoir des effets particulièrement profonds sur la cognition .
Dans un article publié en 1936 ( .pdf ) , le mathématicien anglais Alan Turing a prouvé que l’ordinateur numérique , qui à l’époque n’existait que sous la forme d’une machine théorique , pouvait être programmé pour réaliser les fonctions de n’importe quel autre appareil traitant l’information .
Et c’est ce à quoi nous assistons de nos jours .
Internet , un système informatique d’une puissance inouïe , inclut la plupart de nos autres technologies intellectuelles .
Il devient notre plan et notre horloge , notre imprimerie et notre machine à écrire , notre calculatrice et notre téléphone , notre radio et notre télévision .
Quand le
Net absorbe un médium , ce médium est recréé à l’image du Net .
Il injecte dans le contenu du médium des liens hypertextes , des pubs clignotantes et autres bidules numériques , et il entoure ce contenu avec le contenu de tous les autres média qu’il a absorbés .
Un nouveau message e-mail , par exemple , peut annoncer son arrivée pendant que nous jetons un coup d’œil aux derniers titres sur le site d’un journal .
Résultat : notre attention est dispersée et notre concentration devient diffuse .
L’influence du
Net ne se limite pas aux bords de l’écran de l’ordinateur non plus .
En même temps que l’esprit des gens devient sensible au patchwork disparate du médium Internet , les média traditionnels ont dû s’adapter aux nouvelles attentes de leur public .
Les programmes de télévision ajoutent des textes défilants et des pubs qui surgissent , tandis que les magazines et les journaux réduisent la taille de leurs articles , ajoutent des résumés , et parsèment leurs pages de fragments d’information faciles à parcourir .
Lorsque , au mois de mars de cette année , le New York Times a décidé de consacrer la deuxième et la troisième page de toutes ses éditions à des résumés d’articles , son directeur artistique , Tom Badkin , explique que les “ raccourcis ” donneront aux lecteurs pressés un “ avant - goût ” des nouvelles du jour , leur évitant la méthode “ moins efficace ” de tourner réellement les pages et de lire les articles .
Les anciens média n’ont pas d’autre choix que de jouer suivant les règles du nouveau médium .
Jamais système de communication n’a joué autant de rôles différents dans nos vies , ou exercé une si grande influence sur nos pensées , que ne le fait Internet de nos jours .
Pourtant , malgré tout ce qui a été écrit à propos du Net , on a très peu abordé la façon dont , exactement , il nous reprogramme .
L’éthique intellectuelle du Net reste obscure .
À peu près au moment où Nietzsche commençait à utiliser sa machine à écrire , un jeune homme sérieux du nom de Frederick Winslow Taylor apporta un chronomètre dans l’aciérie Midvale de Philadelphie et entama une série d’expériences historique dont le but était d’améliorer l’efficacité des machinistes de l’usine .
Avec l’accord des propriétaires de Midvale , il embaucha un groupe d’ouvriers , les fit travailler sur différentes machines de métallurgie , enregistra et chronométra chacun de leurs mouvements ainsi que les opérations des machines .
En découpant chaque travail en une séquence de petites étapes unitaires et en testant les différentes façons de réaliser chacune d’entre elles , Taylor créa un ensemble d’instructions précises , un “ algorithme ” , pourrions dire de nos jours , décrivant comment chaque ouvrier devait travailler .
Les employés de Midvale se plaignirent de ce nouveau régime strict , affirmant que cela faisait d’eux quelque chose d’à peine mieux que des automates , mais la productivité de l’usine monta en flèche .
Plus de cent ans après l’invention de la machine à vapeur , la révolution industrielle avait finalement trouvé sa philosophie et son philosophe .
La chorégraphie industrielle stricte de Taylor , son “ système ” comme il aimait l’appeler , fut adoptée par les fabricants dans tout le pays et , avec le temps , dans le monde entier .
À la recherche de la vitesse , de l’efficacité et de la rentabilité maximales , les propriétaires d’usine utilisèrent les études sur le temps et le mouvement pour organiser leur production et configurer le travail de leurs ouvriers .
Le but , comme Taylor le définissait dans son célèbre traité de 1911 , La direction des ateliers ( le titre original
The principles of scientific management pourrait être traduit en français par “ Les principes de l’organisation scientifique ” ) , était d’identifier et d’adopter , pour chaque poste , la “ meilleure méthode ” de travail et ainsi réaliser “ la substitution graduelle de la science à la méthode empirique dans les arts mécaniques ” .
Une fois que le système serait appliqué à tous les actes du travail manuel , garantissait Taylor à ses émules , cela amènerait un remodelage , non seulement de l’industrie , mais également de la société , créant une efficacité parfaite utopique .
“ Dans le passé , l’homme était la priorité ” , déclare - t - il , “ dans le futur , la priorité , ce sera le système ” .
Le système de Taylor , le taylorisme , est encore bien vivant ; il demeure l’éthique de la production industrielle .
Et désormais , grâce au pouvoir grandissant que les ingénieurs informaticiens et les programmeurs de logiciel exercent sur nos vies intellectuelles , l’éthique de Taylor commence également à gouverner le royaume de l’esprit .
Internet est une machine conçue pour la collecte automatique et efficace , la transmission et la manipulation des informations , et des légions de programmeurs veulent trouver “ LA meilleure méthode ” , l’algorithme parfait , pour exécuter chaque geste mental de ce que nous pourrions décrire comme “ le travail de la connaissance ” .
Le siège de Google , à Mountain View , en Californie , le Googleplex , est la Haute Église d’Internet , et la religion pratiquée en ses murs est le taylorisme .
Google , selon son directeur - général Eric Schmidt , est “ une entreprise fondée autour de la science de la mesure ” et il s’efforce de “ tout systématiser ” dans son fonctionnement .
En s’appuyant sur les téra - octets de données comportementales qu’il collecte à travers son moteur de recherche et ses autres sites , il réalise des milliers d’expériences chaque jour , selon le Harvard Business Review , et il utilise les résultats pour peaufiner les algorithmes qui contrôlent de plus en plus la façon dont les gens trouvent l’information et en extraient le sens .
Ce que Taylor a fait pour le travail manuel , Google le fait pour le travail de l’esprit .
Google a déclaré que sa mission était “ d’organiser les informations du monde et de les rendre universellement accessibles et utiles ” .
Cette société essaie de développer “ le moteur de recherche parfait ” , qu’elle définit comme un outil qui “ comprendrait exactement ce que vous voulez dire et vous donnerait en retour exactement ce que vous désirez ” .
Selon la vision de Google , l’information est un produit comme un autre , une ressource utilitaire qui peut être exploitée et traitée avec une efficacité industrielle .
Plus le nombre de morceaux d’information auxquels nous pouvons “ accéder ” est important , plus rapidement nous pouvons en extraire l’essence , et plus nous sommes productifs en tant que penseurs .
Où cela s’arr ê tera - t - il ?
Sergey Brin et Larry
Page , les brillants jeunes gens qui ont fondé
Google pendant leur doctorat en informatique à Stanford , parlent fréquemment de leur désir de transformer leur moteur de recherche en une intelligence artificielle , une machine comme HAL , qui pourrait être connectée directement à nos cerveaux .
“ Le moteur de recherche ultime est quelque chose d’aussi intelligent que les êtres humains , voire davantage ” , a déclaré Page lors d’une conférence il y a quelques années .
“ Pour nous , travailler sur les recherches est un moyen de travailler sur l’intelligence artificielle . ”
Dans un entretien de 2004 pour Newsweek , Brin affirmait :
“ Il est certain que si vous aviez toutes les informations du monde directement fixées à votre cerveau ou une intelligence artificielle qui serait plus intelligente que votre cerveau , vous vous en porteriez mieux . ”
L’année dernière , Page a dit lors d’une convention de scientifiques que Google “ essayait vraiment de construire une intelligence artificielle et de le faire à grande échelle . ”
Une telle ambition est naturelle , et même admirable , pour deux mathématiciens prodiges disposant d’immenses moyens financiers et d’une petite armée d’informaticiens sous leurs ordres .
Google est une entreprise fondamentalement scientifique , motivée par le désir d’utiliser la technologie , comme l’exprime Eric Schmidt , “ pour résoudre les problèmes qui n’ont jamais été résolus auparavant ” , et le frein principal à la réussite d’une telle entreprise reste l’intelligence artificielle .
Pourquoi Brin et Page ne voudraient - ils pas être ceux qui vont parvenir à surmonter cette difficulté ?
Pourtant , leur hypothèse simpliste voulant que nous nous “ porterions mieux ” si nos cerveaux étaient assistés ou même remplacés par une intelligence artificielle , est inquiétante .
Cela suggère que d’après eux l’intelligence résulte d’un processus mécanique , d’une suite d’étapes discrètes qui peuvent être isolés , mesurés et optimisés .
Dans le monde de Google , le monde dans lequel nous entrons lorsque nous allons en ligne , il y a peu de place pour le flou de la réflexion .
L’ambiguïté n’est pas un préliminaire à la réflexion mais un bogue à corriger .
Le cerveau humain n’est qu’un ordinateur dépassé qui a besoin d’un processeur plus rapide et d’un plus gros disque dur .
L’idée que nos esprits doivent fonctionner comme des machines traitant des données à haute vitesse n’est pas seulement inscrite dans les rouages d’Internet , c’est également le business - model qui domine le réseau .
Plus vous surfez rapidement sur le Web , plus vous cliquez sur des liens et visitez de pages , plus Google et les autres compagnies ont d’occasions de recueillir des informations sur vous et de vous nourrir avec de la publicité .
La plupart des propriétaires de sites commerciaux ont un enjeu financier à collecter les miettes de données que nous laissons derrière nous lorsque nous voletons de lien en lien : plus y a de miettes , mieux c’est .
Une lecture tranquille ou une réflexion lente et concentrée sont bien les dernières choses que ces compagnies désirent .
C’est dans leur intérêt commercial de nous distraire .
Peut - être ne suis - je qu’un angoissé .
Tout comme il y a une tendance à glorifier le progrès technologique , il existe la tendance inverse , celle de craindre le pire avec tout nouvel outil ou toute nouvelle machine .
Dans le Phèdre de Platon , Socrate déplore le développement de l’écriture .
Il avait peur que , comme les gens se reposaient de plus en plus sur les mots écrits comme un substitut à la connaissance qu’ils transportaient d’habitude dans leur tête , ils allaient , selon un des intervenants d’un dialogue , “ arrêter de faire travailler leur mémoire et devenir oublieux . ”
Et puisqu’ils seraient capables de “ recevoir une grande quantité d’informations sans instruction appropriée ” , ils risquaient de “ croire posséder une grande connaissance , alors qu’ils seraient en fait largement ignorants ” .
Ils seraient “ remplis de l’orgueil de la sagesse au lieu de la sagesse réelle ” .
Socrate n’avait pas tort , les nouvelles technologies ont souvent les effets qu’il redoutait , mais il manquait de vision à long terme .
Il ne pouvait pas prévoir les nombreux moyens que l’écriture et la lecture allaient fournir pour diffuser l’information , impulsant des idées fraîches et élargissant la connaissance humaine ( voire la sagesse ) .
L’arrivée de l’imprimerie de Gutenberg , au XVe siècle , déclencha une autre série de grincements de dents .
L’humaniste italien Hieronimo Squarciafico s’inquiétait que la facilité à obtenir des livres conduise à la paresse intellectuelle , rende les hommes “ moins studieux ” et affaiblisse leur esprit .
D’autres avançaient que des livres et journaux imprimés à moindre coût allaient saper l’autorité religieuse , rabaisser le travail des érudits et des scribes , et propager la sédition et la débauche .
Comme le professeur de l’université de New York , Clay Shirky , le remarque , “ la plupart des arguments contre l’imprimerie était corrects et même visionnaires . ”
Mais , encore une fois , les prophètes de l’apocalypse ne pouvaient imaginer la myriade de bienfaits que le texte imprimé allait amener .
Alors certes , vous pouvez vous montrer sceptique vis -à - vis de mon scepticisme .
Ceux qui considèrent les détracteurs d’Internet comme des béotiens technophobes ou passéistes auront peut - être raison , et peut - être que de nos esprits hyperactifs , gavés de données surgira un âge d’or de la découverte intellectuelle et de la sagesse universelle .
Là encore , le Net n’est pas l’alphabet , et même s’il remplacera peut - être l’imprimerie , il produira quelque chose de complètement différent .
Le type de lecture profonde qu’une suite de pages imprimées stimule est précieux , non seulement pour la connaissance que nous obtenons des mots de l’auteur , mais aussi pour les vibrations intellectuelles que ces mots déclenchent dans nos esprits .
Dans les espaces de calme ouverts par la lecture soutenue et sans distraction d’un livre , ou d’ailleurs par n’importe quel autre acte de contemplation , nous faisons nos propres associations , construisons nos propres inférences et analogies , nourrissons nos propres idées .
La lecture profonde , comme le défend Maryanne Wolf , est indissociable de la pensée profonde .
Si nous perdons ces endroits calmes ou si nous les remplissons avec du “ contenu ” , nous allons sacrifier quelque chose d’important non seulement pour nous même , mais également pour notre culture .
Dans un essai récent , l’auteur dramatique Richard Foreman décrit de façon éloquente ce qui est en jeu :
“ Je suis issu d’une tradition culturelle occidentale , pour laquelle l’idéal ( mon idéal ) était la structure complexe , dense et “ bâtie telle une cathédrale ” de la personnalité hautement éduquée et logique , un homme ou une femme qui transporte en soi-même une version unique et construite personnellement de l’héritage tout entier de l’occident .
Mais maintenant je vois en nous tous ( y compris en moi-même ) le remplacement de cette densité interne complexe par une nouvelle sorte d’auto - évolution sous la pression de la surcharge d’information et la technologie de “ l’instantanément disponible ” . ”
À mesure que nous nous vidons de notre “ répertoire interne issu de notre héritage dense ” , conclut Foreman , nous risquons de nous transformer en “ crêpe humaine ” , étalée comme un pâte large et fine à mesure que nous nous connectons à ce vaste réseau d’information accessible en pressant simplement sur une touche . ”
Cette scène de 2001 : l’odyssée de l’espace me hante .
Ce qui la rend si poignante , et si bizarre , c’est la réponse pleine d’émotion de l’ordinateur lors du démontage de son esprit : son désespoir à mesure que ses circuits s’éteignent les uns après les autres , sa supplication enfantine face à l’astronaute , “ Je le sens , je le sens .
J’ai peur . ” , ainsi que sa transformation et son retour final à ce que nous pourrions appeler un état d’innocence .
L’épanchement des sentiments de HAL contraste avec l’absence d’émotion qui caractérise les personnages humains dans le film , lesquels s’occupent de leur boulot avec une efficacité robotique .
Leurs pensées et leurs actions semblent scénarisées , comme s’ils suivaient les étapes d’un algorithme .
Dans le monde de 2001 , les hommes sont devenus si semblables aux machines que le personnage le plus humain se trouve être une machine .
C’est l’essence de la sombre prophétie de Kubrick : à mesure que nous nous servons des ordinateurs comme intermédiaires de notre compréhension du monde , c’est notre propre intelligence qui devient semblable à l’intelligence artificielle .

The Conference Board of Canada 's sellout on copyright just keeps on getting worse .
To recap : the Conference Board is a supposedly neutral research outfit that was asked by the Canadian copyright industries to write a report on file - sharing and piracy in Canada .
They hit up the Ontario government for $ 15,000 to fund an event where the findings of the report would be presented .
Then they hired an independent researcher who concluded that there was n't anything particularly wrong with Canadian file - sharing .
They threw away his research .
Then they plagiarized dodgy press-materials produced by the leading US copyright lobby group , quoting lengthy passages that were factually wrong .
Then they denied any wrongdoing .
Then they admitted they 'd plagiarized , but insisted that the public money had n't been spent " on the report " — it had been spent on the conference about the report , which is a Different Thing Altogether .
Then the founder and leader of the Conference Board , Anne Golden , appeared on the TVOntario podcast Search Engine and argued that she did n't really see anything especially egregious about the fact that the plagiarists had copied the talking points of the people who'd hired them to write the " independent " report .
She even tried to discredit the distinguished academic who wrote the conflicting report that they discarded by saying that he 's a plagiarist for saying that " if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck , it probably is a duck " ( in reference to the Board 's apparent bias - for - money position ) , because someone else said that first .
And now , it just got worse .
One of the named authors of the plagiarized report has come forward to say that the funders of the report — Canadian copyright lobbyists — actively pressured him to come to the conclusions that they wanted to see .
He asked to have his name removed from the report prior to publication — and Anne Golden called him to talk it over and then hung up on him .
#
# My new work was interrupted in mid-September by my former supervisor at the Conference Board to tell me there had been " push back " from one of the funding clients about the research and inclusion of Mr. deBeer 's contribution .
I had quit almost two months earlier so this was of no concern to me .
#
Around the same time , my new work was also interrupted by a call from one of the funding clients who expressed similar concerns .
Again , I informed him that I no longer had anything to do with these reports .
# I received news of its publication on May 26 , 2009 , ten months after my resignation .
I downloaded and read the research after I was informed of the controversy and was alarmed to see the direction it had taken .
# I sent my letter to Anne Golden the following day .
#
The VP of Public Policy e-mailed me on May 29th to ask for my assistance in finding both researchers who could " fix " the reports , as well as external reviewers who would be impartial in reviewing the new work .
His message stated that " I trust your judgment , experience and knowledge and would value your help . "
Ex-Conference Board Author Speaks Out ; Confirms " Push Back " From Copyright Lobby Funders
Update : As of Dec. 2 , 2010 , Bahnhof was serving as one of the European hosts for the Wikileaks web site , which is no longer using the Amazon Web Services cloud to distribute its files .
See Netcraft for details .
In an underground bunker 100 feet beneath Stockholm lies a unique facility operated by the Swedish ISP Bahnhof .
It 's become known as the " James Bond Villain Data Center " after it was featured on the Pingdom web site last year .
Dean Nelson of Data Center
Pulse recently got a tour of the data center from Bahnhof CEO Jon Karlung , who provided a look at the many unusual features of the facility , a former military bunker designed to withstand a hydrogen bomb blast .
Karlung has said he drew his inspiration for many of the center 's flourishes from James Bond villains ( especially Ernst Blofeld ) , hence the waterfalls , greenhouse - style NOC , glass - enclosed conference room " floating " above the colocation floor , and blue - lit diesel engines ( supposedly used in German submarines ) .
This video runs about 9 minutes .

Why do they bother locking it when they KNOW 2 seconds after they put it out , one of you guys will break it ?
It sounds like they only do it to keep their lawyers happy with removal of product liability , etc. Damn Lawyers .
" What does qwq mean ? " qwq was developed in quantum physics labs deep underground in Germany .
In English , ' qwq ' means simply .. ' qwq ' .
No hidden meanings .
But in Korean , ' qwq ' has been clinically proven to mean " NOT EVEN DEATH CAN SAVE YOU FROM ME . "
This discovery was found after the invention of ' qwq ' , so we try not to focus on this .
Laughing out loud ?
No you 're not .
You 're just typing it .
Anyone who commonly says ' lol ' is a liar !
You are not laughing out loud .
You are just to lazy to type anything else .
We 're here to fix that .
QWQ " IS JUST A SIMPLE WAY OF EXPRESSING YOUR AMUSEMENT AT SOMETHING .
No laughing required .
We promise .

Accurate Alzheimer 's Diagnosis in Just Five Minutes ?
A new study claims a simple test can be a powerful screening tool .
Try it .
June 10 , 2009  --
A new and improved quiz is able to accurately detect Alzheimer 's disease , in just five minutes , researchers say .
The British Medical Journal published a study on Tuesday about the new self - administered written test called " Test Your Memory " ( TYM ) .
Researchers say it is a far more accurate than any other screening test currently used to detect Alzheimer 's disease .
Click here to find out how to take the quiz and test your mind .
The study claims the test works so well because of the minimal time it takes to complete , the range of cognitive functions it tests , and the specificity with which it can detect even mild cases of the disease .
Administered to 540 subjects with no history of neurological disease , 139 patients with diagnosed Alzheimer 's and 31 patients with non-Alzheimer 's degenerative dementias , TYM 's questions measured orientation , the ability to copy a sentence , semantic knowledge , calculation , verbal fluency , similarities , naming , visuospatial abilities , and recall .
The ability to complete the test was also scored .
Dr. Pamela Blake , a neurologist at Memorial Hermann Northwest Hospital , in Houston Texas joined " Good Morning America " to weigh in on what the TYM could mean for early detection of Alzheimer's .
TYM was able to correctly detect 93 percent of patients with Alzheimer 's disease , while another test , the Mini Mental State Exam - standard method of assessment for the last 30 years - detected only 52 percent of patients .
A perfect score on the TYM is 50 and participants with no history of neurological disease , memory problems or brain injury scored an average of 47 .
Those with mild memory problems had an average score of 45 and those who had been diagnosed with Alzheimer 's scored much lower , with an average of 33 .

Early testing is somewhat controversial .
There is no cure for Alzheimer 's and some argue an early diagnosis is not helpful because there is essentially no treatment available for the disease .
But Dr. Blake noted that early detection can allow for families to plan and can get patients involved in clinical trials and medication therapy .
In no way does the TYM purport to conclusively diagnose Alzheimer 's disease .
Many factors can contribute to a low score including fatigue , anxiety , alcohol , or just having a bad day .
A test taker concerned about a low score should contact their doctor .

Strategies for Teaching Kids about Money and Savings
One of the most important financial concepts is that of saving .
Whether it is saving up for something short - term ( like a family vacation ) , a medium - term goal ( like a down payment on a home ) or something long - term ( like retirement ) , effective saving strategies are important .
Knowing how to save prepares you for the future , teaches discipline and keeps you from the servitude of debt .
Teaching kids about money and savings is a very important part of their life - skills education .
When it comes to finances , showing your children how to save — and encouraging the practice — is one of the best things you can do for them .
It will help your child start down the lifelong path of financial independence .
Here are some strategies you can use to teach your kids to save money .
Saving strategies , ages 3 - 7
Young children are visual .
They need to see concepts in order to begin to understand them .
Even at age 3 ( or even younger ) , children can start understanding the concept of money .
Giving children an allowance or letting them earn money for chores around the house can teach them to allocate their money .
Use different jars or envelopes for different money uses .
I keep things simple for my son :
We have a jar for church donations , one for long - term saving ( which he empties and takes to the bank ) , and one for spending .
This is a very visual way to show my son that it is important to immediately set aside money for purposes other than consumer spending .
To help your young child more fully grasp the concept of saving , have him or her think of a toy , book , game or movie they want .
Have them draw it , or cut out a picture of it .
Then talk about how much time it will take to save up .
My 6 - year - old understands weeks on the calendar , so we figure out how many weeks of allowance ( less donations and long - term savings ) it will take for him to reach his goal .
To him , it ’s exciting to cross off each week , and he feels a sense of accomplishment when he can pay for his toy himself .
Friends of mine do something similar with their 3 - year - old twins .
The put a picture of the goal on a piece of posterboard and make spaces for quarters .
( For these young kids , my friends only have them save up for a portion of the cost . )
When they receive their allowances , after setting some aside for other purposes , the tape a quarter in place .
Once all the spaces are filled up , they can have the toy .
They enjoy seeing the board fill with quarters , and then being rewarded at the end .
While these feelings may not last much beyond the age of 7 or 8 , such visuals give young children an idea of concept of saving , and they learn to feel good about working toward a money goal and then achieving it .
And my son treats the toys he has bought himself with much more care than he treats his other toys .
Saving strategies , ages 7- 12
If you already have a foundation for saving , set from a young age , it will be easier to carry that on as your child gets older .
At this age , children begin to understand more abstract concepts .
Teach them that saving should be a percentage of their income , and that it should be paid for ahead of other expenses .
As you increase their allowance or chore payments , explain that they also have to increase their savings .
Talk to them about what they would like to do later ( in life , in the summer , whenever ) , and work out a strategy with them to help them pay for it .
This gives your children an idea the saving up requires planning .
If you ’re feeling really ambitious , institute a “ savings match ” program , wherein you will match the amount your child puts into long - term savings ( sort of like a 401 k plan ) .
You can also begin talking about savings as a way to get through difficult times .
If you are going through a tough time , let your kids know that your emergency fund is what ’s helping you pay the bills .
If you see a natural disaster on television , talk about the kinds of things a savings account could help with if such a thing happened to your family .
Getting your child involved in money discussions and showing him or her how important savings are is vital to teaching this concept .
Savings strategies , teenagers
Teenagers are able to understand such concepts as interest paid and yields earned .
Help your teenager open an online savings account or set up a CD ladder .
It is vital that teenagers have a checking account and a savings account of some kind .
If you already have your teenager primed for understanding savings through groundwork laid earlier , this is easier .
Enforce the principles that you have been teaching all along .
Bank accounts with minors should be joint accounts .
Go over the statements monthly with your teen and discuss money strategies .
The teen years is a good time to introduce investing concepts .
Encourage your teenager to open an IRA if he or she has a job .
There are investment - style games online that can get your teenager interested in learning about investing .
Talk about return and long - term planning .
Encourage your teenager to think about products that they use , or companies they are interested in .
Either invest in those companies , or invest in an index ( my recommendation ) that tracks them or similar companies .
If your child wants a loan , or an advance on his or her allowance , charge interest .
Make a contract of terms on the computer , and show your child how much he or she will have to pay back , depending on the interest rate and the length of the loan .
I know parents who charge between 10 % and 15 % interest , just to make sure their kids get this idea :
It ’s better to plan ahead with high yield savings than it is to have to take out a loan .
What are some of the strategies you use to teach your children to save money ?
[ Update : June 5 , 2010 : In January , an armed robber held up a jewlery store on Madison Avenue between 75th an 76th , shooting and killing a 71 - year old employee .
This is the first shooting homicide in the Upper East Side in over seven years , and per the linked - to article , seemingly random . ]
The New York Times came out with a neat interactive map of homicides in New York City — something which would be really cool if it were not about murder .
According to the map , ove the six and a half year period covered ( 2003 to present ) , NYC recorded just over 3,400 homicides , of which 15 % — or about 500 — were in Manhattan .
The Upper East Side section of Manhattan is incredibly safe , apparently .
11 homicides over the period , or about two per year .
For an area with a population of 200,000 + , that gives roughly a 1 homicide per 100,000 per annum .
To put that in perspective , in 2003 , Maine had the “ best ” homicide rate in the nation , at 1.2 per 100,000 .
There are no formal barriers separating the Upper East Side from the rest of Manhattan — yes , it abutts Central Park on the west but one can easily walk though that , and the east is bound by the East River .
North and south , though , the lines are 96th and 59th streets respectively , which is to say , the borders are entirely fluid with the neighborhoods next to them .
( A guess as to why the lines are where they are ?
On the south side , Central Park ends on 59th ; on the north , the Metro North train tracks come above ground at 97th . )
The borders are known but hardly observed in any true fashion — we regularly consider a playground on 99th and 5th to be in the “ Upper East Side ” , for example .
If you live here , you probably will understand why the neighborhood is safer than most , but experience does not translate well to words .
I was not terribly surprised to see a low homicide rate , although admittedly it was much lower than I expected .
What did surprise me , however , was one simple fact : no firearms were used in the homicides .
Or , more accurately , guns abide by the borders .
The map above sums it up .
The green dots — firearm - related homicides — all fall outside the borders of the Upper East Side .
There are two which are close , of course : 57th and Madison , 97th and 3rd .
Two blocks south of the UES , one block north .
This makes the UES a massive outlier , as 69 % of the 3,400 + homicides city - wide were firearm - related .

WILL Europe 's biggest defence - procurement programme , the Airbus A400 M military transport , crash and burn before the aircraft has even flown ?
The A400 M is three years late and € 2 billion ( $ 2.7 billion ) over budget .
Talks to decide its fate are about to begin .
They will be a game of high stakes played by OCCAR ( the organisation founded 12 years ago to manage collaborative military projects on behalf of member governments ) , the four countries who have collectively placed 84 % of the 192 orders for the giant plane , and EADS , the parent company of Airbus , which is struggling to build it .
If agreement cannot be reached on how to continue with the € 20 billion programme , EADS will have to return as much as € 5.7 billion in advance payments — more than half the defence group 's net cash .
It would be a humiliating admission of defeat both for Europe 's defence industry and for the sponsoring governments , which would have to turn to America for a replacement aircraft .
The trigger for the showdown is the failure of Airbus to meet a commitment to have flown the A400 M by the end of March .
Under the terms of a contract signed in 2003 , this gives customers the right to cancel their orders .
Rather than do so at once , the governments involved have agreed to a three - month moratorium during which time an attempt will be made to salvage the project .
Most observers believe a fudge of some kind will be found to keep the A400 M alive .
Louis Gallois , the chief executive of EADS , says that not only do European defence ministries need a plane with a unique combination of capabilities , but the jobs of up to 40,000 highly skilled workers are at stake .
However , a recent report from the French Senate suggested that the plane could end up being four years late .
The Germans sound increasingly cool about the project .
And the French and the British , who are desperate for additional heavy - lift capacity to support their operations in Afghanistan , are busy looking for ways to bridge the gap .
One ( far from ideal ) solution would be to buy or lease a combination of Boeing 's C - 17 — a much bigger military transport that is now only slightly more expensive than the A400 M — and an updated version of Lockheed Martin 's venerable C-130 .
Were that to happen , orders for the A400 M might be cut , leading to an even higher unit price for remaining aircraft .
As for EADS , Mr Gallois 's soothing words are in stark contrast to recent comments by Tom Enders , Airbus 's German chief executive .
Mr Enders regards the fixed - price contract negotiated by one of his predecessors , Noël Forgeard , as a disaster rooted in naivety , excessive enthusiasm and arrogance .
“ If you had offered it to an American defence contractor like Northrop , they would have run a mile from it , ” he says .
Mr Enders believes that unless the contract can be substantially renegotiated , the project should be abandoned and , however financially painful it might be , Airbus should return the money to its customers .
In an interview with Der Spiegel two weeks ago , he said : “ Better an end with horror than horror without end . ”
There are a number of reasons why the A400 M contract has proved such a disaster for Airbus .
One is that the firm , which had no previous experience of big military programmes , grossly underestimated the complexity of the aircraft that it was being asked to build .
The view within Airbus was that the A400M was little more than a “ flying truck ” .
But the A400 M is one of the most technically difficult aircraft projects ever undertaken .
Somewhere between a C - 130 and C - 17 in size and payload , the A400 M is designed to have the smaller plane 's ability to fly very slowly and land on unprepared airstrips close to the battlefield , yet come close to the speed of the jet - engined C - 17 and exceed its range .
To pull this off , the A400 M needs extremely sophisticated software to manage its propulsion systems — three times as complex as the software needed for the engines of the A380 superjumbo , according to EADS — and turboprop engines of a size and power never before produced in the West .
Just in case that was not hard enough , Airbus allowed its customers to bully it into rejecting a bid to supply engines from Pratt & Whitney , a vastly experienced American firm .
Airbus plumped instead for a politically - inspired consortium that included France 's Snecma , Britain 's Rolls - Royce , Germany 's MTU and Spain 's ITP .
Still worse , Airbus took the highly unusual step of accepting full contractual responsibility for the delivery of the propulsion - management software , known as FADEC , even though it had little or no control over its development .
Fasten your seatbelts
The TP400 - D6 engine has at least now flown , albeit on a C - 130 testbed , but the software is still months from delivery and the A400 M 's first flight is not expected until next year .
Even then there are doubts whether the aircraft will meet all its performance goals .
In particular , there are fears that early versions may be too heavy to carry more than 30 tonnes of payload over long distances .
That would rule out lifting Germany 's 31.5 - tonne Puma armoured fighting vehicle for more than short hops .
Despite all these problems , most of those involved with the A400 M are still betting that it will survive : too many people have too much riding on it and no other aircraft is as flexible .
If it does take to the air , the plane will have a breadth of talent that nothing else matches .
But such is the frustration and anger on all sides that a different outcome is more than possible .
The Americans are watching closely .
We have seen everything about the iPhone 3G s lately and one thing that always interests most is the cost to the manufacturer of a device to manufacture .
We are paying a subsidized cost for the iPhone 3G s , but it seems fair if it really costs Apple just under $ 200 to make at $ 178.96 .

Subsequent to publication of this essay , several developments occurred that changed key elements of the story .
First , the federal prosecutor in charge of the Ashton Lundeby case issued a press release denying that the USA PATRIOT act played any role in the investigation , arrest , and detention of Ashton Lundeby .
Secondly , Ashton ’s mother Annette admitted that her son , under the screen name " Tyrone , " had been involved in internet - facilitated pranks .
" Tyrone " allegedly called in phony bomb threats to schools at the request of other teenagers who wanted an excuse to miss school — and then charging them for this illicit service .
While Annette Lundeby admits that Ashton made crank calls , she maintains that he was not involved in calling in phony bomb threats .
She likewise continues to insist that someone in the group of on - line Gamers with whom Ashton carried out " pranks " stole his IP address and used his on - line identity while calling in the bogus bomb threats .
According to Annette Lundeby , her son ’s court - appointed attorney and other officials refused to offer a straightforward answer when she asked if the PATRIOT act was involved .
She also claims to have exculpatory evidence confirming that her son was set up by the same former on - line friend who turned him in to the authorities .
Ashton ’s next hearing is scheduled for May 22 .
LRC will provide updates on this story , whatever direction it happens to follow .
Here is the original story :
It ’s been said that a lie is a poor way to say “ hello . ”
It is also the standard greeting one receives from government employees , particularly those who carry guns .
Around 10:00 p.m. on March 5 , a wolf - pack of armed men gathered at the front door of the Lundeby family ’s home in Oxford , North Carolina .
When she answered the doorbell , Annette was greeted with the sight of a State Highway Patrolman who introduced himself with a lie .
Things went dramatically downhill from there .
“ He told me that my son Ashton had committed a hit - and - run with somebody ’s car , ” Annette told Pro Libertate in a phone interview .
“ I said , ‘ No , that ’s not true — it was exactly the reverse ; he was on the receiving end of a hit - and - run , and that was last January . ' ”
The State Trooper ’s lie was a pretext to rouse the home - schooled teenager from bed and bring him to the doorstep .
Once the falsehood shattered against Mrs. Lundeby ’s polite resolve , however , the pretense was dropped and roughly a dozen armed men in body armor stormed into her home .
One of them demanded that Annette go get her son ; the others fanned out to search the house .
“ They would n’t tell me who they were , or where they were from , ” Annette recalled .
“ All I knew was that if I said the wrong thing I ’d be dead on the floor , and there would be nobody here to protect my children . ”
So she went upstairs and woke up her son , as instructed .
When she returned with Ashton she demanded to see a search warrant .
She was shown the paperwork , but the intruders were still reluctant to explain why they had invaded her home .
At some point over the next three and a half hours , Annette and Ashton learned that the men who had barged into their home were from the FBI , and that the teenage boy , who had never been in trouble with the police , was suspected of making several bomb threats via the internet .
The one that brought the FBI had been made against Purdue University in Indiana at 9:05 Central Time on February 15 .
Ashton had an alibi so tight it could be used as a space capsule :
On the evening in question he was at a meeting held in the Union Chapel Methodist Church in Kittrell , North Carolina until after 9:00 p.m. local time , a fact that could be confirmed by interviewing any of several dozen witnesses .
After helping his mother clean the chapel , Ashton accompanied her to a local grocery store to buy food and litter box filler for the family ’s three cats .
Once again , this element of Ashton ’s alibi — for which his mother was an eyewitness — would be relatively simple to confirm .
The Union Chapel church is about 35 minutes away from the Lundeby family ’s home .
Annette recalls that the family got home shortly after 10:00 on February 15 , which would n’t have given her son adequate time to log on to the Internet and make a bomb threat by 10:05 Eastern Time ( which would have been 9:05 p.m. in Indiana ) .
She also insists that her son “ went straight to bed ” without turning on his computer .
The FBI insists that the threat was made using Ashton ’s IP address .
Mrs. Lundeby insists that her son was the victim of identity theft , and that he was not the family ’s only victim .
Her late husband , a former employee of the federal Bureau of Prisons , also had his personal financial information stolen , and Annettee herself recalls that her bank account was hacked a couple of years ago .
For the past several months , she explained to Pro Libertate , “ our family has been receiving bizarre and threatening phone calls from people ” because of the malicious activities of at least one hacker .
“ We had the police call here claiming that someone had called 911 to report drugs in our home .
I told them that there was n’t anything going on here , but they were free to come and search the place to see for themselves . ”
That ’s an invitation she would n’t extend again under similar circumstances .
According to Annette , at least one of Ashton ’s friends can identify , by screenname , the hacker who made life miserable for the Lundebys .
Once again , there is no shortage of leads for an honest , competent , reasonably resourceful investigator to follow in establishing Ashton ’s alibi .
The unfortunate truth is that the FBI is , as far as I can tell , entirely devoid of people meeting that description .
Annette and her children were held hostage in their home until 1:30 in the morning .
The 12 - year - old daughter was dragged from her bed by an armed stranger — an act that left the girl traumatized ( and one for which the assailant should be thrashed to within a centimeter of his tax - devouring existence ) .
Annette insisted that Ashton not answer any questions without an attorney present , but she was n’t permitted to call one .
The Feds confiscated Ashton ’s computer and gaming equipment , and made off with a great deal of family paperwork .
But they could n’t find a particle of evidence anywhere to suggest that the teenager had built a bomb , or that possessed the necessary knowledge and intent .
Nonetheless , they handcuffed Ashton and hauled him away to jail .
A hearing was scheduled for 10:00 a.m. , which meant “ that I could n’t get an attorney — none of their offices was open , ” Annette recalls .
Her son was given a court - appointed attorney , a typically ineffective nebbish who — in the fashion of court - appointed “ defense ” counsel everywhere — was entirely disinclined to contest the prosecution ’s assertions .
At this point it ’s appropriate to note that “ court - appointed ” defense lawyers perform exactly the same function as “ jobbers ” in professional wrestling :
Their job is to lose every contest .
And judges in federal cases serve the same purpose as referees in pro wrestling “ matches ” :
They offer a pitiful pantomime of objectivity as they advance the pre-determined storyline .
In this case , the script called for Ashton to be taken into federal custody under the terms of the Sovietesque PATRIOT ( sic ) Act .
“ The standard that they used to arrest and detain my son was not ‘ probable cause , ’ as the Constitution requires , but rather ‘ good faith , ’ as specified in the PATRIOT [ sic ]
Act , ” Annette Lundeby observes .
“ This meant that they did n’t have to provide real evidence of a crime , because they did n’t have any .
All they had to do was assert their ‘ good faith ’ reasons for arresting and holding Ashton , and the judge simply let it stand . ”
Before and after the hearing , Ashton — a sixteen - year - old — was kept in detention with as many as thirty adult criminal suspects .
He was then transferred to a federal detention center in South Bend , Indiana , where he has been for more than 60 days .
As of today ( May 5 ) , a criminal complaint in this case does exist , but Ashton has yet to be charged with a crime .
Were we living in a country in which the habeas corpus guarantee was operational , Ashton would most likely be free , and a lawsuit against his persecutors would probably be in the works .
However , the late Bush administration , with the enthusiastic support of nearly every conservative commentator and activist of any consequence , quite thoughtfully disposed of the habeas corpus guarantee .
And since Ashton is being held on terrorism - related charges , his status is analogous to that of an “ enemy combatant ” — which is to say , he can probably be held indefinitely , and even be subjected to the same “ enhanced interrogation ” methods that so enchant many of the pew - defilers in conservative “ Christian ” congregations .
Ashton has n’t been mistreated yet , according to his mother .
However , the 16 - year - old — who is “ in every sense still a child , ” in his mother ’s estimation — is in an environment defined by cruel , arbitrary regulations designed to break his will .
“ I ’ve been able to talk with him several times since he was taken into federal custody , ” Annette told me , “ but there was a period of about three weeks in which I did n’t hear from him , and nobody would let me talk to him .
I was frantic , and my mother — she just turned 81 — had to be hospitalized for stress . ”
When that long silence was finally broke , Ashton explained to his mother that “ he was being punished for ‘ moving his eyes in the lunchroom , ' ” Annette related in a voice heavy with incredulity .
“ He told me , ‘ Mom , all I did was try to find out what we were eating .
But I got written up for moving my eyes . ' ”
If the case goes to trial , Ashton would be prosecuted as an adult , and would face a 15 - year prison sentence .
The Feds , who at this point appear to have no case , are quite likely using the leverage offered by the PATRIOT ( sic )
Act and similar measures to terrorize Ashton and his family into a plea bargain that would preserve the State ’s sense of infallibility and reinforce by precedent its ability to terrorize citizens at random .
Something of this sort took place last time a teenager was charged with terrorism under the PATRIOT ( sic ) Act — specifically , section 802 , which makes practically any crime committed on “ public ” property an act of “ terrorism . ”
Two years ago , Andrew Thomas , the demented and politically ambitious prosecutor for Arizona ’s Maricopa County , filed “ terrorism ” charges against Brent Clark , a 14 - year - old delinquent from Mesa who pulled a pocketknife on a schoolmate .
Thomas also charged the eighth grader with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon , which seems like a sufficiently serious offense .
But invoking the post - PATRIOT ( sic ) definition of “ terrorism ” helped extract a pre-emptive guilty plea from the adolescent and his family .
In Brent Clark ’s case , there was an actual crime committed :
He threatened a girl with a knife and tried , albeit not with much ardor , to take her hostage before permitting her to flee to her home .
Brent ’s parents apparently discovered evidence suggesting that the emotionally disturbed teenager harbored ambitions — how serious , we ’ll never know — of carrying out Columbine - style violence .
None of that applies in the case of Ashton Lundeby .
Apart from the use of Ashton ’s ISP information — a fact for which he and his mother have provided a persuasive and easily inspected alibi — nothing connects the 16 - year - old to a bomb threat anywhere .
Under traditional Anglo - Saxon standards of evidence and due process there is no case against Ashton .
This is precisely why the Feds are apparently using the Stalinist PATRIOT ( sic )
Act to keep this youngster confined for as long as it takes to extort some kind of confession from him .
If they determine the situation requires such measures , the Feds can draw upon the precedent set in the case of Jos Padilla , the first U.S. citizen to be designated an “ enemy combatant ” and held indefinitely without criminal charges .
In Padilla ’s case , federal authorities conducted a prolonged campaign of psychological torture designed not only to break his will , but literally — in the words of a Bush administration official — " to destroy Mr. Padilla ’s ordinary emotional and cognitive functioning in order to extract from him potentially self - incriminating information . "
Annette Lundeby once attended a police academy ; her late husband , as noted previously , was an employee of the Bureau of Prisons .
The family ’s home in North Carolina is decorated with U.S. flags .
The three of them are devout Christians who spend most of their free time in church - related activities .
The loss of Annette ’s husband was a severe blow , and the continued harassment they have suffered from hackers and identity thieves is the sort of thing one reads about in the Book of Job .
But the treatment of Ashton by the Regime is like something from modern dystopian literature ; indeed , Franz Kafka might find the story nearly implausible .
“ This is n’t America — not the America I knew , the one I grew up in , ” Annette told Pro Libertate .
“ This is like something out of a Third World dictatorship where the people in power just do whatever they want to anybody they choose .
I want my son back , and I ’ll do anything I can to free him .
But people need to know that if this is n’t stopped now , any of us at anytime can be treated the same way .
The next time it will be your house they visit in the middle of the night , and your children they take away . ”
The Best of William Norman Grigg
In large corporations , almost everything new is impossible .
Try to do anything new , and typically you are met with dozens of reasons why it ca n’t be done .
As a consultant ( which I was throughout my time in the corporate world ) , however , you ’ve been hired to get something specific done , so you do n’t get to echo the “ it ca n’t be done ” line back to your client .
Your job is , effectively , to do the impossible .
What happens after you do this for a few years ?
Well , you gain a healthy disrespect for anyone who tells you that something is impossible ( because it very rarely is ) , and a productive attitude to dealing with such situations .
Some things really are impossible ( so far ) , like teleporting to the other side of the world , or bringing someone back to life , or traveling back in time .
But most situations deemed “ not possible ” are nothing of the sort .
The lessons I ’ve learned about the nature of impossibilities from my years as a corporate consultant are also useful in start - up life .
Now when I run against so - called impossible tasks , the mantra I usually repeat to myself is : “ There are very few things that are truly impossible .
This is not one of them . ”
A practical example of getting the impossible done
Last Christmas , my girlfriend and I were going to spend Christmas in Geneva , with my parents .
We bought our tickets in September , booked a hotel to stay in , and , on December 24th , turned up at London City airport to climb on the plane .
What we did n’t know ( and what Air France failed to inform us of ) was that Switzerland had just entered the Schengen area three weeks earlier ( why they timed that for three weeks before Christmas , I do n’t know ) .
This made no difference to me , but my girlfriend , being Taiwanese , now needed a visa to go to Geneva .
Of course , the airline would n’t let us on the plane .
The Swiss embassy in London was closed for the holidays , so there was no way to get an emergency visa .
This was a typical “ it ca n’t be done ” situation .
French companies are notoriously procedural and uncooperative .
Air France proved to be just that .
They would n’t help us , beyond giving us the phone number of the Geneva airport border police .
The Swiss border police , predictably , had no intention of breaking the Rules to let in a couple of people who did n’t arrange their affairs in advance .
The situation looked lost , Christmas was ruined , my girlfriend was close to tears , suggesting that I go by myself and leave her alone in London for Christmas .
In the end , we made it through .
My father , from Geneva , inexplicably convinced the border police , on the phone , and without any prior contacts , to give us a temporary visa upon arrival ( impossible ! ) , and I convinced the uncooperative Air France to bend ever so slightly ( unthinkable ! ) and actually bother to call up the Swiss border police to confirm that we could board ( at first , they insisted on requiring the border police to send them a fax confirmation ) .
We still missed our plane ( largely due to the inflexibility of Air France , who I shall not be flying with again ) , and had to pay a surcharge to get the next plane .
But we made it to Geneva , and that was the most important thing .
Christmas was saved — in fact , we had a great Christmas holiday .
Principles for doing the impossible
Overcoming these brick walls in the airport required the same approach as it did in large corporations .
I later discussed it with my father , and have broken it down below into a handful of essential practices .
Some may be obvious , some may be less so .
All can be useful when trying to get your way and facing the faceless brick wall of “ it ca n’t be done ” , though they ’re not applicable to all situations .
1. Calm down , smile and stay polite
You cannot win this kind of battle through anger .
The very first thing to do is to observe that you are angry , and calm yourself down .
Acknowledge your anger , and put it aside for later .
There ’ll be plenty of time for cursing the system that put these problems in your way later , after you ’ve removed these obstacles .
The surest way to guarantee that you wo n’t get your way is to get angry .
Angry people are always wrong , and they ’re rarely worth helping or cooperating with .
When faced with sudden , unexpected obstacles , it ’s easy to let your emotions flare up , but in most cases , the other side does n’t have to help you , and a heated exchange may even ensure that they actively hinder you .
Next , you need to make a positive effort to stay polite and pleasant .
This is more than just “ acting normal ” .
You need to be extra nice with all the people involved in the problem you ’re facing , because any of them might be the key to helping you move past that problem .
As a start - up , you have very little power to bully people who throw brick walls in your way , so when you hit such a problem , remain apparently cheerful and polite even if your business is going up in flames in the back of your mind .
Rule 1 is : smile and stay polite and positive .
You ’ll win more with that attitude than any other , particularly when there ’s plenty to be emotional about .
2. Become a human being
It ’s easy to say no to a statistic , or a number , a traveller , a buyer .
It ’s easy to ignore a ticket in a queue .
It ’s much harder to ignore a real human being with a real , personal story , someone you ’ve met , who ’s looked you in the eye , and spoke to you one - to - one .
Chances are the system that is blocking you is not treating you like a person , but like an item in a queue of things to be dealt with .
To get people within that system to help you , you need to snap them out of that world - view , into considering your case as a real , personal , human situation .
The easiest way to achieve that is to provide them with personal details .
No , I do n’t mean your name and address !
Provide some elements to build a story of what is happening to you .
You ’re not just two faceless entities who want to get on a plane without a visa , you ’re a couple traveling home to spend Christmas with your parents .
You ’re not just yet another customer trying to solve some production issue , you ’re an inspiring start - up preparing to go - live with your first and best customers .
Add as many personal details as reasonable to become a real , live human being in the mind of the people you converse with .
3 . Be persistent
There ’s a saying that the “ squeaky wheel gets the fix ” .
Persisting , and conveying that you ’re probably not going to give up until you get your way , makes it more likely that even uncooperative people will help you , if only to get you out of their way .
It ’s of paramount importance that you continue to be very pleasant , friendly , and polite , while firmly persisting .
It is socially difficult to forcibly remove or ignore someone who is polite , positive and friendly , even if they ’re continuing to insist on something past the point where they should have reasonably given up .
The minute you frown and raise the tone of your voice , though , you ’re a goner .
As a start - up , simple polite persistence is often enough when dealing with banks ( when you want to get a merchant account , for example ) , clients , or suppliers who are ignoring you .
4 . Be prepared to lose
If you are not prepared to lose , you probably wo n’t win .
To get what you want , it is , paradoxically , more productive to start by assuming that you have possibly lost already .
This results in a psychological shift where you go from trying to defend what you thought you had ( which can make you overly emotional and defensive ) to trying to gain as much as you can from a bad situation .
This gives you a freedom of both thought and action .
You can think laterally and come up with unexpected compromises and pragmatic solutions , and when you see an opportunity , you can seize it without hesitation .
5 . Define your objective clearly to yourself
In the airport example , our objective was to get to Geneva within the next day or so .
In a corporate work environment , your objective might be to get a production bug fixed today despite all the procedures that say that you need to wait 3 months and get twenty approvals .
In a small business environment , you might want to save the relationship with a client who suddenly blew up , called you names and cancelled their account .
You should phrase this objective in terms of results , not in terms of how you ’re going to get there .
Doing so will also help free you to come up with workable ways to get there , rather than try to make things happen the way you originally thought they should have happened .
6 . Find who can
Often , the person you ’re dealing with right now cannot help you .
What you need is impossible to them … but not to someone else .
Perhaps someone in another department , another institution , or another country can help you .
You can tease out who you need to talk to with questions like “ Could anyone change this ? ” , “ What do you need to do this ?
Who can provide it ? ”
Suddenly , the authorisation that was previously impossible to grant may turn out to merely require the supervisor to sign a piece of paper .
7 . Take an active part
In these kinds of situations , things often fail to happen because of the inertia of interactions between people .
You can enormously enhance your chances of success by acting as a go - between , the social grease between people .
If you get a response like “ Oh , I ’m going to have to send an email to so - and - so , and I ca n’t do anything until I get the reply , ” offer to send the email yourself ( and then probably follow it up with a phone call ) .
You ’ll shave hours off the time from zero to done .
Use this opportunity to escalate and widen your contacts within the power structure that you ’re trying to bend to your will .
If you actively collect those contacts , you may soon find that you have more access to decision - makers than many of the people who you are dealing with ( “ You need a signature from a director ?
I just spoke to one , give me a few minutes . ” ) .
8 . Make the other person feel good
This is particularly important when the situation is such that you are in a position of overwhelming inferiority ( for example , in the airport , or when facing an executive secretary ) .
The natural tendency is to make the other person feel bad for not helping you , and that may work sometimes , but it can often backfire because that person then associates feeling bad with your presence , and may try to get rid of you without helping you .
It is much more effective to present the situation in such a way that the person who can help you will feel that they are doing something Good by helping you .
So , taking the airport example , do n’t make the person at the ticket desk feel that they will destroy your Christmas if they do n’t help you .
Instead , make them feel like they will have been the most essential actor in saving someone ’s Christmas by helping you .
Another example : let ’s say you ’re dealing with a supplier who has treated you badly .
You have every reason to be annoyed at them , but if you really want to get what you want , you should present things in a way so that the person helping you feels like they are a good person — not a cog in an evil machine .
So rather than accuse the company that they work for of various evils ( justified or not ) , present your case in a way so that your interlocutor will feel good for helping you .
It ’s not over yet
Finally , these kind of nightmare situations have a habit of lasting longer than you think and surprising you a couple of times .
Taking the airport example again , it was n’t over when we got Air France to agree to let us board .
It was n’t over when we climbed on the plane .
It was only over when we left Geneva airport , after going through the Swiss border .
When you ’ve gone through the first step in an impossible task , it can be tempting to relax and assume that everything will go fine after this , and maybe let the stress of the situation show through .
Do n’t .
As they say , it ’s not over until the fat lady sings , and things can still go terribly wrong at any moment between now and your objective being achieved .
Until you ’ve got what you want in your hand , stay focused and expect things to continue going wrong .
Conclusion
People react to being told “ it ’s not possible ” in a variety of ways , and not all those ways are productive .
To get around the brick walls which large corporations , bureaucracies and other social organisms put in our way , it is important to :
Calm down , smile and remain polite to maintain any chance of success
to maintain any chance of success Become a human being rather than a faceless number
rather than a faceless number
Be persistent to grind away the brick wall
to grind away the brick wall
Be prepared to lose to expand your freedom of thought and action
to expand your freedom of thought and action
Be clear about your objective so you can be flexible about how to achieve it
so you can be flexible about how to achieve it Find who can , since often the first person you speak to cannot help
, since often the first person you speak to cannot help
Take an active part in making things happen more efficiently
in making things happen more efficiently Make the other person feel good about helping you so that they are more likely to help you
so that they are more likely to help you Do n’t relax this stance until it ’s over , it ’s easy to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory .
I hope those tips are helpful , both in a personal and a professional setting .
If you have any further suggestions , please do post them as comments , and I ’ll try to add them into the article as an update .
Forget everything you thought you knew about squid porn .
What 's that ?
You did n't ?
Oh , well allow me to introduce to you Daikichi Amano - straddling the line between art photos and hardcore porn by way of cephalapods .
It has been alleged that this bizarre fetishism resulted from Japanese censorship laws , which prohibit genitalia shots ( tentacles being obvious substitutes for penises ) .
Daikichi has his own studio called Genki Genki ( it means ' good feeling ' , and their English motto is ' The strange label which flees in phantom ' ) where he makes all kinds of weird films and photos involving girls with bugs , frogs , goldfish and eels .... all of which they eat afterwards , to avoid wasteful animal cruelty .
He called me from Japan just to thank me for the interview , and apologise for his bad English .
We felt we'd only be taking something away if we re-translated him though .
In fact we wish everyone spoke like this .
How did you get started ?
In the beginning , there was not a conception of the work in which the creature and the woman are connected with .
When I was taking bestiality photograph with a dog , I felt personally averse to the photography with the animal where the hair grew and it became not possible to take this .
Because I am of the pet preference with a dog , a cat , and a rabbit at the parents ' home , it is proper might as well .
Only when I think of other ways , the conception that the creature on the sea and the woman to have made the clamminess of the eel , the loach , and the octopus which are handled as the food and so on in Japan was born .
Because I felt that the relation was amusing and that it was lascivious and then beautiful , I think that it continues .
Do your parents know about this ?
Yes , they know .
When I told that to them first , they were secured because they were introduced to my work not as criminal but as art .
Because I had strong interest in sex from the school child age , I sneaked in to the ladies ' room .
I knew I had been disliked by the girls in the class , and also it became impossible to take out a large amount of toy ( minicar and eraser ) put in the anus and I was taken to the hospital by my parents .
When I wanted to experience the orgasm with the anus and the anus was groped while sitting straight , I slept as I was , and the nerve of the foot started being cut , and I was carried by the ambulance .
Because I was putting inconvenience on the parents each time , I think that I was making them anxious .
You work was recently shown in the Mondo Bizzarro gallery , Rome .
Do you think having work in a gallery marks you as an artist rather than a pornographer ?
How would you classify yourself ?
Whether an artist or pornographer , I think that the people who have an interest in my work should decide .
Only , in the opportunity for the people who do n't usually see porn to see it increases , I feel that there is a meaning to be classified as an artist , too .
However , as for the way of taking a picture , the pornography and the art are the same .
What do you think is the strangest thing you 've ever made ?
It is rather the scenes that are strangest and shocking than the work itself .
I have strong memories of all works and it brands my mind with the smell in that case .
I saw a frog which opened the stomach and internal organs were taken from jumping for about 30 minutes .
I saw a cockroach that had head and the body separated with the surprise and scary when having begun to run with the head and the body in separate directions .
The scorpion is like the shrimp in the taste , and there was feeling that the grig ( Ed - some kind of nasty bug ) was quite delicious as it is like the almond , too .
While they are a delicate creatures , really , they have surprisingly strong vital energies , too .
I think that the photography feel alive rather than the sex when attempting to look back .
As for the memories that came on the site , a fire broke out in the building next to the picture - taking studio , and the actors and the staff should have taken shelter to the outside with frogs ' internal organs and blood stuck , and the rescue team came up while onlookers who gathered to see it , screaming , running up were almost transported to the hospital , which was interesting .
Is there anything you 'd consider ' too extreme ' to shoot ?
I do n't know by what the other persons feel too extreme a photography but I myself think that I am taking photographs because there is not a consciousness too extreme .
The work which shows the expression of " sex " by the sex act by man and woman is overflowing in the world and does n't have an interest as the viewpoint to enjoy by it .
The one such as sex is to be personally done and should be much better for it .
As for movies , there is the movie of the setting like a lie and the fantasy movie , too ?
Mine is n't different from those , being sensuous .
How would you address criticisms that your work is exploitative ?
Fortunately I do n't hear such criticism at my ear .
Only , I do n't have the intention of slighting a life at all .
Rather , I feel respect for their life after I have started the photography of them .
The creature which is used for the photography is the one used for food , thinking of the body of the actress , too .
Because so it is , it has sometimes eaten if left , too .
What would you like to do in the future ?
The exhibition by Mondo Bizzarro in Italy ended safely , too .
In September , in Bongout which is in Germany , we wait for the publishing of the photograph collection , too , as well as the exhibition at the same time .
By opening exhibitions and so on in the by - and - by in a variety of cities , I want to impress many people .

Sir Alex Ferguson has admitted he will be " slaughtered " if his severely weakened Manchester United side fail to beat Hull City tomorrow in a match that could have dire consequences for the three north - east clubs fighting relegation .
Ferguson is planning to make extensive changes to his starting line - up but insisted his conscience was clear and argued that the Premier League were partly to blame for scheduling the match three days before the Champions League final .
" Barcelona play on Saturday night and we have got our programme on Sunday , " he pointed out .
" England have had a team in the Champions League final for the last five years and it is not as if the Premier League are short of knowledge .
They could easily have put the programme on Saturday .
I still would n't have played my strongest team , but one or two more maybe would have played . "
Although the absence of most of United 's leading names would appear to work in Hull 's favour , Phil Brown suggested it was the worst possible scenario .
The manager would rather know who his players will be facing at the KC Stadium .
" I 've had a stab [ at predicting the United side ] , but it 's needle in the haystack stuff , " Brown said .
" To know who the team is this season has been a strong point of ours .
We 've more or less second - guessed managers on a number of occasions .
To not know who the team is could be a massive advantage to Manchester United .
The more information I have the better .
I dare say there will be a few surprises , but we 'll prepare for that on Sunday . "
Ferguson will field an experimental line - up including two teenagers , Federico Macheda and Danny Welbeck , in attack and possibly a third , Ben Amos , in goal .
The fit -again Wes Brown and Gary Neville are available to provide some experience in defence while Rio Ferdinand , recovering from a calf injury , may be risked , but Ferguson said he was entitled to rest the likes of Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo despite the potential implications for Newcastle United , Middlesbrough and Sunderland .
" Our responsibility is to win the European Cup and everyone is aware of that .
That 's why we are talking about changes .
But it is not a weak team .
It is a strong team – a good team , a team with fantastic potential in some cases .
I know that if we do n't win on Sunday we will be slaughtered and it will be the ' worst thing that has happened in the British game ' and people will talk about the integrity of the league .
But it is a natural thing for us to use our squad . "
The alternative , he argued , was that a player could be injured and United 's strategy for taking on Barcelona in Rome on Wednesday would be ruined .
" The players would n't forgive me if I played the strongest team on Sunday .
They would say : ' What ? '
They would possibly be tiptoeing around , knowing they have a European final on the Wednesday .
The rest of the league may think it 's good but it could actually be the worst thing that could happen to them .
Someone would get one of those 50 - 50 tackles and be somersaulted over their shoulder in the first tackle and , after that , they might say : ' Right , that 's enough for me . '
It would be the best thing that could happen to Hull . "
Brown is not so certain , but has no complaints about Ferguson using the full depth of United 's squad .
" Whatever team comes out of their dressing room he will have categorically a reason for every one of them playing and it will be a valid ­reason , " he said .
He acknowledged that talk about Ferguson 's selections should not disguise the fact that Hull 's fate is in the balance because of their own poor form over recent months .
" It 's not about this game , it is about the 37 before , " Brown said .
Nonetheless Ferguson is mindful of the controversy on the final weekend of the 2006 - 07 season when he fielded a weakened side that lost 1 - 0 to West Ham , a result that contributed to Sheffield United being relegated and left their manager , Neil Warnock , fuming .
" I was contemplating ringing the three managers , " Ferguson said , " but Ricky Sbragia has worked here and knows this club and knows what we will do .
Alan Shearer and Gareth Southgate have played against us many times and know what it is like to play against Manchester United .
They will know we will be doing our best .
There has been all this speculation and conjecture and concern , but we have got a league that has the best integrity in the world and we will play our part in that .
No matter which team I play it will represent Manchester United in our normal way .
We are expected to win and we will go there to win , and that 's the responsibility we always have . "
GM bought the Hummer brand in 1999
General Motors is to sell its Hummer brand to China 's Sichuan Tengzhong Heavy Industrial Machinery for an undisclosed amount .
It is part of GM 's plan to reinvent itself by concentrating on fewer brands following Monday 's bankruptcy filing .
GM says it hopes the deal will save about 3,000 jobs in the US .
Hummer will remain based in the US .
Tengzhong specialises in making equipment for the road , construction and energy industries .
It is based in China 's Sichuan province .
Hummers were originally built as military off - road vehicles by a company called AM General .
GM bought the Hummer brand in 1999 .
Its sales have suffered as the gas - guzzling performance and military image have become less popular .
When it began the sale process a year ago , GM had hoped to make more than $ 500 m ( £ 302 m ) , but analysts say that it is likely to have made about $ 100 m from the sale .
Let us now banish that enduring image of the bumbling parents who ca n’t program their VCR and must beg their teenager for help .
It turns out that the middle - age demographic stands ready to lead the digital revolution .
When it comes to listening to music on iPods , blogging , downloading podcasts , joining Facebook , and using Twitter , the over - 35 crowd is adopting everything from social media to consumer electronics at a faster rate than their Generation Y ( ages 18 to 24 ) counterparts .
These figures challenge some deeply held stereotypes about technology and age .
Tech companies , often obsessed with designing for youth and hiring young , should take heed of this emerging powerhouse to think differently about their products , and where growth and opportunity may be found .
But in truth , the most important implication is this :
Although I recently turned 40 , I am not necessarily doomed to become a technological dinosaur .
Yes !
If you were watching a YouTube video of me while I was writing this , I ’d be doing a jig and pretending to spike the ball in the end zone .
But as I ’m not one to gloat , let ’s just calmly look inside some of the data and what I think it means .
The first report that caught my eye came from Accenture , under the somewhat low - key title “ Consumer Electronics Products and Services Usage Report 2009 . ”
But in the annual report , which surveyed 3,000 adults , was this fascinating point :
“ Baby boomers are embracing popular consumer technology applications nearly 20 times faster than the younger generation . ”
Now , Accenture defines baby boomers as 45 years and older , so I ’m not technically in their ranks .
I officially belong to Generation X . And to be fair , that “ younger generation , ” dubbed Generation Y , can still claim that the percentage of their ranks using these services is higher than the boomers .
But that gap is closing rapidly , in part because adoption among boomers has accelerated , and in part because , for reasons that are unclear , the adoption rates among Gen Y is flat or declining .
For example :
Over the past year , the percentage of boomers listening to podcasts or reading blogs jumped 67 percent , to 26 percent .
The percentage of Generation Y stayed flat at 45 percent .
During the same period , the percentage of boomers watching or posting videos online climbed 35 percent , to 36 percent .
The percentage of Generation Y doing the same dropped almost 2 percent to 67 percent .
Finally , the percentage of boomers playing mobile video games climbed 52 percent to 13 percent .
The percentage of Generation Y climbed just under 2 percent to 45 percent .
“ Boomers are a lot more hip to technologies than we give them credit for , ” said Kumu Puri , Accenture ’s lead executive for the Consumer Technology industry group and author of their study .
But it ’s not just gadgets and multimedia where the shift of momentum is occurring .
Social media is also becoming fertile ground for the middle - aged :
According to Inside Facebook , a Web site that reports on the social networking king , the fastest - growing segment of users over the past 60 days is people over 35 ( that ’s me ! ) .
While the biggest segment of members are still 18 to 25 ( 19.5 million ) , there are now 13.4 million members who are 35 to 54 — a figure that ballooned 276 percent over the past six months .

The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigations is equipped with expensive high - tech equipment , designed to protect our nation ’s citizens — in most cases , at least .
In an embarrassing debacle , it has been revealed that two FBI Police Officers in Morgantown , West Virginia tried to use such equipment to watch teenage girls undress .
The two employees , Gary Sutton Jr. , 40 , and Charles Hommema , worked at the FBI satellite control room at the mall .
The pair allegedly hatched a plan to indulge their fantasies at an April 4 mall event , titled “ The Cinderella Project ” where high school girls modeled prom dresses for charity .
The pair allegedly used one of the building ’s built - in security cameras to zoom in on the make - shift dressing room which had no ceiling .
As the camera zoomed in closer and closer several teenagers entered the room , undressed and changed , and left .
It is not known how the pair ’s actions were noticed , but once they were , there was little doubt who was to blame as they were the only ones who had control of the camera .
The officers have been charged with conspiracy and committing criminal invasion of privacy .
Sutton is currently released on bond , while Hommema is scheduled to be arraigned later in the week .
The FBI released a statement , saying , “ The FBI is committed to the timely and full resolution of this matter , but must remain sensitive to the privacy concerns of any potential victims and their families . ”

1943 Twitter Challenge
by David ' Hades ' Becker [ Monday , 22nd of June 2009 - 07:49 PM ]
Want a chance to get your grubby mitts on some Battlefield 1943 for the platform of your choice ?
Have a digital camera and minor photoshop skills ?
Have access and the testicular fortitude to force a GameStop employee to take a picture with you while holding a game in your hands ?
Then does Dice and EA have a challenge for you to get 1943 in your hands .
Run through the games Official Twitter page and their actual home page , they are giving that chance I talked about .
It may sound a little silly , but all you have to do is get an employee at [ Insert Game Store Here ] to take a picture with you holding any copy of a Battlefield title .
Any at all .
Then you take your creativity and steady mouse hand and place character heads from BF1943 over the heads of everyone in the picture .
I 'm guessing , it 's not clear , you then upload said image and show it off on their forums or as a tweet to them .
No word on how they will be judged or winners are chosen , but it is a chance for those of you that did n't go to E3 and sit in a line that seemed like the purchase line for the XBox 720 .
It was always 400 strong and only 100 given out per hour for reference .
Here are the deets from their forum as well as links .
Get cracking !

Fast Facts
Consent is an ongoing process – you might agree to sex earlier on and then change your mind - everyone has the right to do this .
Giving your consent and getting your partner ’s consent may feel a bit awkward but ultimately sex is about communication and can and should be a positive and pleasurable experience .
The legal age to have sex in your country may be different depending on whether you ’re a boy or a girl .
It could also vary if you ’re gay or lesbian .
Any sexual contact without consent is wrong and illegal whatever the age of the people involved .
What is sexual consent ?
Sexual consent means agreeing to take part in any kind of sexual activity .
Having sex can and should be a positive and pleasurable experience when it ’s based on mutual respect and the consent of those involved .
You may feel nervous or awkward when talking about consent with your partner but ultimately it can and should feel good .
Sexual consent applies every time you have sex , and to any type of sexual activity at any stage , not just penetrative vaginal or anal sex .
It ’s impossible to say an overall “ yes ” to all sexual activity .
You ca n’t know exactly what your partner is thinking or what you ’re saying “ yes ” to .
How does consent work ‘ in the moment ’ ?
Be careful not to make any assumptions about what is okay for your partner or have expectations about what they will do .
Whether you ’re getting closer and about to start having sex or you ’re already ‘ in the moment ’ , consent is all about communication .
Getting consent when you do n’t know someone very well can be awkward as it can feel like you ’re changing the mood … and with regular partners we can forget to check , instead assuming that they ’re agreeing as they have in the past .
But it ’s important to keep communicating .
Saying “ yes ” now does n’t mean “ yes ” in the future
Giving consent for one type of sexual activity , one time , does n’t mean giving consent for going further or doing that type of activity again , or any sexual contact at all .
For example , agreeing to kiss someone does n’t mean you ’ve said “ yes ” to someone taking your clothes off .
Likewise , giving or receiving oral sex with someone in the past does n’t mean that you want to do that again or have any sexual contact at all with that person in the future .
You can change your mind !
You can say “ no ” ( withdraw your consent ) at any stage – you do n’t have to have a reason .
The best way to know whether you ’re both comfortable with any sexual activity is to talk about it , and get a very clear and enthusiastic ‘ YES ’!
Giving consent can look like this :
Asking your partner when you change the type or degree of sexual activity by saying , “ Is this okay ? ” and getting a clear and positive response .
Clearly agreeing to certain activities , either by saying “ yes ” or something else that ’s positive , like “ I ’m open to trying . ”
Using physical cues like letting out a sigh , reciprocating with a similar touch , looking your partner in the eye and smiling to let them know you ’re comfortable taking things to the next level .
Giving consent is NOT this :
Refusing to hear when someone says “ no ” and carrying on .
Assuming that wearing certain clothes , flirting , or kissing is an invitation for more .
Someone being under the legal age of consent .
Someone not having the freedom or capacity to make a choice because of drugs or alcohol .
Pressuring someone to have sex by intimidating them or making them feel scared .
Assuming you have consent because someone has given it in the past .
Even if you ’re good at communicating with your sexual partners , sometimes it ’s not clear what consent means in different situations .
What if you ’re in a relationship or married ?
Being in a relationship with someone or being married to them does not give them the right to do what they want to you – or you to them .
It ’s no different to sex with anyone else – you must both consent , each time and to each type of activity .
What if someone does n’t actually say the word “ no ” ?
They may say it in other ways , like “ not right now ” , “ I ’m not sure ” , or they might stay silent .
Their body language might also signal “ no ” – for example , by turning away , by curling up , or by not responding positively to touching .
What if you think or can feel that your partner is turned on ?
Sometimes our bodies will be turned on but we do n’t want to be touched .
Even if a penis is erect or the vagina is wet – it ’s not an automatic invitation .
Our minds may want the opposite of what our bodies are doing which can be confusing and uncomfortable .
Sometimes a person can feel turned on by someone ’s touch even when they have n’t consented .
If this happens , do n’t worry , communicate !
What does ‘ age of consent ’ mean ?
‘ Age of consent ’ is another way of saying the legal age to have sex .
When you can legally have sex will depend on what country you live in as laws are different around the world .
The most common age of sexual consent is 16 .
In some countries gay or lesbian sex is illegal .
Avert does not agree with any laws that criminalise homosexuality , but you can find out the situation in your country here .
Consensual underage sex – is it okay ?
If you have sex with someone when either or both of you are under the age of consent / ‘ underage ’ , then you ’re breaking the law – even if you ’re both consenting , the law says it ’s not okay .
This may seem unfair , but there ’s no set age that a person is ready for sex so the law is there to protect you .
You can find out more about the age of consent laws in your country on your government ’s website .
Sex between an underage person and an adult
If an adult has sex with someone under the age of consent , they ’re breaking the law .
They could be charged with :
Statutory rape which means having sex with a person who ’s under the age of consent , but past the age of puberty .
Unlike ‘ forcible rape ’ , statutory rape can mean that the person underage has said ‘ yes ’ .
Child sexual abuse which means that an adult has used their age and / or authority over a child ( before puberty ) to have sexual contact .
Sexual contact without consent is wrong and illegal whatever the age of the people involved .
If you do n’t give your consent and someone still forces you into having sex , it ’s never your fault and it ’s not okay .
You should speak to someone you trust if this has happened so that you can get help and support .
I ’m underage but I want to have sex
If you ’re too young to legally have sex it does n’t mean that you ca n’t get clued up about it or start exploring your sexual feelings .
You can find out a lot about sex by exploring your own body and what feels good to you .
Learning how to protect yourself from sexually transmitted infections ( STIs ) including HIV and unwanted pregnancy , will help you feel confident and in control when the time is right to have sex .

I imagine that when the Grammy - winning singer John Legend broke the news that he wanted to quit his job as a management consultant at the Boston Consulting Group to pursue music full time , some of his relatives were concerned about his career stability .
Obviously , he made the right choice .
Many stories do n’t turn out that way .
I have received pained e-mail messages from grown offspring of aspiring entrepreneurs who chucked it all to follow one failed venture after another .
A musician with a stable day job told me that after pursuing music seriously on the side , he was n’t so sure that he could take the lifestyle full time .
What separates crazy dreams from viable business ideas ?
I do n’t think that it has anything to do with the idea , or the profession , or the market itself .
It has to do with the person .
Jonathan Fields , a high - powered Wall Street lawyer , quit that job more than a decade ago to do personal training sessions in Central Park for $ 15 an hour .
But then he turned his passion into one of the most profitable fitness centers in New York .
He went on to start a flourishing yoga studio , which he sold after getting a deal from a major publishing house to write a career guide .
Real creative urges , those we are meant to express , do n’t go away .
If ignored , they bother us , affect our health , fester and eventually turn us into the living dead .

The new ship would be launched towards the end of the next decade
The Russian space agency is expected to unveil development plans for a next - generation manned spacecraft on Monday .
Roscosmos should name the ship 's prime developer , which has competed to win government funds for the project .
The proposed new spacecraft should enter into service sometime towards the end of the next decade .
It will replace the venerable three - seat Soyuz capsule , which has carried Russian cosmonauts into orbit for more than four decades .
Although Roscosmos has remained tight - lipped about the upcoming presentation , the agency has quietly released its requirements for a future manned transport system to the Russian space industry .
In doing so , the agency has shed some light on the ship 's likely design and its possible missions .
The spacecraft , currently known only by the Russian abbreviation PPTS , for Prospective Piloted Transport System , would be able to reach low - Earth orbit or to enter orbit around the Moon .
Several configurations
The Earth - orbiting version of the ship would have a mass of 12 tonnes , carry a crew of six , along with no less than 500kg of cargo ; while its " lunar cousin " would weigh 16.5 tonnes , have four seats and be capable of delivering and bringing back 100 kg of cargo .
The unmanned cargo version of the vehicle would be required to carry no less than 2,000kg to Earth orbit , and return at least 500 kg back to the planet 's surface .
Roscosmos has reserved the option of making the crew module of the spacecraft reusable , reckoning that a cone - shaped capsule could fly up to 10 missions during its 15 - year lifespan .
Soyuz also acts as the " lifeboat " at the International Space Station
In providing the technical specifications for the new spacecraft , the agency has also given a glimpse of its vision for the future of the Russian space programme .
Although the most capable version of the ship is meant to support expeditions to the Moon , " intermediate " configurations are intended for a variety of other tasks .
For example , the agency wants the future developer to evaluate the possibility of sending the ship into high - inclination orbits extending towards Earth 's poles , usually frequented by Earth - observation and spy satellites .
While in Earth 's orbit , the new spacecraft would have to be able to fly 30 - day - long autonomous missions ; or stay no less than a year in space when it is docked to the International Space Station , or to a possible future Russian space station .
( Currently , Soyuz spacecraft , which serve as " lifeboats " for the International Space Station , have to be replaced roughly every six months due to potential deterioration of some of their systems , such as batteries and propellant ) .
Martian possibilities
In addition to docking to the station , the spacecraft would have to be able to conduct servicing of unmanned vehicles in space and even remove pieces of space junk from their orbits , as well as conduct unspecified military tasks .
The lunar version of the ship would be capable of flying no less than 200 days in space when docked to a space station in orbit around the Moon .
A number of Russian reports have described recent studies looking at the possibility of a lunar orbital station , LOS .
Such an outpost would also serve as a hub for lunar modules , which would deliver crews from lunar orbit to the surface of the Moon .
Europe will now pursue its own plans , but incorporate Russian technology
The 200 - day mission requirement probably provides some hint about Russian plans to eventually build a permanently occupied lunar outpost , similar to Nasa 's lunar base developed under its Constellation programme .
In a recent interview with the ITAR - TASS news agency , Aleksei Krasnov , the head of the manned space flight directorate at Roscosmos , said that the future spacecraft could serve as the " core " technology for a future Martian mission .
This apparently referred to the role that the vehicle might play as a delivery and return craft for the large complex that would be needed to raise a manned assault on the Red Planet .
By the time the new Russian spacecraft could enter service around 2018 , the Soyuz family will have logged more than half a century in service .
In recent years , Russia and Europe did look at the possibility of developing the next - generation vehicle together , but the two parties could not agree on the work share .
Europe will now separately pursue the possibility of upgrading its robotic ATV space freighter to a manned ship , but still using some Russian technology .
Powerful launcher
As reported by BBC News last month , Roscosmos has already completed a tender for the new rocket that would carry the future manned vehicles into space .
Although the agency has delayed the announcement of the winner until at least 6 April , many unofficial sources in Russia maintain that TsSKB Progress , based in Samara , will lead the development of the new rocket .
It is believed that the launch vehicle will feature a three - booster first - stage , each booster equipped with powerful RD - 180 engines , burning a mix of liquid oxygen and kerosene .
Russia will also introduce a new fleet of launchers in the next few years
The engine was originally developed by Moscow - based NPO Energomash for the US Atlas 5 rocket and its performance to date has been impressive .
Ironically , Russian officials rejected a design of the yet - to - be flown Angara rocket that featured the RD - 180 .
Now , the power plant , which has earned such a fine reputation across the Atlantic , could return vindicated to its native land
The second stage of the new manned rocket would probably sport a pair of RD - 0124 engines , currently in use on the Soyuz - 2 rocket .
Thus , both stages of the future launcher would be equipped with the newest existing power plants , greatly reducing the cost and the risk to the overall project .

TEHRAN , Iran ( CNN ) --
An imprisoned Iranian - American journalist accused of spying for the United States was freed Monday , ending a four - month ordeal that became a focal point of tension between Washington and Tehran .
" We are very happy , " Roxana Saberi 's father said as he waited for his daughter outside Evin prison .
Noting that at one point during her incarceration his daughter underwent a hunger strike and had to be hospitalized , Reza Saberi added , " She was very desperate to get out .
...
She was quite relieved to know that the whole world is supporting her . "
In Washington , White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said President Obama was " relieved " at the news of the release .
" We know that this has been a trying time for her family and friends , and he looks forward to welcoming her home to the United States , " Gibbs said at a daily news briefing .
" We want to continue to stress that she was wrongly accused , but we welcome this humanitarian gesture . "
Roxana Saberi , 32 , was convicted last month on espionage charges in a one - day trial closed to the public .
She was sentenced to eight years in prison .
She denies the charges .
Monday 's reversal came a day after Iran 's court of appeals heard her case .
The court agreed with Saberi 's lawyers that because Iran is not at war with the United States , Saberi cannot be punished for cooperating with agents of a nation at war with Iran , according to Saberi 's spokesman , Abdolsamad Khorramshahi .
Her sentence was changed to a two - year jail term suspended for five years , Iran 's state - run news agency IRNA reported .
State - run Press TV , citing " officials close to the case , " reported that the suspended sentence " will be automatically abolished if Saberi shows no unlawful conduct in the next five years . "
" Obviously , we continue to take issue with the charges against her and the verdicts rendered , " U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said .
" But we are very heartened that she has been released and wish her and her family all of the very best we can send their way . "
Reza Saberi said the family will return to their home in the United States " as soon as we can make arrangements for the trip . "
Through her ordeal , Roxana Saberi , who has lived in Iran since 2003 and reported for several news organizations , became a symbol of the fight for journalists ' freedoms worldwide .
" We are thrilled , " said Joel Simon , executive director of the Committee to Protect Journalists .
" But this is also a moment to reflect on the difficult conditions that Iranian journalists endure every day .
Several Iranian journalists remain jailed today .
We urge they be given the same opportunity for judicial review that was afforded to Roxana Saberi . "
Dave Aeikens , president of the Society of Professional Journalists , said , " Iran has a long way to go in guaranteeing freedom of the press , but this is one small indication that there is hope for the future . "
The fight for Saberi 's freedom took an unusual twist last month , when Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad sent a letter to Tehran 's prosecutor calling for justice in her case and the case of Hossein Derakhshan , an Iranian - Canadian blogger imprisoned in the country since November .
Reporters Without Borders , a group that fights for journalists ' rights worldwide , says Derakhshan was sentenced to four years in prison for disseminating the views of one ayatollah and for " publicity against the government . "
Saberi was detained in January after initially being accused of buying a bottle of wine and working as a journalist without proper accreditation , according to the Committee to Protect Journalists .
She was soon charged with espionage .
" Without press credentials and under the name of being a reporter , she was carrying out espionage activities , " Hassan Haddad , a deputy public prosecutor , recently told the Iranian Student 's News Agency .
Authorities said Saberi confessed .
Her father has said he thinks she was coerced into making damaging statements .
The whole experience has been " very depressing " for her , and she has gone through a great deal of frustration , Saberi 's father said Monday .
" It will take some time before she can overcome it . "
He added , " It 's not the [ Iranian ] people ; they are very friendly .
We do n't understand why it happened . "

Quick , name the country that plans to impose a mandatory Internet censoring regime that will , among other things , block access to all video games intended for anyone over the age of 15 ?
Answer : Australia .
The Australian government has pressed ahead with a trial of its proposed Internet filtering system , this despite the fact that — by its own admission — " there are no success criteria as such . "
The scheme would involve a mandatory filtering service that would block access to all material " refused classification " by Australia 's government - run ratings agency .
This includes child pornography , bestiality , truly deviant / abusive sexual behavior ... and plenty of video games !
( A second , optional filtering tier was designed to offer families an option for addition filtering of legal pornography on the Web . )
The video games ratings issue stems from a quirk of Australia 's content rating system .
Movies can be classified as G , PG , M , MA 15 + , R 18 + , and X 18 + , but video games only go as high as MA 15 +.
There are no additional classifications that might allow violent titles like Fallout 3 , which therefore had to alter its content to be sold in the country .
Any game that fails to qualify for one of these ratings is " refused classification " and can't be sold in Australia .
All of which means that that the mandatory filtering scheme will block access to downloadable games , Flash games , and even stores that sell physical games which do n't qualify for the MA 15 + rating .
The Sydney Morning Herald checked in with a spokesperson for Senator Stephen Conroy , Australia 's Communications Minister , to see if the logic here was applicable to the filter .
It was .
The government does n't intend to start rating every website on the Web , but the system will work much as it does now : upon receiving a complaint , the ratings board will examine the link , rate the content , and add it to the database .
If it is refused classification , it will be blocked .
While the mandatory Internet filtering system is new , the government already uses legal threats to enforce a similar regime .
Back in May , Electronic Frontiers Australia ( a group much like the EFF in the US ) got in trouble with the government for posting a hyperlink to graphic abortion footage .
The site in question was already on Australia 's blacklist , and if EFA did n't remove the link , its Web host could be fined AUS $ 11,000 per day .
" To be clear , EFA published only a link to a page that is hosted overseas and is on ACMA ’s prohibited list , " said the group .
" Viewing the potentially R- rated page itself is not in any way illegal , and no system is yet in place to enforce the blocking of such web pages .
One may well wonder why a link to a legally viewable page should draw the threat of legal sanction while the content itself remains visible .
Because the link was on a web page hosted in Australia , the hosting provider — not EFA ourselves , who have more control over the content — falls under Australian legal jurisdiction and could be so served .
What this accomplishes is uncertain . "
The entire system raises troubling questions about freedom of speech , cost , and efficacy — some of which we should have more information about after the trials wrap up in July .
The government 's censoring plans are unusual ( to put it mildly ) when compared to US and European practice , and they have been drawing sharp criticism not just in Australia but in other countries as well .
The UK's Internet Service Provider Association has even included Senator Conroy on its 2009 shortlist of Internet villains " for continuing to promote network - level blocking despite significant national and international opposition . "
None of that has stopped the plan from going ahead , but it has ( perhaps inevitably ) lead to the creation of the " Fake Stephen Conroy " Twitter account .

Very naughty indeed . "
Porn on the bayou : Adult film star running for US Senate in Louisiana
Stormy Daniels , who ’s gunning for David Vitter ’s U.S. Senate seat in Louisiana , is not your typical political candidate .
She ’s makes adult movies .
But she ’s not just a porn star .
She ’s also a porn writer , director and producer .
Next week Stormy ’s launching a “ Listening Tour ” across Louisiana .
She ’s hitting Baton Rouge on Tuesday and New Orleans on Wednesday to find out about the issues and concerns of Louisiana ’s regular people .
“ I wanted to take over the world and I guess ‘ senator ’ is a good place to start , right ? ” Ms. Daniels observed .
“ I ’ve been handed a golden opportunity and I should take advantage of it . ”
Daniels does n’t think her career will be a problem for the voters of Louisiana , because David Vitter , her Republican opponent has his own sex issues .
In 2007 he was connected to Deborah Jeane Palfrey , the “ D.C. Madam ” via phone records .
Stormy Daniels .
She may be the first candidate in history to announce in advance that she ’s willing to screw her constituents .

( CNN ) --
The Iowa Supreme Court unanimously rejected a state law Friday that banned same - sex marriage , and opponents wasted little time in pushing for a state constitutional amendment that could send the issue to voters .
Larry Hoch , left , and David Twombley , one of six couples that filed suit , celebrate Friday at a news conference .
But nothing could dampen the spirits of the six same - sex couples who shouted and clapped at a news conference held by Lambda Legal after hearing the court 's opinion .
Lambda Legal bills itself as the nation 's oldest and largest legal group working for the civil rights of gays .
Two by two , the excited couples -- some with children -- spoke at the briefing .
" Good morning , my name is Kate Varnum , and I 'd like to introduce you to my fiance , Trish Varnum .
I never thought I 'd be able to say that . "
Dawn BarbouRoske told the group , " We 're proud that our kids will be able to grow up knowing their family is respected . "
Her daughter added : " Hi , I 'm McKinley , and I 'm really , really happy .
I feel that my family has always had this right , and today it is true .
No longer shall we be just people who are n't allowed to be married .
We are able to get married . "
Lambda Legal filed the lawsuit against Polk County 's former recorder on behalf of the six same - sex couples .
" This is a great day for civil rights in Iowa , " said former Iowa Solicitor - General Dennis Johnson , a co-counsel with Lambda Legal .
" Go get married .
Live happily ever . "
The court 's decision becomes effective in 21 days , and county recorders then will be required to grant marriage licenses to same - sex couples , Lambda senior staff attorney Camilla Taylor said at the news conference .
" You do not have to be an Iowan to seek a license here , " she said , and Iowa should recognize same - sex marriages from other states .
Iowa will become the third state in the nation to allow same - sex marriage , after Massachusetts and Connecticut .
Not everyone was pleased .
" It 's , quite frankly , a disaster , " said Brian English , a spokesman for the Iowa Family Policy Center , a nonprofit research and educational organization committed to strengthening the family .
" Obviously , we 're extremely disappointed , " he said .
" We 're saddened .
Perhaps a little bit surprised in the unanimous decision that the court handed down . "
English , who said opponents of gay marriage prayed outside the courthouse Friday as they awaited the court 's decision , already has begun lobbying the legislature for an Iowa Marriage Amendment .
" It ( the proposed amendment ) will be very brief .
It will reaffirm in the state constitution that marriage is the union of one man and one woman , " he said .
" We 're beginning the next step in the process . "
A spokesman for One Iowa , which supports gay and lesbian equality , said the earliest the issue could get on a ballot would be 2012 .
Friday 's decision upheld a 2007 ruling by a lower court that Iowa 's 1998 law limiting marriage to heterosexual couples went against the state 's constitution .
The state 's highest court determined that " the Iowa statute limiting civil marriage to a union between a man and a woman violates the equal protection clause of the Iowa Constitution , " court spokesman Steve Davis said in a written statement .

" The decision strikes the language from Iowa Code section 595.2 limiting civil marriage to a man and a woman .
It further directs that the remaining statutory language be interpreted and applied in a manner allowing gay and lesbian people full access to the institution of civil marriage , " the statement on the court 's Web site says .
The Iowa Supreme Court said it has the responsibility to determine whether a law enacted by the legislative branch and enforced by the executive branch violates the Iowa Constitution .
" The court reaffirmed that a statute inconsistent with the Iowa Constitution must be declared void , even though it may be supported by strong and deep - seated traditional beliefs and popular opinion , " the court said .
Polk County District Judge Robert Hanson earlier determined that the law violated the state constitution 's guarantee of equal protection and hurt gay and lesbian couples " in numerous tangible and intangible " ways .
" Civil marriage in Iowa is the only gateway to an extensive legal structure that protects a married couple 's relationship and family in and outside the state , " Hanson ruled in Des Moines .
" Iowa reserves an unparalleled array of rights , obligations and benefits to married couples and their families , privileging married couples as a financial and legal unit and stigmatizing same - sex couples . "
The case was joined on appeal by several state lawmakers who opposed Hanson 's ruling , calling it " a mockery of the judicial system . "
They argued that the ruling stepped on the state legislature 's authority by using the courts " to effectuate fundamental changes in public policies regarding marriage . "
At the news conference , Jason Morgan , who was with his partner , Chuck Swaggerty , said they had been together nearly 12 years .
" We 've been together in sickness and health , through the death of his mother , through the adoption of our children , through four long years of this legal battle , " Morgan said , choking up .
" And if being together through all of that is n't love and commitment or is n't family or is n't marriage , then I do n't know what is . "

Hey everyone ,
In March I ’ll be turning 50 .
Nobody knows what 2021 is going to look like .
But I ’m an optimist and I think it ’s going to be great , so I ’ve already started planning my mid-life crisis .
I 'm making some changes to the way I produce my work , and shifting focus between some of the projects I 'm working on .
PvP is going to be moving to a 3 day a week schedule .
We ’ll be posting new strips every Monday , Wednesday , and Friday for the foreseeable future .
Online content is consumed so much different now than it was in the late 90s and early aughts .
People consume most of their content via social media and when they do visit a website it ’s usually once a week to catch up on what they missed with adblockers ( understandably ) running .
Our readership is as high as it ’s ever been , but ad revenue is almost non-existent .
Which frankly I do n’t mind .
Ads were always a necessary evil and nobody likes them even when they ’re done well ( ourselves included ) .
It costs money to make new merchandise and conventions are canceled until the 30th of vaccine , in the year of our lord twenty - twenty - something .
RIGHT NOW the best way to support this strip is by backing the PvP Patreon .
Cory crunched the numbers and each reader currently generates 2.8 cents per month .
That ’s 36 cents a year .
If you think PvP is worth more than that , you could become a patron and help us pay our bills .
It ’s the simplest and most direct way to help us keep making PvP .
Hands down .
And we appreciate every one of you .
Meanwhile , I ’m working on a middle - grade graphic novel .
It ’s about a young girl named Val who uses her love of Dungeons & Dragons to make friends and survive Middle School .
It ’s a project very dear to me and one I plan to see through to the end .
I really want to expand my work to younger audiences and introduce them to the power of roleplaying and shared storytelling .
Working on this story , preparing pitch - packets for publishers , and honing my craft has been essential in lifting my spirits and keeping my creativity sparking these last few difficult months .
I know that things are uncertain right now .
Everyone is exhausted and frightened .
Now more than ever , we need people to make things that uplift , inspire , and offer an escape .
I plan to work hard , rest well , and wake brave .
I hope you ’ll do the same .
As always , thank you for reading .
Thank you for all the love and support you ’ve given us over two decades .
Thank you for this life .
- Scott
Update :
Holy shit , it ’s stopped .
I re-ran the same experiments a few times over the course of the day to try things that people suggested ( for example , using the IP address instead of the name “ testserv.mydomain.com ” — which made no difference , incidentally ) , and my results were the same every time .
Just now , I tried again , and the traffic makes it from ‘ homemachine ’ to ‘ testserv ’ completely unadulterated .
Now all you frenzied slashdotters can tell me I imagined the whole thing .
Let ’s see if it lasts …
[ original post left for posterity ]
We all know about the annoying DNS tricks folks like Comcast play , right ?
The ones where you mistype a site name and you end up on an annoying advertising page because their DNS server resolves it to their own server ?
Well , it ’s worse than you think .
See , some people are actually savvy enough to simply not use Comcast ’s DNS servers so they do n’t get this obnoxious behavior .
But Comcast has put a stop to that , at least for some people .
( Full disclosure : I do n’t know if it ’s Comcast or Earthlink that ’s responsible for this behavior , but Comcast is who I pay for internet access , so I ’m blaming them for now , even though it ’s obvious Earthlink is involved ) .
What they actually do is to take any UDP traffic bound for port 53 on any server and redirect it to their own server .
This means that you simply can’t use a different DNS server , even if you have one .
Here ’s a little experiment I did to prove it .
There are three computers involved : “ testserv.mydomain.com ” is a Slicehost machine I have for various experiments ( note : actual domain is not mydomain.com , of course ) .
“ homemachine ” is my laptop , sitting at home and connecting via Fucking Comcast .
“ okok ” is a machine which is elsewhere ( does n’t matter where other than to say it ’s not connected via Goddamn Comcast ) .
All of these machines are running Ubuntu linux ( Hardy , in case you care ) .
Step 1 : Start a fake DNS server on testserv :
On the server , run the following command :
testserv$ sudo nc - l -p 53 -u | od -hc
This listens for UDP packets on port 53 , which is where DNS requests will show up , and it prints them to stdout after piping them through ‘ od ’ so the binary garbage does n’t hose up my terminal .
Step 2 : Test it from a known good computer ( “ okok ” )
On the “ good ” machine ( “ good ” in this case means it is not using comcast ) , run this command :
okok $ nslookup comcast.sucks.com testserv.mydomain.com
On the server , I see the following output from the nc process :
0000000 69f4 0001 0100 0000 0000 0000 6307 6d6 f 364 i 001 001 \a c o m 0000020 6163 7473 7305 6375 736 b 6303 6d6 f 0000 c a s t 005 s u c k s 003 c o m 0000040 0001 f401 0169 0000 0001 0000 0000 0700 001 001 364 i 001 001 \a 0000060 6f63 636d 7361 0574 7573 6b63 0373 6f63 c o m c a s t 005 s u c k s 003 c o 0000100 006d 0100 0100 69f4 0001 0100 0000 0000 m 001 001 364 i 001 001 0000120 0000 6307 6d6 f 6163 7473 7305 6375 736 b \a c o m c a s t 005 s u c k s
Now , granted , the “ DNS server ” we have set up is just netcat , and it will never respond , so the client tries a few times ( the above hex dump shows three requests ) , and then eventually gives up :
; ; connection timed out ; no servers could be reached okok $
This is what we ’d expect .
We ’ve proven that an nslookup from ‘ okok ’ to ‘ testserv ’ makes it through to our fake server , which does n’t respond .
So far so good .
Step 3 : Try it from the home machine ( via comcast ) :
Same test , but from the machine behind comcast :
homemachine $ nslookup comcast.sucks.com testserv.mydomain.com
Server : testserv.mydomain.com
Address : [ censored ] #53 Non-authoritative answer : Name : comcast.sucks.com
Address : 207.69.131.9 Name : comcast.sucks.com
Address : 207.69.131.10 homemachine $
Well look at that !
The request succeeded !
Even though we explicitly specified a server which does n’t actually respond !
And we can see from netcat that the server never even received a request !
Oh joy !
The astute reader will notice that the addresses returned are those of the Earthlink host - not - found advertising page .
Step 4 : Verdict
Comcast can suck it .
Note that this setup actually causes me a lot of problems , because Comcast seems to have a hell of a time keeping their DNS servers actually functioning .
Tonight I spent about 30 minutes connected to the internet and able to contact any server I knew the address of with no trouble , but DNS requests all failed because their DNS server was down .
This happens frequently .
Back in the day when I could , I ’d simply manually point my machines at a known good DNS server and continue on , but now these fuckers actually hijack my DNS requests and send them to their broken server .
Thanks a lot , assholes .
You just earned yourself a support call , which is a complete waste of my time and your money .
The support folks just have me reboot my modem until the problem goes away , which it eventually does regardless of whether I call or not .
And nobody there is particularly receptive to or capable of understanding the troubleshooting I ’ve done .
This is why your customers hate you , you fuckers .
Step 5 : Solutions
I have n’t actually set this up yet , because it ’s going to be a pain in the ass and frankly , I shoudl n’t fucking have to , but here ’s what you ’re going to force me to do , Comcast .
I ’m going to set up a bind proxy which tunnels requests to an outside host ( e.g. testserv ) via SSH so the packet - sniffing dicks ca n’t get their grubby mitts on them .
Fuck you for making this necessary .
You suck .
Addenda
Note 1 : Someone either here or on slashdot commented that there might be a problem looking up “ testserv.mydomain.com ” from the home machine , which is why the request ends up not going to my server .
This theory does n’t hold water , because nslookup will complain in that case , plus I actually performed a similar experiment using TCP port 53 and netcat on both ends .
The name was resolved fine , TCP port 53 makes it through .
Switching to UDP and netcat on both ends results in the traffic going to Earthlink ’s servers .
Note 2 : It ’s true , I have no actual proof this is being done by Comcast .
Let ’s just say that someone controlling the path between me and my server really wants me to use a different DNS server than the one I ’m trying to use .
And the server they want me to use returns Earthlink error pages .
Note 3 : Someone named “ ComcastBonnie ” over on twitter , who seems to be some kind of official Comcast twitsperson , is vociferously denying this .
For a while today , she was just tweeting “ engineering confirms we do not hijack any DNS traffic in our network and certainly not to 3rd party resolvers ” over and over .
I have yet to see any plausible alternative explanations for the results of my very simple experiments .
Am I missing something ?
Tell me .
The MTA officially has sold naming rights to one of its busiest subway stations in Brooklyn .
That means McDonald 's 42nd Street and Taco Bell 59th Street - Columbus Circle could be right around the corner -- or not .
Sell the name of a station to an advertiser :
It 's a business strategy the cash - strapped agency has been developing for years .
But no one has been willing to pay up until now .
Strangely enough , it 's a London - based bank that wants first dibs on subway stops at Atlantic Avenue / Pacific Street transit hub .
The $ 4 million deal got approved today , which means all of the subway stations at the busy Brooklyn hub will have Barclays Center added to their names .
Why does a British bank with a Manhattan office want its name on Crooklyn subway stations ?
Barclays Center , the sports stadium intended to be the center of the Atlantic Yards project , will be finished in the next few years .
And Atlantic Yards ' developer Forest City Ratner offered the MTA $ 200,000 annually over the next two decades to change the name of the second most bustling station in Brooklyn to reflect the focal point of its $ 4.9 - billion project .
If one company can buy rights to change the name of subway stations , a New Yorker might ask , what 's next ?
Coca - Cola 59th Street - Lex ? Pepsi 5th Avenue - 53rd ?
Either and more could be on the horizon if the MTA has its way .
In the past , subway stations used to be named based on where they were located , but the MTA is jumping on the chance to raise revenue for the transit system by allowing advertisers to buy in .
" It ’s always a question of balancing our need for revenue and our stewardship of public space , ” MTA spokesman Jeremy Soffin told The New York Times .
But just because a company wants to brand itself on a subway station does n't mean the advertising will work in its favor .
No one 's going to buy an ad that does n't make sense .
“ To be effective , the viewer needs to understand the relevance of the ad , ” branding expert Allen Adamson told the Times .
“ To rename the 59th and Lex stop the McDonald ’s stop — it ai n’t going to work .
I do n’t think it will stick . ”
That 's not going to stop companies from trying .
The Barclays name change is scheduled for 2012 in line with the opening of the new arena .
Forest City Ratner would pay for the new signs and the MTA would slowly incorporate the name change into city maps once the stadium opens , the Times reports .
All of this could hinge on a deal for the Vanderbilt Yard -- a process that has been embroiled in controversy since the project was announced six years ago .
The MTA is expected to vote this morning on a proposed payment plan for Forest City Ratner .
The Empire State Development Corporation voted yesterday that the company only has to pay the MTA $ 20 million upfront to acquire the land and start work .
However , that would apply only if the agency can find buyers for its tax - exempt bonds for the project , according to The New York Post .
Initially , Ratner was supposed to pay a one - time amount of $ 100 million before construction began .
If the new deal is approved , the company would have more than two decades to pay off the rest of the multi-billion - dollar 22 - acre development .
" This is crazy .
The MTA needs this cash now to invest in physical assets like subway cars and signal refurbishment ; its budget for these areas already faces a huge cash shortfall , " wrote the Manhattan Institute 's Nicole Gelinas in a Post op - ed .
" Remember , the MTA is so cash - strapped that it had to beg the state for a permanent $ 2 billion - a - year bailout a couple of months back .
Yet now , in effect , it 's proposing to lend money to a speculative developer at a 6.5 percent interest rate for decades .
That rate is laughable . "
The whole thing is laughable , according to the watchdogs who 've been bemoaning it for years .
When the project was announced in 2003 , it was slated to open in 2006 .
It was supposed to include vast public benefits -- affordable housing , cool architecture and jobs for minorities -- that earned the site hundreds of millions in tax breaks but have since disappeared .
" Every year the goalposts move , " Norman Oder cautions on his blog .
Oder does n't pin all his ire on Ratner or the MTA , however .
He partially blames the media for going along with it because of their own interests .
" The New York Times , which yesterday offered a truncated and contemptible print account of the deal expected between the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and Forest City Ratner for the Vanderbilt Yard , today offers a lengthy , fluffy story headlined M.T.A. Sells Naming Rights to Subway Station , " he wrote in the Atlantic Yards Report .
" A little skepticism -- or at least a little hedging -- is in order , especially since FCR is the parent New York Times Company 's business partner in the Times Tower . "
My name is Stephen Belber and I am a playwright ... and I ’m not sure why .
Or let me put it this way : I make a tidy living writing studio screenplays ; an indie movie just came out that I wrote and directed ; and if all goes well , I ’ll be directing another of my scripts in the near future -- all of which has led me to seriously question the Sisyphean endeavor that is playwriting .
I mean let ’s be serious , even Tony Kushner ’s writing movies now , so what kind of wall are the rest of us banging our heads against ?
Now granted , there are reasons to keep writing plays ( and , indeed , I have one of my own ) , but let ’s not start having parties about them .
Playwriting is difficult , lonely and vastly underpaid compared with screenwriting .
Getting either plays or screenplays produced often depends on luck , but at least Hollywood does n’t try to trick writers into thinking that “ projects of integrity ” are n’t really just profit - motive - disguised - as - art .
Which is n’t to say a lot of great movies do n’t come out of Hollywood , for they certainly do .
The difference is that in theater , it ’s easy to think that the work you ’re doing is sacrosanct , when the reality is that box office counts just as much on Broadway as it does in Hollywood , and producers will drop you with the same exact speed if the numbers are n’t there .
So why do we keep writing plays ?
The standard answer has always tended to be , “ Because nowhere else but in the sacred space of a theater can there be a dialogue with the community that is pure and uncompromised by your own financial motive , studio greed or Gary Busey ’s hair implant schedule . ”
Now this , of course , is true .
There are no rules in theater , and if there are , they generally boil down to the fundamental : “ Do n’t write a sucky play . ”
But even this is n’t true , because there are thousands of sucky plays written every year .
( And films as well , because there is no corresponding sucky screenplay rule , as we all know . )
The point is that theater is not a medium in which the writer is obliged to provide Page 30 and Page 90 “ arc- enhancing ” act breaks , or happy endings , or sad ones with glimmers of optimism at the very end .
And only rarely are we asked to execute notes inspired by studio executives ’ childhood memories of that time when they happily sledded down the hill and all was incomprehensively blissful .

In theater , you really can have two people alone in a room talking about the death penalty for three hours .
In fact , one of the most liberating and satisfying feelings in the world of writing may well be returning to the rule - free world of plays -- of play -- after having slavishly devoted all your recent energy to making sure that a word commonly used for lovemaking does n’t appear more than twice in your screenplay to ensure a PG - 13 rating .
In fact , my most recent play , “ The Muscles in Our Toes , ” practically goes out of its way to use a wide array of lovemaking synonyms -- as verbs , nouns , adjectives , pronouns , proper nouns , glorified prepositions and choking devices .
( I ’m hoping many studio executives will attend this play so that they might subsequently hire me to write a remake of “ Shampoo ” meets “ Must Love Dogs ” meets “ A History of Violence . ”
But the fact remains that I ’m sick and tired of writing ambitious - play - of - integrity after ambitious - play - of - integrity , only to have them bypassed by regional theaters for being too “ edgy , ” or rejected by off - Broadway theaters for being too bland , or not even read by Broadway producers for having too politically sounding a title .
And besides , if one is lucky enough to get a play produced , there ’s an incredibly good chance that no matter how well it goes , a New York Times critic will come by on a night when he has a slightly elevated fever or a blister or an irritable wart and write a review that will make you wish you ’d gone into plastics after all .
Characters count

So now I often ask myself : Is n’t it just better to write for Hollywood ?
After all , the projects I ’ve been able to sell to the studios ( thanks to my proffered guise as a playwright - of - integrity ) , have satisfied my desire for researching and writing about lofty and socially relevant topics -- such as the war in Iraq , the Swiss banking scandal , the early AIDS - activism fight against the big pharmaceuticals .
And though those have n’t yet been produced , I am now able to afford a fancy computer and 154 - grain bread and expensive lipstick for those moments when I feel like wearing expensive lipstick .
Why go back to theater ?
Well , here ’s one : Good characters .
All my best characters started out on stage .
This may be because many of my characters -- like me -- have no idea what they ’re talking about .
Most of the characters I create tend to be equipped with language but woefully ill - equipped when it comes to accurately and honestly expressing their selves , a dilemma I find to be rather human .
The world often appears to me to be full of good talkers but hungry for those who know how to use language to express something true and worth hearing , and that contributes to a communal dialogue .
But do n’t get me wrong , I love people who try to chisel away at the gargantuan rock of language in an attempt to create something sculpted and meaningful .
In fact , my plays are often about small , occasionally odd individuals trying to articulate what they are convinced are their vital two cents .
( And sometimes those cents are vital . )
Advertisement
What I ’ve discovered about my “ process ” is that without theater as a breeding - ground , my characters tend to fall short of full development , for they lack specificity in their fundamental . . . unspecific - ness .
A ‘sacred venue ’
One of the many things that appeals to me about humanity ( besides organic grocery markets ) is our quixotic attempts at self - expression despite the obstacles of occasionally meager intelligence , extreme emotional immaturity and oft - misguided passion .
Thus for me , theater , among many other things , is a perfect place in which to release characters like this .
Theater is that “ sacred venue ” within which they can communally dialogue with themselves and the audience , and in which a playwright can acquire immense knowledge as to who they are and what they are trying to say .
This will sound controversial -- and please know that I am not at all advocating theater as merely a useful way - station for film -- but at this moment in my career ( which you ’ve probably never even heard of anyway ) , I have found playwriting to be a hugely beneficial learning experience in terms of what I am trying to say .
Which often means that after a theater production , with its many rewrites and repeated viewings and even the critical ( and often , I hate to admit , very thoughtful ) responses of reviewers , I have found myself ready to take my characters to a different level , a new iteration where their inarticulateness can be pared down , honed and made more precise and profound .

The medium of film -- with its visual splendor , its capacity for in - your - face intimacy , its ability to show the emotions and detail between the words -- can add exhilarating layers to already defined and emerged characters , allowing them to this time say a little less ( in their own , inarticulate ways ) -- and in so doing , say a lot more .
Which is not to imply they become more articulate on screen ; they just sort of . . . are inarticulate better .
Because , remember , they really had no idea what they were talking about in the first place .
Belber ’s plays - to - movies include “ Tape ” and “ The Laramie Project ” ( co- writer ) and “ Management , ” which opened last week .
His play , “ McReele , ” is currently in development with Overbrook and Sony
ACCESS has unveiled the next major version of its Linux - based mobile software platform .
The ACCESS Linux Platform ( ALP ) 3.0 brings a significant user interface overhaul with support for rich visual effects .
It also boosts interoperability by delivering LiMo compliance .
ALP was developed by PalmSource , a software company that split from Palm in 2003 and was subsequently acquired by ACCESS in 2005 .
ALP 's PalmSource legacy makes it sort of a spiritual successor to the original PalmOS , but it 's important to note that ACCESS is not related to Palm and that ALP is not related in any way to the Linux - based platform that Palm is developing today .
We took a close look at ALP last year with a detailed hands - on overview .
ALP leverages components of the GNOME mobile and embedded stack , which means that third - party developers can use GTK + to build applications that will run on the platform .
It also includes a Java runtime , a Garnet emulator that enables support for legacy Palm applications , and a Web widget runtime that allows developers to build applications with HTML and JavaScript .
In October , ACCESS announced plans to release a new version that would supply a more modern user experience .
The new version was unveiled this week at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona .
Hardware advancements and more powerful chips , such as TI 's OMAP3 series , make it possible to create interactive user interfaces that support sophisticated visual effects and animation .
ALP 's new user interface takes advantage of these next - generation mobile hardware capabilities and OpenGL ES to facilitate richer interaction .
It uses the Clutter toolkit , a GObject - based scenegraph system that is also used by Nokia 's Maemo platform and Intel 's Moblin platform .
ALP 3.0 is designed with clean separation between application logic and presentation so that carriers and handset makers can make extensive customizations to the look and feel of the platform .
LiMo compliance is also another major improvement in the new version of ALP .
LiMo is a coalition of prominent software vendors , handset makers , and mobile carriers that are collaborating to develop interoperable Linux - based platforms for smartphones and other handheld devices .
LiMo provides its own preintegrated platform stack and also provides a baseline for interoperability between derivative third - party platforms .
ACCESS has contributed a significant number of components to the LiMo stack .
ALP 3.0 is the first version of ALP that passes LiMo 's certification test .
" We remain committed to setting the standard for mobile Linux devices , and ACCESS Linux Platform v3.0 is the next step in our technology evolution , " said ACCESS co-CEO Tomihisa Kamada in a statement .
" The flexibility , modularity and openness of Linux make it ideal for mobile operators to deliver customized services -- and our ACCESS Linux Platform v3.0 and ACCESS Linux Platform mini products make this customization easy to develop and market to consumers . "
When ALP first emerged from PalmSource several years ago , the mobile platform landscape was very different .
Back then , the preintegrated Linux options were pretty limited , Symbian was still a proprietary operating system , and Apple had n't yet launched the iPhone .
Today , there are a growing number of open source mobile options that can be used without licensing costs .
User expectations have also been entirely redefined by the iPhone user experience , which has put enormous competitive pressure on conventional platform vendors .
To play a major role in the rapidly growing smartphone market , ACCESS will have to produce a top - notch software platform .
ALP 3.0 is a big step in that direction and the user interface improvements are definitely impressive .

Preliminary results are in for PC sales in the first quarter of this year .
Echoing Gartner 's recent report predicting a fairly grim outlook for 2009 , the numbers show a significant 6.5 percent year - over - year decline in PC shipments worldwide for Q1 .
Meanwhile , US PC shipments have recovered somewhat over the sharp decline experienced in Q4 .
And while Dell continues to cede significant market share to HP , Acer , and Toshiba , Apple 's impressive growth over the last couple of years seems to have run smack into a brick wall .
Worldwide , HP continues to hold on to the top spot , seeing a 2.6 percent growth in unit shipments for the first quarter .
Acer , rallying on increased demand for inexpensive netbooks and desktops , saw a big increase of 26.7 percent , moving up to 13 percent market share , just a tenth of a point behind second - place Dell .
The beleaguered Dell is barely holding on to the number two spot , and felt the sting of a 16.9 percent drop in unit shipments .
Fifth - ranked Toshiba saw a nice 18.4 increase year - over - year , while forth - ranked Lenovo saw a 7.7 percent dip .
Other manufacturers together saw a 15.6 percent drop .
" Low priced mobile PCs continued to be the growth driver for the PC industry in most regions , " said Mikako Kitagawa , principal analyst at Gartner , in a statement .
The race to the bottom in prices will continue to drive down average selling prices and whittle down already razor - thin margins that most PC makers earn .
Data source : Gartner
In the US , the picture is n't much better .
Overall shipments are down three - tenths of a percent year - over - year .
That 's better than the 10 percent decline from last quarter , but it 's still an overall decline .
Second place
Dell took yet another beating , ceding 5 points of market share with shipments down 16.3 percent .
Top seller HP nabbed a big chunk of that , as did number five Toshiba .
And Acer made out big on its budget netbooks , making an impressive 49.5 percent increase in unit shipments .
" Low priced mobile PCs led market growth in the US , " said Ms. Kitagawa , just as they did globally .
" Mini notebooks did well in the challenging economic environment where consumers ' number one priority was to save money , and continued to put pressure on low priced mobile PCs . "
This affected mainly consumer market segments , but budget - strapped schools are also looking into using netbooks to implement or expand one - to - one programs .
Data source : Gartner
Meanwhile Apple , with its reluctance to lower prices or compete much in the low - end market , may finally be feeling the full sting of the recession .
The company experienced tremendous growth over the last few years , averaging about 33 percent growth since the beginning of 2007 .
While the company managed to maintain a scant 8.4 percent positive growth in year - over - year shipments during the first quarter , according to these early estimates Apple will record a 1.1 percent drop in shipments — the first year - over - year drop in several years .
The company 's iPod and iPhone business takes the sting out of this somewhat , and the company still enjoys healthy margins on its products .
But it can't feel good to give up so much of its hard - earned market share , which peaked as high as 9.5 percent in Q3 last year .
PC makers still face a tough road ahead for 2009 .
Low - priced netbooks continue to increase in sales even as overall shipments decline .
Looking to the rest of the year , there are some big questions : Will Apple jump in the game with lower - priced systems , or ride the storm out on its $ 25 billion in the bank ?
And will netbook maker Acer finally surpass the ailing Dell to become the number two PC maker ?
Wounded Knee
Narrator :
On a cold night in February 1973 , a caravan rolled through the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota .
The cars were packed with 200 Indians — men and women , local Oglala Lakota and members of the urban militant group , the American Indian Movement .
They headed toward the hallowed ground of Wounded Knee , the site of the last massacre of the Indian Wars .
Carter Camp , Former AIM Leader , Ponca Tribe : Going into Wounded Knee that night when it was dark and scary , we were clinging to our weapons tightly and we knew that a battle was gonna come .
And I was sitting there thinking of some of these young men that are around me , am I committing them to - to die ?
Madonna Thunder Hawk , Former AIM Member , Two Kettle Lakota : I was ready to do whatever it takes for change .
I did n’t care .
I had children ; and for them I figured I could make a stand here .
Joseph Trimbach , Former FBI Agent :
They were up to no good .
I mean why would they be traveling in a caravan with all these weapons and all these Molotov cocktails if they were n't going to engage in some kind of destructive activity ?
Narrator :
By the 1970’s , Native people , once masters of the continent , had become invisible , consigned to the margins of American life .
Their anger and frustration would explode in Wounded Knee .
Russel Means , Former AIM Leader , Oglala Lakota Tribe :
We were about to be obliterated culturally .
Our spiritual way of life — our entire way of life was about to be stamped out and this was a rebirth of our dignity and self - pride .
Narrator :
For the next 71 days , Indian protesters at Wounded Knee would hold off the federal government at gunpoint .
Media from around the world would give the siege day - by - day coverage .
And Native Americans from across the nation would come to Wounded Knee to be part of what they hoped would be a new beginning .
Dennis Banks , Former AIM Leader , Ojibwa Tribe :
The message that went out is that a band of Indians could take on this government .
Tecumseh had his day and Geronimo , Sitting Bull , Crazy Horse .
And we had ours .
John Chancellor ( archival news anchor ) :
We have tonight one of the strangest stories to come along in a long time .
A group of American Indians has taken over the town of Wounded Knee in South Dakota and they have been holding it for nearly a whole day .
This afternoon the FBI said the Indians are in charge of the town .
Agnes Gildersleeve ( archival ) :
We had just finished eating our dinner and um so I looked out the window and I said “ Well , for heaven ’s sake , who opened the store ? ”
And they ’re carrying things out , bringing things out by the carload .
And I was floored , just floored .
Narrator : After stripping bare the Wounded Knee Trading Post , the village ’s only store , the protestors took over a local church , holding the minister and other white residents hostage .
They quickly blocked all roads leading into town .
Joseph Trimbach , Former FBI Agent : Tuesday , February 27th , I received a telephone call from some news outlet .
I was told that the caravan had forcibly took over the village , were holding hostages , causing destruction there .
So I immediately got my agents together , and I proceeded to the main entrance to Wounded Knee .
Jim Robideau , Former AIM Member , Spirit Lake Nation :
We saw a Fed car coming .
And then it – then it was a – it kind of came , drove just right up kinda , not too far off .
So when they come on , they got out of their car .
They went looking around and as soon as they put their glasses up , we opened up on ‘ em .
We let them know we are here , and uh that ’s far enough .
Joseph Trimbach , Former FBI Agent : I called inside Wounded Knee and I said , “ Look , let ’s get together and have a meeting so we can stop the potential for bloodshed here .
Let ’s talk about this . ”
As I walked up to them I see all these rifles pointed at me and it uh gives you an uneasy feeling .
Joseph Trimbach ( archival ) : Yes , sir .
Joseph Trimbach with the FBI .
Russell Means , Former AIM Leader , Oglala Lakota Tribe : Trimbach came to that roadblock .
And you could tell he ’d been up all night .
And he was very irritable .
Joseph Trimbach ( archival ) :
We have law enforcement up here that ’s armed , and we have hostages here …
Joseph Trimbach , Former FBI Agent : I have no idea what ’s going to happen next .
They came out and gave me this list of demands .
Narrator :
The protesters called for a federal investigation of corruption on reservations in South Dakota , and immediate Senate hearings on broken treaties with Indian nations .
Carter Camp , Former AIM Leader , Ponca Tribe :
We were angry about losing our land .
Losing our language .
You know –being - uh- ripped off of our ability to live as Indian people .
Our parents was telling us “ You have to walk the white man road .
The Indian ways are gonna be gone .
Be a Christian , you know .
Go to school and learn that English but do n’t learn your own language .
We wanted to give our lives in such a way that would bring attention to what was happening in Indian country and we were pretty sure that we were gonna have to give our lives .
Narrator :
The protesters demanded one change close to home .
Through a translator , the Lakota chief Fools Crow called for the immediate ouster of Dick Wilson , the elected head of the tribal government there on Pine Ridge .
Lakota Elder ( archival ) : Wilson molest the Indians .
Sometimes threatening them and so forth .
Before the sunset , we want him out of office and there will be no trouble .
Joseph Trimbach , Former FBI Agent :
My initial reaction was , “ This is something way beyond my pay grade .
Someone in Washington ’s gonna have to handle this . ”
Narrator :
The standoff was unfolding on the Pine Ridge Reservation , home to the Oglala Lakota — not far from where chiefs like Red Cloud , Sitting Bull , and Crazy Horse had once led their people into battle .
Robert Warrior , Writer , Osage Nation : The Lakota , who Americans call the Sioux are iconic in American history and the American imagination .
These are buffalo hunters who lived in teepees , who were at the battle with , uh , with General Custer .
Nearly everything about Lakota life is firmly implanted in the way that Americans think about Indians .
Narrator : By 1973 , the Lakota way of life on the plains was largely in the past .
The Oglala Sioux Tribal government ran things on Pine Ridge , and where traditional chiefs had once sought consensus , elected Chairman Dick Wilson ruled with an iron hand .
Steve Hendricks , Writer :
He was like a Chicago ward boss from the 1930s , big flour sack of a guy , wore dark glasses inside and out , was fond of drinking and uh , brought all his friends and family and cronies into office with him , effect .
Gave them jobs on the federal payroll .
James Abourezk , Former Senator :
On the Pine Ridge Reservation , as with most reservations , the tribal chairman and the council have a great deal of power to spread money around , to spread food around , or to withhold it .
Or to favor one part of the reservation over another , which is what was happening .
Narrator : Wilson favored mixed - race , assimilated Indians like himself , and slighted the traditional Sioux who spoke their language , practiced their religion , and remained loyal to the traditional Oglala chiefs .
Reporter ( archival ) :
Do you get any help from the tribal council ?
Indian Woman ( archival ) : No. Dick Wilson ’s the president here .
He ’s the worst one I think .
He ’s the- I do n’t know he gets the most of everything .
Paul Chaat Smith , Writer , Comanche Nation :
The federal census , I think every decade through the mid to end of the 20th Century , show Pine Ridge as the poorest jurisdiction in the United States .
So there 's poverty and then there 's reservation poverty .
Narrator :
When traditional Oglalas challenged corruption in tribal government , Dick Wilson responded with force .
Regina Brave , Pine Ridge Resident , Oglala Lakota Tribe :
He had his own army , which intimidated , uh , the full - bloods mostly , the traditional people .
His goons started beating up the people .
And no charges were ever pressed .
And if they did , it got thrown out of court .
He controlled the whole reservation .
Marvin Stoldt , Former BIA Police Office , Oglala Lakota Tribe :
Some of the officers hated to arrest any of Dick ’s people in spite of the fact that they did break the law .
He helped me a number of times , so I felt that I owed him a loyalty .
And , uh , and so I did n’t support everything he did , but irregardless of what he did , I still felt that loyalty .
Dick Wilson ( archival ) :
There ’s been a lot of accusations made here lately , and one in particular that upsets me is the fact that I am using a goon squad , so to speak .
They are respectable and honest citizens of Pine Ridge .
Goon 1 : We ’re all sharpshooters .
Tell ‘em the goon squad ’s comin’ .
Goon 2 : Let ’s go and get ‘em !
Narrator :
In late 1972 , traditional Oglalas came together to push for Wilson ’s removal .
Jim Robideau , Former AIM Member , Spirit Lake Nation :
We started a Civil Rights Commission , Oglala Sioux Civil Rights Commission , and from there they got the documentation of the corruption , of the misuse of funds .
They got the evidence .
Regina Brave , Pine Ridge Resident , Oglala Lakota Tribe :
And eventually the Civil Rights , they had a stack about an inch and a half thick of all the testimony and violations , civil rights violations .
Nobody ever got charged .
Narrator : Prompted by the dissidents , the tribal council held impeachment hearings in February 1973 .
But Wilson intimidated witnesses , strong - armed council members , and managed to survive .
Many Oglalas felt they had one last , desperate option .
Woman in Car ( archival ) :
We ’ve always been peaceful and pretty much mind our own business , making our living and raising our family , law - abiding .
Well I believe that the time has come that we have to commit violence in order to be heard .
I do n’t want to see anybody killed or anything , but the time is gonna come when violence might have to be committed in order to wake the people up .
Narrator :
By the second day of the siege , the spectacle of armed Indians holding a town — and 11 hostages — had put the U.S. government on full alert .
Fred Briggs ( archival news reporter ) :
By this morning , the entire area was blocked off by police — there were roadblocks as far away as the Nebraska state line .
Kent Frizzell ( archival ) :
On the far rise is roadblock 1 .
We have further roadblocks around the perimeter which encompasses approximately a 15 mile area .
Joseph Trimbach , Former FBI Agent :
The director said “ Tell Trimbach he can have anything he wants , ” which was pretty neat because that was like a blank check .
So I had agents go up to Rapid City and buy every rifle that they could find in the city because we needed them , like , right now .
So they came down , and now we at least had rifles for protection instead of just side arms .
Robert Warrior , Writer , Osage Nation :
The military response is overwhelming .
It involves plans using the US army to put down this rebellion .
Clearly there are people within the Federal Government who see a need to take it to the limit .
Dennis Banks , Former AIM Leader , Ojibwa Tribe : I was awakened .
There was a deep rumbling , droning noise .
We were looking around and we were surrounded by armored personnel carriers , APCs .
Russell Means , Former AIM Leader , Oglala Lakota Tribe :
All of a sudden we saw these two fighter jets coming , and they circled around , and from the South they just came right at us .
We thought it was over .
That ’s napalm .
Dennis
Banks pulled out his pistol and he started firin ’ , boom - boom - boom - boom .
Then they were gone .
You know , it was that proverbial , uh , last act of defiance , you know .
Here ’s that little mouse and here comes the big , huge eagle , and the little mouse is standing there like this .
Narrator :
On the afternoon of the second day , South Dakota senators George McGovern and James Abourezk arrived .
They hoped that if they could resolve the issue of the hostages , the crisis at Wounded Knee could be ended quickly .
Russell Means , Former Aim Leader :
When they came in it was very news worthy .
They came in with the news media .
That ’s how the networks got in .
And they said , ‘ We wanna see the hostages . ’
James Abourezk , Former Senator :
The agreement I ’d had with Russell Means was that if we landed at Pine Ridge he would release the hostages .
James Abourezk ( archival ) : I have an indication through an intermediary that they will release …
James Abourezk , Former Senator :
And I said , “ Well where are the hostages ?
You ’re supposed to release them .
You agreed to release them . ”
So they ’re standing over there .
So I went over and I said - uh , “ You folks , we ’ve rescued you .
You can leave now . ”
James Abourezk ( archival ) :
If you wanted to leave the Wounded Knee area could you go ?
Russell Means , Former AIM Leader , Oglala Lakota Tribe :
And we ’re sitting there on pins and needles .
Carter Camp ( archival ) : Ask Trimbach , we had people with him and said that they can leave !
Russell Means , Former AIM Leader , Oglala Lakota Tribe : And Mrs. Gildersleeve , the matriarch : “ We ’re not hostages , we ’re gonna remain here !
It ’s your fault that these Indians are here !
Have you listened to them ?
We ’re not leaving because you ’ll kill them if we leave ! ”
Narrator :
Once they realized no one was being held hostage , the Senators hoped to persuade the protesters to stand down by offering to convene hearings on their concerns — sometime in the future .
Russell Means ( archival ) :
We knew that a put - off , a stalling tactic , would happen once there was no threat to any other lives other than Indian lives .
You ’re gonna walk away from here and say ‘ after awhile ’ , doksha - lo !
You know .
And we ’re not going for doksha anymore !
We ’re not going for later anymore , Senator .
Now I told you over the phone that I bet and everyone here and down there have bet with their lives .
James Abourezk , Former Senator : AIM decided that their strategy would be to confront the government .
And try to win the public relations battle .
Prior to that time being a mister nice guy did n’t really work with the government ; they did n’t give a damn .
So that ’s the reason that AIM thought this was the way to do it .
Narrator : 250 armed U.S. personnel now surrounded the village of Wounded Knee .
Dennis Banks , Former AIM Leader , Ojibwa Tribe : I felt good .
This is why AIM was alive .
This is why we came to be .
Stand up against the FBI .
Stand up against the U.S. marshals .
Stand up against GOONs , you know , tribal police , and inside we ’ve got freedom .
Do n’t let nobody in .
Narrator : Since its founding in 1968 the American Indian Movement had been divisive — its militant tactics controversial even among Native people .
Created in Minneapolis by young urban Indians fed up with police harassment , the group had shown a knack for generating publicity .
Members had seized high - profile symbols — Plymouth Rock , the Mayflower , Mt. Rushmore — and in November 1972 , had occupied and vandalized the Washington headquarters of the Bureau of Indian Affairs .
Weeks later , in early 1973 , AIM took its campaign into the reservation border towns of South Dakota .
James Abourezk , Former Senator :
In those days there was a tremendous amount of racism , uh , especially in the border towns around the reservations .
I mean real racism where Indians are practically invisible .
Madonna Thunder Hawk , Former AIM Member , Two Kettle Lakota :
There was towns you did n’t drive through , you did n’t go through .
Especially women .
You did n’t walk down the street of any border town by yourself because you ’d be accosted by any white man that felt like it .
Narrator : Just weeks before the occupation of Wounded Knee , a white man killed an Indian near Custer , South Dakota , 50 miles from Pine Ridge .
When local officials charged him with manslaughter , not murder , 200 angry AIM protesters came to town .
Russell Means ( archival ) :
You charge a white man , premeditated murder , you charge him with second - degree manslaughter !
And we ai n’t going for it anymore .
And I know this whole damn town is an armed camp .
Dennis Banks ( archival ) : Hey listen , White Man !
I have had all the bullshit from your race as I can take !
Narrator :
When police barred them from entering the courthouse , AIM members forced their way in .
Assorted Voices ( archival ) : Hey !
Open them doors up !
Jim Robideau , Former AIM Member , Spirit Lake Nation : Just as we walked in through the door , then we were attacked by , uh , law enforcement .
We were fighting and they come at me with a nightstick , so I blocked it and took it away and started using it on them .
Edgar Bear Runner , Activist , Oglala Lakota Tribe : I was right on the steps , you know , and things were happening .
We bloodied the guy ; we took the helmet away .
We bloodied him up .
Then I ran across to help get gas in the filling station .
We were filling up and making Molotov cocktails and busting the bottles on the building , and the fire started on the wall and everything .
Narrator : Protesters set the courthouse ablaze , and left Custer in shambles .
Paul Chaat Smith , Writer , Comanche Nation :
There was absolutely an element in AIM that considered itself a revolutionary organization who were comfortable being around guns , who absolutely loved the idea of AIM being outlaws — who just wanted to get it on .
Narrator : The confrontation in Custer caught the attention of the Oglala dissidents on Pine Ridge .
Three weeks later , when their campaign to impeach Dick Wilson failed , they asked AIM for help .
Robert Warrior , Writer , Osage Nation : Calling in AIM is attractive , but it ’s a roll of the dice .
It ’s a roll of the dice because where AIM goes chaos often follows .
So that when those traditional chiefs bring in AIM , they ’re doing this in full knowledge that as they go down the road they do n’t know exactly what ’s going to happen .
Narrator : The Oglalas had exhausted all legal options .
They believed that to put an end to Wilson ’s harassment and intimidation , they needed what AIM could offer .
Robert Warrior , Writer , Osage Nation : AIM can bring bodies .
They can bring people .
They have the phone numbers of people at TV networks uh , who can get on airplanes and bring television cameras out .
None of the established national Indian organizations can do what AIM does .
Dennis Banks , Former AIM Leader , Ojibwa Tribe : The American Indian Movement ’s motto was anytime , anywhere , any place .
And that was the most important job that we could do , is to be where there was injustice and to confront it .
Narrator :
At a crowded meeting at a community center , dissident Oglalas , five traditional chiefs , and AIM representatives finally arrived at a radical plan : together they would seize the town of Wounded Knee .
They would force Dick Wilson from office , and , for the first time in nearly a century , draw national attention to indian concerns .
Russell Means ( archival ) : The Oglala Nation is at a crossroads that , that can change the course of history for Indian people all across the nation .
And I would like to ask that the chiefs listen very closely to what is being said here .
Carter Camp , Former AIM Leader , Ponca Tribe :
There was this hesitation .
No one could make a decision , and no one would endorse us and then the women started to talk .
Narrator : Ellen Moves Camp , a founder of the Oglala Sioux Civil Rights Organization , argued in favor of occupying Wounded Knee .
Ellen Moves Camp ( archival ) :
This has been going on for a long time before we invited the American Indian Movement here .
Because the people were scared and they are scared of Dick Wilson and all his men .
I do n’t see why ….
all these people come from all over .
I do n’t see why they - they ca n’t take him and throw him out or throw him in jail or something — the way he ’s been terrorizing people here on the reservation .
And I live in Pine Ridge at that gunpoint .
But , I ’m not scared of them anymore .
Dennis Banks , Former AIM Leader , Ojibwa Tribe :
And she was pushing .
She was pushing to spark something .
And , oh , it did .
Narrator : Finally , Fools Crow , the oldest traditional chief present , spoke .
“ Go ahead and do it , ” he said .
“ Take your brothers from the American Indian Movement and go to Wounded Knee and make your stand there . ”
Lou Davis ( archival reporter ) : Today a teepee was set up in what is now called the Demilitarized Zone .
Both sides are meeting there to negotiate an end to the takeover .
But the progress is agonizingly slow .
Robert Warrior , Writer , Osage Nation :
There were negotiations going on almost always during the occupation , attempts on both sides to reach some sort of agreement .
Narrator : Government negotiators were uncompromising .
They rejected demands to uphold treaty rights , and insisted that they were powerless to remove Dick Wilson , regardless of the charges against him , as he was chairman of a sovereign Indian Nation .
Talks stalled completely when the protesters demanded to deal with the US Secretary of State .
Reporter ( archival ) : I understand they want Henry Kissinger out here .
Do you think this is realistic ?
Do you think he ’ll come ?
Carter Camp ( archival ) :
Why not ?
You know - I do n’t see why the North Vietnamese should take precedent over - over the American Indian people .
You know , we ’ve been fighting this war for 400 years .
And if he can spare the time to go over there , he should be able to spare the time to come here .
Reporter ( archival ) :
But it would be correct to describe the current situation as an impasse ?
Federal Agent ( archival ) :
If there ’s such a thing as an impasse on an impasse , then that ’s what we have .
Narrator : Officials from the departments of Justice and the Interior took the lead in negotiations .
The attention of the White House was elsewhere — on the unfolding Watergate scandal .
James Abourezk , Former Senator :
There ’s no question that the White House was distracted during this Wounded Knee siege .
Although they sent midlevel officials out to run this siege operation , uh they did n’t have their mind on it .
Nixon had his mind on trying to survive the Watergate thing .
Things might have turned out a lot differently had they not been distracted .
Indians ( archival ) : Turn that fuckin’ light out !
Narrator : Within Wounded Knee , the days were relatively calm , while the nights exploded with gunfire .
Indians ( archival ) : Just take these unarmed men and tell ‘ em … Turn that goddamned light out or I ’ll shoot the fucker out !!
Jim Robideau , Former AIM Member , Spirit Lake Nation :
They were shooting machine gun fire at us , tracers coming at us at nighttime just like a war zone .
We had some Vietnam vets with us , and they said , “ Man , this is just like Vietnam ” .
Bill Zimmerman , Pilot / Activist :
There was actually a third force at Wounded Knee in addition to the Indian activists inside of Wounded Knee and the Federal Marshals and FBI agents surrounding Wounded Knee and that third force was the Goon Squad .
Reporter ( archival ) :
What is the mood among your people at this time ?
Dick Wilson ( archival ) :
They ’re very ticked off .
Reporter ( archival ) :
What are they doing right now ?
Dick Wilson ( archival ) : Shining their guns up .
Narrator :
As tribal chairman , Wilson wielded supreme authority on Pine Ridge .
Erected his own roadblocks outside the federal perimeter .
Even U.S. officials had to go through him .
Goon ( archival ) :
This is as far as you ’re going .
Wayne Colburn ( archival ) :
Well , I want him to go in .
Goon ( archival ) :
Well , you ’ll have to get Wilson out here .
Wayne Colburn ( archival ) :
Well , you ’ll have to get him , because I ’m taking them in .
Goon ( archival ) :
And , you ’re who ?
Wayne Colburn ( archival ) : I ’m Wayne Colburn , Director of the US Marshall Service .
Goon ( archival ) : Hmm .
Well , what do you think ?
Should we let him in ?
Bill Zimmerman , Pilot / Activist :
These goons were armed and they frequently uh , got in between the federal lines and the Wounded Knee perimeter and shot — and in both directions — with the intent of provoking firefights because they were angry that the government did n't go in and take over Wounded Knee .
Narrator : Inside the village , the protestors had their own military operation , led by Indians trained by the government they now took up arms against .
Ken Tiger , Former AIM Member , Seminole Tribe :
There was a lot of people there that had been in Vietnam .
And a lot of people had just been in the military .
Some older people had come in and they had actually been in Korea .
They knew how to give orders .
They knew how to take orders .
And they knew how to do things that they did n’t have to be told twice .
Madonna Thunder Hawk , Former AIM Member , Two Kettle Lakota : I knew we were making history for our people .
It did n’t all happen in the 1800s .
We ’re still fighting in the modern day .
I mean that ’s how I felt !
That , it was a continuation , and that ’s why I was not afraid .
I was not afraid .
Narrator :
In the 19th century , the Lakota fought furiously to defend their territory against relentless American expansion .
In 1868 , embattled Lakota chiefs signed the Fort Laramie Treaty to protect more than thirty million acres of their land .
But the United States soon reneged , and forced the Lakota onto small , desolate reservations .
Carter Camp , Former AIM Leader , Ponca Tribe : Americans like to think that American Indian history is something in the past .
I ’m one generation removed from the genocide of my tribe .
And every tribe in this country has a time of horror — I mean a time of absolute horror — when they were confronted by this invader .
And some of it happened almost five hundred years ago .
But as they come across the plains , our time of horror came in the late 1800s .
And we remember it very well .
Narrator :
In the frigid winter of 1890 , Chief Big Foot was leading a group of Lakota , mainly women and children , to shelter on the Pine Ridge reservation .
On the morning of December 29th , they were attacked by the U.S. Army on the banks of Wounded Knee Creek .
Charlotte Black Elk , Oglala Historian , Oglala Lakota Tribe :
My great grandmother is Katy War Bonnet .
She was a survivor at Wounded Knee .
When the shooting broke out , she and her sister , Ka - keek - sa - we , ran down into the ravine and made it to some plum bushes .
And she could hear the firing and the firing and hollering and then finally it was quiet .
Narrator : More than 300 Lakota people lay dead .
After remaining untouched in the ice and snow for three days , they were buried in a mass grave .
The massacre would mark the brutal end of centuries of armed Indian resistance .
those who came nearly a hundred years later , Wounded Knee was sacred land .
Carter Camp , Former AIM Leader , Ponca Tribe : I walked over to a gully and I picked up some sage and I went and washed myself and I prayed to those ancestors that were there in that gully and I said “ We ’re back .
We have returned , my relations .
We - bla - huh ” .
Bill Wordham ( archival reporter ) :
This is where the television crews await the hour - by - hour events in Wounded Knee .
This privileged position is protected by the Indian Chiefs .
Clearly the chiefs are anxious that this rebellion and its outcome receive as much publicity as possible .
Bill Zimmerman , Pilot / Activist :
It would have been very simple for the federal forces to go into Wounded Knee and take over .
There would have been some casualties , but probably the government would have considered them tolerable .
What made it so interesting was that the Indians existed underneath a protective bubble of publicity and shame .
Because everybody knew that this was the site of the last massacre of the Indian Wars and the last thing the government wanted to see , was a massacre on the same site .
Narrator :
One week into the siege , all three television networks had stationed reporters in Wounded Knee .
Polls estimated that more than 90 % of Americans were following the crisis on the nightly news .
Carter Camp , Former AIM Leader , Ponca Tribe :
If they came and killed all of us , it would be recorded and it would be seen by the world where the 1890 massacre was n’t .
And if they did n’t , if they decided , you know , that that media was there so they do n’t want to murder all of us , well , then the media is there to tell our side of the story .
Madonna Thunder Hawk , Former AIM Member , Two Kettle Lakota :
They wanted this stoic - you know - American Indian man with a gun .
America ’s picture of “ The Indian . ”
We did n’t care , as long as the word was getting out .
Archival Footage : ( Reporter speaking in French )
Mike Her Many Horses , Oglala Historian , Oglala Lakota Tribe :
There was a lot of folks here , a lot of foreign press were here .
And they made it out to be kind of a cowboy - Indian adventure , you know .
More people wanted confrontation you know , that seemed to attract the viewers .
Russell Means ( archival ) :
You guys get so tight and start panicking and you get down on the press .
Hell , we want ‘em to film this bullshit !
We ca n’t let ‘em fire first and open up with automatic weapons .
We gotta get that filmed .
We got .22 ’s in our hand against APC’s .
So , do n’t be jumpin ’ on the press !
Narrator :
The news out of South Dakota held Indians around the country spellbound .
Some were ashamed by AIM ’s armed display of defiance , but many were inspired .
Ken Tiger , Former AIM Member , Seminole Tribe : I left school and me and another guy left and we drove in his car from — we were in Central California and we drove up to Oakland and from Oakland we drove back to South Dakota .
Up until ‘ 73 , when it started , I was never involved in anything politically , dealing with , uh , either Native Americans or any other organization .
I just felt like I should go up there and I did .
Bill Wordham ( archival reporter ) :
You all are not Oglala Sioux , I take it .
Assorted Voices ( archival ) : I am , I ’m not .
Indian Man # 2 ( archival ) : Chippewa .
Bill Wordham ( archival ) : You ’re Chippewa ?
Where are you from ?
Indian Man # 2 ( archival ) : Minnesota .
Bill Wordham ( archival ) :
And what about you sir , where are you from ?
Indian Man # 1 ( archival ) : Winnebago .
Wisconsin .
Indian Woman # 3 ( archival ) : Cheyenne .
Oklahoma .
Bill Wordham ( archival ) :
And you ’re not necessarily all members of AIM , huh ?
Indian Man # 1 ( archival ) :
We did n’t say that .
Bill Wordham ( archival ) :
Are you members or AIM ?
Indian Man # 1 ( archival ) :
We did n’t say that either .
Indian Woman # 1 ( archival ) :
We ’re here to support our Indian people that are in Wounded Knee .
Paul Chaat Smith , Writer , Comanche Nation :
This generation of Indians in the late - 60s , early 70s , who for the most part , they had been to boarding school or their parents had been to boarding school , which was explicitly about getting Indians off the reservations , to not be Indian , to not speak their language .
For those Indian people , it was this moment in which you could see , on television , there was another way , there was another possibility .
It was electrifying .
Archival Footage : ( Children sing “ Ten Little Indians ” )
Dennis Banks , Former AIM Leader , Ojibwa Tribe :
There is one dark day in the lives of Indian children ; the day when they are forcibly taken away from those who love and care for them , from those who speak their language .
They are dragged , some screaming and weeping , others in silent terror , to a boarding school where they are to be remade into white kids .
Narrator :
By the late 19th century , the Indian Wars were over .
The United States seized on a ruthless strategy to assimilate Native children to a subordinate place in white - dominated society : government - run boarding schools .
Dennis Banks , Former AIM Leader , Ojibwa Tribe : I was 5 years old .
My mother was crying , and they were taking us off and my sister Audrey , uh , who - who also was like a second mother to me and a very close friend as a sister and my brother , Mark — they were very sad .
Within two hours or so after the buses filled up and we 're down the road — this is the furthest I 've ever been from my home in my life .
And then of course it turns into evening and we arrive at this place .
Walter Little Moon , Wounded Knee Resident , Oglala Lakota Tribe : I ended up in a place where nothing … nothing … nothing made any sense at all .
You know , it was n’t home .
It was n’t uh — I did n’t know anything about school .
Nobody ever even told me anything about school ...
I did n’t know what the education was .
I remember that I wanted to go home .
Period .
I did n’t want to be there .
I just wanted to go home .
Dennis Banks , Former AIM Leader , Ojibwa Tribe :
We all had to strip down naked , and then they put the DDT on us .
They line us up and they 're cutting our hair .
You have long hair , you have braids , and then that gets cut off .
And I would say within a matter of an hour and a half we 're standing there , all looking alike .
Narrator : Between the 1870s and the 1960s , over one hundred thousand Indian children were sent to one of the nearly 500 boarding schools scattered across the United States .
Boarding School Newsreel ( archival ) :
Through the agencies of the government , they are being rapidly brought from their state of comparative savagery and barbarism to one of civilization .
Archival Footage : ( Children sing “ Ten Little Indians ” )
Dennis Banks , Former AIM Leader , Ojibwa Tribe :
You could n’t sing any native songs or tribal songs .
They just started using English , you could only , you could not use any other language .
We ’d whisper , ‘ Pass the pa- qua - shi - ga , pa - qua - shi - ga ’ — pass the bread over .
It ’s like I had to be two people .
I had to be Nowa Cumig , and I had to be Dennis Banks .
Nowa Cumig is my real name , my Ojibwa name .
Dennis Banks had to be very protective of Nowa Cumig .
And so I learned who the presidents were .
And I learned the math .
learned the social studies .
I learned the English , and Nowa Cumig was still there .
Walter Little Moon , Wounded Knee Resident , Oglala Lakota Tribe :
This is education that was promised us .
That was guaranteed us through the treaties , but it was n’t .
It was torture .
Brainwashing .
They called us many different names .
Savage .
Dumb .
I got uh , beat for looking like an Indian , smelling like an Indian , even speaking Indian .
Everything I did .
Dennis Banks , Former AIM Leader , Ojibwa Tribe :
Their de-Indianization program , it failed .
But , the toll was devastating .
It destroyed our family .
It destroyed the relationship we had with our mother .
I could never regain that friendship - loveship relationship that I had with my mother .
It was n’t there anymore , and that ’s what , to this day , I keep thinking — ‘ damn this government ’ .
What it did to me and what it did to thousands of other children across this country .
Ralph Erickson ( archival ) :
If the leaders at Wounded Knee are bent on violence , that is their concern , but I call upon them now to send the women and the children , both resident and non-resident out of Wounded Knee before darkness falls tomorrow .
Regina Brave , Pine Ridge Resident , Oglala Lakota Tribe :
The United States government sent an ultimatum to the people in Wounded Knee that if they did n't leave on a certain day , that they were coming in , they would remove us by force .
Dennis Banks ( archival ) :
We are going to reject any kind of conditions that pushes us out of the Wounded Knee area until all …
Regina Brave , Pine Ridge Resident , Oglala Lakota Tribe : I told Dennis , just burn it .
At that time , we all started making preparations for making our last stand .
Dennis Banks , Former AIM Leader , Ojibwa Tribe :
We smudged everybody as they came up and painted them .
When you go off to war if you get killed in battle then they ’ll , then that paint will signify that you went there with the blessings of the pipe and that you ’ll go to the spirit world with great honor .
Regina Brave , Pine Ridge Resident , Oglala Lakota Tribe : I had this little bitty bag — little bitty bag , with little bitty fringes on it .
I had one bullet in there .
And I had a semi-automatic , and I only put one bullet in there .
Somebody said , “ How come one bullet ? ” I said , “ I 'm gonna wait , ' cause if I 'm going , I 'm gonna take somebody with me . ”
Dennis Banks ( archival ) :
The government just backed down on that 6 o’clock thing .
Narrator :
Two days after issuing the ultimatum , U.S. officials shifted tactics .
Hoping the occupation would simply peter out , they removed roadblocks around Wounded Knee andpersuaded Dick Wilson to remove his .
Federal officials would keep the inflammatory tribal chairman on the sidelines for the rest of the occupation .
But when the roadblocks were lifted , new protesters and fresh supplies flooded in .
On March 11th , revitalized occupation leaders made a startling announcement .
Russell Means ( archival ) :
The leadership of the Oglala Sioux here present in Wounded Knee , have declared Wounded Knee an independent country .
From here further , if any spy from the United States of America is found within our borders , he will be dealt with as any spy in a time of war and be shot before a firing squad .
( Cheering )
Narrator : The battered hamlet of Wounded Knee was now the Independent Oglala Nation .
While U.S. officials hurriedly put roadblocks back in place , the new nation asserted its sovereignty .
A delegation led by Chief Fools Crow traveled to the United Nations to put the Oglalas ’s case before the world .
Reporter ( archival ) :
They arrived almost an hour late .
They said taxi cab drivers just would n’t stop to pick them up .
Wearing a medal given to the tribe by the United States government after the signing of the treaty of 1868 , 78 - year - old chief Fools Crow , through an interpreter , explained why the group came to New York .
Chief Fools Crow ( archival ) : ( Speaking in Lakota )
“ It is our last effort in this trouble .
I think we have exhausted all other means of a settlement of the trouble we have at Wounded Knee .
Narrator :
The delegation failed to get official recognition at the U.N. and returned to Wounded Knee .
There , inside the borders of the Independent Oglala Nation , the chiefs and medicine men introduced Lakota culture to the protesters , many of whom had come from cities and were disconnected from Indian traditions .
Clyde Bellecourt , Former AIM Leader , White Earth Nation :
One of the first things that we did when we got into Wounded Knee is we built a purification lodge , an inipi , a sweat lodge .
We were all required , everybody was required to go in there and purify themselves and to uh ... pray and ask their creator for help .
Everything that we did uh ... was preceded by prayer and gathering , smoking of the -- of the uh ... sacred pipe and tobacco offerings , everything .
Archival Footage : ( Crow Dog speaking Lakota )
Paul Chaat Smith , Writer , Comanche Nation : The Indian Movement was different than other political movements of the time because it defined itself as a spiritual movement .
Their trajectory in a way mirrors what a lot of the Indian world was about , which was trying to connect with traditional knowledge , culture , religion .
Steve Hendricks , Writer :
One of the things that AIM tried to do was to return “ Indian - ness ” to all Indians .
Whether folks lived in the city , on reservations , whether they spoke the language or did n’t speak the language , if you were Indian , you could sort of return to the tribe .
Narrator : Many of the protesters had left reservations behind , along with thousands of other Indians , as part of the federal government ’s Indian relocation program of the 1950s and 60s .
James Abourezk , Former Senator :
The government thought one way to solve the Indian problem was to relocate Indians from the reservation to the bigger cities .
They could n’t kill the Indians anymore .
That was out of fashion by the fifties .
Uh - so , they decided to experiment , they did a lot of experimenting with the Indians .
Relocation Program was one such experiment .
Madonna Thunder Hawk , Former AIM Member , Two Kettle Lakota :
It was exciting , relocation .
You know , you get to go to a big city and uh help you find a job .
And uh , you get to see the rest of the country .
Of course you were n’t forced to go on relocation , but they made it look good : “ Streets paved with gold . ”
We ended up in Cleveland , Ohio .
Narrator : Over 100,000 Indians were relocated in just 15 years .
The government promised to help them find schools , housing , and employment .
But for many , the promise rang hollow .
Madonna Thunder Hawk , Former AIM Member , Two Kettle Lakota :
They put us in a real dumpy motel .
And I was just sitting there thinking , ‘ I wonder what ’s going on at home ? ’
I could just see the rolling hills and , the small , small town .
They ’re all just moving and walking and going real fast .
And nobody ’s stopping to look around .
That ’s why we stayed in our apartments or stayed in our rooms .
Clyde Bellecourt , Former AIM Leader , White Earth Nation :
If you went and uh … applied for a job , you better not tell them you ’re Indian .
You better tell them you ’re French or something , Italian or some other nationality or you would n’t get the job .
Narrator :
By the 1970 ’s , half of all Indians lived in cities , and more than 100 tribes had ceased to legally exist .
But the Relocation Program produced an unanticipated result .
LaNada Warjack , Activist , Shoshone - Bannock Tribes :
It pulled us all closer together .
We could always spot each other in the city .
So if we ’d see an Indian on the street walking down Market Street , we ’d look at each other , and we ’d just smile and kind of shake our head , or , you know , in acknowledgement of each other .
We did n’t care what tribe anyone was .
We were Indian people .
We were a race .
Narrator :
The new pan-Indian identity led to the growth of activist groups around the country .
The American Indian Movement was the most radical .
John Trudell , Former AIM Leader , Santee Sioux Tribe :
There were a lot of Native people that were afraid to stand up .
Geronimo demonstrated , man !
Crazy Horse demonstrated !
And for us , the baby boom generation , circumstances were right .
We could raise our voice .
Russell Means ( archival ) : Do you see him ?
That little black spot out there ?
Reporter ( archival ) :
What do you see ?
Russell Means ( archival ) : See .
See that tree line over there ?
Right there .
Narrator :
Over the course of the siege , government forces would pound the village with more than 500,000 rounds of ammunition .
It was inevitable that there would be casualties .
Various People ( archival ) :
Where ’s the car ?
Where ’s the car ?
Marshal Radio ( archival ) : The Wounded Knee apparently has a wounded party …
Webster Poor Bear ( archival ) :
It really do n’t bug me that much .
I really do n’t mind getting shot .
We are willing to sacrifice our lives for our children so they will not have to grow up in the society we grow up in today .
Webster Poor Bear , Activist , Oglala Lakota Tribe :
When Milo and myself got hit , uh , we knew that no one was , no one was going to go through this completely unscathed .
There was somebody that was going to get it again .
Narrator : With the White House increasingly preoccupied with Watergate , the government had allowed the occupation of Wounded Knee to drag on .
But at the end of March , the Justice Department sent a new negotiator who changed tactics .
Kent Frizzell , Former Department of Justice Official : Shortly after I arrived , the lifestyle was somewhat changed of the occupants of Wounded Knee .
Uh … the electricity was cut off , the water line was cut .
Narrator : Then Frizzell cut off the protesters ’ most vital lifeline : he ordered reporters to leave town .
Marshal ( archival ) :
Hey , until we get the word y’all get back in your cars okay ?
Just get back in the car til we get the word .
Do n’t touch my hand , either .
Just get back in the car ‘ til we get the word !
Kent Frizzell ( archival ) : I frankly think that the barring of the news media has had an effect on negotiations .
A positive effect from the government ’s point of view because …
Kent Frizzell , Former Department of Justice Official :
All of a sudden , those in Wounded Knee were n't seeing themselves uh…on top of a pony waving an AK - 47 at the American personnel on the ground .
Narrator : Just when the siege was officially kicked off the airwaves , it got renewed publicity from an unlikely source — Hollywood .
Sacheen Little Feather ( archival ) :
He very regretfully cannot accept this very generous award …
Narrator : Marlon Brando refused his Oscar for Best Actor in The Godfather , in protest of the negative portrayal of Indians in the movies .
Sacheen Little Feather ( archival ) : ( booing ) .
Excuse me .
Narrator : Brando sent an Apache actress named Sacheen Little Feather to represent him at the awards ceremony , watched by millions .
Later , backstage , she explained Brando ’s absence .
Sacheen Little Feather ( archival ) : I have indicated in this statement that Marlon Brando is on his way to Wounded Knee .
At that time , you ’ll have to take me for his word .
Narrator : Brando never made it to Wounded Knee , but a poll taken four days after the Oscars showed his sympathies were widely shared : most Americans sided with the protesters .
Within a week , the two sides reached a deal .
News Anchor ( archival ) :
The siege of Wounded Knee , South Dakota ended today .
News Anchor # 2 ( archival ) : Representatives of the Indians and US Interior Department officials formally signed the pact this afternoon inside the embattled village .
Narrator : Government officials promised to investigate corruption on Pine Ridge , and to immediately convene a White House meeting and Congressional hearings on treaty rights .
their part , the protesters agreed to lay down their arms .
Archival Footage : ( Indians singing AIM song )
Carter Camp , Former AIM Leader , Ponca Tribe :
You know , the first thing Indians do is break out a drum .
You know so they started banging a drum and singing victory songs and everyone was hooping and cheering .
That was a time when we really thought we won , and not only that , we thought that , uh , we had survived .
Kent Frizzell , Former Department of Justice Official : I talked to Chief Fools Crow , an elder and a full blood .
Uh … I offered him a ride on my helicopter if he could get this young Indian lad to let me ride his pony .
He thought it was a wonderful gesture and I did the same as I galloped off uh …on that pony bareback .
Narrator : Chief Bad Cob , medicine man Leonard Crow Dog , and Russell Means rushed to Washington for a meeting at the White House .
But the deal quickly collapsed over the critical detail of what was to happen first — the White House meeting or the disarming of the protesters .
Kent Frizzell ( archival ) : The White House will not negotiate while guns are pointed at Federal officials in Wounded Knee !
That is our position !
I believe it offers the only hope for a peaceful solution .
And I for one am prepared to stand by the agreement until hell freezes over !
Russell Means , Former AIM Leader , Oglala Lakota Tribe :
We give up our arms ?
Hello ?
That is so stupid , it ’s beyond belief that they would even — they would even say that to the press .
What ?
These stupid Indians are gonna go to negotiate after they lay down their arms ?
What ?
Nobody does that in the entire world in history .
Narrator : After the agreement unraveled , Russell Means was arrested .
He would spend the rest of the occupation in jail .
Kent Frizzell ( archival ) :
The fun and games so far as I ’m concerned are over .
A United States Marshal has been seriously wounded .
Reporter ( archival ) : Many of the some 300 persons in Wounded Knee are sick with bad colds .
Doctors here report at least 15 persons here have pneumonia .
Reporter # 2 ( archival ) :
The garbage is piling up .
The food is running short .
One meal a day is now the rule and that ’s not much of a meal .
Madonna Thunder Hawk , Former AIM Member , Two Kettle Lakota :
One time , one of the guys came in and he had a sack on his shoulders .
And it was , I do n't know , maybe a 50 - pound bag of what they fed calves .
So we just — that 's what we ate .
We made pancakes out of it and whatever .
We just treated it like flour .
Dennis Banks ( archival ) :
We had been rationing ourselves to one meal a day , one full meal a day .
We are cutting that effective today , to one half meal a day .
Bill Zimmerman , Pilot / Activist :
At the time , I was minding my own business in Boston , following the Wounded Knee story in the news like everybody else .
One day , somebody walked into my office that I knew within the Boston anti-war movement .
They had heard that I was a pilot and they needed somebody to go in there who could fly over the federal blockade and bring them some food .
Dennis Banks ( archival ) :
If there ’s any plane comes by here today , we do n’t want anybody taking any - taking any pot -shots at them because they will be making a food drop to us today .
( Cheering )
Bill Zimmerman , Pilot / Activist :
We operated out of Rapid City , South Dakota , at three o'clock in the morning .
We were over Wounded Knee about 40 seconds , made the drop and we were gone .
And 2,000 pounds of food landed in the village .
Beau Little Sky , Activist , Oglala Lakota Tribe :
At first we thought we were bein ’ attacked .
We thought they were gassing us , you know , because what it was , it was the flour exploding and creating , uh , a big cloud .
You know , then all of a sudden , you know , we said , “ Oh , hey , this is food , ” you know ?
So we 're all out there gathering the food and the FBI opens up on us .
Narrator :
The night before , a man named Frank Clearwater and his pregnant wife had arrived in the village .
Clearwater said they had hitchhiked all the way from North Carolina .
Jim Robideau , Former AIM Member , Spirit Lake Nation :
When he came in , he had his own gun .
He had a kind of a big long - barreled shotgun .
It looked like he came out of the hills , too , you know .
( Laughs )
He said he was Cherokee , you know .
Yeah , he looked like one of those mountain men .
Kevin McKiernan , Journalist :
They had ready - made cigarettes , which was a very big deal because uh ... we were all smoking in those days .
And uh ... and we were smoking cherry bark and things from uh ... from - from the ground .
And here was a ready - made cigarette .
And so I remember Frank Clearwater lit it up and we passed it around in a- in a circle like a form of uh ... communion .
Narrator :
When bullets began to fly on the day of the food drop , Frank Clearwater took refuge with other protesters in a church .
As they hugged the floor in an effort to stay out of harm ’s way , a bullet tore through the plasterboard wall and struck Clearwater in the head .
He had been in Wounded Knee for less than 24 hours .
Carter Camp , Former AIM Leader , Ponca Tribe : A brother named Strawberry had his hand on the back of his head and was holding his skull ... and I put my hand on his skull , tried to hold his brains in … and we took him , took him in the clinic and they could n’t save him .
Narrator :
The first death intensified the government ’s determination to bring the siege to an end .
In mid-April , a unit was put on alert at an Army base in Colorado .
According to plans leaked to the press , the government was prepared to move into Wounded Knee with armored helicopters and tear gas .
Kent Frizzell , Former Department of Justice Official : The White House , the Department of Justice , were concerned with the confrontation going on all during the month of May into the summer .
The college campuses , I was told , would be emptying out and all the adventure seekers would be infiltrating Wounded Knee .
I was given a 10 - day deadline .
Narrator :
At the same time the government threatened military assault , officials were destabilizing the occupation using covert tactics .
Kent Frizzell ( archival ) : I have some information that I think that you ’ll be interested in .
And it ’s based on a source that we have utilized in the past and has furnished us information in the past within Wounded Knee .
Now very frankly , I cannot identify him for obvious purposes .
Robert Warrior , Writer , Osage Nation :
There were almost surely spies within Wounded Knee .
The US government had infiltrated the American Indian Movement like it had infiltrated every political organization in the US during that time .
Steve Hendricks , Writer : AIM knew that they had spies in their midst and that was part of the FBI 's game .
Not just to have the spies to get information on what AIM was doing , but to get AIM guessing as to who those spies were .
To get them paranoid , and pointing fingers at one another .
Dennis Banks ( archival ) : What is that ?
What did you point at me ?
Robert Warrior , Writer , Osage Nation :
One effect of that paranoia inside Wounded Knee is that there are purported cases of people who disappeared and who were thought to have been killed mainly because people did n’t know who they were and who assumed that they were spies .
Kent Frizzell , Former Department of Justice Official : I got daily reports .
I got informer reports .
This information came to me through the tribal government and through the FBI .
Narrator : On April 26th , Wounded Knee sustained the heaviest barrage of gunfire since the start of the siege .
When the shooting subsided , Buddy Lamont , a 31 year - old Oglala from Pine Ridge , came out to investigate .
Lamont was a Vietnam veteran who ’d been in Wounded Knee since the beginning .
Beau Little Sky , Activist , Oglala Lakota Tribe : Everybody started getting up and — and goin ' back to — about their normal routines , and Buddy came — got up and walked over to the trenches where we were at .
A sniper at a good thousand yards hit him squarely in the heart , and he was n't even aimin ' the gun .
He had his back turned , you know , and his - his - his , uh , weapon was on his shoulder , you know .
To me , that was murder .
Narrator : Negotiators agreed to a ceasefire so that Lamont ’s family could bury him at Wounded Knee .
On May 6th , Buddy Lamont was laid to rest next to the victims of the 1890 massacre .
Dennis Banks , Former AIM Leader , Ojibwa Tribe :
They asked me if I would , uh , say a prayer for him , which I did .
It said , ‘ 2000 people came and one remained . ’
Robert Warrior , Writer , Osage Nation : Buddy Lamont ’s death becomes , really the , the final blow to a lot of people inside Wounded Knee , especially the Oglalas from Pine Ridge .
He was somebody that everybody knew , everybody knew his Mom and he was there for all the right reasons , fighting for something that he cared about .
And for Buddy Lamont to die was more of a tragedy than most people could bear .
Narrator : Fools Crow and the other Oglala leaders had had enough .
spite AIM ’s objections , they insisted on bringing the occupation to an end .
On May 8 , 1973 , after 71 days , the siege of Wounded Knee was over .
In final talks with the government , AIM leaders agreed to disarm and submit to arrest .
But many of the protesters were already making other plans .
Jim Robideau , Former AIM Member , Spirit Lake Nation :
We asked the medicine man , we said we want to get out of here .
We do n’t want to leave no weapons here .
So , he says we ’ll have a ceremony tonight and we ’ll pray .
So we prayed all night long .
Richard Whitman , Activist , Euchee and Pawnee Tribes : We sang the American Indian Movement song .
An honor song .
A memorial song .
Dennis Banks , Former AIM Leader , Ojibwa Tribe : ( Singing AIM song )
Jim Robideau , Former AIM Member , Spirit Lake Nation :
So , it started getting cloudy and then that evening , it started raining .
Wind.
Rain .
So they could n’t shoot the flares .
Arlene Means , Activist , Oglala Lakota Tribe : Lots of people walked out .
The spirits had a lot to do with it .
The one that brought us out was the owl .
And every time he'd hoot in a direction and then we'd go that way and they did it right under the marshals ’ noses .
Narrator :
As the protesters fled Wounded Knee , a triumphant Dick Wilson toured the remains of the town .
Reporter ( archival ) : Dick , are you surprised by what you ’re seeing ?
Dick Wilson ( archival ) : I expected this .
Reporter ( archival ) : Why ?
Dick Wilson ( archival ) :
They ’re hoodlums .
Clowns .
This is the way they live .
Narrator : Not only was Dick Wilson still firmly in charge , he would exact revenge on his opponents as the federal government looked the other way .
Dick Wilson ( archival ) : The Oglalas do n’t like what happened and if the FBI do n’t get ‘em , the Oglalas will .
We have our own way of punishing people that way .
Reporter ( archival ) : Shooting on the reservation ?
Dick Wilson ( archival ) : You said it .
We ’ll take care of ‘em .
Steve Hendricks , Writer :
It was a period of time that the dissidents called ‘ The Reign of Terror . ’
It was a time when Dick Wilson truly unleashed his forces on the folks who had supported Wounded Knee .
Narrator :
In the three years following the siege , two FBI agents and more than 60 AIM supporters were killed , giving Pine Ridge the highest per capita murder rate in the country .
As the reservation spiraled into violence , the government went after AIM in the courts .
Steve Hendricks , Writer :
One thing that Wounded Knee gave the federal government an excuse to do was to try to litigate the American Indian Movement out of existence .
Senator Taylor ( archival ) :
You and your bunch of hoodlums take over down there , you destroy people ’s property …
Narrator : Within months , more than 500 indictments were brought against AIM members , most on minor charges that were later dismissed .
Steve Hendricks , Writer :
They succeeded in tying up AIM in court , and AIM at this point , with all those resources going into court , lost its way .
Narrator : AIM fell into disarray and violent infighting , and would never again have the impact it had in 1973 .
But the hopes inspired by the siege would echo in the decades to come .
Despite the chaos that followed in its wake , Wounded Knee would prove to be a turning point in the history of Native people .
Madonna Thunder Hawk , Former AIM Member , Two Kettle Lakota :
We needed to let the rest of the world know what was going on .
Two states over , they had no idea about Indian people .
We were just invisible .
We were the ones that kicked the doors open on the Indian issue and let the world see .
Robert Warrior , Writer , Osage Nation :
The good that came out of Wounded Knee was the entry into American Indian political life of people who had not been there before , who had not had a real voice .
People learned they could tackle problems , create opportunities .
And I think that coming out of Wounded Knee , people knew they could make a difference .
Ken Tiger , Former AIM Member , Seminole Tribe :
There was a lot of sense of uh ... we ’re important and we can do something within our own people , our own tribe , our own homes .
I did n’t go back to what I was doing before .
I felt maybe I can do something to help , not only my people , but other people , too .
Narrator : Native activism would spur the revitalization of Native cultures .
In the years following the siege at Wounded Knee , Indians would create tribal schools and cultural institutions charged with preserving Indian traditions — and passing them on .
Paul Chaat Smith , Writer , Comanche Nation :
In the late 60s and early 70s , these were still emerging ideas about reconnecting with traditional culture , language , religion that was starting to happen .
But this became the majority sentiment in the space of just a handful of years .
It was really about identity .
It was about affirming we ’re still here , we want to be here , and we want to be here on our own terms .
John Trudell , Former AIM Leader , Santee Sioux Tribe :
Whatever went on in the 60s and 70s , it ’s an extension , it ’s a continuation .
It was no different than what King Phillip was about , or Crazy Horse was about .
And whatever means and manner we - we could , since - since the Europeans arrived here , we ’ve had to fight for our survival .
Charlotte Black Elk , Oglala Historian , Oglala Lakota Tribe :
What the 1973 occupation did was people started saying ‘ Hey , we ’re Indians .
It ’s okay to be Indian .
We are Indian , we really should be who we are . ’
The struggle that we have in the 21st Century is to remain ourselves .
Every one of us has to do our part to remain Lakota , to remain Indian — and to teach our children , to teach our grandchildren — and make sure that there will be children sitting in sweat lodge , standing at the sun dance in a thousand years .

Have you ever wondered why some years , some sires — or even some dams — produce more of one gender than others ?
Can certain management practices favor one over the other — or is it random ?
Is one more desirable than the other in the goat world ?
In this article we will briefly discuss how the Alpha team ( Qué ? read our ‘ The way out ’ post first ) will proceed with preparing the firmaments for our new colony on location .
Escaping the matrix is not a zero- seconds process .
There will be a transition period in which we will have to use matrix stuff to build up the colony camp .
To make it easier reading , this transition period is split up in some phases .
First phase : gather intel on location
Duration : 2 weeks
The first part consists of the physical move within the matrix .
We move according to the tough or smooth way out ( see earlier post ) .
We move with 6 to 8 people ( 50/50 man and women ) to a big city close to the chosen spot .
In this phase the Alpha team gathers intel on the country , weather forecasts , property information on the available terrains and fertility of the ground .
Although a lot of stuff can be checked via the internet , some stuff we need to see with our own eyes to make our final choice definitive .
The list of requirements for the spots from Intermission Report I. :
We have 4 spots so far .
2 of them are going to be screened this year for sustainability and suitability .
The spots :
• Peru
• South - Africa
• Tanzania
• Turkey Each spot has its own advantages and disadvantages .
Important selection criteria for the spots are :
• Distance from nuclear power plants ( min 1000 km )
• Height of above the current sea level .
( Min 2 km )
• Proximity of ( renewable ) a water supply
• Distance from matrix folks ( min 50 km )
• Availability of direct food
• Availability of wood ( unlimited would be nice )
• Availability of other resources needed for construction of other buildings ( sandstone , grind , …)
• Risk of matrix folks going crazy ( a.k.a. political stability in the region = absence of politics in the region ) ( max 1 % )
• Local climate & proximity to the equator ( as close as possible )
• Distance from tectonic borders ( min 500 km )
• Distance from volcanoes ( min 300-500 km )
• Number of mountain rigs an eventual tidal wave of 2 km height will have to breach before it gets to our colony .
For every possible spot this checklist will be discussed , so back and forth communication between Alpha ( located at the chosen country ) and Beta ( still in Belgium / Western Europe ) teams will be necessary to check for additional ‘ inside matrix information ’ to be retrieved by the Beta team .
Once that is complete , we expect there will be 2 to 4 possible terrains for checkup .
Phase two : inspection of possible locations
Duration : 2 weeks
At this point , the Alpha team splits up in 2 sub teams .
One team stays in the big city and provides communication and location service for the other team .
The other team goes hitch hiking or rents a jeep to scan the spots .
Every spot is checked thoroughly for security and sustainability issues .
During this process some important stuff will be verified that we cannot check via the internet .
These are the the ‘ secondary requirements ’ for the spot .
presence of ( potential ) food near the colony location ( ‘ potential ’ because the Alpha team will probably arrive in early Spring ) .
The more food that is already there , the better .

Of course we will fertilize ground with our own disposals , but this takes time .
If you plan to start your own colony this may be worth a read .

weather conditions .
Although the primary criteria will only give us spots of some square kilometers , weather can be very different in the different ‘ sub - spots ’ due to terrain levels .
Typical mountain rains are something to avoid .
.

Typical mountain rains are something to avoid .
proximity of important natural resources ( e.g. salt , iron ore , stone , clay , cotton fields , …)
( e.g. salt , iron ore , stone , clay , cotton fields , … ) and last but not least : the feeling of the spot .
In a few hundred meters Earth - surface - energies can vary a lot .
Although we ’re not capable of consciously using our ‘ 6th sense ’ , we will strongly feel the energies on the different locations .
But we ’re not there yet .
Upon inspection of every spot , the team will make a brief list of ( additional ) materials needed to be able to build a colony there .
Things like ‘ extra saws for the big trees ’ , ‘ ground fertilizer for the weak ground ’ , ‘ extra shelter for heavy and sudden rainfall ’ , etc .
These are just some ( bad ) examples but you catch my drift .
Once this is completed one spot will stand out from the others .
This will be the spot we ’ll move to , and build the colony .
Phase three : shopping time !
Duration 1 - 2 weeks
With our pile of almost – but not yet – worthless money , we buy all essential stuff mentioned above in order to start the colony .
Depending on the chosen location , shopping might take up to 2 weeks .
Here we ’ll have to see how much support from locals we can get .
Or we will have to purchase the goods and move them directly to the spot , or we move them to some kind of a warehouse and stockpile everything there and then move it all at once to the location of the future colony .
To stay under the radar it would be wise to do it in bits and pieces , with the Alpha team still split in a purchasing unit in the big city and a construction unit on the spot location .
This is a brief list of the stuff that the Alpha team will have to buy in that short time span :
tents and shelter
backpacks
basic clothing for members of the Alpha team
tablets to clean water
food for 6 months for 20 people
basic construction tools : hammers , saws , axes , sledgehammers , shovels , kilometers of rope , …
seeds and ‘ bio- artificial ’ fertilizers to start agriculture
additional stuff that will come to mind last minute
In whichever case , the goods will have to be on the spot location within a relatively short time .
In the event of a ‘ construction team ’ on the spot , this team will have to guard the materials and bury them until later .
Phase four : move to the spot and set up a temporary camp
Duration : 1 week
Before the Alpha team leaves the the big city forever – and thus actually unplug from the matrix – they will have to send a ‘ go ’ signal to the Beta team in Belgium / Western Europe .
For security reasons we wont get into further details on how the go signal will be sent or transmitted .
From this point , the Alpha team leaves all matrix abstractions , and will need to get their own food .
No more money to buy food with , a car to drive , …
This is where the ‘ way in ’ process starts .
The process in which every colony member will have to face the hard transition effects from the matrix life to the unplugged life .
This will be without a doubt the toughest period for the Alpha team members .
Once the Alpha team is re-united the temporary camp will be set up .
This will be in analogy with the setup of the Belgian Princess Elisabeth Antarctic Research Station .
The video ( and the whole website ) are very much like our progress – only the temperature will be slightly warmer .
This temporary camp will be set up with tents and some shelters to protect tools and additional materials from weather .
In this phase it will be crucial to set the right priorities and make sure we have a plan to continue building in both good and bas weather circumstances .
Once the temporary camp is set up and the entire Alpha team agrees on the schedule for the next weeks , we arrive at their final and last phase .
Phase five : set up the basics for the final colony village
Duration : ~ 1 month
The best way to cheer up and have some stability in your minds is to make sure your life is scheduled with building tasks .
This fifth and final stage of the Alpha team is crucial to the Beta team .
The beta team is larger , are less ‘ survivalist ’ , and might have some kids among them .
Alpha team ’s final task will thus be :
provide tents and shelter for the coming Beta team
set up sustainable agriculture
develop a clean water supply to the future village
construction of city hall
City hall will be the nerve centre of the village .
It will house the central heating system , there will be a water tower build in the roof of it , and it will be the central meeting place for the colonists .
Without this city hall there wont be much luxury possible in the smaller houses .
Meanwhile
I ’m working to test out free energy possibilities and Number 13 is currently creating our village to scale 1:87 ( H0 ) , like a diorama .
We made a paper scale model , and it already looks cute .
But that ’s another big story , firstly , the beta team arrives …

If you liked The host , but wanted something a little darker , get ready for Chaw , the latest Korean monster movie from director Shin Jeong - won .
Over at the film ’s official website ( or beyond the break ) you can get your first look at the international trailer for the film , which features a creepy look at the pic ’s monster , along with the official synopsis .
“ One day in a small and peaceful village Sameri , boasting no criminal cases for 10 years , a terrible accident happens .
Ecologists studying wild animals on a nearby mountain , discover a collection of dismembered body parts .
Policeman KIM
Kang - su just transferred to Sameri from Seoul takes the case .
The victim turns out a grand - daughter of Chun il - man , who was once a legendary hunter .
Chun is convinced that it was n’t a human that murdered his granddaughter but a man-eating boar , Chaw .
Terrified , the people of Sameri invite one of the most famous hunters Baek to catch the Chaw .
Baek leaps at the chance hoping it will prove himself to be the best ever hunter .

Republicans are so hilarious !
They go into the 2008 presidential election with a 300 - year - old dinosaur as their standard bearer .
That does n't work out so well , and they exit the year fractured , demoralized , and rudderless .
A normal party uses opportunities like these to change direction , reform , and rebrand .
It 's not easy -- we had a ton of resistance from the ineffective DLC - ish status quo when we got Howard Dean elected chair of the party and dragged the party kicking and screaming into a more anti-war posture .
But our grassroots was eager for change , and we embraced those candidates who promised it , from Dean , to Ned Lamont , to Darcy Burner , to Jim Webb , to Eric Massa , to Barack Obama , and so on .
But Republicans ?
their own grassroots are so wedded to the status quo that anyone in the establishment attempting to move the party to a more electorally viable posture is branded a heretic and cast out of their club .
They think they 've lost elections because they have n't shouted the crazy loud enough ( more teabagging please ! ) , or because their insults just are n't as effective anymore ( let 's try " fascist " now ! ) .
So they stick to their old loser policies , from their pathological defense of the ultra wealthy , to their clinging to doomed opposition to gay marriage .
And as for leadership ?
Well , who better to defend the status quo than the status quo ?
Into that breach has entered Rush Limbaugh , Glenn Beck , and Joe the Plumber to provide the philosophical underpinnings of the GOP .
For the party that could once depend on the intellectual prowess of William F. Buckley , this has certainly been a downgrade .
As their public face , if they could dig up Ronald Reagan and prop him up at RNC headquarters , they would .
Instead , the Palins and Jindals jostle and compete for who can be the most ridiculously regressive .
But for a party that predicates its philosophy on distrust of change , it looks like this leadership vacuum is best filled by old retreads -- Dick Cheney , Newt Gingrich , and Karl Rove .
All three Republicans have image problems .
A January Pew Research Center poll showed just 31 percent viewed Cheney favorably .
Rove 's appearances serve to remind the American public of the similarly - unpopular Bush administration .
And Gingrich , who is said to be considering a presidential bid in 2012 , never enjoyed widespread popularity during his tenure as Speaker .
Cheney , Gingrich and Rove have all sucked up time on cable news networks and sparked new controversies .
Media outlets fixating on remarks the three Republicans make , Democrats say , are robbing the Congressional GOP of oxygen they need to get out their own message and fight back against Democratic initiatives .
“ I think most voters , especially those under 50 , see Cheney , Gingrich and Rove as the symbols of a Republican Party built on intolerance , deceit and division , ” said Democratic strategist Peter Giangreco .
“ Where voters are tired of the old politics of conflict , these men still want to divide America into red states and blue states , into good Americans and bad Americans . ”
What a great team !
But not for them .
For us .

Your Family Insurance Company
This doesnt surprise me , but I hadnt seen these figures before .
They re in a letter to the New York Times from David A. Balto , of the Center for American Progress .
Between 2000 and 2007 , the 10 largest publicly traded insurance companies increased their profits 428 percent , from $ 2.4 billion to $ 12.9 billion , according to Securities and Exchange Commission filings .
During the same period , the number of insurers fell by nearly 20 percent , largely because of a huge wave of mergers that led to stunning consolidation .
And premiums increased by more than 87 percent , rising four times faster than the average Americans wages .
Today , 95 percent of American insurance markets qualify as tight oligopolies .
As in so many industries , blind reliance on free - market forces has failed the American public .
Clearly , doctors bear a responsibility to curb costs .
But the real culprits are the middlemen who , after years of lax regulation , now have such a tight grip on the market that they can  and do  charge whatever they want .
Yesterday the embargoes lifted on reviews of AMD 's six - core Opteron server processor , codenamed " Istanbul , " but for all that 's riding on Istanbul there were n't that many reviews out there .
Tech Reports ' Scott Wasson and Anandtech 's Johan DeGalas , however , came through with very thorough reviews of Istanbul that pit it against its predecessor ( quad- core Shanghai ) and members of Intel 's Xeon line .
Istanbul is essentially a quad - core Shanghai part with two extra cores and a faster HyperTransport interface .
So it has the same 6MB L3 cache and the same dual - channel DDR2 controller , a fact that has some fascinating implications for how the part performs in different system topologies .
The dual - socket picture
Scott 's review compared the six - core Istanbul to its quad - core Opteron predecessors and to the quad - core Xeon 5550 ( Nehalem ) .
All of the tests were run on dual - processor machines , and neither Scott nor Johan tested a four - processor rig .
What the tests ultimately showed was that the quad - core Xeon 's combination of higher per-thread performance and superior memory bandwidth ( triple - channel DDR3 vs. Istanbul 's dual - channel DDR2 ) gave it a definitive edge over its six - core competitor in most tests .
The simple fact is that bandwidth and per- thread performance still rule in most workloads .
Though none of the reviewers tested a four - socket Istanbul , I suspect that this configuration is where the new processor will really shine .
But there are a few places where Istanbul holds its own against Xeon .
In particular , Johan 's tests indicate that the processor is a good buy for lower VM - count servers that are focused on consolidating existing workloads onto a single physical box .
And Scott 's detailed platform - level power measurements give Istanbul the edge in performance per watt , especially on highly multithreaded , scalable workloads .
In such cases , the Xeon 's faster memory boosts the Intel platform 's power consumption , so Istanbul is able to match it with slower memory and a higher physical core count per socket .
These results indicate that Istanbul is still a good fit for HPC clusters .
So while the quad - core Xeon X5550 beats the similarly priced Istanbul six - core in price / performance and raw performance in 2P configs , Istanbul is a match for it on many workloads in performance per watt .
And AMD 's newest is enough of an improvement over Shanghai that it's a solid upgrade for any Socket F server , especially given that it 's a drop - in replacement .
What 's left unanswered by both reviews is how well Istanbul compares to Intel 's six - core " Dunnington " Xeon , which is bandwidth - impaired due to its aging frontside bus architecture .
If anyone knows of any reviews that covered this , please send a link my way .
The four - socket picture
Though none of the reviewers tested a four - socket Istanbul , I suspect that this configuration is where the new processor will really shine .
The secret sauce here is something that AMD calls " HT Assist , " and it 's basically a trick that lets AMD trade off 1MB of L3 cache space per processor for an alleged HT streaming bandwidth increase of 17 GB / s ( from 25 GB / s on a non-HT - enabled link to 42 GB /s ) .
HT Assist works by using 1MB of L3 to store an index of the contents of the other processors ' caches .
So whenever a processor needs to check the other processors ' caches for the latest version of a piece of data , instead of polling the other sockets with a broadcasted request it can check the local index to see which processor 's cache is hosting a copy of the needed data and ping that processor directly .
This scheme cuts down significantly on memory - overhead - related bus traffic , leaving more HT link bandwidth available for actual data transfers .
It seems likely that in a 2P Istanbul is hamstrung by its dual - channel DDR2 controller .
But when you move to 4P and there 's more inter - socket memory traffic , the memory bottleneck shifts from the DDR2 link to the HT link , and that 's where HT assist will help tremendously .
The real question is whether HT Assist can help even the score with Xeon in a 4P config , or whether this new trick is necessary just to keep Istanbul from falling even further behind in 4P and above .
The answer to that will depend partly on how inefficient QPI is in handling cache coherency among four or more Xeon sockets ; but even if QPI is relatively inefficient vs.
HT , Xeon still has the following advantages in terms of cache coherency : 1 ) it has only four cores per socket emitting snoop traffic , and 2 ) it has more memory bandwidth per socket .
So it may turn out to be the case that HT Assist is necessary just to keep the combination of added snoop traffic from the two extra cores per socket and lower per-socket memory bandwidth from murdering Istanbul 's performance in 4P and above systems .
Following on this line of inquiry , it 's worth nothing that Intel did n't announce any special , HT Assist - style tricks with its recent Nehalem - EX reveal .
That is n't to say that they wo n't eventually do something like this , but they just have n't announced it .
It 's worth noting that at some point , everyone trades cache transistors for bandwidth , and Intel had a very long history of doing that before QPI came to market .
( Witness the ballooning cache sizes on Intel 's processors until Nehalem launched ) .
HT
Assist is just another , very specialized example of this classic tradeoff , which is often a very good one that lets a processor maker leverage Moore 's Law directly to rein in system costs and power consumption .

I just got back from San Francisco Monday .
I went up to join in a protest of the Scientology rally against the American Psychiatric Association convention at Moscone Center .
Along with a march down Market Street , the Scientology front group , Citizens Commission on Human Rights , was hosting a traveling roadshow entitled , " Psychiatry , Industry of Death . "
Approximately 400 Scientologists from all over the country showed up for this march , waving pre-fab signs and chanting pre-fab slogans provided them by the mother ship .
The ' Industry of Death ' exhibit has a permanent museum in Hollywood , and this road show travels around the country spreading lies and misinformation about the psychiatric profession .
Did you know psychiatrists were behind the Holocaust ?
( they were n't )
Did you know that Saddam Hussein was under the influence of a pychiatrist ?
( he was n't )
They blame the mental health industry for society 's woes , and claim that mental illness is a mere fabrication crafted to sell drugs .
If Christianity has Satan and demons , Scientology 's evil entities are psychiatrists , psychologists , and Big Pharma .
Now , if a few consenting adults want to eschew treatment , that is their business and , if harmless , their right .
But Scientology wants to impose its beliefs on contemporary society , in order to advance their goal of creating a perfect Scientology planet .
The APA has tried to ignore Scientology 's attacks , but this year , in a stunning turn of events , the President of the American Psychiatric Association , Dr. Nada Stotland , addressed this issue from the podium .
Dr. Stotland says , " There is no other medical specialty I know of that has its own particular , dedicated hate group . "
Yes , that 's right , hate group .
CCHR 's own website is full of vile accusations against psychiatry and psychiatrists .
Their videos have graphic images of " psychs " being machine - gunned , and offices being blown up with hand grenades .
When I returned to San Diego , it was to hear that Fat Actress Kirstie Alley has begun a Twitter campaign against a bill written to help mothers understand and deal with Post - Partum Depression .
Of course , Alley is merely a celebrity puppet being used by the Scientology organization to further its goal of denying citizens any access to mental health help .
The MOTHERS Act was introduced by Senators Robert Menendez ( D - New Jersey ) and Richard Durbin ( D - Illinois ) in 2006 .
The Mom ’s Opportunity To Access Help , Education , Research , and Support for Postpartum Depression ( MOTHERS )
Act seeks to improve education , access to treatment , and research into PPD .
This bill has been passed by the House of Representatives , and the Scientologists are working furiously to derail it ; using misleading information , fear - mongering and flat - out lies to influence the public .
Senator Menendez ' website explains the bill further ,
" Specifically , the MOTHERS Act will help new moms by :
Providing important education and screening on postpartum depression ( PPD ) that can lead to early identification and treatment .
A major part of prevention is informing new mothers about the symptoms and providing them with the services that are available in their community .
Thus , this legislation includes two grants to help health care providers educate , identify and treat PPD .
Awards grants to States so that local health care providers ( physicians , nurse midwives , and other licensed health care professionals ) can educate women who have recently given birth and their families about PPD before the mothers leave the birthing center and offer the opportunity for new mothers to be screened for postpartum depression symptoms during the first year of postnatal check - up visits .
Awards grants to States and local governments , public or non-profit hospitals and community based organizations for the delivery of essential services to individuals with postpartum depression and psychosis and their families , including enhanced outpatient and home - based health care , inpatient care and support services . "
Nowhere does this bill suggest that women or their children will be forcibly drugged , but this is one of the fearmongering " factual statements " put forth by Scientology , CCHR , and its celebrity mouthpieces like Kirstie Alley .
Look at some of the absurd statements in Kirstie Alley 's Twitter feed :
" I have to get you all info on THE MOTHER ’S ACT .
this is this lousy BILL that would give BIG BROTHER the right to force you to drug ur kids AND MANDATE that when you are pregnant , YOU MUST take drugs if a Dr. tells you to .
THIS is BIG BROTHER at his finest .
More on this soon moms I am organizing a MILLION MOM MARCH to protest this BILL .
It just keeps rearing it ’s head .
BACKED 100 % by BIG PHARMA .
MOMS UNITE !!
BABIES HAVING PROZAC squirted in there eyes at birth to prevent depression later on .
HELLO 1984 ..
I will keep you informed .
It is brutal !
@scarrieann I am serious .
PROZAC in babies eyes !
And this is not a FUTURE scene , it is done right now every day . "
Well , no , it is n't " done right now every day . "
In fact , outside of Kirstie 's source of " information , " nobody has ever heard of this practise .
Furthermore , the MOTHERS
Act has nothing to do with " drugging babies . "
It is solely an attempt to establish a better system of education , access to treatment , and research of PPD .
This legislation incorporates a House bill , the Melanie Stokes Postpartum Depression Research and Care Act. Melanie Stokes was a new mother who looked forward to being a mom .
Her story is a tragic example of why this legislation is so desperately needed .
Caught up in a cycle of post - partum psychosis , she failed to respond to treatment and , after a few weeks of mental and physical decline , she ended her life .
It is absolutely irresponsible and reprehensible for Scientology , its front groups and celebrity mouthpieces to spew this fearmongering load of pure falsehoods to the public .
Scientology 's history is littered with shattered minds fallen victim to L. Ron Hubbard 's ignorant garbage .
Anyone who depends on a college dropout pulp fiction hack for medical advice is doomed to a life of insanity , as Hubbard 's own mental deficiencies are imposed upon Scientologists in hours of mind - numbing hypnotic drills .
People 's personalities change .
They are taught to rely solely on Scientology teachings rather than research things for themselves .
They trust Scientology to provide them with correct information .
In a blatant betrayal of this trust , the Scientology organization has no problem lying to them , assured that they will not seek a second opinion .
Be assured that Scientologists nation - wide are flooding their elected representatives ' email inboxes , mailboxes and voicemails with their opposition to the MOTHERS Act .
Do n't let them win !
Write your representative now if you support this bill !
Make your voices heard !
Remember , the only way stupidity can prevail is if good people do nothing .

COLOMBO , Sri Lanka ( CNN ) --
Shell - shocked and scarred both inside and out , they huddle in tents , water and medicine in short supply -- hundreds of thousands of people , civilian victims of Sri Lanka 's recently - ended civil war .
Displaced Sri Lankan people look out from inside a camp in Cheddikulam .

" We suffered a lot because shelling was coming from everywhere , " said a 38 - year - old man identifying himself as Vishwamala .
" Firing , shelling -- many , many people have died ... there was nobody there to carry the dead .
A lot of dead were left on the road . "
Another survivor , Krisha Duray , recalls " running and running " to escape shelling by both the Sri Lankan military and the Tamil Tiger rebels , who waged a bloody 25 - year war .
United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon on Saturday visited refugee camps housing such victims .
" I have traveled around the world and visited similar places , but this is by far the most appalling scenes I have seen , " he said .
Ban requested that the United Nations be provided full access to the displacement camps in order to provide aid .
In a joint statement issued Saturday , Ban and Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa said the United Nations will continue to provide humanitarian assistance to displaced persons , and that the government will continue to provide access to humanitarian agencies .
That access , however , is limited .
The United Nations and other organizations have never had full access , as government officials fear some remaining Tamil Tiger rebels may be hiding in the camps and are screening those inside .
Watch the U.N. chief discuss the humanitarian crisis »
Sri Lanka 's Sunday
Times newspaper reported that attempts to smuggle youths out of the camps has prompted the government to impose restrictions on visits .
Rajiva Wijesinha , the nation 's human rights ministry secretary , was quoted as telling the newspaper that people " with the connivance of Non- Governmental Organization workers " were involved in the plot .
Because of the plot , " a thorough screening of IDPs was under way , " the newspaper said .
" I have United Nations humanitarian agencies , and there are ICRC ( International Committee of the Red Cross ) and many other international humanitarian agency workers , " Ban said in a Saturday news conference , according to a transcript .
" They should be given unimpeded access and freedom of movement within the camp .
That is what I have asked the foreign minister and the president ( for ) , and I was assured that the leaders of the Sri Lankan government will make sure ( of this ) . "
Sri Lanka 's government as of Sunday had not responded to Ban 's appeal .
But the joint statement Saturday said , " The government will expedite the necessary basic and civil infrastructure as well as ( the ) means of livelihood necessary for the IDPs to resume their normal lives at the earliest .
" The Secretary - General welcomed the announcement by the government expressing its intention to dismantle the welfare villages at the earliest as outlined in the plan to resettle the bulk of IDPs and call for its early implementation . "
Ban toured Manik Farm , a sprawling camp for internally displaced people in the country 's north , days after Sri Lanka declared victory in a 25 - year civil war against the Tamil Tigers rebels .
About 250,000 to 300,000 people are refugees in the country , according to humanitarian groups and U.N. figures .
Some in the camp have experienced fierce fighting in recent months , saying that at moments they did not believe they were going to survive .
Asked whether he agrees with the military 's assertions that not many civilians died in the violence , Ban told CNN he believes there were many civilian casualties .
While the war 's end elicited celebrations in parts of the country , humanitarian groups and the United Nations worry about those uprooted by the fighting .
Ban arrived in the South Asian island nation Friday , saying he came to offer help and partnership .
" I hope my visit today can help begin a process of national recovery , renewal and reconciliation for all Sri Lankans , " Ban said in a written statement issued Friday .
" That is why I am here . "
He said he would urge the government to expedite the screening and processing of refugees and ensure that displaced camps have adequate supplies of food , medicine and water .
With the war 's end , " the government of Sri Lanka faces many immediate and long - term challenges relating to issues of relief , rehabilitation , resettlement and reconciliation , " the joint statement said .
Ban also flew to the site of the civil war 's final battle , near Mullaitivu .
CNN 's Iqbal Athas in Colombo , Sri Lanka , and CNN's Sara Sidner contributed to this report .

Note : this is not seasonally adjusted .
There is a very distinct seasonal pattern for imports , but not for exports .
Sometimes port traffic gives us an early hint of changes in the trade deficit .
The following graph shows the loaded inbound and outbound traffic at the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach in TEUs ( TEUs : 20 - foot equivalent units or 20 - foot - long cargo container ) .
Although containers tell us nothing about value , container traffic does give us an idea of the volume of goods being exported and imported .
Click on graph for larger image in new window .
Inbound traffic was 19.7 % below May 2008 .
Outbound traffic was 15.3 % below May 2008 .
There has been some recovery in exports over the last few months ( the year - over - year comparison was off 30 % from December through February ) .
But this is the 3nd worst YoY comparison for imports - only February and April were worse .
So imports from Asia appear especially weak .
This suggests a little more improvement in the trade balance with Asia in the May trade report .
Of course the overall trade deficit will probably be worse because of rising oil prices .
The Group of Eight powers called on all parties in the Middle East to " re-enter direct negotiations on all standing issues consistent with the Road Map " and it called for a freeze in Jewish settlement construction on the occupied West Bank .
The G8 also deplored violence in Iran after its disputed election on Friday and urged Tehran to settle the crisis soon through democratic dialogue , according to the final draft statement seen by Reuters .

What a twitter :
The moment sleeping kitten is pecked awake by cheeky budgie who wants to play
In the cartoon world , Sylvester was forever cweeping up on his would - be supper , Tweety Pie .
But in the real world , it seems , there has been something of a role reversal .
The pictures here show a living room shared by a kitten and a budgie .
This is n't the pecking order :
Having left its cage , a budgie cheekily pecks dozing kitten
In what could have been a fatal display of daring , the bird decided to leave his cage and taunt his feline playfellow by reversing the normal pecking order .
He hopped on top of the napping kitten , trying to attract his attention , but the good - natured kitten simply ignored him .
Emboldened , the bird then hops onto the kitten , which begins to wake up .
The feline is not quite sure what to do
Undeterred , the budgie continued to harass his sleepy - eyed friend until he lazily opened an eye to see what was going on .
After being repeatedly pecked on the midriff , the kitten jumped up and took a swipe at its tormentor .
Then as the cat gave chase , the budgie led it straight into his cage .
The antics of the two , whose identities are unknown , have become an internet hit .
After being persistently pecked in the midriff , the kitten now looks less than happy ...
Patience exhausted , the kitten springs up and takes a swipe at its feathered tormentor ...
But this game between the unnamed animals may not last as the kitten grows up .
Budgerigars are known to be very active , energetic , and lively birds .
They are originally from Australia and live on grains and seeds and have never eaten cats .
They grow up to 18 cm .
In contrast , their feline friends grow up to 46 cm in length and live on a diet of commercial cat food as well as rodents ... and birds .
There can be few more potent symbols of the new caring age in which we are supposed to be living , post - credit crunch , than that of the man who voluntarily gave up one of his organs so that a perfect stranger might live .
Paul Vandenbosch , a father of four aged 54 , donated a kidney to a woman whom he did not know and has never met to save her from kidney failure , spare her the ordeal of dialysis and help to restore her to health and a normal life .
As an act of generosity , it would be difficult to beat .
Donating blood is a generous act , but this is of a different order .
It involves a significant amount of pain and a lot of disruption – preparing for the operation and recovering from it .
Nor is it without risk , though this is probably lower than most people think .
It is altruism of the purest kind .

Yet altruistic kidney donation – to a person with whom the donor has no connection – has leapt 50 per cent in the past year , according to latest figures from the Human Tissue Authority , published yesterday .
The numbers are still small – 10 in 2007 - 8 rising to 15 last year – but the practice was only approved in 2007 , and the upward trend is unmistakeable .
This is good news for the 8,000 people currently on the waiting list for a transplant , fewer than half of whom will receive a replacement organ this year because of the shortage of donors .
It was his first - hand awareness of the devastating impact of kidney disease that started Dr Vandenbosch , a GP in Surrey , thinking about becoming a living donor .
As a junior doctor in the 1970s , his first job was on a renal ward – an experience that has never left him – and he has cared for many kidney patients in his practice since .
" The turning point came when I asked a man my own age about the impact a transplant had made .
' It 's like winning the lottery ' he said , before adding , ' No , it 's better than that because no amount of money could have made me feel well again . ' "
Once he started to think about , the feeling that he should go ahead grew .
" It is difficult to say why the feeling became so strong .
When you try to do beneficial actions you think about your own situation .
I am fit and healthy , prosperous , with a supportive family .
I am very conscious of my own good fortune .
That is probably part of the motivation . "
Although he is a church - goer , he describes himself as a " not very active member " and says it was not so much his religious belief as secular considerations about the good that he could do that led him to his decision .
" There are lots of questions surrounding charitable donations , even about giving money to charities such as Oxfam , which I do , over how the money is used .
People argue that it may not be very effective .
But it is very difficult to argue that giving your kidney is not beneficial .
Someone can potentially get an enormous benefit from your donation , against a small risk . "
His medical training helped him judge the risks .
" As well as being more aware of the impact of kidney disease I was also in a good position to assess how hazardous it was .
Or particularly how hazardous it was n't .
I looked into this with some care and found the chances of coming to grief over a year from any other cause were considerably greater than from the operation .
I think people have an exaggerated idea of the risk .
If people were able to assess it and to anticipate how much pain and disruption was involved they might be more willing to donate . "
His wife and family backed his decision without being particularly enthusiastic .
" They were supportive , they felt it was in character .
No one said I was mad , " he said .
He admits the pain was significant – " I was quite sore " – but he recovered quickly , was out of hospital in three days and back at work in a couple of weeks .
Four months after the operation – in April last year – he went on a cycling holiday with no other sign or symptom of the operation than the scar .
The most difficult part was the time required to go through the necessary assessments – physical and psychiatric .
" Going up to the hospital , being checked over – that was the bit that bugged me most .
Especially the psychiatric assessment .
Someone may have a bizarre disorder like body dysmorphism [ excessive concern with a physical defect ] which means they should be shunted away but I felt it was a bit intrusive .
My brother - in - law recently started riding a large motorbike and he did n't have to undergo a psychiatric assessment , though his wife might have thought it appropriate . "
Most organs for transplants are taken from people who have died but every year more and more people agree to donate organs while they are alive .
The number of living kidney donors rose to 927 last year and they now account for more than one in three of all kidney transplants .
The vast majority involve donations from relatives and , to a lesser extent , from friends .
There are also " paired donations " where a couple who are unable to donate to each other , because of a poor tissue match , effectively swap organs with another couple in the same position .
Dr Vandenbosch has never met the woman who now carries his kidney , and has no particular desire to do so .
" I am glad to have heard from her that she got it and that she is doing well .
She sent me a card and she is fine .
But I do n't need her gratitude to make me feel what I have done is worthwhile .
I do n't need her to give me a hug .
It is an internal action , that I have done something altruistic .
" One of the questions you are asked in the assessment is to prepare for the possibility that it may not work .
Your kidney may be rejected and end up in the incinerator . "
The shortage of donors is a constant theme in transplant surgery .
More than 1,000 patients are expected to die this year before an organ becomes available .
Yesterday , leaders of the main religious faiths appealed to their followers to support a campaign to increase the numbers on the organ - donor register .
The aim of the campaign is to clarify what each religion teaches about organ donation and remove uncertainty .
The campaign is supported by the Anglican and Roman Catholic churches and leaders of the Jewish , Muslim , Sikh and Hindu communities .
Altruistic living donation is still in its infancy , but it could have a significant impact .
Vicki Chapman , policy director at the Human Tissue Authority , said : " It is remarkable to see an increase in the number of people who want to donate a kidney to someone they do not know .
We expected to see a small number of cases when we first started approving this type opf transplant but we did not expect to see the number rise so significantly after just one year . "
The HTA has to approve all transplants involving living people , following an independent assessment , to ensure both donor and recipient understand what is involved and that the risks have been properly explained .
It also has to satisfy itself that no money has changed hands – in some countries there is an active trade in organs for transplant .
Dr Vandenbosch said : " I very much hope I can encourage others to think about altruistic donation .
Kidney patients are the single largest group awaiting transplants and there are enough potential living donors around .
It does n't have to be a great many to make a big difference . "
" My feeling is that if people were able to assess the risks and how much pain and disruption was involved they would be more willing to donate .
It is not such a big deal . "
The parents of a 16 - year - old high school student who committed suicide last month have filed a $ 3 - million claim against his Orange County school district alleging that administrators and staff failed for years to intervene while their son was “ relentlessly bullied . ”
Daniel Mendez , a sophomore at San Clemente High School in the Capistrano Unified School District , drove to a friend ’s house in San Clemente shortly after school let out May 1 .
He parked nearby , got out of the car and shot himself , authorities concluded .
According to the claim filed by his parents , Mendez had been bullied for years .
The bullying , they said , intensified during the week before his death .

Mendez ’s difficulties at school started in sixth grade , said James Traut , an attorney representing Danny and Anna Mendez , the dead student ’s parents .
“ He was shy and quiet and he took it , even though it bothered him , ” Traut said .
Mendez ’s parents do n’t know why their son became the target of bullies , but they sought counseling for him because of it and approached the school several times for help , Traut said .
“ It was common knowledge there was a lot of taunting going on , ” the attorney said .

School district officials did not return phone calls seeking comment .
In the days leading up to Mendez ’s death , the taunting was severe , Traut said .
“ There were two boys in particular who were persistent at it , ” he said .
The day of his death , Mendez was in a fight with the boys and suffered a split lip and bruising , Traut added .

Mendez ’s parents said they learned about the fight and the buildup of the bullying during that last week from his fellow students , who described it to them after his death .
The claim , which can be a precursor to a lawsuit , seeks $ 3 million in damages .
The claim asks that all of the money be directed to the Orangewood Children ’s Home , an emergency shelter for abused and neglected children in Orange County .
“ Hopefully , ” Traut said , “ there will be a consequence that will result in the school district doing something to prevent bullying .
. . .
[ The Mendezes are ] not interested in receiving money based on the death of their son . ”

Over the weekend I helped a buddy pick out a brand new Apple MacBook Pro laptop and realized that I ’ve slowly but surely become an Apple Evangelist .
To help my buddy and other new Apple users make the most of their new Macs here ’s 45 free applications for Mac OS X .
Productivity
Very simple to - do checklist that sits in your menu bar .
In addition to telling everyone about the awesomeness of Apple computers and the Mac OS X Leopard operating system I also evangelize the heck out of OpenOffice.org .
In my eight years of using OpenOffice.org on Windows , Ubuntu , and Mac OS X I ’ve found it to be super stable and packed with nearly all the functionality of the much more expensive ( e.g. not free ) Microsoft Office .
So far I ’ve had no need to use MS Office as OpenOffice.org provides enough applications to get the job done .
When I got my Macbook Pro three years ago I installed and used Aquamacs Emacs but after installing a fresh Leopard system I took another look at my applications and fell in love with TextWrangler .
I especially love that it integrates with my SFTP browser , CyberDuck , for easy editing right on my server .
The new spotlight in Leopard is awesome but still lacks the extensive features of Quicksilver .
Launching a terminal window with my first command line already inputted in just two or three key taps is a beautiful thing .
You can also control iTunes directly from Quicksilver and a whole host of other sweet commands .
For the few compressed file formats Leopard does n’t recognize out of the box , The Unarchiver will uncompress them and even has options to automatically delete the zipped file after its opened up .
Sync your facebook events with iCal .
Another to do check list application .
Anxiety is more versatile than Check - Off but for me Check - Off does the job fine but if you need something more robust check out Anxiety .
I used Aquamacs Emacs for the longest time when I first got my Mac but am now loving TextWrangler .
Both are solid text editing programs with their own pros and cons .
I prefer using my iPhone as my alarm , but for those who are inclined to use their laptop , Tiny Alarm is a great little app that sites in your menu bar .
A great personal finance manager .
A while back I picked up Cha - Ching via a Macheist giveaway , but if I did n’t I ’d be using Cashbox .
Both are great personal finance applications , one is free the other is n’t but both should treat you right .
Communication
i Chat is cool but Adium is much , much better .
This open source application allows to connect to nearly every messaging system on the planet .
The list includes AIM , MSN , Google Talk , ICQ , Facebook Chat , Myspace IM , Bonjour , LiveJournal Chat , Gadu Gadu and more !
The best way to interact with Twitter .
Runs off Adobe Air and is fast and easy to use .
I did n’t really get Twitter until I downloaded and installed TweetDeck and now I ’m tweeting all the time !
Great for making cheap international calls .
I also use Skype to set up a business line so my cell phone does n’t get jammed with calls .
You can also instant message , call and video chat with others over the internet for free .
Unobtrusive application / system notification .
A great way to explain Growl is to provide an example .
It integrates with Adium and will show a small temporary popup window whenever a contact signs on / off or sends you a message .
Audio
Allows you to move music off your iPod without dealing with iTunes .
In other words , it turns your iPod into a regular disk drive .
Great alternative to Garageband for recording audio .
GimmeSomeTune is an iTunes extension that adds a lot of functionality to iTunes , but chief among them is the ability to import missing artwork and fetch song lyrics .
It also integrates with Last .fm thus allowing you to have one less application running on your Mac .
Video
Expands on Mac OS X ’s built in disc recording and adds a ton more file formats and options while still keeping the interface simple and speedy .
This open - source , multi- threaded video converter accepts DVD , DVD - esque ( images and some . VOB files ) , and multimedia files and converts them to MP4 , MKV , AVI or OGM / MPEG - 4 , H.264 , or Theora formats quickly and easily .
i Squint A video converter to make your videos suitable for viewing on an iPod / iPhone .
The best media player on the planet .
VLC will play nearly every video and audio format out there .
Another media player but it ’s hook is that Miro allows you to setup RSS feeds for torrents and other media files for automated downloading of videos .
The list of legally free videos out there is extensive and will keep you entertained for a long , long time .
Caffeine is a light weight application that sits in your menu bar .
A simple click turns off the screen saver or delays it for a set amount of time .
A great time saver for when you want to watch a video without getting interrupted by your screen saver .
I reviewed Caffeine at Only The Internet ’s Best Reviews in September ’08 and it still remains one of the highest rated items on OTIBR ( scored it a 38/42 ) .
Plugin for Quicktime letting you play Windows Media Video files on your Mac .
The best of both worlds !
Images
Not as good as Adobe Photoshop CS4 but it ’s free ( while Photoshop is $ 600 ) .
The GIMP should be just good enough for the majority of users out there and will at least tide you over until you save up for a copy of Photoshop .
A photo browser for facebook .
Quick and very easy to use , PhotoBook will display all your friend ’s facebook photos in a convenient album format for quick browsing .
A sweet vector graphics application .
Drag and drop interface for quickly and easily uploading your pics to Flickr .
DeskLickr will go out to Flickr and import photos and automatically change your desktop background every so often .
Nice for those of us who get bored of our backgrounds quite easily .
Mac Maintenance
A graphical outline of your hard drive showing what ’s using up space and how much of it .
Handy for when you ’re running low and need to find files to delete .
Sure the new Leopard operating system comes with Time Machine , but Super Duper is great for making bootable clones of your drive .
It ’s super handy for when you need to bring your Mac in for repairs as it lets you keep working with your files and setup .
I ’ve used Super Duper extensively over the past two weeks while bringing my Macbook Pro in for repairs and had almost no loss in productivity thanks to Super Duper and a generous friend who loaned me his brand new Macbook !
Control your Mac ’s fans from a simple graphical interface .
Very handy for diagnosing if your Mac ’s fans are busted , as one of mine recently was .
Also useful for cranking up the RPMs when you think your Mac is getting a tad too hot for comfort .
A Command Line Interface for OS X / Terminal !
Clix stores literally hundreds and hundreds of commands , allowing you to click through and run them through Terminal .
It ’s handy even for command line experts who ca n’t remember all the commands or syntax .
Perhaps the most useful Dashboard widget out there .
iStat Pro will display your CPU temperatures , hard drive space , network stats , fan speed , running processes ( and how much CPU power they take up ) .
All in real time from the convenience of your dashboard .
Mac OS
X’s built in Software Update is great but only works for Mac OS X and other Apple applications .
AppFresh will notify you when all your other applications have updates available by periodically checking osx.iusethis.com .
OnyX
A Graphical User Interface for all your Mac ’s maintenance needs .
You can perform most of these processes from the command line , but if you just got a Mac you ’re probably terrified of Terminal right now .
Dragging your applications to the trash can is a very simple way to delete old or unwanted applications but usually leaves files scattered about your hard drive .
Using AppCleaner will ensure all those pesky files are gone , freeing up hard drive space and lowering the chance for any conflicts .
Web
The best FTP / SFTP / Amazon S3 browser / uploader / downloader on the planet .
Drag n drop interface that is integrated with your Mac ’s keychain for a no hassle upload / download experience .
Easy to setup and use local server for developing and testing your web - sites before they go live .
Needless to say this gets a lot of use on my Macbook Pro .
The best RSS reader on the planet .
With a free account at NewsGator.com you can sync your feeds between different locations .
I love this app as it allows me to read my feeds on my iPhone knowing that whatever I read or clip ( bookmark ) will sync back to my Macbook Pro at home .
I love the speedy Safari , and in fact spend most of my day within its friendly confines , but Firefox has an immense library of extensions and plugins that Safari has yet to match .
Besides , it ’s free , what ’ve you got to lose ?
Besides a little bit of hard drive space of course .
DeepVacuum is a graphical interface for the unix command wget , which allows you to download entire web - sites .
Useful for developers who want to take a peak at a site ’s code or people who wish to browse a site offline .
Simple but powerful bittorrent client .
A great way to store files in a cloud for easy access from any internet connection .
A graphical interface for TOR , the safest and easiest way to browse the web anonymously .
Very useful for users who live in a country with a strict firewall or for accessing sites you do n’t want associated with you .
Though , I must state that if a government agency wants to find you they will , so do n’t go doing something stupid or dangerous just because you ’re behind a TOR connection .
Many of us have had our confidence shaken .
If you 're like me you might have thought of your advisors as not just hired hands , but trusted allies .
I was confident that I had a crack team working for my best interests and that they were taking initiative to make sure I was safe .
The subsequent crisis left me with the question of who I could trust .
Were these people looking out for my best interests at all ?
Are They Crooks ?
If you 're trying to decide whether to trust someone with your money , you certainly do n't want to do so if they 're criminals .
Many of us , after the results of the recent crisis , are left to wonder whether our investment advisors were n't just being negligent but in fact deceitful .
You seriously have to wonder if they were routing your money to their friends , or getting kickbacks or some other under - the - table deal .
Ultimately after my initial outrage I 've become confident that they are not criminals .
I do n't think they wanted to see me do poorly and are honestly upset that I did n't do better .
I do n't think the financial sector and the investing industry are thieves per se , but that 's not a complete answer to whether they are trustworthy .
Are They Acting in Your Best Interests ?
This is ultimately the question that you really want to understand .
It does n't matter whether there 's malice involved are not .
Is the investment industry working for you , or fleecing you ?
Even if they would like to see you do well are their interests aligned with yours ?
Sadly for the most part the investing industry is a no-lose proposition for its members in the short term .
For example , your broker gets paid commissions on what you buy and sell .
He does n't get paid commission on what you earn .
Obviously he wants you to do well so you have more money to invest and he gets to keep your business , but ultimately the amount he earns has more to do with how many trades you make , not how successful they are .
You see a similar structure in corporate management .
Most executives are paid by short term performance .
Thus they 're much better off having 3 good years followed by a collapse than just having 3 mediocre years , especially when their competition is having meteoric years at the same time .
It 's very difficult to be the CEO , or fund manager , or any other financial person who 's having modest returns while everyone else is skyrocketing .
Ultimately the answer to the question is that the investment industry is trustworthy if you make them so .
If you take the time to monitor your investments and make sure that what they 're doing makes sense for you , then they can be a useful tool .
But blindly assuming that they will act in your best interests is a path to ruin .
A new breed of inexpensive , photo- quality products are revolutionizing the photo industry , and Linux is there with the tools to put these products to use .
In 1990 , while editing my first digital image on a Mac SE , I had visions of one day having all the power of a high - end photo retouching workstation in my own digital studio .
Several years later , I had the Mac studio I had dreamed of but still was dependent on an outside service bureau for scanning and printing .
Around 1996 , I saw an early version of The GIMP and was excited at the possibility of moving my digital studio to Linux .
Fast - forward to the present : inexpensive photo scanners and printers are available that offer professional results at affordable prices , and the Linux drivers and tools are there to take advantage .
A color management work flow is starting to take shape on Linux , and The GIMP is maturing at a steady pace .
I now can go from scanned transparency through digital retouching to final output , all in my own studio running Linux .
This article explains the steps required for creating professional digital prints with Linux by following one of my images through the process .
Rather than go into details about compiling and installing Linux packages , I try to give a bird 's - eye view of how the different pieces fit together and provide links to more detailed information .
Hardware Requirements
Not much separates the workstation I use for photo editing from a good Linux desktop .
Certainly , the more memory you have the better ; I recommend 512MB as a minimum , and a fast disk is a real time - saver as well .
My photo workstation is a dual - head , 1.7GHz P4 machine with 1GB of RAM and three 36GB , 10 K RPM SCSI hard drives .
What truly separates a photo editing setup from a generic desktop are the peripherals .
Excellent photo-quality scanners and printers are now available for under $ 1,000 US .
Most of these are supported under Linux , but always check the Linux compatibility pages before you buy one of these specialized devices .
When looking for a scanner , cross -check advice from dedicated on - line photo forums , such as Photo.net , with the Linux compatibility information found on the VueScan and SANE Web sites .
Because I shoot large format , 4 " × 5 " film , my choice in desktop scanners is limited to flatbed scanners with transparency adapters .
For 35 mm film scanning , the dedicated film scanners offer better results than flatbeds .
For photo printers , it 's hard to beat the current generation of Epson inkjets .
The LinuxPrinting .org site provides a great utility to find out whether a particular printer is supported under Linux , and it even suggests the best driver to use .

Color Communication Communication is all about having a standard vocabulary that two parties understand , and in the world of color communication the International Color Consortium ( ICC ) provides this lingua franca .
All color devices have their own color space , meaning they are able to reproduce only a certain range of colors .
This type of color is known as device - dependent color .
In order to convert between different color spaces , a device - independent color space is needed .
ICC uses a color description known as the CIE 1931 standard colorimetric observer to describe accurately the color space of any color device .
ICC profiles are files that contain the information needed to translate the color space of a particular device to this device - independent color space .
A special type of color space , called the working color space , is a device - independent color space used when editing an image .
By having one common language and a translator from each different language , complete communication is possible .
Although it 's helpful to know all about color theory , it is not required to make good color prints .
All you do need to know is that ICC profiles are used to convert the colors from one device to the colors of another device accurately .
Figure 2 . CIE diagram showing visual color space .
The triangle shows the color space of the AdobeRGB 1998 working space .
Monitor Calibration
An accurate monitor is vital for working with color photos .
Professionals use a device called a colorimeter to measure the actual computer display and create an ICC profile that then is used by the OS to reproduce colors faithfully .
Unfortunately , I am aware of no Linux drivers that support any of these devices .
Even if you could get a monitor profile , The GIMP does not support using one for monitor display .
Certainly , this is one feature in The GIMP I sorely miss .
In fact , The GIMP bug # 78265 documents the problem ; hopefully , we will have this feature soon .
In the meantime , we will do the best we can by carefully adjusting the monitor manually , using the controls built in to most quality monitors :
Set the monitor white point to 6,500K .
This provides more yellow than the 9,300 K that most monitors ship with , but it is much easier for your eyes to see correct color , which is why it 's the industry standard recommendation .
Increase the monitor contrast to 100 % and adjust the brightness until you can see most of the B Black Level strip in Norman Koren 's excellent calibration chart , shown in Figure 3 .
Adjust the display gamma using the gamma strip of Figure 3 .
To read the chart , squint your eyes until you can't discern the horizontal lines and find the location where the gray tone is the same across the strip ; this is your current gamma .
Adjust the display gamma using xgamma until the gamma is 2.2 , the industry default .
Now adjust the separate R , G and B controls to make the gray of the target as neutral as possible .
Use an image such as the color calibration chart , shown in Figure 3 , to help adjust the monitor color balance .
By focusing on the skin tones as well as neutral gray tones , you should be able to eliminate any gross color imbalances .
Figure 3 . Monitor calibration images : on the left , Norman Koren 's monitor gamma chart , and on the right , the Photodisc color calibration image .
These printed examples should not be used for reference as their colors may have changed due to printing press inconsistencies .
In addition to a well - adjusted monitor , a consistent lighting environment is critical for accurate color viewing .
Dim light is best , and by lighting your room with 5,000 K daylight - balanced compact fluorescents , the white of a piece of paper should look very close to the white on your display .
ISO 12646 goes into great depth on providing further guidelines on ambient viewing conditions .
Bright colors in your environment alter your color perception , so watch out for brightly colored nearby walls , as well as bright backgrounds and colored windows in your Linux environment .
My Linux desktop uses a plain gray background and black and white window decorations .
Scanner Calibration
Now that we have a reasonably correct monitor and viewing environment , we can turn our focus to scanning .
Both SANE and VueScan are excellent Linux solutions for scanning , I have chosen to use VueScan primarily because it's the same software I use on the Mac .
Whichever scanning software you choose , it 's important always to use the same software settings .
This is vital for correct color , as the ICC profile we are about to create is valid only for the color settings used when making it .
In order to make a scanner profile , it 's necessary to have a known quantity to scan , called a color calibration target .
The target I use is the Q - 60 Color Input Target made by Kodak , and it is available from many high - end photo stores .
Scan the target using your preferred scanning software ; remember to save your settings , and always use the same settings moving forward .
Creating an ICC from this scan is made possible by the LProf profiling tools , available from the Little CMS Web site ( see on - line Resources ) .
Run kmeasurementool and open the scan .
Go to the Options tab and select the correct pick template for the target used , in this case the Kodak column picker .
Go back to the image tab and resize the green target outline .
Once the little squares are lined up with the color patches in the scan , select Pick and then Save IT8 sheet .
Now use kscannerprofiler to create a custom ICC profile for your scanner by first selecting the correct target vendor and batch ID .
Each target comes with a date identifying the batch .
Open the IT8 sheet file created above and enter an output profile filename for your ICC profile , then press GO .
This ICC profile now can be used to interpret the color space of the scanner .
Figure 4 . Creating the Scanner Profile Using Scanned Kodak Target
Now that we have profiled our scanner , we can scan an actual transparency .
When scanning , it 's helpful to know the true optical resolution of the scanner .
Scanning at the maximum optical resolution captures as much detail as possible without making your file too large .
When saving the file , use the TIFF format for best results as it is a lossless format .
Figure 5 . Making the Initial Scan Using VueScan
After scanning the transparency , the resulting TIFF file 's color space is that of the scanner .
I want to convert this color space to a working color space to do my image editing .
A popular working color space is the Adobe 1998 , a profile of which can be obtained from the Adobe Web site .
Apply the scanner profile using tifficc , which is part of the Little CMS package , by running tifficc - i scanner.icc -o Adobe1998.icc scan.tiff scan_working.tiff , which converts the scanned TIFF image to our working color space .
Photographic Tools in The GIMP A lot of the tools in The GIMP , as well as other image editing programs , are n't needed for photographic work .
Most of my time is spent using the Levels or Curves tools .
The first adjustment I make is to the overall exposure , and the best tool for this is Levels .
Never use the Brightness / Contrast tool , as it tends to clip values .
Open the Levels tool and slide the black and white points right up to the point where data ( height ) is apparent .
Adjust the middle slider to lighten or darken the overall image .
Figure 6 . Using Levels in The GIMP for Exposure Adjustment Cleaning up dust and scratches is the vital next step , and the Clone tool is perfect for this .
Zoom in until the size of a dust spot is easily seen on the screen and then carefully scan the entire image .
When you find a spot , select the Clone tool using a soft - edged brush that is slightly larger than the dust spot .
Set the Clone Tool Options to 100 % opacity and select aligned .
Ctrl - click on an adjacent area to pick up an area to copy , release the Ctrl key and click directly on top of the spot .
By using an opaque brush , the spot should be removed completely .
The technique for removing scratches is similar , but you have to watch out for repeating patterns .
With a little practice , you should be able to clone large sections without any telltale artifacts .

The Artist 's Proof
We now are ready to make a print .
For me , the print is the final piece of art , and I spend a lot of time trying to create a print that really speaks to the viewer .
I often will print out a picture 10 – 20 times , subtly making adjustments until I am happy with the image .
I call this inkjet print my artist proof .
To prepare the image for printing , a few adjustments must be made that are specific to the print size .
These adjustments are destructive , so save a copy of your image to a master file before getting started .
First , resize the image by opening up the Scale Image dialog under The GIMP 's Image menu .
For inkjets I recommend 200PPI at your desired print size .
Next , sharpen the image using the Unsharp Mask tool .
Think of this as enhancing the edges in a photo .
In case you 're wondering why it 's called unsharp , the name comes from the traditional photographic method of using a blurred ( or unsharp ) copy negative to increase the edge definition , and thus the perceived sharpness , of an image .
Select Filter →Enhance →Unsharp Mask , and a dialog box appears with three sliders .
Radius is how far away from the edge pixels are affected , Amount controls how much the pixels are changed and Threshold determines which edges are affected .
To decide how much sharpening to apply , view the image at 100 % and try a few settings .
Unfortunately , Unsharp Mask does not yet have a preview , so you have to apply a setting , undo and repeat until you get the look you want .
I am looking for the setting where the sharpening is barely obvious on my screen , generally starting with a radius of 1.0 , a threshold of 3 and an amount of .75 .
I use CUPS with Gimp - Print when printing to the Epson inkjets .
Check the Gimp - Print Web page for instructions on getting this set up and running .
By using Gimp - Print , all of the Epson - specific options are available in the Print menu .
It also includes the Epson printer utility escputil , which allows for head cleaning and print alignment .
Ideally , at this point we would be able to create an ICC profile for our printer ; however , no software for Linux exists yet that does this .
Instead , I recommend creating a standard set of adjustments using Gimp - Print 's color adjust feature .
To arrive at these adjustments , use a color test image such as the one we used for monitor calibration .
Print the image , and look carefully at the results .
You should be able to see details in the shadows and separation in the grayscale step tablet ; the neutral and skin tones should not have a color bias .
If this is n't the case , open the Print dialog box , select Image / Output Settings →Adjust Output and make the necessary changes .
Repeat until your printout looks correct .
Once you find a standard set of adjustments , write them down so you can use them as a starting point for future prints .

A revolution is taking place in industrial relations , the Confederation of British Industry claims , courtesy of the worst economic crisis since the 1930s .
A new " solidarity of employers and their employees " has taken hold , John Cridland , the CBI 's deputy director - general enthused this week , as managements and staff roll up their sleeves to take the " difficult decisions " needed to survive the slump .
If so , news of the new understanding clearly has n't reached Lincolnshire , where hundreds of engineering ­construction workers at the Lindsey oil refinery burned dismissal notices on Monday after they were sacked for going on strike – and thousands walked out in sympathy across the energy industry for the third time in five months .
The latest dispute began nearly a fortnight ago , when a subcontractor for Total , which owns the refinery , made 51 workers redundant while another contractor was hiring 61 staff on the same project .
After hundreds stopped work in protest and unofficial strikes spread by text and flying pickets across Britain , 647 workers were summarily sacked on Thursday night .
By any reckoning , this was surely a provocative and self - defeating move .
Not only had the same workforce already demonstrated its capacity to shut down the site – and significant sections of the wider industry – if it believed agreements were being undercut .
But the layoffs were in direct violation of a deal to settle an earlier dispute .
Perhaps the idea was finally to bring to heel what one manager described as an " unruly workforce " .
But after point - blank refusals to negotiate until the workers had applied for their jobs back , the contractors blinked once again and were back in talks on Tuesday , now due to be resumed .
This was , after all , the same group of workers whose unofficial strikes stopped refineries and power stations all over the country in February after a Sicilian contractor shipped in a non-union , and apparently less skilled , Italian and Portuguese workforce .
That first Lindsey walkout was portrayed as anti-foreigner because of " British jobs for British workers " placards held by some strikers , as to a lesser extent was another strike in May over a refusal to take on locally based labour at ExxonMobil 's South Hook terminal in Wales .
In fact , both walkouts were clearly aimed at halting the exploitation of EU directives and European court ­judgments to undermine the terms and conditions of all workers in the industry , British and migrant alike – which is why hundreds of Polish workers joined the stoppages .
And , crucially , they were successful .
In a profitable and highly contractualised industry , a tightly knit workforce has turned a fragmentation designed to benefit employers to their own advantage .
Now , as the unions prepare to ballot 30,000 workers to turn the wildcat walkouts into an official strike , they look set to prevail again – just as Grangemouth oil refinery workers and Shell tanker drivers did last year in battles over pension rights and pay .
Success seems to be catching .
The most recent walkouts have naturally focused on jobs , as insecurity grips the labour market .
But they also show that , as one leading trade unionist puts it , " it is n't inevitable that employers have the whip hand , even during a recession , and collective action can deliver results " – while passivity guarantees that jobs , pay and conditions are culled , squeezed and slashed .
Second , they underline the irrelevance of anti-union legislation when workers are determined and well - organised .
Every single one of the walkouts at Lindsey and at dozens of other power stations and refineries has been illegal under what Tony Blair boasted were " the most restrictive union laws in the western world " .
But so far no employer has even hinted at a visit to the courts , so counter - productive would that be in the real industrial world .
It 's now become obvious that only by defying or ignoring the anti-democratic legislation bequeathed by Margaret Thatcher – which outlaws , for example , all solidarity action – will there ever be the political will to ditch or replace it with something more reasonable .
Of course , there are few workforces with the industrial muscle and organisation of energy or rail .
Despite the crisis , some firms and sectors are still highly profitable , while others are on their hands and knees , genuinely struggling for survival .
That gap is being exploited by managers reaching for once impossible wish lists on pay , pensions and productivity – and often getting away with it , even as bonus schemes remain stubbornly in place , regardless of public revulsion at bankers ' and executive pay .
In the case of BA chief executive Willie Walsh – who volunteered to give up a month of his £ 743,000 salary and asked his staff , some of whom earn closer to £ 11,000 , to match him for the sake of the loss - making carrier – such opportunism has tipped over into the grotesque .
In any case , it 's not that there is " less ideological resistance these days " when firms demand staff " make sacrifices " , as John Philpott of the Chartered Institute for Personnel and Development claims , or a newfound partnership between employers and employees , as the CBI insists .
It 's the much more straightforward fear of losing their jobs that keeps large parts of the labour force compliant .
But even workforces with far less leverage than those in energy or engineering construction have got results in recent months by taking action against lockouts and closures .
Occupations of Ford parts Visteon factories at Enfield , Basildon and Belfast , of Waterford Crystal in Ireland and Prisme Packaging in Dundee all saved jobs or won better pay - offs .
Earlier this month , a threatened strike at the Linamar car parts plant in Swansea won the reinstatement of a sacked convenor .
As jobs are lost even faster than in the 1980s , others seem bound to conclude there 's no point waiting for politicians to intervene – and take things into their own hands as well .
Meanwhile , the next major industrial relations flashpoint is likely to come in the public sector .
That would be true whoever wins the general election .
But if David Cameron takes over , the combination of a Tory cuts programme , pressure for new Thatcher - style restrictions on unions and a battle over public sector pensions makes confrontation almost unavoidable .
What looks certain is that once the economy starts growing again , the CBI 's revolution will already be a thing of the past .
It 's remarkably difficult to fire a tenured public school teacher in California , a Times investigation has found .
The path can be laborious and labyrinthine , in some cases involving years of investigation , union grievances , administrative appeals , court challenges and hearings .
Not only is the process arduous , but some districts are particularly unsuccessful in navigating its complexities .
The Los Angeles Unified School District sees the majority of its firings overturned , and its administrators are far less likely even to try firing a tenured teacher than those in other districts .
The Times reviewed every case on record in the last 15 years in which a tenured employee was fired by a California school district and formally contested the decision before a review commission : 159 in all ( not including about two dozen in which the records were destroyed ) .
The newspaper also examined court and school district records and interviewed scores of people , including principals , teachers , union officials , district administrators , parents and students .

Auditory - motor entrainment , the ability to align motor actions with an external auditory beat , has been commonly assumed to be a uniquely human capacity [ ] .
However , it has recently been proposed that auditory - motor entrainment ( henceforth “ entrainment ” ) emerged as a by - product of selection for vocal mimicry , leading to the prediction that only vocal mimicking animals will be able to entrain [ ] .
By this hypothesis , vocal mimicry would be a necessary , although likely not sufficient , condition for entrainment .
Rhythm in music :
What is it ?
Who has it ?
And why ?.
Vocal mimics form a relatively small group , including humans , three avian clades ( songbirds , parrots , and hummingbirds [ ] ) , two marine mammal clades ( cetaceans [ ] and pinnipeds [ ] ) , elephants [ ] , and some bats [ ] ( see the Supplemental Data available online ) .
If vocal mimicry were a necessary precondition for entrainment , we would expect to find the capacity for entrainment only in vocal mimicking species .
This view predicts that other factors ( e.g. , phylogenetic proximity to humans , exposure to music , movement imitation , and / or complex social structure ) cannot enable entrainment in the absence of vocal mimicry .
Here we report evidence of entrainment from detailed case studies of two avian subjects , both proficient vocal mimics ( parrots ) .
In addition , we test the claim that vocal mimicry is necessary for entrainment by performing a broader comparative exploration of entrainment in hundreds of species .
Though the results thus far are consistent with the vocal mimicry hypothesis , they are limited by the small sample of subjects , species , and materials .
To fully test the vocal mimicry hypothesis , we must ask whether entrainment is truly never present in species lacking the capacity for vocal mimicry .
It is therefore necessary to test an extremely broad set of comparative data representing many species , many individuals of each species , and multiple sessions with the same individual .
We performed a systematic analysis of a global video database , which provided the scope of data needed to find evidence of entrainment across a wide range of species and subjects .
To provide further support for this hypothesis , we also tested a group of vocal nonmimics , cotton - top tamarin monkeys , for entrainment with the same set of stimuli , procedures , and analyses that successfully demonstrated entrainment in our avian subjects ( see Supplemental Experimental Procedures and Supplemental Results ) .
Of the nine tamarins tested ( 270 min of video ) , none showed evidence of entrainment .
Claims of human uniqueness are defeated by even one well - documented case study demonstrating the existence of the capacity in a nonhuman animal ; here we report entrainment in two nonhuman subjects .
These data rule out the claim that entrainment is unique to humans and provide initial support for the hypothesis that vocal mimicry is necessary for entrainment .
In summary , these case studies show strong evidence of entrainment in nonhuman animals based on multiple convergent analyses .
In addition , a simultaneously collected data set provided convergent evidence of entrainment :
In a separate experiment with subject 2 by Patel and colleagues in this issue of Current Biology , the tempo of a song that reliably evoked movement was changed by small increments ( 5 % , 10 % , etc. ) , and analyses revealed spontaneous adjustments of movement tempo to match tempo manipulations of the music ( [ ] ) .
In addition to head bob movements , subject 2 also displayed foot - lifting movement in response to the music .
Subject 2's foot movement also showed evidence of entrainment : it maintained a significantly consistent phase with the musical beat during four of four trials ( p < 0.05 ) .
In three of four trials , foot movements were phase matched with the beat ( p < 0.05 ) , significantly periodic ( p < 0.01 ) , and matched in modal frequency with the musical beat ( see Table 1 ) .
This response suggests considerable motor flexibility in entrainment , similar to the highly flexible motor response of humans during entrainment [ ] .
Overall , by matching phase , flexibly entraining to multiple tempi , and involving multiple body parts in entrainment , subject 2 demonstrates a phenomenology strikingly similar to human subjects .
Subject 2's movements were also synchronized , or phase matched , with the musical beat in each of the three consistent - phase sessions ( p < 0.05 ) .
Subject 2's head movements maintained a significantly consistent phase relationship with the musical beat in three of four presentations of rhythmic stimuli ( p < 0.05 ) .
The likelihood of maintaining as consistent a phase relationship by chance was less than 1 in 10 18 .
Subject 2 displayed significantly periodic movement in the same three of four trials ( p < 0.01 for all three trials ) .
Importantly , these three rhythmic stimuli spanned a wide range of tempi , from 108 to 132 bpm .
Thus , subject 2 demonstrated the ability to flexibly entrain movements with musical beats of a variety of speeds .
Subject 1 did not show periodic movement in response to the 150 bpm stimuli .
This frequency may have exceeded the range of tempi to which entrainment is possible for this subject .
Unfortunately , it was not possible to further explore this subject 's behavior because of his unexpected death [ ] .
Subject 1's movements were also phase matched with humans ' taps to the musical beat in one of the four consistent - phase trials ( p < 0.05 via the Rayleigh test with a specified mean direction of zero ) , showing an additional parallel between subject 1's behavior and human entrainment .
Phase analyses : the Rayleigh test with unspecified mean directionwas used to determine whether the animals ' movements maintained a consistent phase relationship to the musical beat as perceived by any of the human subjects or computed by an automated beat tracker .
The Rayleigh test with a specified mean direction of zerowas used to determine whether the animal 's movements were synchronized , or phase matched , with the musical beat .
Ratio values indicate the number of human subjects whose data significantly matched the animals ' data ( p < 0.05 ) over the total number of human subjects at the correct metrical level .
Only human subjects who tapped at the same metrical level as the animal were included for analysis , so as to maintain the validity of the analyses ( e.g. , if a subject tapped at a lower ( faster ) metrical level , this would greatly increase the likelihood of finding synchrony / consistency even if it were not present ; see Supplemental Data ) .
Matched modal frequency : Z score refers to location of modal frequency within distribution of human subjects ' modal frequencies tapping to the same stimuli ; <2 SD was considered matched modal frequency .
Consistent frequency : p value refers to likelihood under Monte Carlo simulation ( see Results and Supplemental Experimental Procedures ) ; significance implies movement at a consistent frequency throughout the trial ( NS = not significant ) .
Tempo refers to the mean of subjects ' modal tapping frequencies in beats per minute ( bpm ) . “ a ” indicates that autotracked beat was phase consistent or phase matched with the subject 's movement .
For four of the six presentations of the 120 bpm stimuli , subject 1's head bob movements maintained a significantly consistent phase relationship with the musical beat ( p < 0.05 via the Rayleigh test with unspecified mean direction ; see Table 1 ) .
The probability of observing these data due to chance was less than 1 in 10 .
Subject 1 also showed significantly periodic ( consistent - frequency ) movement in all six trials ( p < 0.05 for all six trials ; p < 0.01 for five of six trials ) .
Subject 1 thus showed strong evidence of entrainment .
To provide convergent evidence for entrainment , we ran two additional tests to determine ( 1 ) whether the periodicity of movement was likely to have been due to chance and ( 2 ) whether the modal frequency of movement matched the modal frequency of the musical beats as perceived by human subjects .
We performed a Fourier transform on the avian subjects ' speed - of - movement function to identify the extent to which the subject was moving at each frequency .
If the subject was moving periodically ( i.e. , with consistent frequency ) , we saw a peak at the frequency range most present in the movement .
We used a Monte Carlo simulation to determine whether the periodicity was extensive enough to have been unlikely by chance ( p < 0.05 ) ( Figure 1 ) .
We then determined whether the animal 's frequency matched the musical beat by asking whether the modal frequency of the animal 's movement ( the peak of the Fourier transform ) fell within the range of modal frequencies of human subjects ' tapping to the same set of auditory stimuli .
Multiple analyses comparing avian movement to the musical beat allowed for convergent evidence of entrainment .
First , we asked whether subjects ' movements maintained a more consistent phase relationship with the musical beat than expected by chance , using the Rayleigh test with unspecified mean direction [ ] .
Because the motor and cognitive systems introduce noise to periodic movement , maintaining a consistent phase with the external stimulus is extremely unlikely without real - time error correction to actively realign with the beat ( i.e. , entrainment ) [ ] .
Thus , consistency of phase over many beats is strong evidence of entrainment .
Second , we asked whether the birds ' movements were phase matched ( synchronized ) with the musical beats .
Although this is not a necessary condition for entrainment , human subjects typically phase match when tapping to the beat [ ] ; thus , avian phase matching would demonstrate an additional way in which the phenomenology of avian entrainment resembles that of human entrainment .
To detect phase matching , we used a modified version of the Rayleigh test [ ] , this time specifying a mean direction of zero ( identical phase ) .
During presentation of the stimuli , both subjects spontaneously displayed periodic ( regularly spaced ) movement in the form of head bobbing ; subject 2 also displayed periodic foot lifting ( see Movies S1 and S2 ) .
We assessed whether the subjects ' periodic movements were entrained to the musical beats by analyzing the frequency and phase of the subjects ' movements .
We collected data on intentional human entrainment to the same stimuli by asking human subjects to tap a button to the beat of the same musical stimuli used with avian subjects .
These human data served both as a measure of the location of the musical beats as well as a measure of the range of error acceptably present in entrained movement .
We then examined the extent to which the avian movements aligned with the intentionally entrained tapping of the human subjects ( see Figure 1 and Supplemental Experimental Procedures ) .
(C) We asked whether the movements were in consistent phase with the musical beat as perceived by a human subject or an automated beat tracker ( see Supplemental Experimental Procedures ) , using the Rayleigh test with unspecified mean direction .
We then additionally asked whether the movements were phase matched with the musical beat , using the Rayleigh test with a specified mean direction of zero( see Results ) .
Shown : subject 2 , trial 1 , head movement .
( A and B ) We videotaped nonhuman subjects while they moved in response to music and then coded the location of each subject 's head in each frame .
To compute the magnitude of motion at each frequency , we took the derivative to obtain the speed of movement ( A ) and performed a Fourier transform to convert this signal to frequency space ( black waveform in [ B ] ) .
To test whether subjects were moving at a consistent frequency , we used a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the magnitude ( at any frequency ) that would be obtained less than 5 % of the time by random head bobbing ( p < 0.05 ; dashed line in [ B ] ) , which served as the threshold for significance .
We then asked whether the animals were moving at the correct frequency by comparing the peak ( modal ) frequency from the animal data to the range of modal frequencies of human tapping for the same set of stimuli , to see whether the peak frequency in the animals ' movement fell within 2 SD of the mean of the distribution of human subjects ' modal tap frequencies ( maximum - likelihood Gaussian ; light gray waveform in [ B ] ) .
Subject 1 , a well - studied African grey parrot [ ]
( Psittacus erithacus ) , was video - recorded while exposed to novel naturalistic rhythmic musical stimuli at two tempi ( 120 and 150 beats per minute [ bpm ] ) in the absence of visual rhythmic movement .
Subject 2 , a sulphur - crested cockatoo [ ]
( Cacatua galerita eleanora ) , was recorded while exposed to novel natural rhythmic music and one familiar piece of music with tempi ranging from 108 to 132 bpm ( see Supplemental Experimental Procedures ) in the absence of continuous human movement .
Neither subject had been explicitly trained to produce movement in response to acoustic material .
Video Database Analyses
The global database used , www.youtube.com , is a video - sharing website consisting of tens of millions of user contributions from a wide range of people across the globe .
Users commonly post animal behavior on YouTube , and animals that dance are popular ( e.g. , one video of subject 2 has over 3 million views ) .
Given the widespread ability and motivation of millions of users to post popular videos , we expect that if animals to which humans are regularly exposed are capable of entrainment , even as a result of training , there is a high likelihood that videos of such activity would be present on YouTube .
There are of course many selection biases associated with the kinds of videos that people post on YouTube ( e.g. , users posting only the best videos ) .
However , we have no reason to assume that any of these biases would be systematic with respect to our question of interest — the relationship between vocal mimicry and entrainment .
In addition , vocal nonmimicking species are much more highly represented on YouTube than vocal mimics ( by a ratio of approximately 2:1 ) , increasing our chance of detecting entrainment in vocal nonmimics .
We systematically queried the database for a variety of animal terms plus “ dancing , ” covering a wide range of species commonly in contact with humans ( e.g. , “ cat , ” “ dog , ” “ bird ” ) .
For each search , we recorded the first 50 results ( as sorted by relevance ) and categorized them by a variety of dimensions ( presence of an animal , periodic movement , rhythmic sound , potentially entrained ) .
These categorizations were verified through reliability testing ( 10 % recoded blind ; coders agreed on 96.9 % of trials ; see Supplemental Experimental Procedures ) .
We analyzed the musical beat and animals ' periodic movement via the same methods as in the case studies above for any video that had been categorized as potentially entrained .
We then iteratively performed more specific follow - up searches for groups showing evidence of entrainment and also performed theoretically driven searches for nonhuman primate species , additional vocal mimicking species , and groups of species that are closely related but differ in their vocal mimicry status ( e.g. , oscine and suboscine birds ) .
These searches were designed to tease apart potential contributing factors for entrainment , such as vocal mimicry , phylogenetic proximity to humans , and extent of experience with humans .
We performed 161 searches , resulting in 3879 unique videos .
Of these videos , 1019 featured a nonhuman animal .
Importantly , the proportion of videos of vocal nonmimics ( 53 % ) was comparable to that of vocal mimics ( 47 % ) .
In addition , a large proportion of videos featured both vocal nonmimicking animals and rhythmic sound ( 44 % of the 406 with rhythmic sound ) .

( See Supplemental Experimental Procedures for definition of vocal mimicry . )
Only vocal mimicking species showed evidence of entrainment , even when casting the widest possible net by including any individual that passed even one of our two main measures ( maintaining consistent phase , matching frequency ) .
Of the vocal mimicking species , a total of 15 species across 33 individual videos showed evidence suggestive of entrainment , including 14 species of parrot and one elephant species ( see Table 2 Figure 2 , and Table S2 ) .
At least one individual of each of the 15 species maintained a significantly consistent phase relationship with the musical beat ( p < 0.05 ) .
Individuals of 9 of the 15 species were both consistent and phase matched with the musical beat ( p < 0.05 ) .
The modal frequency of movement of 10 of the 15 consistent - phase species matched the frequency of the musical beat , providing convergent evidence for entrainment in the same individuals ; we found consistency of frequency that was highly unlikely to have occurred by chance in 9 of the 15 species ( p < 0.05 ) .
Vocal nonmimics showed no evidence of entrainment by any of our measures , despite significant effort by many individuals to train dance - like behavior ( e.g. , “ canine freestyle , ” in which people spend years training dogs to compete in dance competitions ) .
In addition , the absence of entrainment in vocal nonmimicking animals is unlikely to result from differences in exposure to music or familiarity with humans , because numerous species of both vocal mimics and nonmimics ( e.g. , parrots , dogs , and cats ) are reared by humans and exposed to human music .
Approximately 50 % of the videos we analyzed involved vocal nonmimics , but all 33 videos demonstrating evidence suggestive of entrainment were of vocal mimics ( χ2 = 30.25 , p < .00001 ) .
This suggests that the capacity for vocal mimicry is a necessary precondition for entrainment .
How can we spot future terrorists ?

Editorial : Seeking out the engineers of terror
WHO becomes a terrorist ?
An MI5 report leaked to London newspaper The Guardian in August 2008 concluded that there is no easy way to identify those who become involved in terrorism in the UK because there is “ no single pathway to violent extremism ” and that “ it is not possible to draw up a typical profile of the ‘ British terrorist ’ as most are ‘ demographically unremarkable ' ” .
The extraordinary lengths the German authorities went to …
Pretty bad , Tal M thought to himself on his first day on the new job .
Pretty , pretty , pretty bad .
In all reality , the code and development practices at Tal ’s company were n’t that bad .
At least , not when compared with some of the monstrosities we ’ve all see published here .
Sure , they had the base class to end all base classes ( basically an IObject ) , plenty of does - it - all - and - then - some classes ( a good old ISwissArmyKnife ) , and a seemingly endless supply of wrappers and wrapper wrappers , but there was nothing that went completely over the top .
Disappointed that he’d be working at yet another company with a dysfunctional codebase , Tal decided to take a stroll and explore the five floors that the programming department utilized .
The first stop on his self - guided tour was a place called the “ Developer Resource Center ” .
Situated between conference rooms 402 and 408 , it was mostly an alcove of bookshelves filled tomes such as DOS 4.0 Fundamentals and Mosaic for Dummies .
But there was one shelf that caught his eye .
Technically , it was n’t so much the shelf that drew his attention , but the passive - aggressive sign written in red , 58 - point Chiller .
Do Not Take Any of THESE BOOKS , Tal read the words in his head .
Code Complete 2 … Pragmatic Programmer … what the —
His internal monologue was cut off by another stream of thought .
Is this why the code is so terrible ?
Is someone trying to hoard all of the best practices knowledge ?
Or is this some harebrained scheme to monopolize all local copies of good programming books ?
Do n’t Touch , Explained
After some investigation , Tal learned why the Developer Resource Center was stocked with so many look - but - do n ’t - touch volumes .
Some time ago , a developer who had long since left the company organized the “ Developers ’ Book Club . ”
Though the exact details were lost to time , the idea was that like - minded developers would get together at lunch and discuss things like Code Complete 2 : Chapter 16 : Controlling Loops .
It was supposed to be a great way to learn and reinforce good coding practices .
Unfortunately , the book club never made it past buying that initial stock of books .
It was hard to say why , but Tal speculated that the initial organizer got so frustrated with the lack of interest that he gave up and never looked back .
Or maybe he got hit by a bus .
But either way , the books had been carefully guarded by the ominous chiller sign , effectively preventing anyone from accessing the invaluable knowledge contained within .
Developers ’ Book Club 2.0
Not only did Tal hate to see such great books go to waste , but he knew that his fellow developers could really learn a thing or two from the material .
At his previous job , he had seen great things happen with similar “ light training ” programs , and he knew the perfect way to get things going again .
Through the Lunch & Learn .
Organizing a Lunch & Learn group at the new job seemed like an all - around great idea .
It offered a fairly high ROR ( Return - On - Résumé ) and would show management that he was very serious about improving not only his skills , but those of his colleagues .
After finagling a bit to get the lunch portion paid for , Tal sent an email invitation to the 600 on - site developers for the very first Lunch & Learn and patiently waited two weeks for the event .
No one shows up to the first anything , Tal reassured himself before convening the discussion .
Nine attendees are n’t too bad , and these things take time to grow .
As Tal went into his spiel about Lunch & Learns and learning in general , he noticed that the attendees were helping themselves to one , then two , and then three , and even four slices of pizza .
Not that it mattered , developers get hungry and there was plenty of pizza to go around .
However , as the 15 - minute mark neared and they were finishing their meal , two of the attendees got up and excused themselves .
Apparently , they both had to be on an “ important 12:30 call ” and could n’t miss it .
Then another attendee excused himself .
And then another .
Before the hour discussion was over , all of four people – Tal included – remained .
2.0 SP1
Given the low attendance and early leavers , Tal figured that his presentation was below par .
For the second Lunch & Learn , he knew he ’d have to prepare a bit more and build in as much interactivity / discussion as possible .
Pretty good ,
Tal was pleasantly surprised that twenty - two developers stopped by for the second Lunch & Learn .
Pretty , pretty , pretty good .
But before he even started talking , he noticed that a small clique of developers was leaving with a plate - full of pizza in hand .
Apparently , they were just stepping out for a minute , but would be right back .
During his brief , thirty - second introduction , Tal saw another handful of other developers leave .
When it came time for discussion , no one had even read the cover , let alone a few pages or a chapter .
Fortunately , Tal came armed with Power Point slides and was able something that resembled a conversation going .
It was a good start but came to an end prematurely as everyone seemed to have a “ mandatory 12:30 ” they could n’t miss .
The Final Nail
Hoping to nip the freeloading problem in the bud , Tal ’s invitation for the third meeting implored attendees not to dine and ditch , and reminded everyone that the value came in discussion and attending for the full hour .
He figured that should shame just about everyone from freeloading .
And he was right : none of the known freeloaders were in attendance and there was only one suspected freeloader .
Period .
Just a single , suspected freeloader .
No one else attended the Lunch & Learn .
As for why Tal suspected she was freeloading , she was n’t actually a developer and instead worked as a systems administrator for the DB2 group .
That was the last Lunch & Learn that Tal organized .
Since then , he ’s come to learn how deep - seeded the noninterest in improvement had become .
Not that it matters , though .
These days ,
Tal finds himself grumbling at the bad — but not quite The Daily WTF bad — code .
Pretty bad ; pretty , pretty , pretty bad .
Joseph Ondieki , at the grave of his mother , who was burned as a witch
By Odhiambo Joseph
BBC News , Kenya
Villagers , many straight from their farms , and armed with machetes , sticks and axes , are shouting and crowding round in a big group in Kenya 's fertile Kisii district .
I can't see clearly what is going on , but heavy smoke is rising from the ground and a horrible stench fills the air .
More people are streaming up the hill , some of them with firewood and maize stalks .
Suddenly an old woman breaks from the crowd , screaming for mercy .
Three or four people go after her , beat her and drag her back , pushing her onto - what I can now see - is a raging fire .
Burned alive I was witnessing a horrific practice which appears to be on the increase in Kenya - the lynching of people accused of being witches .
I personally saw the burning alive of five elderly men and women in Itii village .
They point at me saying - that is a son of the witch
Joseph Ondieki
Listen to African Perspective I had been visiting relatives in a nearby town , when I heard what was happening .
I dashed to the scene , accompanied by a village elder .
He reacted as if what we were watching was quite normal , which was shocking for me .
As a stranger I felt I had no choice but to stand by and watch .
My fear was that if I showed any sign of disapproval , or made any false move , the angry mob could turn on me .
Not one person was protesting or trying to stop the killing .
Hours later , the police came and removed the charred bodies .
Village youths who took part in the killings told me that the five victims had to die because they had bewitched a young boy .
" Of course some people have been burned .
But there is proof of witchcraft , " said one youth .
He said that a child had spent the night walking around and then was unable to talk the following morning - except to one of the so - called witches .
Mary Nyaboke came home to find her mother - in - law burned alive I asked the youths whether or not people involved in this supposed witchcraft should be punished .
" Yes , they must be punished , every one , " said the first youth .
" We are very angry and that 's why we end up punishing these people and even killing them . "
His friend agreed : " In other communities , there are witches all round but in Kisii we have come up with a new method , we want to kill these people using our own hands . "
I later discovered that the young boy who had supposedly been bewitched , was suffering from epilepsy .
His mother had panicked when he had had an attack .
All too common
The village elder was dismissive of my horror , saying that this kind of thing happens all the time in the western district of Kisii .
He told me about Joseph Ondieki , whose mother had been burned to death less than two months earlier .
I found Joseph and his wife Mary Nyaboke tending vegetables in their small shamba , or homestead .
If I visit my neighbours I fear they might poison my food
Joseph Ondieki
Mary told me that on the day her mother - in - law had been killed she had been visiting her own parents .
She had heard a noise and discovered the truth when she came home .
She said that in the 20 years she had been married , she had never had any reason to believe her husband 's mother was a witch .
Joseph told me he has suffered a lot since his mother died .
" I was born here , but at this stage I feel as if this is not my home any more , " he said .
" I can not visit neighbours or relatives .
" Even when they see me standing by the road side , they point at me , saying : ' That is a son of the witch ' .
The couple fear they may be the next victims " And when I go to town they also start wondering what has taken me there .
Is it that I am going to give evidence against them ?
" When I come back , they say I 've been seen at the police station , but I 've never been there .
I 've never reported the matter .
" If I visit the neighbours , I always fear that they might put poison in the food .
" So when I 'm forced to visit , I make sure I do n't eat anything .
" If I ca n't get my own food I just have a glass of water and sleep . "
I set off with Joseph up the hill towards his house , which was far from the centre of the village .
On the way we passed his mother 's house .
A neighbour was reluctant to talk to me and denied even knowing Joseph 's mother .
" Here in Kisii , people are being burned on mere allegation and most of them are old , " Joseph said .
" We now do n't have any old people in the village to consult .
" Even me I 'm now approaching 50 years old - I 'm afraid that they 'll come for me also . "
Warning signs I spent three days in Kisii trying to speak to the authorities , but nobody , neither the police nor the local government officials would talk to me .
As night drew in , and it was time for me to leave , Joseph walked with me from his village to where my car was parked .
When we arrived , he begged me to take him with me to Mombasa , where I am based .
It was very difficult for me to leave him behind .
As I drove away I passed signs pinned to trees , warning witches that they would be tracked down .
" We know you by your names " , someone had typed in bold .

Steve had been passing by SecuriTek 's in - your - face full - sized billboard job ad every day for nearly a month .
They utilized the " geek appeal " of twisted logic puzzles and obtuse syntax to lure in candidates with perks in their " laid back yet professional " environment .
However , along with their promises of catered lunch wishes and every - day - is - casual - day dreams , the advertisements made one thing perfectly clear - only the best and brightest C/C++ developers on the planet should apply .
Thinking Hey !
I'm a Top - Tier kind of guy and What the heck ... I do n't have anything to lose Steve decoded an obfuscated HR email address ( ROT13 ? C'mon ... ) and sent off his resume .
To his delight , their HR called soon after to schedule an interview .
After a short " Hi . How are you ?
Nice weather ! " with the HR rep Steve was put straight into the next stage of his interview - a programming test .
It was an insidious test involving string processing , trees , and data structures that took over an hour to complete .
But within minutes of finishing the test , Steve learned that , out of hundreds who took it , he was one of the few out who managed to pass it .
Afterwards ,
Steve was offered and accepted the job .
Welcome Aboard !
Steve arrived to the " standard " fanfare of any new SecuriTek employee - an edible bouquet waiting for him at his desk , a top o' the line laptop , 24 " monitor , executive - style chair ... and orders to hang tight until they had some work to send his way .
So , like any corporate " newb " with his hands on the keys to the castle while awaiting his first real assignment , Steve hit the books , or rather the corporate Sharepoint portal .
After first learning the inner workings of the company 's flagship application ( developed in C++ ) he brushed up on improving his fundamentals , optimizing memory , and all the other " best practices " that earns A +++ developers points in the corporate world .
After a few days of working — or more accurately , waiting for work —
Steve felt pretty stoked to be able to handle any oddball enhancement or bug related to a dangling pointer that would come his way .
However , when the first assignment arrived , Steve found himself in a difficult place .
It was n't some esoteric C++ bug , but instead a test script to get him familiar with the company 's flagship virus detection app .
It was n't a " script " intended for execution by some interpreter , but instead one that was printed out and executed by a human .
Worse still , the document resembled a cryptic sphinx riddle than a bug description .
...
7. Perform all of the necessary pre-initialization steps as described by script 118T - B .
8. Open Microsoft Excel as prescribed in script 0G17 .
9 . After clicking on " Virus " , take a screen capture ( see script 0G22 ) .
10 .
From the printout , enter each item into Microsoft Excel .
...
18 . After clicking on " View Report " , click on " Print Report " .
19 .
From the printout , enter each " Virus " item into Microsoft Excel .
20 .
If the Excel spreadsheets do not contain identical data , the test has failed .
...
Steve began repeating out loud if only to confirm that the language centers of his brain had not been fried .
It turned out that the test script could be simplified as " Verify that items which appear after you click on ' Virus ' will be listed on the ' errors report ' . "
That could have taken two minutes , and thanks to the genius developer who had already fixed that particular bug , Steve spent more than two hours fruitlessly testing a working feature .
As the days of performing test scripts passed by , Steve could n't help but wonder why are there so many JavaScript and HTML bugs .
That and , what the hell does this have to do with C++?
As Steve become more acclimated with his coworkers , he began to wonder something else : why are so many " developers " doing test scripts all day ?
Should n't they be fixing bugs instead ?
The answer came in the form of the company 's in - house developed scripting language that Steve came to call " WTFSL "
Security Through ... Obscurity ?
Like many horribly tragic enterprisey solutions , WTFSL was the nepotistic brain child of the company owner 's cousin .
Besides not being the least bit extensible , WTFSL featured a limited set of functions .
Floating point math ?
Nope . Regular expressions ?
Sorry .
Advanced string handling ?
Sort of ...
Handling strings larger than 64K ?
Wishful thinking .
Garbage collection ?
Only if the developer remembered to deallocate local variables - in fact , this was the source of many crashes and out - of - memory bugs in the product .
Things were so bad that nearly all data validation was forced to be handled in the user 's web browser because of WTFSL 's impossibilities .
It was , however , originally written in C ++.
Steve considered making an argument in very best interests of " the greater good " ( namely the sanity of the company 's development staff ) , like implementing future version using a liberal - licensed scripting language like LUA or at least allow a hook into something a little more well known like PHP or even SNOBOL at this point , but it was a hopeless case .
Besides freely admitting that WTFSL as being the most secure language to develop in ( only 10 people , tops , on earth knew how to code in it ) , the owner 's cousin who first dreamt up this sasquatch of a language was on the board of directors .
" I 'm sorry , I ca n't just tell him to throw his work to the garbage " was the usual reply if someone suggested that they use something else .
" Do n't worry , " Steve 's coworker said in response to the why are we testing bugs all day question , " it 's always like this before the launch of a new version .
Once we 're out of beta , it 's right back to the code . "
Coding , as he found out , was n't going to be C++ , but instead WTFSL .
" Some day , " his coworker added , " you 'll work on the language core .
But you gotta give it some time .
I should be starting on that team next month ! "
His coworker also happened to be " one of the best C++ developers the company could find " , though he had started at SecuriTek nearly three years earlier .
As enticing as it was to maybe code in C++ some day , Steve chose not to stick around .
But his former coworker should be joining that team any month now !
They do n’t increase friction , so what do they do ?
( Image : Junior Gomes / Stock.xchng )
The long - held notion that fingerprints marks help us grip more firmly appears to be wrong .
Instead , a new study finds that the marks actually reduce the friction between skin and surfaces .
“ Because there are all the gaps between the fingerprints , what they do is reduce the contact area with the surface , ” says Roland Ennos , a biomechanicist at the University of Manchester , UK , who led the study with colleague Peter Warman .
Rather than singe the prints off an unlucky student to compare hands with and without prints , Ennos rigged Warman ’s fingers to a special device that slides a weighted sheet of Perspex across a finger and measures the resulting frictional force .

Ennos and Warman determined that the amount of friction generated went up as more of the fingerprint was touching the sheet , but not by as much as expected .
This indicated that the skin was behaving like rubber , where friction is proportional to the contact area between the two surfaces .
With most solids , friction depends on the force of contact between of the surfaces .
Further tests with varying widths of plastic sheet confirmed this behaviour .
Measurements taken from ink marks then revealed that fingerprints actually reduce the area in contact with a surface by about one third , compared with smooth skin .
Therefore fingerprints actually reduce friction , Ennis says .
Mystery remains
But if they ’re no good for grip why , then , do we have fingerprints ?
A French team of researchers working with a mechanical hand loaded with tactile sensors found that fingerprint - like ridges improved the hand ’s tactile sensitivity .
Another possibility is that fingerprints help wick water off of our hands , improving grip on wet surfaces , Ennos says .
Or alternatively , they might work in coordination with soft finger and foot pads to help skin fit more snugly to abrasive surfaces , reducing shear stress .
“ We very rarely get blisters on the soles of our feet or our fingertips , ” he says .
“ It ’s an interesting paper , ” says Lynette Jones , a mechanical engineer at Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge .
Ennos and Warman make a good case that fingerprints do n’t increase friction when our fingers apply the kinds of forces used to feel objects , but they did n’t test much stronger gripping forces , she says .
Understanding exactly how fingerprints work could help in the design of prosthetic and robotic hands that grasp and feel every bit as well as natural hands .

The XM25 Individual Air Burst Weapon is looking likely to be the shoulder - fired weapon of choice for the US military to kill or neutralize hidden targets .
Due for field test this summer , the lightweight XM - 25 " smart weapon " uses High Explosive Air-Burst ( HEAB ) munitions that can be programmed to detonate at a precise point in the air without the need to impact , spelling trouble for elusive targets , be they behind a wall , inside a building or in a foxhole .
The XM25
Developed jointly by the German arms manufacturer Heckler & Koch and the US company Alliant Techsystems ( ATK Corporation ) , the XM - 25 is a semi-automatic , shoulder - fired weapon with a five - round magazine and weighs in at around 14 pounds ( 6.3 kg ) – about the same weight as an M - 16 with a 203 grenade launcher .
The weapon 's XM116 integral fire system provides the weapon with its precision and is capable of controlling individually each of the 25 mm rounds in real time .
Based on a thermal optic , day - sight , laser range finder , compass and infrared light , the system can precisely measure the distance to the target and program each round to explode close to the mark via the wireless connection .
Capable of hitting a point target at 500 meters and area targets at 700 meters with a range of munitions including HEAB , anti-personnel , two types of non-lethal munitions – blunt and agent dispersing airburst - plus armor piercing , and door breaching munitions , this is one very nasty piece of ordinance and a must have on any soldiers list .
In a nutshell , it operates with the soldier sighting the target and the advanced laser rangefinder transmitting range information to the chambered 25 mm round .
The soldier then essentially points and fires .
After the round leaves the chamber and moves towards its target , the system precisely measures the distance traveled and detonates it at exactly the right moment to deliver maximum effectiveness .
ATK says that the XM25 increases the warfighter ’s probability of hit - to - kill performance by up to 500 percent over existing weapons and extends the effective range of the soldier ’s individual weapon to more than 500 meters .
The LW50MG
Another high - tech weapon recently field tested by the military is the Lightweight .50 Caliber Machine Gun ( LW50 MG ) .
Unlike the XM25 , which does n’t offer a weight advantage , the LW50MG weights in at 64 pounds ( 29kg ) complete with tripod , i.e. , half the weight of the M - 2 .50 caliber machine gun .
With 60 % less recoil than the M - 2 , the LW50MG will also offer greater accuracy and speed than the veteran M - 2 .

U.S. lost its moral bearings over torture , says Obama - and warns Bush officials could be charged
America lost its ‘ moral bearings ’ over its torture of terrorist suspects , President Obama said last night .
He also left the door open for possible prosecutions of Bush administration lawyers who approved tough interrogation methods such as waterboarding .
Mr Obama conceded that an inquiry might be necessary , despite earlier assurances that those responsible for ordering and carrying out the torture techniques would not be punished .
On the front foot : Barack Obama , standing alongside CIA chief Leon Panetta , also told agency staff that their expertise was vital in the fight against Al Qaeda
But he said it is important that a congressional probe does n’t deteriorate into petty party political bickering .
Mr Obama also defended his decision to release official memos which revealed senior Bush administration lawyers approved controversial questioning techniques that he outlawed as torture days after taking office .
He said the U.S. Department of Justice memos ‘ reflect , in my view , us losing our moral bearings ’ .
He stood by his claim that CIA agents should be absolved from prosecution because they were acting on government advice that what they were doing was legal .
However , he said it may be up to America ’s top lawyer , Attorney General Eric Holder , to decide whether officials should be punished .
‘ I think that there are a host of very complicated issues involved here , ’ he said .
The President said he could support a congressional inquiry only if it was conducted in a bipartisan way ‘ outside of the typical hearing process ’ and with ‘ independent participants who are above reproach ’.
Former Vice President Dick Cheney believes America does not need to apologise for its foreign policy
' As a general view , I do think we should be looking forward , not back , ' he said .
' I do worry about this getting so politicised that we cannot function effectively and it hampers our ability to carry out critical national security operations . '
The president spoke as former Vice President Dick Cheney insisted America has ' nothing to apologise for ' and demanded he release evidence that torture - waterboarding in particular - was successful .
' Since the U.S. provides most leadership in the world , I do n't think we have much to apologise for , ' said Cheney .
His comments follow Obama 's pledge of support yesterday to CIA chief Leon Panetta to make public the classified information on the widely - condemned waterboarding
' One of the things that I find a little bit disturbing about this recent disclosure is they put out the legal memos , the memos that the CIA got from the Office of Legal Counsel , but they did n't put out the memos that showed the success of the effort , ' Cheney told Fox News last night .
' I have n't talked about it , but I know specifically of reports that I read , that I saw , that lay out what we learned through the interrogation process and what the consequences were for the country .
' I 've now formally asked the CIA to take steps to declassify those memos so we can lay them out there and the American people have a chance to see what we obtained and what we learned and how good the intelligence was .
' It 's important to not personally attack the new president - I 've never done that .
' There 's a great temptation for a new administration to find a problem and blame it on the predecessor .
We did it .
' The Obama administration is not the first one to do that , ' he added .
Waterboarding - now outlawed by Obama - was launched by former President George W Bush after the September 11 attacks .
One memo said waterboarding - a form of stimulated drowning widely - considered torture - had been used a total of 266 times on two of the three Al Qaeda suspects .
The U.S. Justice Department said that CIA interrogators used the technique 183 times on Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , the self - proclaimed planner of the September 11 attacks and 83 times on another Al Qaeda prisoner , Abu Zubaydah .
The memo appears to contradict a former CIA officer who claimed two years ago , when the waterboarding claims first surfaced amid a huge public outcry , that Zubaydah had been subjected to the technique for just 35 seconds before agreeing to tell everything he knew .
The impression given was that , while the technique might be harrowing , it was brief and brought immediate results .
In this reconstruction , the subject is strapped down and waterboarded .
The technique simulates drowning
Obama said the memos were released because they had become the subject of a burdensome court fight and their covert nature had already been compromised .
Panetta vowed to respect a ban on harsh interrogations that Obama issued in January .
He had opposed releasing the memos , joining former CIA directors concerned that their release could expose agents to retribution .
Cheney 's comments follow Obama 's visit to CIA headquarters where he emphasised the importance of the CIA 's role in the fight against al Qaeda .
' We live in dangerous times .
I am going to need you more than ever , ' Obama said .
He advised the employees not to be discouraged by public discussion of ' mistakes ' .
The visit represented a swift bid by Obama to shore up CIA morale after he released classified Bush - era legal memos last week detailing the interrogation program .
Republican Kit Bond , vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee , said the release of the memos was a signal to CIA employees that ' our government is not going to stand behind you ' .
Obama pledged to employees that he would be ' vigorous ' in protecting them .
Obama also drew anger from human rights groups , by saying last week he would not prosecute CIA interrogators who had relied on the Bush - era legal guidelines .
The Democratic head of the Senate Intelligence Committee , Dianne Feinstein , urged him to withhold judgement on prosecutions , pending a closed - door review by her committee of the interrogation program .
Obama also acknowledged that CIA senior leaders in recent conversations had demonstrated ' anxiety and concern ' over his limits on interrogation techniques .
Worst Drought in 26 Years Threatens the Survival of the Last Desert Elephants in West Africa
The future of a rare herd of desert elephants in Mali is under threat from one of the worst droughts in living memory , which has left a key water source at its lowest level in a quarter of a century and is breaking down the usual peaceful co-existence between the elephants and local herdsmen .
The 350 to 450 elephants of Gourma , the northernmost herds still alive in Africa , are being forced to trek ever - longer distances across the fringes of the Sahara to find scarce water , conservation organization Save The Elephants warns today .
Juveniles are likely to be among the worst affected , as – unlike the bigger bulls – their trunks are not long enough to reach deep into remaining wells .
Six elephants have already been found dead .
Four others , including three calves , were recently saved from a mud hole …. only to die soon thereafter .
Save the Elephants ’ scientist Jake Wall is in Mali following the situation closely .
He says :
“ Banzena has almost completely dried leaving no more than 30 cm of muddy , sediment filled water .
The elephants are now in a deadly situation as they wait anxiously for the rains to begin .
Six elephants have died in the last couple of months from causes related to the drought conditions . ”
A group of NGO ’s comprising Save the Elephants ( STE ) and The WILD Foundation ( WILD ) have been monitoring the last rare desert elephants in Mali in collaboration with the Malian Environment Ministry directorate for conservation – Direction Nationale de la Conservation de la Nature ( DNCN ) .
This unique herd of elephants is now in a desperate situation due to a drastic shortage of water , and we are launching an emergency appeal to save them .
The desert elephants of Mali live in the Gourma district to the South East of Timbuktu .
They are the northernmost elephants surviving in Africa , estimated at between 350 and 450 in number .
They have adapted to survive in the harsh conditions of the Sahel by migrating long distances in search of water and food but live on the margin of what is ecologically viable .
Dr Iain Douglas - Hamilton of Save the Elephants has been monitoring their range since the mid 1970s .
He says :
“ In the Gourma region of Mali are the last elephants living in the Sahel and they are northernmost in Africa .
Their range has shrunk drastically since the 1970 ’s due to climate change and overstocking of livestock which has degraded the habitat .
These elephants have the longest migration route of any in Africa and move in a counterclockwise circle of about 700 km .
At the height of the dry season there are only a handful of shallow lakes left to them until recharged by rains in July and August . ”
This year the water levels are extremely low in the Gourma region due to uneven rainfall in 2008 .
The most important of these lakes , Banzena , is the lowest it has been since 1983 when it dried completely .
Over the last few years a team of Save the Elephants in collaboration with the DNCN have been closely following the movements of the elephants using 9 collars fitted with Global Positioning System ( GPS ) receivers .
The collars transmit the hourly positions of the elephants three times daily via satellite link and give real - time information about the activities of the elephant herds .
The WILD Foundation is using this information and that collected in previous years they ’ve worked in Mali , to create outreach and coordination programs with local officials and villagers to try and reduce human elephant conflict , and reduce stress on the elephants .
On the 16th of May , Jake Wall , a scientist with Save the Elephants , returned from the most important water source , Lake Banzena , on which the elephants rely at the height of the dry season .
He found it almost dry .
“ The situation is equally dire for the Touareg and Pheul herdsmen who rely on Banzena for their cattle and many cows are now dying each day from lack of water and the soaring temperatures which reach 50 degrees Celcius in the shade .
The stench of rotting corpses fills the air and what little water remains is putrid and undrinkable by all standards .
The normal peaceful coexistence between the elephants and herdsmen is starting to break - down and giving way to conflict over access to water . ”
Very few options now exist for finding water and we are witnessing erratic movements further and further afield as they desperately search for water and forage .
“ Small thundershowers last week left tantalizing puddles 20 km to the south of Banzena , enough to survive on for a couple days at most , but the herds are now being forced back north to the almost dry lake . ”
At a dry lake bed 50 km to the east of Banzena , 6 bull elephants are surviving by getting on their knees and reaching for water with their trunks that is 3 meters beneath ground level and through a hole dug by the Touareg .
Younger elephants who are not as big or as skilled cannot possibly reach these hard to get at water points .
The long distances , high temperatures and weakened condition will also take a heavy toll on the younger elephants .
Jake Wall says , “ I ’ve witnessed first hand how tough the situation can be for young elephants .
Last year during a radio - collaring operation , I came across 3 elephant calves trapped in a mud hole along with a half grown female .
From the age structure it looked like they had lost their matriarch .
Evidently , this young female had led the youngsters into a waterless area .
They happened upon a shallow well dug by herdsmen for watering cattle and it appears that the elephants , desperate for water , tumbled into the well and all four were hopelessly stuck in the mud for three days .
Our Save the Elephants team pulled them out one by one , but they were so weak that only the large female survived .
She was radio - tagged and we watched her dash 80 km to the nearest water at Lake Banzena . ”
Urgent action is now needed to secure water for the elephants until the rains commence as predicted in early June .
Fortunately , two pumps already exist at Banzena for pumping water and the DNCN have fixed them and have staff on site with the pumps running .
Save the Elephants , in partnership with the WILD Foundation and the Mali government ( DNCN ) , is appealing for funds for diesel necessary for their operation .
It is not certain whether the water quantity will be sufficient
Vance Martin , President of The WILD Foundation , said that they are working on a long term plan : ” After years of work in Mali we understand what is needed now .
We ’ve been working for some months developing a long term plan to reduce human elephant conflict , secure permanent water for the elephants , and create separate arrangements for the local villagers and their cattle .
There is a way to do this , working with local people , so the needs of both people and wildlife are part of the solution ….
but it must be done properly or we will end up in the same position in a few years . ”

Shantytown , USA
Nickelsville residents demand permanent land for the homeless
by Dawn Paley
The Dominion - http://www.dominionpaper.ca
NICKELSVILLE ( RENTON ) , SEATTLE–" Thank God for Nickelsville . "
That 's how two women living at the site summed up their feelings towards the " permanent homeless shantytown " currently set up in the side lot of the Bryn Mawr United Methodist Church in northeast Seattle , WA , USA .
Its existence has provided a safe place to people who would otherwise have nowhere to live , allowing residents to " provide for themselves a basic level of safety and sanitation when their government steadfastly refuses to do so for them , " according to the Nickelsville website .
Nickelsville got its start on city property on September 22 , 2008 , in response to a lack of city action in response to growing of homelessness .
Days later , the site was raided by police , and 22 people were arrested .
Nickelsville has moved five times since it was founded .
Every so often , residents of Nickelsville , who call themselves Nickelodeons , have to pack up and move .
The City of Seattle sets time limits for how long Nickelodeons are allowed to stay in one place .
Nickelsville has been located in Renton since March 5 , and residents will be forced to move on June 5 .
Residents of Nickelsville are working to secure a permanent site where long - term housing for 1,000 people can be built .
The entryway to Nickelsville .
" [ Seattle ] Mayor Nickels ' edict to systematically drive people out of their encampments and to destroy their property was the trigger for the present crisis , " reads the Nickelsville website .
" It is only befitting that our shantytown be named in honor of Mayor Nickels and his ' humane ' treatment of the homeless . "

Despite allegations of bribery , despite accounts of over - charging the government , despite reports of faulty work endangering the lives of American soldiers , the companies of Halliburton and its one - time subsidiary KBR are doing better than ever .
When the Bush administration gave the green light to invade Iraq in 2003 , Halliburton was rewarded with billion - dollar contracts through KBR to provide logistical support for the U.S. military , performing tasks that ranged from feeding the troops to building their shelters .
But once numerous controversies surfaced involving KBR , Halliburton cut the company loose , and officially ended their longtime relationship in 2007 .
Today , neither Halliburton nor KBR are suffering from their divorce .
Halliburton reported $ 4 billion in operating profits in 2008 , while KBR recently said its first quarter revenues in 2009 were up 27 % , for a total of $ 3.2 billion .
Its sales in 2008 were up 33 % , and according to the Financial Times , the company had $ 1 billion in cash , no debt , and was looking for acquisitions .
So far no amount of bad news has hurt KBR ’s business .
Last month , a Defense Department investigator told the Commission on Wartime Contracting in Iraq and Afghanistan that the “ vast majority ” of cases involving over - billing , bribery , and other possible violations by contractors in Iraq were linked to KBR .
Also , Pentagon auditors balked at paying KBR $ 100 million for private security that the government contract specifically prohibited .
And the company has been accused of installing faulty wiring at military bases that has resulted in numerous soldiers being electrocuted , leading to four deaths .
But this may be the topper .
KBR is currently rebuilding a dining hall at Camp Delta in Iraq — even though : A ) The company just finished remodeling it ; and B ) The military will be pulling out of the base within two years .

Iraqis are known for having a wicked sense of humour
An Iraqi member of staff at the BBC Baghdad bureau has been sending his impressions of life in his hometown .
In this instalment he considers the lighter side of an often dark situation .
For security reasons , the author 's name is not being published .
There is a special intensity to the experience of life in Iraq .
You laugh more and cry more .
And as often as not , you find yourself doing both at the same time .
The humour of the people of Egypt is well - known in the Middle East .
Some believe it is born of crippling poverty - if you 've no other choice , you have to laugh the hardships away .
Everyone scattered in panic , thinking it was bound to be a car bomb
The same is true in Iraq .
Except that , in addition to poverty , we have daily , random violence , foreign soldiers all over the place , a state sector riddled with corruption , and public services that have fallen to pieces .
So we laugh all the harder .
The other day , a colleague went to the computer market in the centre of Baghdad .
When he got back he told us he had been scared stiff .
As he walked among the stalls , a taxi screeched to a halt and three men plus the driver leapt from the vehicle .
Everyone scattered in panic , thinking it was bound to be a car bomb and the men were about to detonate it by remote control .
Chaos followed .
It turned out the men had simply stopped their car in a no-parking zone and were hurrying to do their shopping before the traffic police showed up .
Humour amid discomfort
It 's like another story I heard recently ; a young guy was staring lasciviously at a pretty girl on a public minibus .
An older man , indignant at the youth 's shameless behaviour , but not knowing how to intervene , called out " Allahu akbar " ( God is great ) in an attempt to bring the youth 's mind back to more pious thoughts .
Of course , all the other passengers drew the natural conclusion , that the old man must be a suicide bomber and the shout of " Allahu akbar " meant he , and they , were about to meet their maker .
" Hey driver , where are your trousers ? "
The bus driver pumped the brakes and the passengers fled screaming in all directions .
Should we laugh at their discomfort ?
I do n't know .
But what else can you do ?
Here are some of the jokes doing the rounds in Baghdad these days .
You may find them funny , you may not . - A guy stoned on drugs is driving his car when he 's stopped by the traffic police enforcing the new traffic rules .
" Why are n't you wearing your belt ? " they ask him .
" Because I 'm not wearing any trousers , " he replies . - A guy with cross -eyes volunteers to join a militia group .
They assign him to the random bombing unit .
- A Jordanian finds a magic lamp .
A genie appears and asks him what is his heart 's desire .
" Send all these Iraqi refugees back across the border , " the man says .
" Why ? " asks the genie .
" Whatever have we done to you ? " - A Indian man is tossing and turning in his bed in the middle of the night in his hovel in the country 's poorest slum , and then he wakes up screaming .
" Oh God ! Please !
No !!! " he yells .
" Calm down , darling .
It 's just a nightmare , " says his wife .
" You 're right , my love , " he says , catching his breath .
" But what a nightmare - I dreamt I went to sleep and woke up in Iraq ! " Quite .
A nightmare indeed .

Read how no one is even close to debating " ticking time bomb " scenarios as they strap people to boards and drown them until they break .
Then read how they adjusted the waterboarding , for fear it was too much , for fear that they were actually in danger of suffocating their captives , and then read how they found self - described loopholes in the law to tell themselves that what the US had once prosecuted as torture could not possibly be torture because we 're doing it , and we 're different from the Viet Cong .
We 're doing torture right and for the right reasons and with the right motive .
Many of the people who did this are mild , kind , courteous , family men and women , who somehow were able to defend slamming human beings against walls in the daytime while watching the Charlie Rose show over a glass of wine at night .
We 've seen this syndrome before , in other places and at other times .
Yes : it can happen here .
And imagine how this already functioning torture machine would have operated in the wake of another attack under a president Romney or Giuliani .
It is this professionalism and bureaucratic mastery that chills in the end .
Not the brutality of " the program , " but the modernity and banality of the apparatus around it .
As Orwell predicted , the English language had to disappear first .
The president referred to waterboarding prisoners as " asking them questions . "
Bringing prisoners ' temperatures down to hypothermia levels was simply an " alternative set of procedures . "
The entire process is " enhanced interrogation . "
Even the press has to find a way to call it merely " harsh " , a term now changed to " brutal " in the NYT , even though nothing we found out yesterday was more brutal than anything we knew about before .
Mukasey and Hayden complain that the president has tied the hands of future presidents in this .
Yes , he has .
What Obama understands is that what is truly vital is that this dark and shameful period not become a workable precedent .
It must be repudiated at the very heart of the American political system , and removed like the cancer it is .
The question of prosecution remains .
It 's a painful decision .
My view is that those who pay the legal price should be , first and foremost , those who authorized this at the highest levels .
My view is also that it is a travesty that the Abu Ghraib reservists were prosecuted , and yet far , far more culpable people are claiming it would be too divisive to prosecute them .
My view is that no one is above the law , and that when a society based on law prosecutes the powerless and excuses the powerful , it is corroding its own soul .
But my view is also that the president has acted wisely in this .
As president in wartime , he knows how wounding it would be to engage in this kind of activity right now .
But he has also ensured that a process of transparency continue .
A full accounting of all of this - by people from both parties with real power to investigate and report ( a 9/11 style commission , in other words ) would be a natural next step .
There is still much we do n't know .
It should take its time to get everything right .
Justice can be slow as long as it is guaranteed .
From the president , some well - chosen words he clearly wrote himself :
At a time of great challenges and disturbing disunity , nothing will be gained by spending our time and energy laying blame for the past .
Our national greatness is embedded in America 's ability to right its course in concert with our core values , and to move forward with confidence .
That is why we must resist the forces that divide us , and instead come together on behalf of our common future .
The United States is a nation of laws .
My Administration will always act in accordance with those laws , and with an unshakeable commitment to our ideals .
That is why we have released these memos , and that is why we have taken steps to ensure that the actions described within them never take place again .
Let me repeat the critical two words in that paragraph : Never .
Again .

During the election , the Iranian government cut off access to telephones , text messaging , Facebook , YouTube , and opposition websites - but not Twitter .
Apparently , because its API enables its use across many servers and clients , they 're having incredible trouble shutting it down .
As a result , Twitter is literally the central hub for the entire movement .
#iranelection Widely considered superior to any mainstream media coverage as a realtime news source .
Emerging cliché : " The revolution will be Twittered . "
#iranrevolution Proposed successor to #iranelection , since the uprising has grown beyond the election alone .

Has nothing been learned ?
Apparently not .
Stephen Hester , the chief ­executive of RBS , will get a pay deal worth £ 9.6 m , ­although he is in ­effect a public ­servant , working for us , the bank 's ­owners .
His bonus is tied to a high share price , the very incentive that caused the bubble and crash in the first place .
Perversely , his bonus encourages him not to lend , though the governor of the Bank of ­England urges banks to lend more .
As a small extra , RBS executives are spending some £ 300,000 on entertaining one another at Wimbledon .
Reclaiming some of Sir Fred Goodwin 's super - sized pension failed to distract attention from these excesses .
It 's not surprising Sir Fred says he needs police protection when he returns to his Edinburgh home , since the unemployed and repossessed may feel like bricking the windows of all those who helped crash the economy .
Compared with what 's happening in the City , MPs ' expenses are chicken feed ( though none have yet actually claimed for chicken feed ) .
Fury over parliamentary petty greed has displaced what should be a spontaneous uprising against the bankers who have caused such widespread damage .
Who agreed this ?
Sir Philip Hampton , part - time chair of RBS , and unusually for a non-exec himself paid £ 750,000 plus a bonus of £ 1.2 m .
Last Friday the deal was agreed by UKFI , the new body supposedly overseeing the taxpayers ' stake in failed banks .
Well , it would agree , would n't it ?
UKFI 's board is packed with former directors of failed banks .
The chair worked in crashed Citigroup , another was Citi 's chief UK officer , another worked at collapsed Merrill Lynch , one came from bailed - out UBS , another from near - miss Credit Suisse .
Just two are from the Treasury .
At the Mansion House last week Alistair Darling gave a speech calling for bank boards to have " the right people and the right experience ... making the right call at the right time " .
Yes indeed ; but that £ 9.6 m fee will prove to be the wrong political call .
" We can not go back to business as usual " the chancellor said , but UKFI did just that , because the people he appointed know nothing else .
Group - think is what he hired , and herd behaviour is what he got .
Hester 's salary is , they say , broadly in line with other UK bank chiefs .
These people are plainly incapable of imagining how it looks to the citizenry outside .
The UKFI board includes no outsider , not one rebellious academic or free - thinking economist .
The chancellor agreed this deal in advance .
The Treasury says ­Hester wo n't get the full whack until he ­delivers a £ 15 bn profit for the taxpayer , after the elapse of three years – and it can be clawed back .
" The government feels comfortable with these terms .
This is the model we want for all banks . "
RBS , they remind us , is as big as the British economy – but then why is n't he paid the same as the chancellor , or vice versa ?
" People are motivated by different things and bankers are motivated by money , whereas chancellors are not so much . "
Look , Bob Diamond of Barclays earns far more , they say .
" We have benchmarked this deal against the market . "
Yes , but that " benchmarking " is exactly how top pay has been inflated from 15 times the average worker 's wage to 75 times in just 20 years .
Gordon Brown spent two days last week in Brussels fighting against new EU regulations , under pressure from hedge funds threatening to leave London if we sign up .
Meanwhile , Goldman Sachs is having its best year ever , and will be handing out the biggest bonuses in its history .
Investment banks that did n't crash have made bumper fortunes out of trading in debt , much of it government debt .
While these buccaneers are free to pay what they please , the rest can claim these sums are now the " going rate " .
So what they do affects everyone .
As we now know , we insure their risk willy - nilly , because even small bank failures can crash the whole system .
We could and should be taxing bank profits an extra 10 % , according to tax campaigner Richard Murphy , to cover the cost of that unseen insurance .
Indeed we could hypothecate it to pay for training and employing the million young people who are out of work this summer due directly to banking recklessness .
Stephen Hester seemed to understand the need for change now RBS was publicly owned when he told the Treasury select committee this year : " I do think banking pay in some areas of the industry is way too high and needs to come down , and I intend us to lead that process . "
What a shame he decided not to take that lead after all .
He is already phenomenally rich , as is RBS chair Sir Philip Hampton , who when I interviewed him at the height of the boom , differentiated not between the have - nots and have - yachts , but between those like him who have yachts but not their own crews .
These two men could have earned the admiration and gratitude of the people by working for a nominal sum .
They could be heroes .
But that kind of financial abstemiousness is now wildly eccentric .
That 's why it did n't occur to many MPs that there was anything wrong with claiming all the expenses they could get away with .
The last two decades of undiluted money worship were captured so well by Peter Mandelson 's laconically iconic remark that he was " intensely relaxed about people getting filthy rich " .
That spirit of the age was gilded by Gordon Brown 's fawning praise to the City on his last Mansion House dinner as chancellor , extolling them for delivering a " golden age " on the eve of disaster .
Tony Blair swanning round the world collecting millions for public speaking sets the seal on it all .
This feels like the end of Labour as the credible voice of the underdog .
The New Labour " project " was designed by Mandelson , Brown and Blair to abolish the politics of class , scorning the " politics of envy " .
The project has ended in abolishing the credibility and meaning of Labour itself .
Wherever you go in meetings or gatherings , people are incandescently angry with the establishment .
But they have nowhere to turn , no one to rally them against untouched City power or a complacent parliament .
Labour , once the natural home for anti-establishment anger , is now defender of everything people want to rebel against .
At the time of the crash , Brown and Darling had a choice to become the representatives of that voice but they ducked the radical moment .
Instead they are defenders of the status quo , halfhearted in political and electoral reform , timid apologists for the City .
What more will it take to make politics respond to popular anger ?

Exploring Perl web frameworks
A couple of years ago I started looking at options to deliver common “ front end ” functionality for sites using Bricolage , the content - management system that is used at New Internationalist
Initially , what I had in mind to provide this front - end functionality was a “ swarm ” of micro-applications , where each little application provided one simple , specific , function , e.g. , user registration , comments on content , voting and rating , sharing content , etc .
There were other people thinking along these lines too , and – eventually – I came across the MicroApps project , which stated its philosophy as :
MicroApps are small REST applications that are designed from the ground up to be integrated with other applications .
Usually , they are not directly useful on their own , but must be integrated into other applications ( this is what differentiates a MicroApp from a regular REST application ) .
Unfortunately , the project appeared to be at a standstill , and my experience with Python was pretty limited .
Most of my experience is with Perl , so my investigation headed in that direction , and eventually lead to the topic of this post :
Perl web frameworks .
While they may not often be used for micro-applications , Web frameworks are all the rage .
You ’ve probably heard of Ruby on Rails , and you may have even heard of Django ( a Python - based web framework ) or Symphony ( PHP ) .
Put simply : these web frameworks aim to make web application development faster and commonly “ bake in ” some best practices .
Advert
Yes , Perl has CRUD too
Perl , though frequently dismissed by the youngsters , is not a language that likes to get left behind , and there are now several Perl web frameworks to choose from .
Around the time of thinking about micro-applications , I stumbled on Jifty .
Jifty was developed by Best Practical – an established software company in the Perl world – and was used in the production and delivery of their Hiveminder application .
I had heard of Gantry , Maypole , and Catalyst ( and – of course – CGI : : Appliation ) but I had not really given them much attention until I first read about Jifty .
Fast forward to 2009 .
We ’re underway with a number of initiatives of strategic importance to the New Internationalist – re-launching NI ’s various web properties – and so it ’s time to start thinking again about the technologies that will carry NI forward .
My colleague Charlie had been recently experimenting with Jifty and Catalyst , and – in the interest of the experience to be gained by getting one ’s hands dirty – I also decided to jump in and re-explore the state of Perl web frameworks .
This time I thought I ’d look at the three most active , or promising , options : Catalyst , Jifty , and Mojo / Mojolicious .
( I also took a pretty close look at CGI : : Application , but decided to pass on that for now . )
Advert
So , far from an evaluation , I thought I ’d just jot down my first impressions of where these frameworks are by exploring how easy it is to get up - and - running and working through their tutorials .
Catalyst
My development environment for this adventure was VMware ’s Fusion on a MacBook Pro and a stock Debian 5.0 “ Lenny ” installation .
I started with the Catalyst installation documentation and followed their instructions for an installation using aptitude .
Though the basic installation went well , it seemed to leave me with many missing modules , including Catalyst : : Devel ( which is odd , as that appears to be a rather critical piece ) .
After various attempts to create an application skeleton or start up the web server , I was able to get the various missing bits installed via CPAN and to get everything working .
On to the documentation and tutorials …
My first impression was that the documentation was very well maintained .
The tutorials are abundant and thorough , and make attempts to address the various versions of Catalyst that are out there in the wild .
Thanks to the tutorials , I was able to get a simple test application set up relatively quickly .
However , what Catalyst makes up for in documentation , it lacks in simplicity .
As the Catalyst documentation states :
Catalyst is designed for flexibility and power ; to an extent , this comes at the expense of simplicity .
Programmers have many options for almost everything they need to do , which means that any given need can be done in many ways , and finding the one that ’s right for you , and learning the right way to do it , can take time .
TIMTOWDI works both ways .
Compared to the competing Perl web frameworks or web frameworks in other languages , I found that Catalyst required more effort to get started and does n’t provide an out - of - the - box experience .
Not a bad thing but a consideration nonetheless .
Jifty
For Jifty , this time I went with the suggested apt - get install route to get things downloaded and installed .
Unfortunately , the first thing I ran into was this rather intimidating warning :
WARNING : This key is not certified with a trusted signature !
Moving right along , I installed the package anyway and tried to set up my first application .
Like Catalyst , I was presented with various errors about missing modules .
One Google search and several CPAN installations later , as promised , I got a Pony .
One nice thing that Jifty gives you out - of - the - box is an administration interface , making it easy to start adding test data to your model .
The other really helpful thing that Jifty provides is , well , everything .
Part of what makes Jifty so cool is :
Out of the proverbial box , Jifty comes with one way to do everything you should need to do : one database mapper , one templating system , one web services layer , one AJAX toolkit , one set of handlers for standalone or FastCGI servers .
We work hard to make all the bits play well together , so you do n’t have to .
Which means trading off options ( as in the case of Catalyst ) for simplicity .
Jifty ’s documentation is a little rough around the edges , but the tutorials are up - to - date and I was able to get my test application running and doing fancy , AJAX -y , stuff in no time .
Mojo / Mojolicious
Mojo is a “ A next generation web framework for the Perl programming language ” and Mojolicious is a MVC framework built on top of Mojo .
The primary author of Mojo – Sebastian Riedel – was one of the founders of Catalyst and , with Mojo , he sets out to create something more like Jifty – or , if you prefer , “ the web in a box . ”
Mojo was by far the easiest to install : just a straightforward tarball to download and a few Perl “ make ” commands and Mojo was up - and - running .
Unfortunately , the fun stops there at the moment .
Mojo is very new and provides fairly limited documentation to work from .
And , idling in the IRC channel , one can see lots of activity and signs that there is much work to be done before Mojo becomes a practical alternative to Catalyst or Jifty .
However , once it does , it ’s going to be one to watch .
Conclusions
So , a few parting thoughts on my exploration of Perl web frameworks :
I worry that some of the installation issues I ran into will discourage other people to try these incredibly powerful frameworks .
It ’s been years since I ’ve looked at any of the competing frameworks in other languages , but my guess would be that most installation issues are ironed out and the process is dead - simple .
However , any time I ran into a problem , I was able to hop into the IRC channel for the project and find friendly and helpful advice .
All three project ’s channels are active and filled with idling contributors .
And , for me , the current prize goes to Jifty for being friendly to developers of all experience levels .
For rapid application prototyping , Jifty makes the set - up process fast and easy , provides a full stack for application development , and makes a lot of relatively unimportant decisions ( database mapper , Javascript toolkit , templating language , etc. ) for you right upfront .
I ’m anxious to see what Charlie comes up with during his explorations of the same .
Rachel Maddow , on the other hand , appears to be a keeper .
In the clip below , she explains how President Obama , principled opponent of prosecuting or even investigating past crimes , plans to lock people up for future crimes .
Forever .
To be fair , that is literally progressive .

This Improved Fuel Stove , or Rocket Stove , is the final project for Engr305 at Humboldt State University .
The project goal is to construct a demonstration rocket stove for the Campus Center for Appropriate Technology on the campus of Humboldt State University .
The rocket stove will serve as an example of improved fuel stove technology and development ; students and public touring the center will learn about the design , function and need for improved fuel stoves around the world .
The rocket stove will also enable the residents of the center to cook with traditional biomass , reducing their dependence on petroleum based energy sources .
It is important to note that rocket stoves are designed for populations around the world who depend on biomass for their cooking fuel .
The use of rocket stoves in developed nations is not necessary .
Developed nations using modern cooking methods are not faced with health and environmental issues related with traditional cooking methods .
The improved fuel stove was designed , built and tested by Daniel Moyer and Tyler Jones .
Populations increasingly rely on biomass for cooking fuel , thus hindering the next step toward modern cooking methods .
Populations in developing nations want the same modern , self cleaning , convection , downdraft stove found in American suburbs .
Many people argue that modern cooking methods are more appropriate .
Modern cooking methods are efficient at fuel conversion and produce less atmospheric particulates , however the dependence on petroleum hinders the appropriateness of modern cooking methods .
Improved cook stoves are an attempt to address the negative environmental and social effects of the three rock fire .
Improved Stoves increase efficiency of fuel consumption and reduce pollution released into indoor cooking environments .
Improved fuel stoves designs are constructed with metal housing and insulating materials enclosing the fire .
Improved fuel stoves improve heat transfer and fuel combustion , resulting in an efficient clean burning wood stove .
Design [ edit ]
Design Principles [ edit ]
A well constructed rocket stove will allow for air to circulate .
With this in mind , it is important to provide an even pathway for the air .
The chimney , the combustion chamber and the skirt gap should all have the same cross-sectional area .
Unless oxygen is being circulated , the fire will smother .
When building the combustion chamber it is necessary to provide a shelf for the fuel .
This way , fresh air will be pulled underneath the burning fuel .
The chimney should be short , reaching just above the cookpot .
This allows for hot gasses to flow more rapidly through the system .
Heat will radiate from the combustion chamber .
For improved efficiency , insulate around the chamber .
Materials [ edit ]
The materials used in the construction of a rocket stoves main body are made from recycled metal barrels .
An old lemon oil can was trimmed to the proper dimensions , becoming our pot skirt .
The insulated combustion chamber is comprised of ceramic insulated bricks purchased at a local pottery supply store .
The chamber is held together with eighteen gauge stainless steel metal plating fastened with 3/8 inch hardware .
The hardware used to construct the rocket stove includes machine screws , nuts , washers and sheet metal screws ; all of our hardware utilized was purchased from a local hardware store .

Construction Steps [ edit ]
The square combustion chamber was constructed out of insulative bricks .
Bricks were cut and shaped using a hack saw .
Heat resistant putty was used as sealant .
A metal bracket supports a sheet metal case that holds the combustion chamber in place .
The metal was cut out with tin snips and fastened with screws at the edges .
Drill and tin snips are used to cut a square out of the barrel corresponding to the dimensions of the metal casing .
The casing for the combustion chamber fits into the hole , protruding on both sides .
The casing is firmly secured to a metal beam that stretches across the barrel .
This beam is secured on both sides with L brackets .
Vermiculite is poured into the barrel in order to insulate the combustion chamber .
This insulation fills the space between the chamber and the barrel and is filled as high as the top of the chamber .
At the top opening of the combustion chamber we constructed a metal shelf .
This shelf is circular and perfectly fits inside of the barrel .
It has a square cut in it corresponding to the top opening of the combustion chamber .
This allows for gasses to pass through , but seals them off from the bottom half of the barrel .
The shelf is secured firmly to the outside of the barrel with L brackets and screws .
In the top half of the barrel , we constructed a skirt .
This skirt surrounds the cooking pot , leaving a small gap on the bottom and the sides .
The skirt was constructed out of a can .
We used tin snips to cut a square opening in the bottom to channel the hot gasses .
The top of the can was cut completely open with a Sawzall .
The skirt is fastened to the shelf with screws and washers .
The pot is inserted into an opening in the top of the barrel .
Here we have cut out a circle with tin snips and then carefully bent the metal down at a right angle using square pliers and a mallet .
This way the pot is extra sealed and the opening for it is not jagged or sharp .
We cut a hole out of the upper side of the barrel and fastened a circular metal chimney over the hole using screws .
To use our rocket stove , burn fuel inside the combustion chamber and set the pot inside the skirt .
Testing [ edit ]
Testing is essential to rocket stove projects .
Testing should happen throughout the entire life of a stove project .
The evaluation of improved stoves helps determine if the model is marketable , whether production costs are as low as possible , and if improvements are needed .
" Careful testing of stoves has resulted in a more accurate understanding of how to make a better stove .
Without experimentation and testing , the development of a stove is based on conjecture " .
Technical advances in energy efficiency alone will not ensure success .
Stove programs must be complemented by appropriate project design , implementation and proper institutional support .
Without proper testing , stove programs will have unrealistic expectation of the efficiency of improved stoves .
Stove programs can overestimate the efficiency of improved stoves when tested in a controlled lab setting .
Improved stoves never do as well in real households .
" The fuel savings that can be attained in a laboratory often have little relationship to savings possible under field conditions " [ 1 ] .
Many stove programs in controlled lab settings achieved a 75 % reduction in fuel consumption .
After examination of early stove programs , fuel efficiency expectations of improved stoves have been substantially reduced .
" Most people in the stove community now agree that a 50 % decrease in fuel consumption should be considered a major achievement and that should be content with a savings of 25 % or even less " [ 1 ] .
Laboratory settings can be valuable with designing and initial testing of improved stoves ; testing in field conditions can ensure the final product is built and designed correctly .
Producing a stove design that adheres and conforms to local culture is vital in ensuring a successful stove program .
Types of Testing [ edit ]
In testing our stove , we wanted to find out how long it would take to boil water and how much wood was being used .
We also inspected the ashes to determine if the wood was fully combusted .
Ultimately we did three types of tests .
We boiled water from a cold start and from hot start .
Hot start means that we started the test when there was already wood burning .
The starting temperature for the water was sixty three degrees .
We maintained a boil for 30 minutes .
We did not start the clock until all of the wood that initially brought the water to a boil had burned out .
This gave us more accurate results .
Results [ edit ]
It took 13 minutes and .36 pounds of wood to heat four liters of water 108 oF .
This was done from a cold start ( nothing burning initially ) .
The starting temperature was 62 oF and the final temperature was 170 oF .
From a hot start , it took 10 minutes and .56 pounds of wood to heat the same volume of water 149 oF .
The starting temperature was 63 oF and the final temperature was 212 oF .
From a hot start , it took 11 minutes and .72 pounds of wood to heat six liters of water 146 oF .
The starting temperature was 64 oF and the final temperature was 210 oF .
To keep six liters of water boiling for half of an hour it took .18 pounds of wood .
The starting temperature was 212 oF and the final temperature was 210 oF .
Conclusion [ edit ]
The results of our testing demonstrated that the project was a success .
The first thing that we noticed was that the air circulation is excellent .
We never had a problem getting enough air into the fire or with having smoke back out of the combustion chamber .
This makes starting a fire very easy .
Also , we were happy to see that there were hardly any ashes left over .
The wood burned hot and combusted completely .
Although the top of the stove gets hot when the fire is burning fast , the vermiculite does a very good job of insulating the bottom part .
The lower half of the stove never got too hot to touch and the very base never even got warm .
Once a fire is going , it must be tended regularly .
As well as adding new wood as the fire burns , it is important to constantly push burning pieces all the way into the chamber .
Our stove is very efficient .
To cook spaghetti in our stove would require roughly one pound of wood and would take only a few minutes longer than a regular stove .
By using a lot of wood and creating a big flame , it is possible to boil water quickly .
With less wood , the same amount of water can be boiled but it takes longer .
It takes a lot of wood to heat water initially , but to keep it boiling requires very little wood .
One pound of wood would keep six liters of water boiling for about two and a half hours .
When our stove is burning , the pot and the skirt get a lot of soot .
Periodically , it will be necessary to clean this soot out .
In building a rocket stove , we learned some important things .
First , it would be possible to construct this type of stove using only recycled materials .
The hardware would be the most difficult to find .
It would also be possible to construct our rocket stove with out the use of power tools .
We could have used a hammer and spike instead of a drill .
We also could have used a hacksaw instead of a Sawzall .
We only used this tool once , to cut the skirt out .
As we anticipated , the top of the stove got hot .
If our stove was placed inside of another barrel and insulated , it would be more user - friendly .
Personally , I would rather deal with the hot surface than to put more work into the stove .
In a situation where there were children using the stove , the hot metal could be dangerous .
The one thing that our stove lacks is a shelf for extra long pieces of wood to rest on while they are combusting .
Populations around the world are going to continue to use biomass fuel for the indefinite future .
The use of improved stoves can help control the external costs to both the environment and human society .
" It seems inevitable that an increasing amount of biomass fuel will be bought and burned in purchased stoves " [ 1 ] .
Fuel savings may not be the driving factor in the adaptation of improved stoves .
Improved stoves work because they make cooking quicker , safer , and cleaner .
Improved stoves protect children from the dangers of burns from the open fire , reduce respiratory diseases , and burn clean and free of soot .

On September 11 , we visited the rocket stove at CCAT to check on how it 's doing and update the page a little .
The stove is in decent condition but there are a few areas that the stove could be improved .
The rocket stove has gone through a few very minor changes since its creation .
Recently , it received a fresh paint job .
Also , the chimney has been lengthened considerably .
As you can see from previous pictures , the original chimney was rather short .
The new chimney is much taller and has a cap on the top .
We also left a laminated informational piece to hang around the chimney and let people know what the rocket stove is and information about rocket stoves in general .
We met up with Dan and tested the stove .
It appeared as if the stove had n’t been used in quite a few years .
The first step was to wash the cookpot
Then , we gathered pieces of kindling 1 ’ to 1.5 ’ long .
The kindling weighed a total of .44 lbs
After that , we filled the pot with water and placed it in the skirt
Next , we started burning the pieces of wood in the combustion chamber .
We also added dead grass to the kindling .
The water came to a rapid boil within 7 minutes and 25 seconds .
The water 's temperature was measured at 150 degrees Fahrenheit .
We observed a few problem areas .
The vermiculite used to insulate the combustion chamber is old and could be replaced .
Also , there are small gaps between the combustion chamber and the metal case of the barrel , which may have decreased the concentration of the heat around the pot and the low temperature of the boiling water .
These gaps could easily be filled in by some kind of heat resistant sealant .
Also , it was unclear if the addition of the longer chimney improved the flow of gasses or not .
As noted earlier the chimney should be short , reaching just above the cookpot so the lengthened chimney might have actually hindered the flow of gases .
Also , the bricks in the combustion chamber may need some replacing as well .
If this stove was being consistently used , it would probably be a good idea to address these concerns as you would want your stove in prime running condition .

Updated by Jacob Carroll - Johnson and Carlos A. Sanchez
It looked like the rocket stove has not been used in quite some time .
Reasons for not using the rocket stove is easy of use .
Its difficult to light and once it is lit it 's hard to stay lit .
The bottoms of pots get scorched .
It also becomes very smokey when using .
The weather has taken its toll on it .
I was bummed out that we could n’t test it out and see actual results .
We are planning on going back to do some testing and see how it compares with when it was first built .
We will post results once we run some tests .
We proceed with the analytical analysis .
The first thing that we noticed was the smoke flute and the laminated information were gone .
Rust has taken its toll on the stove .
The top and bottom have taken the most hit from it .
There are some holes from the rust going all the way through the top .
So the top will soon need to be replaced .
The bottom also has been affected .
It appears that the rust has eaten the metal , and is now really thin at the bottom .
No holes yet but maybe in the near future .
There does n't seem to be much continuity of the rocket .
Moving on to the combustion chamber .
The heat resistant sealant that was used to seal the ceramic bricks is almost completely gone .
The bottom brick is also in bad shape .
When we wiggled the bottom brick we saw that only one big chunk moved .
We also noticed that the back part of the combustion chamber had cracks .

Blood and Politics : The History of the White Nationalist Movement from the Margins to the Mainstream
By Leonard Zeskind
( Farrar Straus & Giroux , 2009 )
In the 1970s , 80s , and 90s , the deeply - held religious beliefs of an assortment of white nationalists became the scaffolding for a broad , and often violent , movement of racists and anti-Semites .
Fifteen years in the making , Leonard Zeskind ’s new book Blood and Politics : The History of the White Nationalist Movement from the Margins to the Mainstream ( Farrar Straus & Giroux ) is more than a history of the white supremacist movement .
While the movement ’s Christian roots , anti-Semitism and racist beliefs have been dissected over the years , the core religious beliefs of a number of white nationalist movement leaders has received far less attention .
I recently had the opportunity to talk with Zeskind , a friend and colleague , about his new book , the role these religious beliefs played in the development of a host of organizations , and where things stand as we inhabit the Age of Obama .
Zeskind is an internationally recognized expert on white nationalist movements and a longtime activist in the battle for civil and human rights .
He has testified at a British parliamentary subcommittee hearing , crisscrossed Germany speaking to anti-fascist activists , and received a MacArthur Foundation Fellowship .
He argues that “ for those of us who hope to protect and extend our multiracial democracy … we ignore this white nationalist movement at our own peril . ”
How did you get started monitoring and investigating these movements ?
LZ : I came to the age of social consciousness when the black freedom movement was very strong and civil rights were high on the national agenda .
I was taken by the notion , articulated during the mid-1960s , that white people should focus on organizing other white people to oppose racism .
As a grassroots activist that idea stayed with me .
In 1970 , I started doing anti-racist work with impoverished working class young white people who had previously been at odds with poor black people living virtually in the same neighborhood .
For thirteen years I worked as a welder , an iron worker , and on assembly lines .
Around 1978 , I noticed that Klan and neo -Nazi activity had picked up , and so it was my interest in racism in general that led me to research and write about the white supremacy movement .
Between 1985 and 1994 , I was the research director at the Center for Democratic Renewal ( formerly the National Anti-Klan Network ) .
Why did you decide to write Blood and Politics ?
It became apparent to me that much of the received wisdom about white supremacists was simply wrong .
And I wanted to write a book that did not just say what I thought was correct , but I wanted to show it through specific characters , scenes of action and analysis .
These white - ists are not just a bunch of uneducated bumpkins down on their economic luck .
Instead , they are demographically much like the rest of white Americans , working class and middle class with a significant stratum of middle class professionals — professors , lawyers , chiropractors , etc . — as their leaders .
And , these are not a string of disconnected organizations sharing only a common set of hatreds .
Rather , this is a single movement , with a common set of leaders and interlocking memberships that hold a complete and sometimes sophisticated ideology .
Further , the white nationalist movement today is organized around the notion that the power of whites to control government and social policy has already been overthrown by people of color and Jews , rather unlike the Klan of the 1960s which sought to defend a system of racial apartheid in the South .
How do the religious beliefs of the movement ’s different constituencies — the Christian patriots , neo-Confederates , survivalists , white power skinheads , Holocaust deniers , scientific racists , and others — manifest themselves ?
For some , religion is simply a way of expressing group identity .
That is most obviously true among the pagans and Odinists in the skinhead scene , where the invocation of the old Norse gods is not about theology or even ethics , but about style and promoting their subculture .
In a similar sense , there are neo-Confederates and white nationalists who believe that “ Christian - ness ” is one aspect of their Western civilization — along with respect for tradition , authority , and whites - only citizenship rights .
For this wing of the movement , best exemplified in my book by a now - deceased Washington Times columnist Sam Francis , opposition to abortion is less a theological imperative and more a program plank alongside support for gun rights and opposition to immigration .
Then there are the so - called Christian patriots and Posse Comitatus - types for whom a specific theological strain known as “ Christian Identity ” defines their notions of themselves as white people , and their ideas of national identity and governmental power .
They hold Bible camp retreats for families where they teach each other how to live and what to believe .
They also promote their belief that the United States is a white Christian republic rather than a multiracial democracy .
And in a number of cases they turn their conviction that white Christians have superior civil and political rights — over those they deem “ Fourteenth Amendment ” citizens ( everybody else ) — into fraudulent schemes with fake money .
In other instances , they establish “ Christian ” courts and militia groups that act as if they are legitimate arms of “ lawful ” government .
In this belief system , whites from northern Europe — the Anglo - Saxon , Celtic , Teutonic and Lombard peoples — are the real descendents of the biblical people of Israel .
As such , Jews are fakes and considered either satanic by nature or Satan himself incarnate .
In this schema , black people and other people of color are considered “ pre-Adamic , ” that is before Adam : not fully human in the way white people are .
In this telling , interracial marriage is a sin akin to bestiality , and the presence of Jews in their Christian society is a crime against their God .
While such ideas may seem ridiculous on their face , Christian Identity followers derive their entire belief system from their Bible .
What are the differences between the beliefs of these groups and those of the Christian Right ?
Much like the Christian right types , Identity believers oppose abortion and homosexuality as violations of what they deem to be God ’s Law .
Similarly , they view women ’s role in the family and society as subordinate to men .
They also support prayer in school and oppose secularism in society .
But Christian Identity is much more forthright in its anti-Semitism and racism .
They are decidedly not “ Christian Zionists , ” and do not have an eschatology , or theory of the End Times , with Israel at its center .
In fact , they tend to call themselves “ End Times Overcomers , ” and believe the final conflict is a race war that they win .
And Christian Identity has a much more highly defined theory of Satan .
Explain the Christian Identity theory of the Devil .
Actually they have two competing theories of Satan and Jews .
In one case , they believe that the snake in the Garden of Eden was Satan , and that he impregnated Eve , and that Cain was not only Satan ’s offspring , but that Jews are descendants of Cain , and Satan incarnate .
In a second case , they believe that Satan worked through Esau , and that the Jews are descendants of Esau ( Edomites ) and do the Devil ’s work here on Earth .
Blood and Politics details this belief system and its implications , and even readers already vaguely familiar with the ideas of Christian Identity will find this discussion helpful .
Indeed , it is my argument that without a proper understanding of these devil theories , the average person can not actually understand what Christian Identity is about .
Why do you describe this movement as “ white nationalist ” ?
Most obviously because the movement ’s foremost aspect is its regard for white skin color as a badge of national identity .
Many of the organizations and leaders look back to the Cnstitutional order prior to the Civil War , when the national - state was a whites - only republic .
Others look forward to the creation of a new white nation - state carved out of the lands of North America .
While these ideas were present in the movement from its re-inception in the mid-1970s , they only became dominant in the 1990s , after the end of the Cold War ushered in a new era .
Across the globe , nationalism became a language of opposition to the New Global Order , and racial and ethnic nationalism became more salient than its liberal civic opposition .
Books such as Blood and Belonging and Jihad vs. McWorld explored these issues globally .
In the United States , racial nationalism meant white nationalism , and the old white supremacist movement was thus transformed into 21st - century white nationalism .
You argue in the book ( and the title references it ) that white nationalists have successfully moved from the “ margins to the mainstream . ”
How did this happen ?
Through a combination of factors .
First , through the slow accretion of organizing week - in , week - out events : Klan rallies , Bible camps , survivalist and gun shows , white - power music concerts , etc. , many of which are described in my book .
Second , when David Duke won a majority of white votes while running in two Louisiana statewide elections in 1990 and 1991 , he uncovered a middle - American constituency that supported at least a portion of his national socialist ideas .
Third , a group of respected ( if not respectable ) ultra - conservatives broke with the Bush 41 - era Republican consensus during the first Persian Gulf War and headed in the white direction .
These were the Buchananites [ led by current television commentator and author Pat Buchanan ] and they helped create a realignment of forces that continues to plague us today .
How does that show itself today ?
Primarily in the anti-immigrant movement — the lobbyists , Minuteman vigilantes , and racist think tanks that support them .
It is here that the idea that the United States is or should be a “ white ” country takes on the form of a policy issue .
If you follow the discussion among anti-immigrant groups , the dominant discourse is about how the United States is becoming a “ Third World ” country because of all the brown - skinned Spanish - speaking people crossing the Rio Grande — never mind the fact that these same people have been on this side of the border ever since 1845 .
From this perspective , one of the most interesting Republican pieces of legislation languishing in Congress is a proposal to end birthright citizenship for children born in the United States to parents lacking the proper documents .
If such a measure was enacted , it would run smack dab into the Fourteenth Amendment , which guarantees birthright citizenship and equality before the law .
In this sense , the Republicans who signed onto this bill are proposing measures that the Christian patriots and Posse Comitatus - types talked about twenty - five years ago .
It is important for us to be able to connect these dots .
Now that the economy is in a severe tailspin , what are the implications for the white nationalist movement ?
Although I loathe predicting the future , I will say that in the past , hard economic times have not automatically translated into an expansion for white nationalists .
There was a growth surge during the Clinton years , for example , which were generally considered better economic conditions for middle class people .
In the past , the politics of race and nation mattered more than economic hard times .
White nationalists will support protectionist measures , and they oppose free trade in capital goods because they oppose free trade ( or open borders ) for labor .
Whether or not they gain traction by claiming that the stock market and banks are controlled by Jews depends on whether people of goodwill are able to offer a more compelling vision of change .
With Obama in the White House , I think we can expect more of the same , plus some .
Some white nationalists will focus on tending to their current base — which is not inconsiderable .
They will continue to push for secessionist - style white enclaves and might engage in militia - style violence .
Others will attempt to widen their base , and carve out a larger niche among conservative Republicans .
Without an electoral vehicle of their own , they will suffer from the vicissitudes of the Republican leadership .
Their natural base , however , will be the five percent of white voters who told pollsters last summer that they would never vote for a black person for president .
More than Rush Limbaugh will get ugly .

See the beauty of , and the ingenuity of the author in concocting such a story line with these traffic signages .
Some people have all the time in the world to put their ideas into a form .
The eighth - grade boy held out his wrists for teacher Carlos Polanco to see .
He had just explained to Polanco and his history classmates at Virgil Middle School in Koreatown why he had been absent :
He had been in the hospital after an attempt at suicide .
Polanco looked at the cuts and said they “ were weak , ” according to witness accounts in documents filed with the state .
“ Carve deeper next time , ” he was said to have told the boy .
“ Look , ” Polanco allegedly said , “ you ca n’t even kill yourself . ”
The boy ’s classmates joined in , with one advising how to cut a main artery , according to the witnesses .
“ See , ” Polanco was quoted as saying , “ even he knows how to commit suicide better than you . ”
The Los Angeles school board , citing Polanco ’s poor judgment , voted to fire him .
But Polanco , who contended that he had been misunderstood , kept his job .
A little - known review commission overruled the board , saying that although the teacher had made the statements , he had meant no harm .
It ’s remarkably difficult to fire a tenured public school teacher in California , a Times investigation has found .
The path can be laborious and labyrinthine , in some cases involving years of investigation , union grievances , administrative appeals , court challenges and re-hearings .
Not only is the process arduous , but some districts are particularly unsuccessful in navigating its complexities .
The Los Angeles Unified School District sees the majority of its appealed dismissals overturned , and its administrators are far less likely even to try firing a tenured teacher than those in other districts .
The Times reviewed every case on record in the last 15 years in which a tenured employee was fired by a California school district and formally contested the decision before a review commission : 159 in all ( not including about two dozen in which the records were destroyed ) .
The newspaper also examined court and school district records and interviewed scores of people , including principals , teachers , union officials , district administrators , parents and students .
Among the findings :
* Building a case for dismissal is so time - consuming , costly and draining for principals and administrators that many say they do n’t make the effort except in the most egregious cases .
The vast majority of firings stem from blatant misconduct , including sexual abuse , other immoral or illegal behavior , insubordination or repeated violation of rules such as showing up on time .
* Although districts generally press ahead with only the strongest cases , even these get knocked down more than a third of the time by the specially convened review panels , which have the discretion to restore teachers ’ jobs even when grounds for dismissal are proved .
* Jettisoning a teacher solely because he or she can’t teach is rare .
In 80 % of the dismissals that were upheld , classroom performance was not even a factor .
When teaching is at issue , years of effort -- and thousands of dollars -- sometimes go into rehabilitating the teacher as students suffer .
Over the three years before he was fired , one struggling math teacher in Stockton was observed 13 times by school officials , failed three year - end evaluations , was offered a more desirable assignment and joined a mentoring program as most of his ninth - grade students flunked his courses .
As a case winds its way through the system , legal costs can soar into the six figures .
Meanwhile , said Kendra Wallace , principal of Daniel Webster Middle School on Los Angeles ’ Westside , an ineffective teacher can instruct 125 to 260 students a year -- up to 1,300 in the five years she says it often takes to remove a tenured employee .
“ The hardest conversation to have is when a student comes in and looks at you and says , ‘ Can you please come teach our class ? ’ ” she said .
When coaching and other improvement efforts do n’t work , she said , “ You ’re in the position of having to look at 125 kids and just say , ‘ I ’m sorry , ’ because the process of removal is really difficult .
. . .
You ’re looking at these kids and knowing they are going to high school and they ’re not ready .
It is absolutely devastating . ”
‘ Really disheartening ’
In his first major education speech in March , President Obama called for a system that would be the “ envy of the world ” -- one that nourishes good teachers and casts out the “ bad ” ones .
“ I reject a system that rewards failure and protects a person from its consequences , ” he said .
“ We can afford nothing but the best when it comes to our children ’s teachers and the schools where they teach . ”
In many California school districts , that goal seems impossibly distant .
Laziness , apathy or poor performance often are n’t firing offenses , some school officials complain .
“ We as administrators , knowing how difficult it is , tend to make excuses for the employee , and I think in some cases , accept mediocrity , ” said L.A. Unified Supt .
Ramon C. Cortines .
Strapped districts are forced to keep tenured staffers they deem unworthy even as they must consider layoffs for less - experienced teachers , without regard to their talents .
“ It ’s really disheartening , ” said Dr. Mitchell Wong , president of Act4Education , a group of parents trying to improve school performance in West Los Angeles .
“ What message does it send to the students , to the community and to the teachers who are doing their job ? ”
Kathleen Collins , associate general counsel for L.A. Unified , explained it this way : “ Kids do n’t have a union . ”
Teachers have won strong job protections over the years , the legacy of labor battles in the early 20th century , when instructors could be fired for frivolous infractions .
Some experts say the tenure system has outlived its usefulness .
Union leaders say tenure and collective bargaining are not the problem , nor is it fair to use egregious cases to indict the entire system .
“ The union is bound by law to defend our members , and we do , ” said A.J. Duffy , president of United Teachers Los Angeles .
“ That should in no way deter the resolve of the district to do their job , which is to help failing teachers to get better , or , if they can ’t , to work to get rid of them . ”
Outspoken teachers can be victimized , union leaders say , and principals and parents sometimes take aim at people they simply do n’t like .
Teachers , they say , are entitled to a presumption of innocence .
Cynthia Acerno was a last - minute hire at an elementary magnet school in the San Diego Unified School District , according to a summary of her case by a review commission .
Though known for being strict , the district veteran had had no previous problems .
But “ vocal , politically well - connected ” parents accused her of being a “ menace , ” and started unfounded rumors that she was screaming at children , drinking and using drugs , the panel found .
Some pulled their children from her class .
“ The case against her was a cocktail of hearsay on hearsay with an ill - will chaser , ” the panel commented in its ruling in favor of Acerno , who could not be reached for comment . " . . .
Many of these scurrilous and damaging things were said in front of the children of this class by parents .
This was shameful . ”
Despite such problems , the system in California provides teachers protections that go beyond what they receive in many other states .
Teachers here can gain tenure after two years instead of three , which is common elsewhere .
Proposing changes can amount to stepping on a political third rail .
Last week , when Los Angeles school board members Marlene Canter and Tamar Galatzan introduced measures to streamline the firing process , more than an hour of debate ensued in which UTLA leaders , a state senator and fellow board members warned against hasty action and an end - run around the unions .
A milder motion was approved to create a task force to discuss the issue further .
The process has remained more or less the same for years :
The onus initially is on principals to document their case .
Their evidence must pass muster with district officials and lawyers , who decide which cases should be taken to the school board .
Once the board approves a dismissal , teachers may appeal to Commissions on Professional Competence , review panels that have final administrative authority on who gets fired or laid off in California schools .
In many other states , such appeals are handled by administrative law judges alone .
But California panels also include two educators , one appointed by the school district and the other by the employee under review .
The grounds for termination seem clear enough .
They include immorality , persistent violation of school rules , unprofessional conduct , commission of a felony or sexual harassment , unsatisfactory performance and the catchall “ evident unfitness to teach . ”
In practice , however , even the panelists can disagree on whether these grounds are met , and if met , whether they merit firing in a particular case .
Districts complain that in review hearings , where lawyers go head to head , the testimony of student witnesses is often discounted because their memories have faded , they are scared or reluctant to talk about traumatic events , or they ca n’t withstand intensive cross-examination .
But it is not uncommon for districts to sabotage themselves with technical missteps .
In Polanco ’s case , for example , L.A. Unified administrators began firing proceedings before giving him the required 45 days ’ “ notice of unprofessional conduct ” -- one factor in the commission ’s decision to overturn his firing .
And if the teacher or district is dissatisfied with the commission ’s decision , each has the right to appeal the case to superior and appellate courts , which sometimes force the panels to reconsider .
Records show that from the time principals tagged teachers for possible termination , hundreds of cases were dropped or settled -- often through district buyouts -- between 1994 and 2008 .
No specific documentation was available , however , on how each case was resolved .
Even so , the cases reviewed by The Times open a window onto the firing process from start to finish , showing many of the ways it works or does not along the way .
District struggles
L.A. Unified officials have struggled with the system more than most .
Of the 15 tenured employees on record as fighting their terminations before review commissions in the last decade and a half , nine won their jobs back .
The main reasons : Commissions did not find the district ’s evidence damning or persuasive enough .
The district wanted to fire a high school teacher who kept a stash of pornography , marijuana and vials with cocaine residue at school , but a commission balked , suggesting that firing was too harsh .
L.A. Unified officials were also unsuccessful in firing a male middle school teacher spotted lying on top of a female colleague in the metal shop , saying the district did not prove that the two were having sex .
The district fared no better in its case against elementary school special education teacher Gloria Hsi , despite allegations that included poor judgment , failing to report child abuse , yelling at and insulting children , planning lessons inadequately and failing to supervise her class .
Not a single charge was upheld .
The commission found the school ’s evaluators were unqualified because they did not have special education training .
Moreover , it said they went to the class at especially difficult periods and did n’t stay long enough .
Four years after the district began trying to fire Hsi , the case is still tied up in court , although she has been removed from the classroom .
Her lawyer declined to comment on her behalf .
The district ’s legal costs so far : $ 110,000 .
Classroom ineffectiveness is hard to prove , administrators and principals said .
“ One of the toughest things to document , ironically , is [ teachers ’ ] ability to teach , ” Wallace , the Daniel Webster principal , said .
“ It ’s an amorphous thing . ”
District officials thought they had a strong case against fourth - grade teacher Shirley Loftis , including complaints and other evidence they said dated back a decade .
According to their allegations before the commission , Loftis , 74 , failed to give directions to students , assigned homework that was n’t at the appropriate grade level and provided such inadequate supervision that students pulled down their pants or harmed one another by fighting or throwing things .
One child allegedly broke a tooth , another was hit in the head after being pushed off a chair , a third struck by a backpack .
The commission , however , sided with Loftis .
It acknowledged that she showed signs of burnout and “ would often retreat from student relationship problems rather than confront them . ”
But it said the district did not try hard enough to help her and suggested administrators find her another job -- perhaps training other teachers .
“ She ’s obviously an intelligent lady , and such a program might well succeed . ”
When the district took the case to Superior Court , lost and appealed , Loftis retired .
The district agreed to pay $ 195,000 for her attorney ’s fees .
Through her attorney , the former teacher declined to comment .
Collins , whose first case with L.A. Unified was Loftis ’ , recalled being frustrated because , although the problems allegedly had gone on many years , the district was allowed to present just four years of evidence under the state education code .
“ This is not an LAUSD story -- it is a statewide reality , ” Collins said in an e-mail .
But L.A. Unified does n’t pursue as many firings as other major districts , considering its size .
The district , which has about 30,000 tenured teachers , fires 21 a year -- well under 1 per 1,000 -- according to district statistics for the last five years .
Long Beach fires 6 per 1,000 , and San Diego fires about 2 per 1,000 .
Evidence suggests that L.A. Unified does a poor job of tracking teacher performance overall , making it tough to prove anyone is a bad apple .
A one - time study of teacher evaluations from the 2003 - 04 academic year , for instance , showed that 98.9 % of all tenured teachers were said by supervisors to have “ met standards . ”
The only categories in which a substantial percentage were said to have needed improvement concerned punctuality and attendance .
Five percent had difficulty showing up on time .
Even some teachers union representatives said they do not believe the evaluations accurately portray the quality of teacher performance .
Joshua Pechthalt , a United Teachers Los Angeles vice president , said the process is “ fraught with problems ” and results in teachers , especially young ones , not getting the guidance they need .
“ I do n’t know any workplace where 98 % of the people are doing a good job , ” Pechthalt said .
Contrition can help
In other districts , as well , review panels found officials to be too harsh , or determined that their firings were n’t supported by “ the preponderance of evidence ” -- a standard also used in most civil cases .
San Diego Unified administrators tried and failed to fire an elementary school reading teacher who one district evaluator said could not follow a lesson plan .
“ It was evident . . . that the teacher was likely not the most gifted or skilled , ” the commission said in reversing the dismissal .
“ However , her performance was not ‘ unsatisfactory ’ simply because she was not the most capable or the quickest study . ”
In many instances , an apology -- or at least an acknowledgment of error -- went a long way .
One teacher and coach from the San Ramon Valley Unified School District in the Bay Area was contrite after being accused of leering at teenage swimmers , making sexually charged remarks to students and instructing girls to “ bark like seals ” while they did push - ups .
“ There is good reason to believe the respondent ’s conduct will not recur , ” the commission wrote of the teacher , who had worked in the district for 24 years .
In several cases , the commissions were torn .
Ronald Hafner , a choral teacher with a long history of favorable evaluations in the Lake Elsinore Unified School District , was accused of serious misconduct during a trip he led with 24 students and five chaperons to Las Vegas .
According to a commission summary , the district accused him of drinking alcohol in front of students , making offensive remarks -- such as suggesting that girls in his charge should apply to be strippers -- and touching a female student inappropriately .
Hafner disputed many of the accusations and argued in the hearing that he was the subject of a “ witch hunt ” by fundamentalist Christians .
He could not be reached for comment .
In 2005 , the panel found that Hafner ’s behavior was “ shameful and inexcusable and demonstrates a severe lapse of judgment . ”
But the teacher kept his job , because the district ’s allegations were not fully proved and did not warrant dismissal , according to the panel majority .
A middle school assistant principal on the panel wrote a sharp dissent :
“ As a parent I would not allow my child in his classroom .
As a colleague I cannot condone his conduct or attitude .
As an administrator I could not trust him beyond my sight . ”
Too daunted to try
Faced with such frustrations , many principals do n’t even attempt to navigate the firing process .
Letting a bad teacher slide or making him someone else ’s problem is far easier than trying to document his failings , some say .
The prospect of union grievances , and a protracted battle against labor representatives and attorneys , makes the endeavor even less appealing .
Joseph Walker , a former principal of Grant High School in Van Nuys , was sued by a special education teacher whom he tried to dismiss for alleged repeated sexual harassment .
A civil jury sided with Walker -- but the review commission decided the teacher should n’t be fired .
The case , now in the courts , has dragged on seven years .
Confronting uphill battles like this , Walker said : “ You ’re not going to fire someone who ’s not doing their job .
And if you have someone who ’s done something really egregious , there ’s only a 50 - 50 chance that you can fire them . ”
Walker is now principal of Discovery Charter Preparatory Academy in Pacoima , where he said he had fired three teachers so far this year .
None were fired during his three years as head of Grant .
The difference :
His school ’s teachers are not unionized and can be fired at will .
On regular public school campuses , some principals simply pass problem teachers from school to school .
Judith Perez , principal of Hancock Park Elementary School in Los Angeles , recalled a situation in which a fellow principal had one more teacher than he needed .
Under union rules , the teacher with the least seniority was to be transferred .
Instead , the principal pushed out a poorly performing veteran by threatening to make her life miserable with frequent observations of her classes , Perez said .
The teacher ended up at Perez ’s school .
When Perez called the principal for information , he quickly apologized .
“ I ’m so sorry , ” she recalled him saying .
Perez soon found out why , concluding that her new teacher was “ a total incompetent .
. . .
She had no idea how to conduct a lesson in reading or math . ”
Perez committed herself to either making this teacher improve or forcing her out .
“ I was a [ teachers ] union leader , ” Perez said .
“ I believe in teachers ’ rights and protections .
. . .
But my bottom line is I ’m in this profession for children .
. . .
Basically , I dedicated my year to getting rid of this teacher . ”
She kept a detailed diary , conducted a series of formal meetings with the teacher and her union representatives -- all called for under the teachers ’ contract -- and finally persuaded the woman to quit .
A principal at Le Conte Middle School in Hollywood got a very different result .
To Linda Del Cueto , David Daniel ’s physical education class looked more like recess than an instructional period .
Half or more of the students refused to change into gym clothes , and it sometimes took Daniel more than 15 minutes to get enough control to take roll , administrators reported in commission and court documents .
Del Cueto and her assistants repeatedly observed Daniel , counseled him and offered help , compiling meticulous records over three years .
But the commission sided with Daniel , saying the evaluations by Del Cueto and her staff were so frequent that they undermined Daniel with his students .
“ Students at the middle school level are very perceptive , ” the commission wrote .
“ This atmosphere led students to believe that they could openly defy [ him ] . ”
Essentially , the administrator was faulted for making too many observations .
“ When that decision came out , ” Del Cueto said in an interview , “ I really thought it was a classic example of damned if you do , damned if you do n’t . ”
Daniel agreed to resign from the district in late 2006 .
As part of a settlement , the district agreed to pay lifetime health benefits and $ 50,000 in attorney fees .
Daniel ’s attorney said the former teacher did not want to comment .
In the Polanco case , as in Daniel ’s , there was no shortage of documentation .
The account of the history teacher ’s interactions with the apparently suicidal boy came primarily from his teaching assistant , who wrote a detailed letter to administrators .
In addition , students submitted written statements that were introduced at Polanco ’s hearing .
One student wrote that Polanco had told the boy that he “ should cut himself more bigger next time ( cuts himself like a little wussy ) . ”
Another wrote : “ Polanco tell [ him ] that he should cut himself with something sharper . ”
A third wrote that “ Polanco would call [ him ] ‘ the cutter kid ’ and would sometimes call [ him ] stupid . ”
Polanco testified at his hearing that he had not made these remarks and instead had told the boy -- who was not named in the commission documents -- that he was glad his suicide attempt had not succeeded .
The documents suggest he had showed concern about the boy , asking a counselor about his well - being .
“ Knowing that I caused pain , whether I did it on purpose or without knowing it , it ’s a weight on my shoulders because I ’m responsible [ for ] what happened in my classroom , ” testified Polanco , who declined to comment for this story .
The commission accepted the accounts of the teacher ’s aide and students as accurate .
But it did not see the statements of Polanco , an otherwise well - regarded teacher and former union representative , as goading or callous .
The teacher , the panel concluded , was trying “ to defuse the awkward situation . ”
The Times could not determine what became of the boy .
As for Polanco , he now teaches at East Valley High School in North Hollywood .

A dinosaur bone buried for 80 million years has yielded a mix of proteins and microstructures resembling cells .
The finding is important because it should resolve doubts about a previous report that also claimed to have extracted dino tissue from fossils .
Proteins such as collagen are far more durable than DNA , but they had not been expected to last the 65 million years since the dinosaurs died out .
So palaeontologist Mary Schweitzer of North Carolina State University attracted wide attention when she reported finding first soft tissue and later collagen from a Tyrannosaurus rex leg bone that was intact until it was broken during excavation .
Yet critics said the extraordinary claim required extraordinary evidence , and asked for protein sequences , better handling of samples to prevent contamination , and confirmation analyses from other laboratories .
So Schweitzer took a look at the pristine leg bone of a plant - eating hadrosaur that had been encased in sandstone for 80 million years .
She and colleagues exhaustively tested the sample , sequencing the proteins they found with a new and better mass spectrometer and sending samples to two other labs for verification .
Now they report recovering not just collagen – which conveys little evolutionary information because it is the same in almost all animals – but also haemoglobin , elastin and laminin , as well as cell - like structures resembling blood and bone cells .
The proteins should reveal more about dinosaur evolution because they vary much more between species .

The home page is nearly blank .
At the center , just below a colorful logo , you 'll find an empty data field .
Type in a phrase , hit Return , and knowledge appears .
No , it 's not Google .
It 's Wolfram| Alpha , named after its creator , Stephen Wolfram , a 49 - year - old former particle physics prodigy who became bewitched by the potential of computers .
He invented a powerful computational software program ( Mathematica ) , built a company around it ( Wolfram Research ) , and wrote a massive book ( A New Kind of Science ) that claims to redefine the universe itself in terms of computation .
So when Wolfram asked me , " Do you want a sneak preview of my most ambitious and complex project yet ? " he had me at " Do . "
The product of four years of development , Alpha is an engine for answers .
Its ambition is to delve into " all the knowledge in the world , " Wolfram says , to find and calculate information .
Though Alpha 's interface evokes Google ― whose co-founder Sergey Brin once spent a summer interning for Wolfram ― it's more like the anti-Google .
Type in a query for a statistic , a profile of a country or company , the average airspeed of a sparrow ― and instead of a series of results that may or may not provide the answer you 're looking for , you get a mini dossier on the subject compiled in real time that , ideally , nails the exact thing you want to know .
It 's like having a squad of Cambridge mathematicians and CIA analysts inside your browser .
Type in " Pluto " and Alpha calculates the dwarf planet 's distance from Earth at that very instant .
Bang out a series of letters like " ACTCGTC " and Alpha recognizes it as genetic code and tells you what strand of DNA that particular gene lives on and what we know about it .
Wolfram has licensed ― or created ― a whole library of databases and massaged them so the information is pliable .
( To date , they include Wikipedia , the US Census , and " about nine - tenths of what you 'd see on the main shelves of a reference library , " he says . )
Combined with the near - ­magical abilities of Mathematica , Alpha is a powerful computational engine that can effortlessly answer queries that no one has asked of a search engine before .
Consider a question like " How many Nobel Prize winners were born under a full moon ? "
Google would find the answer only if someone had previously gone through the whole list , matched the birthplace of each laureate with a table of lunar phases , and posted the results .
Wolfram says his engine would have no problem doing this on the fly .
" Alpha makes it easy for the typical person to answer anything quantitatively , " he asserts .
Wolfram needs some prodding before he talks about the business model .
" Plan A is to get this out , " he says .
" Maybe it will be a giant piece of philanthropy . "
On the other hand , he adds , " we 're happy to license this . "
He thinks Alpha would be welcome inside applications , on mobile devices , and in a generalized search engine .
Wolfram has already shown Alpha to former intern Brin and thinks that it could make sense to have the engine running behind the scenes in Google searches .
Another possible source of revenue : licensing data­bases .
In corralling information for Alpha , Wolfram has frequently been disappointed in the quality of the source material , and he plans to create hundreds of new databases in areas ranging from nutrition to tidal tables .
All of this is only stage one of the project , says Wolfram , who proceeds to get to the " crazy stuff . "
Uh , like what ?
" We ’ll actually be able to simulate in real time based on descriptions .
The next question is , can we invent things on the fly , create things that have never been created before , in real time ? "
This venture is so edgy that even the hyperbolically confident Wolfram is hedging a bit .
" There are many things that could go horribly wrong , " he says .
Indeed , weeks before its planned launch , the product is still rough , lacking both integrated natural language processing and sufficient data to deliver the Information Singularity that Wolfram envisions .
But once Alpha tells you how many Nobel Prize winners were born under a full moon , you ’ll know that we 've moved one step up the evolutionary ladder of knowledge .

Love him or loathe him , Cristiano Ronaldo was by far the most glamorous player in the Premiership , embodying the souped up Saint Tropez playboy look to a point that rivals George Michael and Andrew Ridgeley circa Club Tropicana .

Then there 's the James Dean lip and quiff to consider .
Despite – or even because of – the overload of Hawaiian Tropic , the stonewash denim worn long before it came back into fashion and without a trace of irony , and the crucifix that would dwarf the average medallion , he still succeeds in setting hearts – male and female – aflutter like no other .

Admittedly , competition is far from fierce .
Ask a wannabe WAG which footballer she 'd most like to see and be seen with and she 's unlikely to say Tevez ( bad hair , worse eyebrows ) , Crouch ( weedy by any other name ) , or Rooney ( plain simian , Coleen can keep him ) .
Instead , Ronaldo is the obvious – the only – respectable option .
At just 24 , he is the quintessential peacock male and not since George Best has any other footballer come close .
The trouble is , he 's already outgrown the British social scene .
Only Ronaldo could be spotted the night before his £ 80 m transfer from Manchester United to Real Madrid was announced , hanging out with Paris and Nicky Hilton in Hollywood .
On a superficial level – the tan the colour of gravy and dress sense that may not unreasonably be described as disastrous makes him all the more appealing – there 's so much a woman of style could do for him .
After all , he has so much to learn .
Then there 's the fact he behaves like football 's biggest baby bringing out the protective mother in anyone with half a heart – women the world over yearn to look after Ronaldo the way David Seaman , for example , looks like he might look after them .
Yawn .

Ronaldo 's unswerving petulance , his tantrums and bare - faced cheek , not to mention the fact that ( almost unbelievably ) he wears his baseball cap back to front makes for a heady formula that is well - nigh impossible to resist .
His status as a bad boy has done him no harm either – from setting up the opposition and winking at the sidelines when he succeeds in so doing to smashing up Ferraris .
Ronaldo is modern day football 's rebel .
And today they are few and far between .
To describe Ronaldo as attention seeking both on and off duty would be an understatement .
The " I 'm too sexy for it " ease with which he strips off his shirt is , of course , nothing short of legendary .
Add to that the endless photographs of him in the briefest of swim shorts and outrageously camp skin - tight T - shirts , and this is clearly no shrinking violet .
Ronaldo is a narcissist , but there are those who might argue he has quite a lot to be narcissistic about .
Phenomenal musculature aside – and more seriously – Ronaldo has for some time been the only footballer in Britain who might be described as a genius .
Certainly , he is among the most exciting and gifted players of his time .
He may be quite shockingly vain and even more badly behaved but he is also an athlete par excellence and that , inevitably , gives him sex appeal in spades .
Truth to tell , more recently , Ronaldo 's formerly lithe torso has thickened somewhat in typically Mediterranean style , but to quibble over such minor inadequacies would simply be churlish .
Whichever way one looks at it , this is the greatest personality British football has seen for decades .
Match Of The Day will never be the same .

I ’ve always wished I could document my own code with Haddock even when it is n’t exported .
Today I was exploring the Haddock code - base ( which contains a fair number of Haddock - comments ) and wanted an easier way to read it .
First I tried `cabal haddock –hyperlink - source` .
It only documented Distribution .
Haddock because that ’s the only exported module of the library !
`cabal haddock - v` told me that it was passing `–hide=all the other - modules` to haddock , which I could n’t reverse with `cabal –haddock - option` .
The only way to “ fix ” that was to hack haddock.cabal so that all modules appear under an `exported - modules : ` clause ( which is only allowed under `library` , not `executable` , so I had to spuriously merge the executable section into the library section ) .
Yay !
Then I had to remove Haddock .
Types ’s {-# OPTIONS_HADDOCK hide #-} which was causing a bit of trouble .
Adding –haddock - option=–ignore - all - exports includes non-exported functions in the documentation , which can be helpful or unhelpful .
I wish it had a mode to include the un-exported stuff * after * all the exported stuff , with a clear separation .
As a side note , –ignore - all - exports also “ breaks ” docs of Distribution .
Haddock and any module that re-exports things from other modules , currently …
HsColour is pretty cool too , but it would be even cooler if it hyperlinked all the identifiers in the source , like Haddock does … hmm .
EDIT : I forgot to attach my actual silly patch to Haddock .
Ca n’t find out how to get WordPress to let me upload it either .
oh well , here it is : gee , I ca n’t even get it to turn into a link , here on Linux ? : http://isaac.cedarswampstudios.org/2009/isaacs-silly-haddock-self-doc.dpatch

The recent stream of stories about newspapers charging for online access to their stories have largely focused on the Murdoch empire - the Wall Street Journal , the Sun , the Times and others .
The voices from elsewhere around the newspaper industry have been considerably quieter : the Guardian 's Carolyn McCall suggesting the possibility of charging for specialist news or Arthur Sulzberger of the New York Times telling shareholders that his title is " exploring a new online financial strategy " .
That sounds dangerously vague - but more details on the NYT 's plans emerged yesterday after talking points from a staff strategy meeting were published on Twitter .
The rough details of the meeting - held for news staff at the company 's headquarters in Manhattan - have come to light thanks to a series of Twitter messages from Jennifer 8 Lee , a metro reporter at the newspaper .
In the messages , she described a sequence of ideas and points from senior newspaper executives , such as the fact that the company is looking again at the lessons learned from Times Select - its ill - fated attempt to charge for opinion columns .
Other points of interest include :
• That senior executives are considering introducing tiered memberships , modelled on the credit card industry ( silver , gold , platinum and so on ) , which would give paying different levels of access to information on the New York Times website .
They are also " rethinking " what level of access existing print subscribers should get as a matter of course .
• That the company is also exploring ways to recoup money from those who profit from infringing its copyright .
At the moment NYT lawyers take one of two approaches to copyright infringement : either letting it ride , or choosing to " squash " infringers " like mosquitoes " .
They are now exploring a third way , which would involve convincing advertising providers – such as Google – to hand over a proportion of the profits made by infringing websites straight to the copyright holder .
• It is also setting great store by its application programming interface , or API – the system by which third party software developers can create services that use New York Times stories and content ( the Guardian also runs a similar program , Open Platform ) .
Senior managers expect the system to increase activity drastically – eventually bringing as many as 2.5 times more viewers to NYT stories than the NYTimes.com website itself .
By charging for the API service ( although it is not clear how ) the title hopes to tap into " significant revenue streams " .
Much of the information has already been made public by Sulzberger , and in stories about the company 's strategy to fight off the recession and the crumbling of the newspaper industry .
But , given that it was staff who were made privy to this information and not shareholders , there was important detail here - and the approach towards Times Select remains one of the most intriguing .
Widely regarded by many as an attempt to impose a pay barrier on the least valuable part of the NYT 's output , it appears executives are less critical about their decision with hindsight .
According to Lee , staff were told that " rollout was not so great at time of integration , " and " taking away something that was free annoyed the blogosphere " .
The implication is that Times Select was more of a failure of marketing - because it was rolled out badly and annoyed bloggers - rather than a strategic error .
Whether that is the best lesson to have learned is up for debate .
Similarly , the company admits that its idea about tiers of membership is problematic , but that although it is a strategy that represents " the highest risk " it also offer the " most potential reward " .
What is clear from Lee 's messages , however , is that the company – at least in this forum – remains bullish .
It " significantly outperformed the market with display advertising " ( even if nobody will publish figures to that effect ) and that the company 's rivals " make a lot less money than we do " .
Despite evidence to the contrary , the NYT still believes in itself , and in its ability to navigate its way out of this economic swamp .

Is - ought problem is one that got articulated by the Scottish Historian named David Hume .
It states that several writers make certain claims regarding what ought to be depending on the statement of what is .
He discovered that there is a huge difference between normative or prescriptive statements and positive statements .
It also helped one understand that it is quite obvious the way one can transcend from descriptive statements to prescriptive statements .
This problem is also referred to as Hume ’s guillotine .
This view was also shared by Moore ’s argument which had the intention of refuting whatsoever identification of moral properties along with natural properties
Is ought fallacy
The is - ought fallacy is one that happens when an assumption is made on the premise that since things are in a particular way , they have to be that way .
It can also be predicated on the fact that since something is not happening at the moment , it should n’t occur .
It , therefore , suffices to say that the status quo must be maintained .
It simply attempts to get a moral angle from the description of an occurrence .
The difference which exists between ought statements and is statements when coupled with Hume ’s fork makes ought to statement a questionable validity .
For instance , Hume ’s fork is of the view that all knowledge items are predicated upon definitions or logic or perhaps on observation .
This fallacy attempts to put great value on facts as against moral views .
It should be noted that just because something is a certain way does not imply that it has to be that way .
This on its own maybe one of the most complex fallacies to identify .
Several examples buttresses this fact .
For instance , just because murder is a common thing among human beings does not suggest that it ought to be in existence .
What Is The Implication Of This Problem ?
Ethical naturalists believe that moral truths exist and that the value of their truth is proportional to certain facts about physical reality .
Several contemporary naturalist philosophers do not see any barrier in getting ought from “ is ” due to the belief that one can do it whenever a goal - directed behavior is analyzed .
They think .
The is - ought fallacy of morality and science
Since G.E. Moore and David Hume came up with the problem that exists between prescriptive problems and descriptive statements , the majority of scientists have given up the high - ground required to determine human morals , values , and ethics to the philosophers .
They concluded that science can only talk about how things are and not how they should be .
This in itself is a big error !
We indeed need to be concerned about the fact that scientists appear to have given up on the quest to determine wrong and right .
This is while also determining which of the values lead to human progress .
This is even so because the research tools needed for implementing it are coming up via certain tools such as experimental ethics , evolutionary ethics , and neuro - ethics .
It , therefore , suffices to say that the naturalistic fallacy is a fallacy in itself .
Values and morals have to based upon the way via which things are to create the best system for humans to flourish .
It is important to allow science to take charge and take us to a point where scientists can at least have a say regarding how we ought to live .
To achieve this , it is imperative to begin from the micro-components of society because the organism is the main target of social evolution and natural selection .
It , therefore , suffices to say that the core basis for establishing morals and values is the progress made by the individual organism .
It thus means that the goal of the science of morality should be to determine the conditions in which people live .
Also , the constitutions in our societies should be predicated upon the laws of human nature and science is perhaps the best way to understand our nature as humans .
What Are The Factors That Necessitate The Involvement Of Science ?
From the theory of evolution , we understand that the concept of reciprocal altruism which states that “ scratch my back , I will scratch your back ” is universal .
What this means is that people are only generous because they believe they will get something in return .
Also , we understand via behavior genetics that about 50 percent of the variance which exists with people in terms of personality , temperament and other preferences is often inherited .
Furthermore , we understand from the evolution of psychology that the concepts of moralistic punishments are universal .
It simply means that if you do not scratch my back , I will punish you .
People do not always have tolerance for people who seem to only receive but never give .
It is also understood from the behavioral game theory regarding between - group enmity and within - group amity the concept of trust .
Finally , regarding the concept of behavioral economics , we understand that the need for people to trade with themselves creates trust among different people .
This , in turn , reduces the tendency for enmity among people .
This by extension leads to increased prosperity among the people .
The view of discourse ethics
Advocates of discus ethics think that the concept of discourse is one that suggests some elements of “ ought . ”
This means certain presuppositions which are often adopted by the participants in discourse .
It is therefore argued that it is quite unreasonable to push an ethical position simply on the premise of ought - is problem which is often a contradiction of these assumptions .
Moral ought
A person may be seen as good if there is an inherent purpose among people .
Several ethical systems adopt this .
This is applicable for some forms of moral realism which indicates that something may be wrong regardless of what everyone else thinks .
An ethical realist may believe that human beings were formed for the supreme purpose of serving God .
This is especially so when they are ethical non-naturalists .
Also , if an ethical realist is instead an ethical naturalist they may think that human beings have changed and as such chase after some evolutionary concepts .
It should , however , be indicated that not every moral system is affected by the human purpose of telos .
The reason for this is that it is not often obvious that human beings have any form of natural purpose or what such a purpose may be .
Even though several scientists know about teleonomy , not many philosophers are open to the idea so that they can prevent naturalistic fallacy .
“ Ought ” that are dependent on goals often encounter problems even when they do not appeal to an in - built human purpose .
You may want to consider a case of someone who does not have any desire to do well .
And in most instances , doing well is synonymous with washing your hands .
It then appears that one morally ought to wash their hands .
The main challenge with moral philosophy can be traced to what happens when a person does not want to be good .
Therefore , in what sense do we ought to hold the said goal of being perceived as good .
How will one be rationally required to view well as a value or even chase after it ?
Institution - based facts
Based on insight by John Searle , there was an attempt to explain the simple act of placing one under an obligation because of a promise .
An in such a situation , the obligation is tantamount to ought .
This school of thought is still widely been debate and to give a definite response , Searle has further worked on the concept of institutional facts .
For instance , the idea that a building is a bank and paper is money is largely predicated upon the overall perception of those institutions and the value they hold .
Moral realism
The moral realist position was adopted by Phillippa Foot who criticized the idea that when a certain evaluation gets superposed on the fact that there must be a committal from a different angle .
What she does is to bring about via an analogy the implications of adopting the term “ injury . ”
It is of the view that there has to be a form of impairment .
Conclusion
Some of the time , this fallacy may even be taken to be the same as to appeal to tradition .
This is the one that is based upon the premise that such a thing had been done before and as such should be done again .
Several unique things make this fallacy worthy of discourse among philosophers and other professionals alike .
It is , however , pertinent to note that the different angles it presents are such that create more opportunities for discovery .
May Savidge : The Woman Who Moved Her House 100 Miles and Spent Her Life Rebuilding It
When city council told May Savidge that her home would be destroyed to make way for a new road , this determined woman decided to take the construction materials and rebuild her historic home — by hand — 100 miles away .
Home renovations are never as easy as they seem on HGTV .
The moment you tackle one project , there ’s always another , even bigger one that you wo n’t be able to rest until you finish .
But for those of us who find ourselves constantly surrounded by paint tins , brushes , and stacks of tiles just waiting to be put into place , take heart : no matter how major your project might seem , it ca n’t compare with the scope of May Savidge ’s DIY home makeover .
For this one - of - a- kind woman from Great Britain , it was n’t so much a makeover as a move - over , in fact :
When city council members in her town , Hertfordshire , told her that her 400 - year - old home would soon be demolished to make way for a new road , she refused to see the house that she had lovingly restored be destroyed .
Instead , she wrote the city council a letter : “ If this little house is really in the way , I would rather move it and re-erect it than see it destroyed , ” she said .
When the city council refused to bend , Savidge made good on her vow .
As a bulldozer rolled over her home , she walked among the debris with a permanent marker , numbering every wooden beam and pane of glass to mark where they should go when the home was reassembled .
Each night after the demolishers left , Savidge slept inside the remains of the house , despite the bitter cold .
Savidge decided to relocate her home in a coastal town 100 miles away , Wells - next - to - the - Sea in Norfolk , and sent a truck on eleven delivery runs to carry all of the building materials there .
Rather than hiring a construction crew to rebuild her beautiful house , though , Savidge then 58 , decided to take on the entire project by herself , sleeping in a trailer on the property while working on construction .
It was eight years before Savidge could finally move back into her home , though she continued to work on improvements every day .
By the time she passed away at age 81 in 1993 , “ the walls were up and the roof was on , but the place was little more than a shaky shell , ” Savidge ’s niece , Christine Adams , said in her book , A Lifetime in the Building : The Extraordinary Story of May Savidge and the House She Moved .
Adams inherited the home upon her aunt ’s death , and was surprised to find decades ’ worth of memorabilia , including service medals from Savidge ’s wartime nursing days , hundreds of diaries , and correspondence between Savidge and a man that she had loved , who eventually left her for another woman .
The house , unfinished as it was , contained the woman ’s entire life history .
Adams knew she must pay tribute to her aunt by transforming the home into the beautiful mansion her aunt had worked so hard to build .
Adams soon sold much of her aunt ’s memorabilia , which paid for the final touches in the home ’s restoration .
Now , Adams lives in the stunning home and runs it as a bed - and - breakfast , where guests can stop in to spend a night in the magnificent home that a determined woman spent her entire life creating .

I ’d been working for the bank for about five weeks when I woke up on the balcony of a ski resort in the Swiss Alps .
It was midnight and I was drunk .
One of my fellow management trainees was urinating onto the skylight of the lobby below us ; another was hurling wine glasses into the courtyard .
Behind us , someone had stolen the hotel ’s shoe - polishing machine and carried it into the room ; there were a line of drunken bankers waiting to use it .
Half of them were dripping wet , having gone swimming in all their clothes and been too drunk to remember to take them off .
It took several more weeks of this before the bank considered us properly trained .
I did n’t fit the typical profile of a trader .
I was an English major working on a novel at night .
Most everyone else was a maths or economics major , most everyone else had relatives or family in banking .
I ’d spent a year walking around studying flashcards with maths problems , multiplying random licence - plate numbers in my head , just to prepare for the interviews .
I memorised The Wall Street Journal every morning .
I did n’t care what I had to do .
At Cornell University it was well known that after five years on Wall Street , you could expect to be making half a million a year in salary and bonus ; after 10 years you could expect a million or more .
I had 60 grand of university debt and my parents had no retirement .
I needed that money .

UBS apparently thought pretty highly of me , because despite my lack of a financial background , they put me onto the derivatives trading desk .
This was a coveted spot - the derivatives traders were viewed as the elite - the baddest of the bad - asses .
Derivatives are financial contracts , the value of which is based on ( derives from ) something else , say the price of a stock or the price of a bushel of wheat .
They were originally created to provide stability and allocate capital to industry , farmers , and the like , and , for a long time , derivatives allowed businesses to eliminate certain financial risks , say in currency , which provided stability to the business , its management , and its workers .
If you were a factory worker back in the day , you benefited from your employer ’s use of derivatives to smooth out their cash flows during the year , hedge against the risk of selling goods abroad .
For about a hundred years , derivatives were a sort of lubricant in the world financial machine .
By the time I arrived on Wall Street in 1999 , the link between derivatives and the real world had broken down .
Instead of being used to reduce risk , 95 per cent of their use was speculation - a polite term for gambling .
And leveraging - which means taking a large amount of risk for a small amount of money .
So while derivatives , and the financial industry more broadly , had started out serving industry , by the late 1990s the situation had reversed .
The Market had become a near - religious force in our culture ; industry , society , and politicians all bowed down to it .
It was pretty clear what The Market did n’t like .
It did n’t like being closely watched .
It did n’t like rules that governed its behaviour .
It did n’t like goods produced in First - World countries or workers who made high wages , with the notable exception of financial sector employees .
This last point bothered me especially .
I ’d grown up in a working class neighborhood in Baltimore , a place hard hit by the offshoring of numerous heavy industries - steel , textile , shipbuilding .
My parents were n’t mill workers - they were recovering hippies - but we were always struggling for money and so my brother and I lived a sort of split existence .
Inside the house , I read constantly and my brother listened to classical music .
Outside the house , like all the other kids in the neighbourhood , we got into fights and caused trouble .
At 16 I dropped out of school and spent five years working as a bicycle mechanic and volunteering in a Trauma Centre before ultimately deciding to go to university .
I earned high marks at various local colleges and eventually , after three tries at applying to the Ivy League , I got into Cornell .
My first job out of Cornell was on the trading floor at UBS .
So when news would hit the wire about an American company closing a domestic factory , I felt a good deal of conflict as I watched the company ’s stock price go up as a result .
Those sorts of factory closings had ruined my neighbourhood , my city , and many of the people I ’d grown up with .
I was not alone in this feeling , but there were not many of us , either .
One of my British friends from the training programme , who later became a currency trader , once told me : “ I mean Christ , mate , every time they close a factory in Wales the goddamn market goes up .
The whole system ’s a little fucked , do n’t you think ? ”
And of course it was .
The question was how to deal with it .
The easiest thing was buy into the system , convince ourselves that there was no other way to live .
A few semesters worth of economics classes certainly helped ; the in - house economics classes taught by the bank helped even more .
The financial markets operate on the principle that , at our core , we ’re all basically shit : selfish , self - interested creatures .
There ’s a whole branch of economics devoted to proving that if you help someone , say , run in front of a speeding train to push another person out of the way , you are actually acting out of self - interest , not altruism ; that what most of us would consider humankind ’s cardinal virtues - love , honor , compassion - do not actually exist .
The idea that we ’re nothing more than selfish animals is an attractive philosophy to a person pulling down a few million dollars a year .
It is a philosophy that negates guilt .
The guilty feeling a normal person gets while visiting a Third World country is the same feeling a senior investment banker gets when they see a working class neighborhood in Birmingham or Philadelphia .
When your paycheck could cover the salaries of a few hundred nurses or teachers , you need some explanation for why that ’s okay .
The only one that really works is that life is a pure meritocracy .
That whether rich or poor , we ’re all getting what we deserve .

The fact is , I became pretty good at making this argument myself .
Until a roommate of mine , a guy named Mark Brewin , asked me : “ So is that really what you want to be ?
A selfish animal ? ” “ It ’s not like we have a choice , ” I said .
“ No , ” he said .
“ You always have a choice .
It ’s just easier to pretend that you do n’t . ”
Ouch .
The strangest thing was , this thing I ’d wanted for so long , this chance to become wealthy , was causing me more internal conflict than anything I ’d ever done .
I began writing a second novel , about a kid from the provinces who comes to Wall Street and is both drawn in and horrified by the culture of excess .
I understood it well .
I put on 45 pounds in my first year at the bank , and , as you might guess , it was not from eating McDonalds .
Occasionally I ate stuff like sushi , but mostly it was steak .
We went to the good places like Sparks , Peter Luger ’s , and the Strip House .
We tended to look down on chains like Morton ’s and Ruth ’s Chris - they were for car dealers or stock brokers , not traders .
Regardless of where we ate , we ate in quantity .
My standard strategy was to order half a dozen appetisers , plus a steak and lobster , plus a few desserts and much wine as I could drink , as long it was under a few hundred dollars a bottle .
Followed by a digestif , typically a 30 - year - old port .
There ’s not any way to justify this except to say I was trying to catch up to my colleagues .
We would treat those restaurants like Roman vomitoriums .
And it was n’t the food so much as the wine .
Being a junior employee , I could n’t really order bottles that cost more than a few hundred dollars , but the senior guys could get nicer stuff - Opus One , Chateau Latour .
As long as we were out with a client , the bank paid .
I remember being stunned the first time I saw a dinner bill for ten grand .
But that was just the beginning .
What it boiled down to was austerity for everyone else and rampant consumption for ourselves .
I never saw anyone literally set fire to money , but I did drink most of a bottle of 1983 Margaux ( $ 2,000 ) .
The mornings after , with our thousand - dollar hangovers , my colleagues in corporate finance would set up deals and make a few hundred factory workers redundant .
I helped build derivatives that funnelled income to offshore holding companies so rich people and big corporations did n’t have to pay taxes .
We had lawyers on retainer in the Cayman Islands and Jersey – a quick phone call and it was all set , no more taxes .
My guilt from doing this became so intense that on a whim I once went to a protest against the World Bank .
I got sprayed with a little pepper gas and it felt good .
***
My conflicted feelings manifested themselves in a variety of other ways , most of which involved avoiding work - this seemed to make me less culpable .
In addition to my trading duties , I ’d got myself installed as head of recruiting for UBS at Cornell , a job my bosses were grateful to me for taking , because the last thing they wanted to do was worry about talking to kids at university .
I loved it ; it allowed me to return to the Cornell campus , the last place I ’d really been happy with my life .
I walked around Ithaca , worked on my novel in the library , interviewed undergraduates for jobs .
Occasionally I ’d spot one like me , liberal - arts with a type - A personality , the sort I knew would make it in banking .
I ’d give them interviews in which I tried to talk them into doing something else .
But of course all they could see was the money , same as me .
Gradually , I was descending into the strange social isolation of my colleagues .
I spent less and less time with normal people and more time with people from the bank .
I could feel myself slowly detaching from reality as lived by the average citizen .
Four nights a week I stayed home and wrote my novel but the other nights I went out with a vengance .
One evening , a close friend from the bank , an art history major from Princeton , took a bunch of recruits out with me .
I did my normal trick of ordering nearly everything on the menu .
There were piles of raw fish , shrimp , paté , sauces that had taken hours to prepare .
It was far more food than anyone could eat and I could see some of the recruits were a little stunned at the quantities of uneaten shrimp and oysters being shovelled into the bin .
I ate a big steak , put down a few bottles of red wine at $ 400 - a- bottle and we hopped into a minibus we ’d chartered for the night ( gauche , but we could n’t find a large enough limo ) .
We stopped somewhere and bought a mixed case of Veuve Clicquot and Moet .
Try the difference between these two , I demanded , but by then the recruits were all so drunk they barely touched it .
I could tell they were getting a little scared .
This stuff is bottom of the line , I told them .
You ought to try the vintages .
I downed at least two of the bottles in rapid succession .
Some of the recruits would not look at me .
They did not want to be there anymore .
We stopped at a bar .
I realised I was going to be sick , made sure my colleague had things under control , caught a cab , and promptly began vomiting out the window .
Because of the quantity of wine and red meat I ’d consumed , it looked like I was spitting up blood .
The cab driver pulled over , certain I was about to die in his backseat .
A finely dressed couple opened the door and I clambered out and vomited on their shoes .
I do n’t remember how I got home .
The next morning I discovered a dozen cigars stuffed in my pockets , probably from the restaurant .
I told my colleagues what had happened , looking for some moral bearing , secretly hoping to be chastised , but they all thought I was a hero .
The vomiting on strangers was their favourite part .
My boss , for fun , would sometimes throw cocktail olives , sushi , things of that nature , across the room in restaurants , always at people we did n’t know .
***
In addition to the physical effects - my ballooning waistline and cholesterol levels - I had become an extremely angry person .
On the trading floor the best way to win an argument was with overpowering aggression .
Right or wrong , you protected your PnL [ profit and loss account ] with the fury of the righteous .
But of course this approach to problem - solving leaks into other parts of your life .
I became a raving idiot when I got behind the wheel of the car , screaming at other drivers for the slightest infractions .
Meanwhile , I kept plugging away at the writing .
Once every few months , when I really felt like treating myself , I ’d take a sick day and stay home and write .
Those were my best days .
I was making good progress on the novel about the young trader with the lost soul .
The bank had me on a management track , which meant I was being rotated in different areas , learning different skills .
After a year of derivative structuring I was sent to the NASDAQ trading desk .
I quickly discovered that NASDAQ traders worked much shorter days , 8 hours as opposed to 12 , and I suddenly had an enormous amount of time to write .
It was one of the luckiest things that ever happened to me , because writing was one of the few things that kept my life in perspective .
Near the end of my second year at the bank , I decided to take a week of vacation and rebuild the engine in my Volkswagen .
Naturally , I did n’t tell my colleagues what I was doing because they would have thought I was insane .
I drove down to Baltimore to a friend ’s repair shop and spent the week working in a spare bay .
It was satisfying to use my hands again , to be around people who did n’t talk about the stock market and I began to feel very acutely exactly how much I hated my job .
Everyone hates their job , I reminded myself .
You ’re getting paid a lot of money to complain .
Looking around at my friends in the shop , it occurred to me that by the time I became a senior trader , I ’d be making more money every year than they would make in their entire careers .
And for what ?
Basically , for helping to break apart the lives of the sort of people I ’d grown up with .
Which brings me to my earlier point .
One of the reasons we allowed the financial industry so much control over our lives , starting in the 1990s and continuing until the meltdown of 2008 , is the propaganda smokescreen of The Market .
This idea of the God - like Market - all - seeing , all - knowing , and beyond question - is what allows CEOs to put a few thousand people out of work while giving themselves a $ 40 m paycheck .
It ’s what allows certain hedge fund managers to take home half a billion ( yes - billion ) in a good year , while schools and bridges fall apart .
In reality , The Market is nothing more than the people who comprise it .
Access to trading markets is very tightly controlled - it is not like a shopping mall .
And it is certainly not magic .
It ’s just people .
A very small number of people , in fact .
To give some perspective , even as a junior trader I might get an order to put on a two million share position - that ’s shares , not dollars - and I ’d do it several times a day .
Advertisements for online trading companies try to imply that the market is made up of people like your Cousin Vinny , who buys a hundred shares here and there , but the truth is that Cousin Vinny is irrelevant .
Markets are driven by a very small number of very large investors - traders at banks , hedge funds , and mutual funds - who drive nice cars and drink expensive wine .
We need them - the financial markets , that is .
They are a necessary part of modern civilisation .
What is unnecessary , and extremely unusual , is that the people who run them are paid so disproportionately to the rest of us .
It is crucial to realise that what motivates those people - collecting their million or hundred million dollar bonuses - has nothing to do with the job they actually perform .
People used to do it for a lot less and it ’s not like there ’s a shortage of candidates - I turned away 10 good recruits at Cornell for every one we hired .
The reason we ’ve ended up in the spot we ’re in today is not so much our failure to understand economics as our failure to understand human nature .
Give a small number of people the power to enrich themselves beyond everyone ’s wildest dreams , a philosophical rationale to explain all the damage they ’re causing , and they will not stop until they ’ve run the world economy off a cliff .
It ’s not that people in the City or on Wall Street are necessarily bad people , it ’s just that they , like almost anyone , will do anything to keep their million or ten million dollar paycheck .
They ’ll creatively interpret data , they ’ll understate risks , they ’ll put the best spin on things .
Some will lie , cheat , and steal .
But most of them , like most of us , will simply resist looking at the world from any perspective other than their own .
And if we are intelligent , we will keep a careful watch on them - both now and into the distant future .
Like any big decision , my choice to leave the bank felt pretty easy once I ’d made it .
My girlfriend at the time was considering going to law school at Harvard ; I asked my boss and some other senior people to ask around for hedge fund jobs in Boston .
But the moment I began to consider leaving UBS , it was like a dam breaking .
I did not want another job in finance .
I did not care about money .
I cared about people , I cared about their stories .
I cared about what makes us who we are .
I left the bank in late 2001 , with my second novel partially written .
By 2004 , things were not exactly going to plan .
I was broke and the second novel had been rejected by every literary agent in America .
The book I ’d spent three years toiling over turned out to be an apprentice - level work .
It was a hard blow but I kept writing .
I moved back to the old neighbourhood in Baltimore and took jobs that allowed me to reconnect with the people I ’d grown up with - working in construction and driving an ambulance .
In 2005 I began a third novel , American Rust , about the way that our circumstances , whether poor or wealthy , can so completely shape our morality and our way of looking at things .
I was fascinated by the lost generation in America - the people whose towns and hopes have been wiped out by outsourcing - people for whom the American Dream has ceased to be relevant .
As Steinbeck did in The Grapes of Wrath , I wanted to show the inner lives , for better and worse , of the new lost generation .
I wanted readers to think about exactly what it means to be human .
What is at the core of us ?
Where do our morals come from ?
What differentiates us from the other animals on earth ?
What measures do we use to define our friends and family and how far are we willing to go to protect them ?
Of course these are questions for broader society , not just literature .
Maybe it ’s only in crises like this that we get shaken up enough to ask ourselves those larger questions - who are we , what is important to us , how should we define our humanity .
The answers we choose will determine the sort of world we live in for the coming decades .

CORRECTLY ATTRIBUTED
Example : [ Collected via e-mail , May 2009 ]
AN OPEN LETTER TO PRESIDENT OBAMA AN OPEN LETTER TO PRESIDENT OBAMA Dear President Obama :
You are the thirteenth President under whom I have lived and unlike any of the others , you truly scare me .
You scare me because after months of exposure , I know nothing about you .
You scare me because I do not know how you paid for your expensive Ivy League education and your upscale lifestyle and housing with no visible signs of support .
You scare me because you did not spend the formative years of youth growing up in America and culturally you are not an American .
You scare me because you have never run a company or met a payroll .
You scare me because you have never had military experience , thus do n’t understand it at its core ..
You scare me because you lack humility and ‘ class ’ , always blaming others .
You scare me because for over half your life you have aligned yourself with radical extremists who hate America and you refuse to publicly denounce these radicals who wish to see America fail .
You scare me because you are a cheerleader for the ‘ blame America ’ crowd and deliver this message abroad .
You scare me because you want to change America to a European style country where the government sector dominates instead of the private sector .
You scare me because you want to replace our health care system with a government controlled one .
You scare me because you prefer ‘ wind mills ’ to responsibly capitalizing on our own vast oil , coal and shale reserves .
You scare me because you want to kill the American capitalist goose that lays the golden egg which provides the highest standard of living in the world .
You scare me because you have begun to use ‘ extortion ’ tactics against certain banks and corporations .
You scare me because your own political party shrinks from challenging you on your wild and irresponsible spending proposals .
You scare me because you will not openly listen to or even consider opposing points of view from intelligent people .
You scare me because you falsely believe that you are both omnipotent and omniscient .
You scare me because the media gives you a free pass on everything you do .
You scare me because you demonize and want to silence the Limbaughs , Hannitys , O’Relllys and Becks who offer opposing , conservative points of view .
You scare me because you prefer controlling over governing .
Finally , you scare me because if you serve a second term I will probably not feel safe in writing a similar letter in 8 years .
Lou Pritchett
Origins : Lou Pritchett is a former vice president of Procter & Gamble whose career at that company spanned 36 years before his retirement in 1989 , and he is the author of the 1995 business book , Stop Paddling & Start Rocking the Boat .
Mr. Pritchett confirmed to us that he was indeed the author of the much - circulated “ open letter ” quoted above :
I did write the ‘ you scare me ’ letter .
I sent it to the NY Times but they never acknowledged or published it .
However , it hit the internet and according to the ‘ experts ’ has had over 500,000 hits .
In April 2012 , the following update was added to the original :
In April 2009 , I sent President Obama and the New York Times a letter
titled “ You Scare Me ” because , as a candidate , he promised to
“ fundamentally transform America . ”
Now , after observing his performance
for over three years , he no longer scares me — he terrifies me for the
following reasons :
In April 2009 , I sent President Obama and the New York Times a lettertitled “ You Scare Me ” because , as a candidate , he promised to “ fundamentally transform America . ”
Now , after observing his performancefor over three years , he no longer scares me — he terrifies me for thefollowing reasons : FIRST–
He has done more to damage America ’s standing in the world , to
lower the standard of living in America , to impoverish future generations
and to shake our faith in the country ’s future than any other American
president in history .
SECOND–
With a compliant Democrat congress , a lapdog media and a weak ,
almost nonexistent Republican opposition , he has shattered the American
dream of job security , home ownership and rugged individualism for
millions of Americans and has poisoned and divided our civil society with
his politics of envy , class warfare , race warfare , and religious warfare
which he is using as fundamental building blocks for his ‘ socialist ’
agenda .
THIRD– culturally , he remains totally out of touch with traditional
American values .
This has absolutely nothing to do with race or where he
was born , rather it has everything to do with where , how and with whom he
was raised , schooled , educated , trained and associates with still today .
FOURTH – he has surrounded himself with naive academicians , lawyers ,
politicians , bureaucrats and socialist leaning czars who arrogantly think
and behave exactly as he does .
People who offer no balanced suggestions or devils advocate positions and
think in lock step with him that big government is the answer to all our
problems .
FIFTH – he not only encourages but aids and abets the unionization of all
American industry , the albatross around the neck of the free market .
In
turn , they provide the money and muscle to intimidate his opponents .
SIXTH – he has increased the national debt by over 30 % in just three
years .
If re-elected and this rate of increase continues , America will be
burdened with an unsustainable 20 trillion dollar debt which will result
in the Country ’s financial death .
Recovery will be impossible —- America
will be the Greece of 2016 .
SEVENTH– given his fanatical beholding to the ‘ environmental ’ and
‘ man - caused global warming ’ fringe , he has deliberately discouraged U.S .
fossil fuel exploration and production while wasting millions of tax payer
dollars on solar , wind and algae experiments .
He refuses to accept that
oil , gas and coal are not America ’s enemies , they are America ’s assets
which , properly managed , could make us energy independent within a
generation .
EIGHTH–
He views the U.S. as a power in retreat which abused its World
dominance .
Therefore he systematically apologizes round the world .
Last
March he whispered to Russian President Medvedev “ –this is my last
election .
After my election , I have more flexibility ” .
Just what is the
secret that Obama and Putin are concealing from the American people until
after the election ?
With what other leaders has he made similar secret
agreements ?
NINTH — and finally , after all his mis-steps , bad decision making , poor
management , and zero leadership , the fact that he has the audacity to seek
re-election should terrify every American .
I predict that if re-elected , future historians and political interpreters
will look back at the eight year period 2008 - 2016 , and conclude “ the 44th
President of the U.S. allowed the takers to overpower the payers which
resulted in the greatest economy in history vanishing from the face of the
Earth ” .

Farewell America , the World will really miss you !
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The suicide rate among U.S. Army soldiers jumped in May -- continuing a four - month upward trend and on a record pace for a second straight year , according to Army statistics released Thursday .
During a service - wide stand - down , troops were trained on identifying signs of distress .
Last month the deaths of 17 soldiers were either confirmed or suspected to be suicides , up from 13 in April and 13 in March , the new numbers revealed .
The Army said the total number of potential or confirmed suicides since January stands at 82 .
Last year the Army recorded 133 suicides , the most ever .
Earlier this year , Army officials saw the suicide numbers moving up , and by February said the service was on track for a record year for suicides .
Only one of the 17 in May has been confirmed as a suicide , while the others remain under investigation and are listed as " potential suicides , " according to the latest statistics .
For April , the Army reported eight potential and five confirmed suicides .
The Army initially classifies a death as " potential suicide " or " confirmed suicide " and moves the numbers between categories after an investigation into the death is complete , according to Army officials .
Last month , Fort Campbell , Kentucky , home to the 101st Airborne Division , held a three - day " suicide stand - down training event " -- the second one at the base this year -- after the base recorded 11 suspected or confirmed suicides between January and May .
Units of the 101st have deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan several times since the September 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks on the United States , and have experienced a good deal of combat and the related stress that comes with those deployments .
Thousands of 101st Airborne troops are currently in Afghanistan .
In January the Army implemented a service - wide effort to combat the problem , including a stand - down for all 1.1 million soldiers in which the troops were trained on identifying signs of distress in the ranks , and were charged with getting help for their comrades .
" We have got to do better , " said Army Vice Chief of Staff Gen. Peter W. Chiarelli in a statement released Thursday .
" It 's clear we have not found full solutions to this yet .
But we are trying every remedy and seeking help from outside agencies that are experts in suicide prevention .
There is n't a reasonable suicide prevention tool out there the Army wo n't potentially employ , " he said .
Fort Hood , Texas , the largest base in the United States , is home to the 4th Infantry Division , which also has seen multiple deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan .
Base commander Lt. Gen. Rick Lynch identified one major stress problem there : Soldiers were working long hours and not spending time with their families between deployments .
Lynch made " focus on the family " a key part of Fort Hood 's environment .
He insists that every soldier on a day schedule leave work in time to be home for dinner by 6 p.m .
On Thursday , many are told to leave by 3 p.m. so they can have the afternoon with the family .
And no one at Fort Hood works weekends unless Lynch signs off on it .
The steps appear to be working .
Although the base has recorded two suicides since the start of the year , that is well below many other major Army bases .

WASHINGTON , April 11 . --
The condition of war which has existed between the United States and Spain since April 21 , 1898 , terminated to - day , when the last formalities of the restoration of peace were performed by the exchange of ratifications of the peace treaty .
Coincident with this , President McKinley issued a proclamation declaring that the war was at an end , and the appointment of Bellamy Storer was determined upon as United States Minister to Spain .

The secret of a successful sandcastle could aid the revival of an ancient eco-friendly building technique , according to research led by Durham University .
Researchers , led by experts at Durham 's School of Engineering , have carried out a study into the strength of rammed earth , which is growing in popularity as a sustainable building method .
Just as a sandcastle needs a little water to stand up , the Durham engineers found that the strength of rammed earth was heavily dependent on its water content .
Rammed earth is a manufactured material made up of sand , gravel and clay which is moistened and then compacted between forms to build walls .
Sometimes stabilisers such as cement are added but the Durham research focussed on unstabilised materials .
The research , funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council ( EPSRC ) and published in the journal Geotechnique , showed that a major component of the strength of rammed earth was due to the small amount of water present .
Small cylindrical samples of rammed earth underwent " triaxial testing " - where external pressures are applied to model behaviour of the material in a wall .
The researchers found that the suction created between soil particles at very low water contents was a source of strength in unstabilised rammed earth .
They showed that rammed earth walls left to dry after construction , in a suitable climate , could be expected to dry but not lose all their water .
The small amount of water remaining provided considerable strength over time .
The researchers say their work could have implications for the future design of buildings using rammed earth as the link between strength and water content becomes clearer .
There is increasing interest in using the technique as it may help reduce reliance on cement in building materials ( cement production being responsible for five per cent of man 's CO 2 output ) .
Rammed earth materials can usually also be sourced locally , thereby reducing transport needs .
As well as informing new build designs the team hopes their findings could also aid the conservation of ancient rammed earth buildings by putting methods in place to protect against too much water entering a structure , which would reduce its strength .
Paul Jaquin , a researcher on the project is now working for an engineering consultancy ( Ramboll , UK ) on new earth building projects around the world , using this research to better engineer buildings .
Research project leader , Dr Charles Augarde , of Durham University 's School of Engineering , said : " We know that rammed earth can stand the test of time but the source of its strength has not been understood properly to date .
" Without this understanding we cannot effectively conserve old rammed earth or make economic designs for new build .
" Our initial tests point to its main source of strength being linked to its water content .
" By understanding more about this we can begin to look at the implications for using rammed earth as a green material in the design of new buildings and in the conservation of ancient buildings that were constructed using the technique . "
Rammed earth was developed in ancient China around 2,000 years before Christ , when people used the technique to build walls around their settlements and the technique spread throughout the world - as documented in another recent publication by the researchers linking up with Dr Chris Gerrard , of the Department of Archaeology , at Durham University (* ) .
Parts of the Great Wall of China and the Alhambra at Granada in Spain were built using rammed earth .
In the UK the technique was used to build experimental low cost housing , in Amesbury , Wiltshire , following the end of the First World War , and it is a recognised building method in parts of Australia and the USA .
The popularity of eco-friendly homes showcased on television programmes such as Grand Designs has also brought the technique to people 's attention .
Dr Augarde is a co-director of Earth Building UK ( EBUK ) , a new association established this year to foster the conservation , understanding and development of building with earth in the United Kingdom .
EBUK brings together builders , academics , researchers , architects , engineers , manufacturers and many more to work in areas of common interest at a national and local level .
Tom Morton , Secretary of Earth Building UK , said : " This kind of research is very valuable as the construction industry analyses environmentally sound , traditional ways of building and adapts them for sustainable construction in the 21st century .
" Such low - carbon technologies are most likely to succeed by marrying the expertise of our research universities , such as Durham , with the commercial understanding of the wider industry and we are seeing a number of very exciting developments in this area . "

While such direct results are certainly rare , the city ’s public libraries are increasingly serving as makeshift employment centers .
At the 58th Street branch of the New York Public Library in Manhattan , out - of - work professionals crowd the computers in the afternoon , a time that had previously been dominated by elderly patrons , and books on résumé writing are hard to keep on the shelves .
The Science , Industry and Business Library on 34th Street drew 700 people to a career preparedness fair in January , and the Bronx Library Center recently doubled the number of computer classes it offers to the elderly because people looking to re-enter the work force had packed the existing classes to overflow levels .
“ We ’ve been in the job - search business for decades , ” said Paul LeClerc , the president of the New York Public Library , noting that President Obama has said that a librarian helped him find his first job as a community organizer .
“ This is a continuation . ”
The new role comes amid a broader surge in demand for libraries ’ free goods and services that is typical during economic downturns .
In the fourth quarter of 2008 , circulation rose 16 percent compared with the previous year at the New York Public Library , which serves Manhattan , the Bronx and Staten Island ; 9 percent at the Brooklyn Public Library ; and 2 percent in Queens .
All three systems also report significant increases in the number of visits .

But the libraries are facing steep cuts in the mayor ’s proposed budget for next year , and have other economic woes .
Brooklyn has already shut its branches on Sundays and is considering trimming hours further .
This month , a hotel company backed away from its pledge to purchase the Donnell Library , a five - story building on 53rd Street , whose sale was intended to help pay for the $ 250 million renovation of the New York Public Library ’s headquarters on Fifth Avenue .
The Joyous Cosmology Alan W. Watts T0 BEGIN WITH , this world has a different kind of time .
It is the time of biological rhythm , not of the clock and all that goes with the clock .
There is no hurry .
Our sense of time is notoriously subjective and thus dependent upon the quality of our attention , whether of interest or boredom , and upon the alignment of our behavior in terms of routines , goals , and deadlines .
Here the present is self - sufficient , but it is not a static present .
It is a dancing present the unfolding of a pattern which has no specific destination in the future but is simply its own point .
It leaves and arrives simultaneously , and the seed is as much the goal as the flower .
There is therefore time to perceive every detail of the movement with infinitely greater richness of articulation .
Normally we do not so much look at things as overlook them .
The eye sees types and classes flower , leaf , rock , bird , firemental pictures of things rather than things , rough outlines filled with flat color , always a little dusty and dim .
But here the depth of light and structure in a bursting bud go on forever .
There is time to see them , time for the whole intricacy of veins and capillaries to develop in consciousness , time to see down and down into the shape of greenness , which is not green at all , but a whole spectrum generalizing itself as greenpurple , gold , the sunlit turquoise of the ocean , the intense luminescence of the emerald .
I cannot decide where shape ends and color begins .
The bud has opened and the fresh leaves fan out and curve back with a gesture which is unmistakably communicative but does not say anything except , " Thus ! "
And somehow that is quite satisfactory , even startlingly clear .
The meaning is transparent in the same way that the color and the texture are transparent , with light which does not seem to fall upon surfaces from above but to be right inside the structure and color .
Which is of course where it is , for light is an inseparable trinity of sun , object , and eye , and the chemistry of the leaf is its color , its light .
But at the same time color and light are the gift of the eye to the leaf and the sun .
Transparency is the property of the eyeball , projected outward as luminous space , interpreting quanta of energy in terms of the gelatinous fibers in the head .
I begin to feel that the world is at once inside my head and outside it , and the two , inside and outside , begin to include or " cap " one another like an infinite series of concentric spheres .
I am unusually aware that everything I am sensing is also my body that light , color , shape , sound , and texture are terms and properties of the brain conferred upon the outside world .
I am not looking at the world , not confronting it ; I am knowing it by a continuous process of transforming it into myself , so that everything around me , the whole globe of space , no longer feels away from me but in the middle .
This is at first confusing .
I am not quite sure of the direction from which sounds come .
The visual space seems to reverberate with them as if it were a drum .
The surrounding hills rumble with the sound of a truck , and the rumble and the color - shape of the hills become one and the same gesture .
I use that word deliberately and shall use it again .
The hills are moving into their stillness .
They mean something because they are being transformed into my brain , and my brain is an organ of meaning .
The forests of redwood trees upon them look like green fire , and the copper gold of the sun - dried grass heaves immensely into the sky .
Time is so slow as to be a kind of eternity , and the flavor of eternity transfers itself to the hills burnished mountains which I seem to remember from an immeasurably distant past , at once so unfamiliar as to be exotic and yet as familiar as my own hand .
Thus transformed into consciousness , into the electric , interior luminosity of the nerves , the world seems vaguely insubstantial developed upon a color film , resounding upon the skin of a drum , pressing , not with weight , but with vibrations interpreted as weight .
Solidity is a neurological invention , and , I wonder , can the nerves be solid to themselves ?
Where do we begin ?
Does the order of the brain create the order of the world , or the order of the world the brain ?
The two seem like egg and hen , or like back and front .
The physical world is vibration , quanta , but vibrations of what ?
To the eye , form and color ; to the ear , sound ; to the nose , scent ; to the fingers , touch .
But these are all different languages for the same thing , different qualities of sensitivity , different dimensions of consciousness .
The question , " Of what are they differing forms ? " seems to have no meaning .
What is light to the eye is sound to the ear .
I have the image of the senses being terms , forms , or dimensions not of one thing common to all , but of each other , locked in a circle of mutuality .
Closely examined , shape becomes color , which becomes vibration , which becomes sound , which becomes smell , which becomes taste , and then touch , and then again shape .
( One can see , for example , that the shape of a leaf is its color .
There is no outline around the leaf ; the outline is the limit where one colored surface becomes another . )
I see all these sensory dimensions as a round dance , gesticulations of one pattern being transformed into gesticulations of another .
And these gesticulations are flowing through a space that has still other dimensions , which I want to describe as tones of emotional color , of light or sound being joyous or fearful , gold elated or lead depressed .
These , too , form a circle of reciprocity , a round spectrum so polarized that we can only describe each in terms of the others .
Sometimes the image of the physical world is not so much a dance of gestures as a woven texture .
Light , sound , touch , taste , and smell become a continuous warp , with the feeling that the whole dimension of sensation is a single continuum or field .
Crossing the warp is a woof representing the dimension of meaning moral and aesthetic values , personal or individual uniqueness , logical significance , and expressive formand the two dimensions interpenetrate so as to make distinguishable shapes seem like ripples in the water of sensation .
The warp and the woof stream together , for the weaving is neither flat nor static but a many - directioned cross - flow of impulses filling the whole volume of space .
I feel that the world is on something in somewhat the same way that a color photograph is on a film , underlying and connecting the patches of color , though the film here is a dense rain of energy .
I see that what it is on is my brain " that enchanted loom , " as Sherrington called it .
Brain and world , warp of sense and woof of meaning , seem to interpenetrate inseparably .
They hold their boundaries or limits in common in such a way as to define one another and to be impossible without each other .
I am listening to the music of an organ .
As leaves seemed to gesture , the organ seems quite literally to speak .
There is no use of the vox humana stop , but every sound seems to issue from a vast human throat , moist with saliva .
As , with the base pedals , the player moves slowly down the scale , the sounds seem to blow forth in immense , gooey spludges .
As I listen more carefully , the spludges acquire texture expanding circles of vibration finely and evenly toothed like combs , no longer moist and liquidinous like the living throat , but mechanically discontinuous .
The sound disintegrates into the innumerable individual drrrits of vibration .
Listening on , the gaps close , or perhaps each individual drrrit becomes in its turn a spludge .
The liquid and the hard , the continuous and the discontinuous , the gooey and the prickly , seem to be transformations of each other , or to be different levels of magnification upon the same thing .
This theme recurs in a hundred different ways the inseparable polarity of opposites , or the mutuality and reciprocity of all the possible contents of consciousness .
It is easy to see theoretically that all perception is of contrasts figure and ground , light and shadow , clear and vague , firm and weak .
But normal attention seems to have difficulty in taking in both at once .
Both sensuously and conceptually we seem to move serially from one to the other ; we do not seem to be able to attend to the figure without relative unconsciousness of the ground .
But in this new world the mutuality of things is quite clear at every level .
The human face , for example , becomes clear in all its aspects the total form together with each single hair and wrinkle .
Faces become all ages at once , for characteristics that suggest age also suggest youth by implication ; the bony structure suggesting the skull evokes instantly the newborn infant .
The associative couplings of the brain seem to fire simultaneously instead of one at a time , projecting a view of life which may be terrifying in its ambiguity or joyous in its integrity .
Decision can be completely paralyzed by the sudden realization that there is no way of having good without evil , or that it is impossible to act upon reliable authority without choosing , from your own inexperience , to do so .
If sanity implies madness and faith doubt , am I basically a psychotic pretending to be sane , a blithering terrified idiot who manages , temporarily , to put on an act of being self - possessed ?
I begin to see my whole life as a masterpiece of duplicity the confused , helpless , hungry , and hideously sensitive little embryo at the root of me having learned , step by step , to comply , placate , bully , wheedle , flatter , bluff , and cheat my way into being taken for a person of competence and reliability .
For when it really comes down to it , what do any of us know ?
I am listening to a priest chanting the Mass and a choir of nuns responding .
His mature , cultivated voice rings with the serene authority of the One , Holy , Catholic , and Apostolic Church , of the Faith once and for all delivered to the saints , and the nuns respond , naively it seems , with childlike , utterly innocent devotion .
But , listening again , I can hear the priest " putting on " his voice , hear the inflated , pompous balloon , the studiedly unctuous tones of a master deceptionist who has the poor little nuns , kneeling in their stalls , completely cowed .
Listen deeper .
The nuns are not cowed at all .
They are playing possum .
With just a little stiffening , the limp gesture of bowing turns into the gesture of the closing claw .
With too few men to go around , the nuns know what is good for them : how to bend and survive .
But this profoundly cynical view of things is only an intermediate stage .
I begin to congratulate the priest on his gamesmanship , on the sheer courage of being able to put up such a performance of authority when he knows precisely nothing .
Perhaps there is no other knowing than the mere competence of the act .
If , at the heart of one 's being , there is no real self to which one ought to be true , sincerity is simply nerve ; it lies in the unabashed vigor of the pretense .
But pretense is only pretense when it is assumed that the act is not true to the agent .
Find the agent .
In the priest 's voice I hear down at the root the primordial howl of the beast in the jungle , but it has been inflected , complicated , refined , and textured with centuries of culture .
Every new twist , every additional subtlety , was a fresh gambit in the game of making the original howl more effective .
At first , crude and unconcealed , the cry for food or mate , or just noise for the fun of it , making the rocks echo .
Then rhythm to enchant .
then changes of tone to plead or threaten .
Then words to specify the need , to promise and bargain .
And then , much later , the gambits of indirection .
The feminine stratagem of stooping to conquer , the claim to superior worth in renouncing the world for the spirit , the cunning of weakness proving stronger than the might of muscle and the meek inheriting the earth .
As I listen , then , I can hear in that one voice the simultaneous presence of all the levels of man 's history , as of all the stages of life before man .
Every step in the game becomes as clear as the rings in a severed tree .
But this is an ascending hierarchy of maneuvers , of stratagems capping stratagems , all symbolized in the overlays of refinement beneath which the original howl is still sounding .
Sometimes the howl shifts from the mating call of the adult animal to the helpless crying of the baby , and I feel all man 's musicits pomp and circumstance , its gaiety , its awe , its confident solemnity as just so much complication and concealment of baby wailing for mother .
And as I want to cry with pity , I know I am sorry for myself .
I , as an adult , am also back there alone in the dark , just as the primordial howl is still present beneath the sublime modulations of the chant .
You poor baby !
And yet you selfish little bastard !
As I try to find the agent behind the act , the motivating force at the bottom of the whole thing , I seem to see only an endless ambivalence .
Behind the mask of love I find my innate selfishness .
What a predicament I am in if someone asks , " Do you really love me ? " I can't say yes without saying no , for the only answer that will really satisfy is , " Yes , I love you so much I could eat you !
My love for you is identical with my love for myself .
I love you with the purest selfishness . "
No one wants to be loved out of a sense of duty .
So I will be very frank .
" Yes , I am pure , selfish desire and I love you because you make me feel wonderful at any rate for the time being . "
But then I begin to wonder whether there is n't something a bit cunning in this frankness .
It is big of me to be so sincere , to make a play for her by not pretending to be more than I amunlike the other guys who say they love her for herself .
I see that there is always something insincere about trying to be sincere , as if I were to say openly , " The statement that I am now making is a lie . "
There seems to be something phony about every attempt to define myself , to be totally honest .
The trouble is that I can't see the back , much less the inside , of my head .
I can't be honest because I do n't fully know what I am .
Consciousness peers out from a center which it cannot seeand that is the root of the matter .
Life seems to resolve itself down to a tiny germ or nipple of sensitivity .
I call it the Eenie - Weeniea squiggling little nucleus that is trying to make love to itself and can never quite get there .
The whole fabulous complexity of vegetable and animal life , as of human civilization , is just a colossal elaboration of the Eenie - Weenie trying to make the Eenie - Weenie .
I am in love with myself , but cannot seek myself without hiding myself .
As I pursue my own tail , it runs away from me .
Does the amoeba split itself in two in an attempt to solve this problem ?
I try to go deeper , sinking thought and feeling down and down to their ultimate beginnings .
What do I mean by loving myself ?
In what form do I know myself ?
Always , it seems , in the form of something other , something strange .
The landscape I am watching is also a state of myself , of the neurons in my head .
I feel the rock in my hand in terms of my own fingers .
And nothing is stranger than my own body the sensation of the pulse , the eye seen through a magnifying glass in the mirror , the shock of realizing that oneself is something in the external world .
At root , there is simply no way of separating self from other , self - love from other - love .
All knowledge of self is knowledge of other , and all knowledge of other knowledge of self .
I begin to see that self and other , the familiar and the strange , the internal and the external , the predictable and the unpredictable imply each other .
One is seek and the other is hide , and the more I become aware of their implying each other , the more I feel them to be one with each other .
I become curiously affectionate and intimate with all that seemed alien .
In the features of everything foreign , threatening , terrifying , incomprehensible , and remote I begin to recognize myself .
Yet this is a " myself " which I seem to be remembering from long , long ago not at all my empirical ego of yesterday , not my specious personality .
The " myself " which I am beginning to recognize , which I had forgotten but actually know better than anything else , goes far back beyond my childhood , beyond the time when adults confused me and tried to tell me that I was someone else ; when , because they were bigger and stronger , they could terrify me with their imaginary fears and bewilder and outface me in the complicated game that I had not yet learned .
( The sadism of the teacher explaining the game and yet having to prove his superiority in it . )
Long before all that , long before I was an embryo in my mother 's womb , there looms the ever - so - familiar stranger , the everything not me , which I recognize , with a joy immeasurably more intense than a meeting of lovers separated by centuries , to be my original self .
The good old sonofabitch who got me involved in this whole game .
At the same time everyone and everything around me takes on the feeling of having been there always , and then forgotten , and then remembered again .
We are sitting in a garden surrounded in every direction by uncultivated hills , a garden of fuchsias and hummingbirds in a valley that leads down to the westernmost ocean , and where the gulls take refuge in storms .
At some time in the middle of the twentieth century , upon an afternoon in the summer , we are sitting around a table on the terrace , eating dark homemade bread and drinking white wine .
And yet we seem to have been there forever , for the people with me are no longer the humdrum and harassed little personalities with names , addresses , and social security numbers , the specifically dated mortals we are all pretending to be .
They appear rather as immortal archetypes of themselves without , however , losing their humanity .
It is just that their differing characters seem , like the priest 's voice , to contain all history ; they are at once unique and eternal , men and women but also gods and goddesses .
For now that we have time to look at each other we become timeless .
The human form becomes immeasurably precious and , as if to symbolize this , the eyes become intelligent jewels , the hair spun gold , and the flesh translucent ivory .
Between those who enter this world together there is also a love which is distinctly eucharistic , an acceptance of each other 's natures from the heights to the depths .
Ella , who planted the garden , is a beneficent Circesorceress , daughter of the moon , familiar of cats and snakes , herbalist and healer with the youngest old face one has ever seen , exquisitely wrinkled , silver - black hair rippled like flames .
Robert is a manifestation of Pan , but a Pan of bulls instead of the Pan of goats , with frizzled short hair tufted into blunt horns a man all sweating muscle and body , incarnation of exuberant glee .
Beryl , his wife , is a nymph who has stepped out of the forest , a mermaid of the land with swinging hair and a dancing body that seems to be naked even when clothed .
It is her bread that we are eating , and it tastes like the Original Bread of which mother 's own bread was a bungled imitation .
And then there is Mary , beloved in the usual , dusty world , but in this world an embodiment of light and gold , daughter of the sun , with eyes formed from the evening sky a creature of all ages , baby , moppet , maid , matron , crone , and corpse , evoking love of all ages .
I try to find words that will suggest the numinous , mythological quality of these people .
Yet at the same time they are as familiar as if I had known them for centuries , or rather , as if I were recognizing them again as lost friends whom I knew at the beginning of time , from a country begotten before all worlds .
This is of course bound up with the recognition of my own most ancient identity , older by far than the blind squiggling of the Eenie - Weenie , as if the highest form that consciousness could take had somehow been present at the very beginning of things .
All of us look at each other knowingly , for the feeling that we knew each other in that most distant past conceals something elsetacit , awesome , almost unmentionable the realization that at the deep center of a time perpendicular to ordinary time we are , and always have been , one .
We acknowledge the marvelously hidden plot , the master illusion , whereby we appear to be different .
The shock of recognition .
In the form of everything most other , alien , and remote the ever - receding galaxies , the mystery of death , the terrors of disease and madness , the foreign - feeling , gooseflesh world of sea monsters and spiders , the queasy labyrinth of my own insides in all these forms I have crept up on myself and yelled " Boo ! " I scare myself out of my wits , and , while out of my wits , cannot remember just how it happened .
Ordinarily I am lost in a maze .
I do n't know how I got here , for I have lost the thread and forgotten the intricately convoluted system of passages through which the game of hide - and - seek was pursued .
( Was it the path I followed in growing the circuits of my brain ? )
But now the principle of the maze is clear .
It is the device of something turning back upon itself so as to seem to be other , and the turns have been so many and so dizzyingly complex that I am quite bewildered .
The principle is that all dualities and opposites are not disjoined but polar ; they do not encounter and confront one another from afar ; they exfoliate from a common center .
Ordinary thinking conceals polarity and relativity because it employs terms , the terminals or ends , the poles , neglecting what lies between them .
The difference of front and back , to be and not to be , hides their unity and mutuality .
Now consciousness , sense perception , is always a sensation of contrasts .
It is a specialization in differences , in noticing , and nothing is definable , classifiable , or noticeable except by contrast with something else .
But man does not live by consciousness alone , for the linear , step - by - step , contrast - by - contrast procedure of attention is quite inadequate for organizing anything so complex as a living body .
The body itself has an " omniscience " which is unconscious , or superconscious , just because it deals with relation instead of contrast , with harmonies rather than discords .
It " thinks " or organizes as a plant grows , not as a botanist describes its growth .
This is why Shiva has ten arms , for he represents the dance of life , the omnipotence of being able to do innumerably many things at once .
In the type of experience I am describing , it seems that the superconscious method of thinking becomes conscious .
We see the world as the whole body sees it , and for this very reason there is the greatest difficulty in attempting to translate this mode of vision into a form of language that is based on contrast and classification .
To the extent , then , that man has become a being centered in consciousness , he has become centered in clash , conflict , and discord .
He ignores , as beneath notice , the astounding perfection of his organism as a whole , and this is why , in most people , there is such a deplorable disparity between the intelligent and marvelous order of their bodies and the trivial preoccupations of their consciousness .
But in this other world the situation is reversed .
Ordinary people look like gods because the values of the organism are uppermost , and the concerns of consciousness fall back into the subordinate position which they should properly hold .
Love , unity , harmony , and relationship therefore take precedence over war and division .
For what consciousness overlooks is the fact that all boundaries and divisions are held in common by their opposite sides and areas , so that when a boundary changes its shape both sides move together .
It is like the yang - yin symbol of the Chinese the black and white fishes divided by an S - curve inscribed within a circle .
The bulging head of one is the narrowing tail of the other .
But how much more difficult it is to see that my skin and its movements belong both to me and to the external world , or that the spheres of influence of different human beings have common walls like so many rooms in a house , so that the movement of my wall is also the movement of yours .
You can do what you like in your room just so long as I can do what I like in mine .
But each man 's room is himself in his fullest extension , so that my expansion is your contraction and vice versa .
I am looking at what I would ordinarily call a confusion of bushes a tangle of plants and weeds with branches and leaves going every which way .
But now that the organizing , relational mind is uppermost I see that what is confusing is not the bushes but my clumsy method of thinking .
Every twig is in its proper place , and the tangle has become an arabesque more delicately ordered than the fabulous doodles in the margins of Celtic manuscripts .
In this same state of consciousness I have seen a woodland at fall , with the whole multitude of almost bare branches and twigs in silhouette against the sky , not as a confusion , but as the lacework or tracery of an enchanted jeweler .
A rotten log bearing rows of fungus and patches of moss became as precious as any work of Cellinian inwardly luminous construct of jet , amber , jade , and ivory , all the porous and spongy disintegrations of the wood seeming to have been carved out with infinite patience and skill .
I do not know whether this mode of vision organizes the world in the same way that it organizes the body , or whether it is just that the natural world is organized in that way .
A journey into this new mode of consciousness gives one a marvelously enhanced appreciation of patterning in nature , a fascination deeper than ever with the structure of ferns , the formation of crystals , the markings upon sea shells , the incredible jewelry of such unicellular creatures of the ocean as the radiolaria , the fairy architecture of seeds and pods , the engineering of bones and skeletons , the aerodynamics of feathers , and the astonishing profusion of eye - forms upon the wings of butterflies and birds .
All this involved delicacy of organization may , from one point of view , be strictly functional for the purposes of reproduction and survival .
But when you come down to it , the survival of these creatures is the same as their very existence and what is that for ?
More and more it seems that the ordering of nature is an art akin to musicfugues in shell and cartilage , counterpoint in fibers and capillaries , throbbing rhythm in waves of sound , light , and nerve .
And oneself is connected with it quite inextricably a node , a ganglion , an electronic interweaving of paths , circuits , and impulses that stretch and hum through the whole of time and space .
The entire pattern swirls in its complexity like smoke in sunbeams or the rippling networks of sunlight in shallow water .
Transforming itself endlessly into itself , the pattern alone remains .
The crosspoints , nodes , nets , and curlicues vanish perpetually into each other .
" The baseless fabric of this vision . "
It is its own base .
When the ground dissolves beneath me I float .
Closed - eye fantasies in this world seem sometimes to be revelations of the secret workings of the brain , of the associative and patterning processes , the ordering systems which carry out all our sensing and thinking .
Unlike the one I have just described , they are for the most part ever more complex variations upon a theme ferns sprouting ferns sprouting ferns in multidimensional spaces , vast kaleidoscopic domes of stained glass or mosaic , or patterns like the models of highly intricate molecules systems of colored balls , each one of which turns out to be a multitude of smaller balls , forever and ever .
Is this , perhaps , an inner view of the organizing process which , when the eyes are open , makes sense of the world even at points where it appears to be supremely messy ?
Later that same afternoon , Robert takes us over to his barn from which he has been cleaning out junk and piling it into a big and battered Buick convertible , with all the stuffing coming out of the upholstery .
The sight of trash poses two of the great questions of human life , " Where are we going to put it ? " and " Who 's going to clean up ? "
From one point of view living creatures are simply tubes , putting things in at one end and pushing them out at the otheruntil the tube wears out .
The problem is always where to put what is pushed out at the other end , especially when it begins to pile so high that the tubes are in danger of being crowded off the earth by their own refuse .
And the questions have metaphysical overtones .
" Where are we going to put it ? " asks for the foundation upon which things ultimately rest the First Cause , the Divine Ground , the bases of morality , the origin of action .
" Who 's going to clean up ? " is asking where responsibility ultimately lies , or how to solve our ever - multiplying problems other than by passing the buck to the next generation .
I contemplate the mystery of trash in its immediate manifestation : Robert 's car piled high , with only the driver 's seat left unoccupied by broken door - frames , rusty stoves , tangles of chicken - wire , squashed cans , insides of ancient harmoniums , nameless enormities of cracked plastic , headless dolls , bicycles without wheels , torn cushions vomiting kapok , non-returnable bottles , busted dressmakers ' dummies , rhomboid picture - frames , shattered bird - cages , and inconceivable messes of string , electric wiring , orange peels , eggshells , potato skins , and light bulbs all garnished with some ghastly - white chemical powder that we call " angel shit . "
Tomorrow we shall escort this in a joyous convoy to the local dump .
And then what ?
Can any melting and burning imaginable get rid of these ever - rising mountains of ruinespecially when the things we make and build are beginning to look more and more like rubbish even before they are thrown away ?
The only answer seems to be that of the present group .
The sight of Robert 's car has everyone helpless with hysterics .
The Divine Comedy .
All things dissolve in laughter .
And for Robert this huge heap of marvelously incongruous uselessness is a veritable creation , a masterpiece of nonsense .
He slams it together and ropes it securely to the bulbous , low - slung wreck of the supposedly chic convertible , and then stands back to admire it as if it were a float for a carnival .
Theme : the American way of life .
But our laughter is without malice , for in this state of consciousness everything is the doing of gods .
The culmination of civilization in monumental heaps of junk is seen , not as thoughtless ugliness , but as self - caricature as the creation of phenomenally absurd collages and abstract sculptures in deliberate but kindly mockery of our own pretensions .
For in this world nothing is wrong , nothing is even stupid .
The sense of wrong is simply failure to see where something fits into a pattern , to be confused as to the hierarchical level upon which an event belongs a play which seems quite improper at level 28 may be exactly right at level 96 .
I am speaking of levels or stages in the labyrinth of twists and turns , gambits and counter - gambits , in which life is involving and evolving itself  the cosmological one - upmanship which the yang and the yin , the light and the dark principles , are forever playing , the game which at some early level in its development seems to be the serious battle between good and evil .
If the square may be defined as one who takes the game seriously , one must admire him for the very depth of his involvement , for the courage to be so far - out that he does n't know where he started .
The more prosaic , the more dreadfully ordinary anyone or anything seems to be , the more I am moved to marvel at the ingenuity with which divinity hides in order to seek itself , at the lengths to which this cosmic joie de vivre will go in elaborating its dance .
I think of a corner gas station on a hot afternoon .
Dust and exhaust fumes , the regular Standard guy all baseball and sports cars , the billboards halfheartedly gaudy , the flatness so reassuring nothing around here but just us folks !
I can see people just pretending not to see that they are avatars of Brahma , Vishnu , and Shiva , that the cells of their bodies are n't millions of gods , that the dust is n't a haze of jewels .
How solemnly they would go through the act of not understanding me if I were to step up and say , " Well , who do you think you 're kidding ?
Come off it , Shiva , you old rascal !
It 's a great act , but it does n't fool me . "
But the conscious ego does n't know that it is something which that divine organ , the body , is only pretending to be .*
When people go to a guru , a master of wisdom , seeking a way out of darkness , all he really does is to humor them in their pretense until they are outfaced into dropping it .
He tells nothing , but the twinkle in his eye speaks to the unconscious 
" You know .... You know ! "
In the contrast world of ordinary consciousness man feels himself , as will , to be something in nature but not of it .
He likes it or dislikes it .
He accepts it or resists it .
He moves it or it moves him .
But in the basic superconsciousness of the whole organism this division does not exist .
The organism and its surrounding world are a single , integrated pattern of action in which there is neither subject nor object , doer nor done to .
At this level there is not one thing called pain and another thing called myself , which dislikes pain .
Pain and the " response " to pain are the same thing .
When this becomes conscious it feels as if everything that happens is my own will .
But this is a preliminary and clumsy way of feeling that what happens outside the body is one process with what happens inside it .
This is that " original identity " which ordinary language and our conventional definitions of man so completely conceal .
The active and the passive are two phases of the same act .
A seed , floating in its white sunburst of down , drifts across the sky , sighing with the sound of a jet plane invisible above .
I catch it by one hair between thumb and index finger , and am astonished to watch this little creature actually wiggling and pulling as if it were struggling to get away .
Common sense tells me that this tugging is the action of the wind , not of the thistledown .
But then I recognize that it is the " intelligence " of the seed to have just such delicate antennae of silk that , in an environment of wind , it can move .
Having such extensions , it moves itself with the wind .
When it comes to it , is there any basic difference between putting up a sail and pulling an oar ?
If anything , the former is a more intelligent use of effort than the latter .
True , the seed does not intend to move itself with the wind , but neither did I intend to have arms and legs .
It is this vivid realization of the reciprocity of will and world , active and passive , inside and outside , self and not - self , which evokes the aspect of these experiences that is most puzzling from the standpoint of ordinary consciousness : the strange and seemingly unholy conviction that " I " am God .
In Western culture this sensation is seen as the very signature of insanity But in India it is simply a matter of course that the deepest center of man , atman , is the deepest center of the universe , Brahman .
Why not ?
Surely a continuous view of the world is more whole , more holy , more healthy , than one in which there is a yawning emptiness between the Cause and its effects .
Obviously , the " I " which is God is not the ego , the consciousness of self which is simultaneously an unconsciousness of the fact that its outer limits are held in common with the inner limits of the rest of the world .
But in this wider , less ignore - ant consciousness I am forced to see that everything I claim to will and intend has a common boundary with all I pretend to disown .
The limits of what I will , the form and shape of all those actions which I claim as mine , are identical and coterminous with the limits of all those events which I have been taught to define as alien and external .
The feeling of self is no longer confined to the inside of the skin .
Instead , my individual being seems to grow out from the rest of the universe like a hair from a head or a limb from a body , so that my center is also the center of the whole .
I find that in ordinary consciousness I am habitually trying to ring myself off from this totality , that I am perpetually on the defensive .
But what am I trying to protect ?
Only very occasionally are my defensive attitudes directly concerned with warding off physical damage or deprivation .
For the most part I am defending my defenses : rings around rings around rings around nothing .
Guards inside a fortress inside entrenchments inside a radar curtain .
The military war is the outward parody of the war of ego versus world : only the guards are safe .
In the next war only the air force will outlive the women and children .
I trace myself back through the labyrinth of my brain , through the innumerable turns by which I have ringed myself off and , by perpetual circling , obliterated the original trail whereby I entered this forest .
Back through the tunnels through the devious status - and - survival strategy of adult life , through the interminable passages which we remember in dreams all the streets we have ever traveled , the corridors of schools , the winding pathways between the legs of tables and chairs where one crawled as a child , the tight and bloody exit from the womb , the fountainous surge through the channel of the penis , the timeless wanderings through ducts and spongy caverns .
Down and back through ever - narrowing tubes to the point where the passage itself is the traveler a thin string of molecules going through the trial and error of getting itself into the right order to be a unit of organic life .
Relentlessly back and back through endless and whirling dances in the astronomically proportioned spaces which surround the original nuclei of the world , the centers of centers , as remotely distant on the inside as the nebulae beyond our galaxy on the outside .
Down and at last out out of the cosmic maze to recognize in and as myself , the bewildered traveler , the forgotten yet familiar sensation of the original impulse of all things , supreme identity , inmost light , ultimate center , self more me than myself .
Standing in the midst of Ella 's garden I feel , with a peace so deep that it sings to be shared with all the world , that at last I belong , that I have returned to the home behind home , that I have come into the inheritance unknowingly bequeathed from all my ancestors since the beginning .
Plucked like the strings of a harp , the warp and woof of the world reverberate with memories of triumphant hymns .
The sure foundation upon which I had sought to stand has turned out to be the center from which I seek .
The elusive substance beneath all the forms of the universe is discovered as the immediate gesture of my hand .
But how did I ever get lost ?
And why have I traveled so far through these intertwined tunnels that I seem to be the quaking vortex of defended defensiveness which is my conventional self ?
Going indoors I find that all the household furniture is alive .
Everything gestures .
Tables are tabling , pots are potting , walls are walling , fixtures are fixturing a world of events instead of things .
Robert turns on the phonograph , without telling me what is being played .
Looking intently at the pictures picturing , I only gradually become conscious of the music , and at first cannot decide whether I am hearing an instrument or a human voice simply falling .
A single stream of sound , curving , rippling , and jiggling with a soft snarl that at last reveals it to be a reed instrument some sort of oboe .
Later , human voices join it .
But they are not singing words , nothing but a kind of " buoh buahbueeh " which seems to be exploring all the liquidinous inflections of which the voice is capable .
What has Robert got here ?
I imagine it must be some of his far - out friends in a great session of nonsense - chanting .
The singing intensifies into the most refined , exuberant , and delightful warbling , burbling .
honking .
hooting .
and howling which quite obviously means nothing whatsoever .
and is being done out of pure glee .
There is a pause .
A voice says .
" Dit ! "
Another seems to reply , " Da ! " Then , " Dit -da ! Di-dittty - da ! "
And getting gradually faster .
" Da -di - ditty - di- ditty - da ! Di-da - di - ditty - ditty - da - di- da - di - ditty - da -da ! "
And so on , until the players are quite out of their minds .
The record cover which Robert now shows me , says " Classical Music of India , " and informs me that this is a series edited by Alain Danielou , who happens to be the most serious , esoteric , and learned scholar of Hindu music , and an exponent .
in the line of Rene Guenon and Ananda Coomaraswamy , of the most formal , traditional , and difficult interpretation of Yoga and Vedanta .
Somehow I cannot quite reconcile Danielou , the pandit of pandits , with this delirious outpouring of human bird - song .
I feel my leg is being pulled .
Or perhaps Danielou 's leg .
But then , maybe not .
Oh , indeed not !
For quite suddenly I feel my understanding dawning into a colossal clarity , as if everything were opening up down to the roots of my being and of time and space themselves .
The sense of the world becomes totally obvious .
I am struck with amazement that I or anyone could have thought life a problem or being a mystery .
I call to everyone to gather round .
" Listen , there 's something I must tell .
I 've never , never seen it so clearly .
But it does n't matter a bit if you do n't understand , because each one of you is quite perfect as you are , even if you do n't know it .
Life is basically a gesture , but no one , no thing , is making it .
There is no necessity for it to happen , and none for it to go on happening .
For it is n't being driven by anything ; it just happens freely of itself .
It 's a gesture of motion , of sound , of color , and just as no one is making it , it is n't happening to anyone .
There is simply no problem of life ; it is completely purposeless play exuberance which is its own end .
Basically there is the gesture .
Time , space , and multiplicity are complications of it .
There is no reason whatever to explain it , for explanations are just another form of complexity , a new manifestation of life on top of life , of gestures gesturing .
Pain and suffering are simply extreme forms of play , and there is n't anything in the whole universe to be afraid of because it does n't happen to anyone !
There is n't any substantial ego at all .
The ego is a kind of flip , a knowing of knowing , a fearing of fearing .
It 's a curlicue , an extra jazz to experience , a sort of double - take or reverberation , a dithering of consciousness which is the same as anxiety . "
Of course , to say that life is just a gesture , an action without agent , recipient , or purpose , sounds much more empty and futile than joyous .
But to me it seems that an ego , a substantial entity to which experience happens , is more of a minus than a plus .
It is an estrangement from experience , a lack of participation .
And in this moment I feel absolutely with the world , free of that chronic resistance to experience which blocks the free flowing of life and makes us move like muscle - bound dancers .
But I do n't have to overcome resistance .
I see that resistance , ego , is just an extra vortex in the stream -- part of it and that in fact there is no actual resistance at all .
There is no point from which to confront life , or stand against it .
I go into the garden again .
The hummingbirds are soaring up and falling in their mating dance , as if there were someone behind the bushes playing ball with them .
Fruit and more wine have been put out on the table .
Oranges transformations of the sun into its own image , as if the tree were acknowledging gratitude for warmth .
Leaves , green with the pale , yellow - fresh green that I remember from the springtimes of my childhood in Kentish spinneys , where breaking buds were spotted all over the hazel branches in a floating mist .
Within them , trunks , boughs , and twigs moist black behind the sunlit green .
Fuchsia bushes , tangled traceries of stalks , intermingled with thousands of magenta ballerinas with purple petticoats .
And , behind all , towering into the near - twilight sky , the grove of giant eucalyptus trees with their waving clusters of distinctly individual , bamboo - like leaves .
Everything here is the visual form of the lilting nonsense and abandoned vocal dexterity of those Hindu musicians .
I recall the words of an ancient Tantric scripture : " As waves come with water and flames with fire , so the universal waves with us . "
Gestures of the gesture , waves of the wave leaves flowing into caterpillars , grass into cows , milk into babies , bodies into worms , earth into flowers , seeds into birds , quanta of energy into the iridescent or reverberating labyrinths of the brain .
Within and swept up into this endless , exulting , cosmological dance are the base and grinding undertones of the pain which transformation involves : chewed nerve endings , sudden electric - striking snakes in the meadow grass , swoop of the lazily circling hawks , sore muscles piling logs , sleepless nights trying to keep track of the unrelenting bookkeeping which civilized survival demands .
How unfamiliarly natural it is to see pain as no longer a problem .
For problematic pain arises with the tendency of self - consciousness to short - circuit the brain and fill its passages with dithering echoes revulsions to revulsions , fears of fear , cringing from cringing , guilt about guilttwisting thought to trap itself in endless oscillations .
In his ordinary consciousness man lives like someone trying to speak in an excessively sensitive echo - chamber ; he can proceed only by doggedly ignoring the interminably gibbering reflections of his voice .
For in the brain there are echoes and reflected images in every dimension of sense , thought , and feeling , chattering on and on in the tunnels of memory .
The difficulty is that we confuse this storing of information with an intelligent commentary on what we are doing at the moment , mistaking for intelligence the raw materials of the data with which it works .
Like too much alcohol , self - consciousness makes us see ourselves double , and we mistake the double image for two selvesmental and material , controlling and controlled , reflective and spontaneous .
Thus instead of suffering we suffer about suffering , and suffer about suffering about suffering .
As has always been said , clarity comes with the giving up of self .
But what this means is that we cease to attribute selfhood to these echoes and mirror images .
Otherwise we stand in a hall of mirrors , dancing hesitantly and irresolutely because we are making the images take the lead .
We move in circles because we are following what we have already done .
We have lost touch with our original identity , which is not the system of images but the great self - moving gesture of this as yet unremembered moment .
The gift of remembering and binding time creates the illusion that the past stands to the present as agent to act , mover to moved .
Living thus from the past , with echoes taking the lead , we are not truly here , and are always a little late for the feast .
Yet could anything be more obvious than that the past follows from the present like the wake of a ship , and that if we are to be alive at all , here is the place to be ?
Evening at last closes a day that seemed to have been going on since the world began .
At the high end of the garden , above a clearing , there stands against the mountain wall a semicircle of trees , immensely tall and dense with foliage , suggesting the entrance grove to some ancient temple .
It is from here that the deep blue - green transparency of twilight comes down , silencing the birds and hushing our own conversation .
We have been watching the sunset , sitting in a row upon the ridgepole of the great barn whose roof of redwood tiles , warped and cracked , sweeps clear to the ground .
Below , to the west , lies an open sward where two white goats are munching the grass , and beyond this is Robert 's house where lights in the kitchen show that Beryl is preparing dinner .
Time to go in , and leave the garden to the awakening stars .
Again music harpsichords and a string orchestra , and Bach in his most exultant mood .
I lie down to listen , and close my eyes .
All day , in wave after wave and from all directions of the mind 's compass , there has repeatedly come upon me the sense of my original identity as one with the very fountain of the universe .
I have seen , too , that the fountain is its own source and motive , and that its spirit is an unbounded playfulness which is the many - dimensioned dance of life .
There is no problem left , but who will believe it ?
Will I believe it myself when I return to normal consciousness ?
Yet I can see at the moment that this does not matter .
The play is hide - and - seek or lost - and - found , and it is all part of the play that one can get very lost indeed .
How far , then , can one go in getting found ?
As if in answer to my question there appears before my closed eyes a vision in symbolic form of what Eliot has called " the still point of the turning world . "
I find myself looking down at the floor of a vast courtyard , as if from a window high upon the wall , and the floor and the walls are entirely surfaced with ceramic tiles displaying densely involved arabesques in gold , purple , and blue .
The scene might be the inner court of some Persian palace , were it not of such immense proportions and its colors of such preternatural transparency .
In the center of the floor there is a great sunken arena , shaped like a combination of star and rose , and bordered with a strip of tiles that suggest the finest inlay work in vermilion , gold , and obsidian .
Within this arena some kind of ritual is being performed in time with the music .
At first its mood is stately and royal , as if there were officers and courtiers in rich armor and many - colored cloaks dancing before their king .
As I watch , the mood changes .
The courtiers become angels with wings of golden fire , and in the center of the arena there appears a pool of dazzling flame .
Looking into the pool I see , just for a moment , a face which reminds me of the Christos Pantocrator of Byzantine mosaics , and I feel that the angels are drawing back with wings over their faces in a motion of reverent dread .
But the face dissolves .
The pool of flame grows brighter and brighter , and I notice that the winged beings are drawing back with a gesture , not of dread , but of tenderness for the flame knows no anger .
Its warmth and radiance " tongues of flame infolded " are an efflorescence of love so endearing that I feel I have seen the heart of all hearts .

A SOUTH Wales council faces increased scrutiny after a string of failures led to a teenager being placed with a family whose young children he sexually abused .
Three social workers and managers have been suspended in the wake of the errors , an inquiry revealed yesterday .
It emerged that further disciplinary action will follow after the report found staff concentrated on the 19 - year - old ’s own vulnerability rather than the risks he posed to others .
The sex abuser was jailed in February after he admitted the rape and sexual assault of two young children in the Vale of Glamorgan .
The teenager was placed with the family by the council ’s Adult Placement Service , despite having a history of sexual behaviour involving children .
But the inquiry found it was the Leaving Care Team – who focused on finding an emergency placement for the teenager – who failed to pass on information about his past .
The report , conducted by the council , describes their actions as “ naive ” .
It said : “ Seen for the most part as a victim in many aspects of his life , he was considered to be the one in need of protection .
“ Because of this focus , much of the relevant information was not made available to the parents of the children and to some staff involved in making decisions about providing accommodation . ”
Philip Evans , the council ’s director of social services , pictured , said : “ We have suspended three members of staff – social workers and managers – and further disciplinary action will follow quickly now we have the inquiry report .
“ Potentially the consequences to the staff are serious .
As accountable professionals they are now open to external scrutiny by the Care Council for Wales and they can be removed from the register . ”
He added : “ The parents were left with responsibility for contacting the police .
Failure to act by these staff is almost beyond understanding . ”
A new management team is in place and an action plan has been drawn up to implement all 12 of its recommendations by September .
Mr Evans said some had already been completed .
He added : “ We can , we must and we will do better . ”
John Maitland
Evans , the council ’s chief executive , said : “ This is a tragic situation and I join the leader and all others within the council in offering a full and unreserved apology to the parents and children affected .
I ’m very , very sorry . ”
The teenager , who can not be named to protect the identity of the family ’s children , was ordered to serve a minimum of six years by a judge at Cardiff Crown Court .
After sentencing , the court heard that allegations about the teenager were first made in 2004 , when it was claimed he behaved in a sexually inappropriate way to another boy .
In 2005 , he is said to have sexually touched a boy while they were both living at a hostel in England .
Last year , he allegedly sexually assaulted a 16 - year - old while they were staying in the same hostel .
The council knew about this sexual history , but despite this , he was sent to live with the couple and their children .
Further reports are due on the case from the Welsh Assembly Government .
Gwenda Thomas , Wales ’ Deputy Minister for Social Services , said she would be giving the report “ very serious consideration ” .
She said : “ It is clear that mistakes have been made and I have asked the Chief Inspector of the Care and Social Services Inspectorate Wales to advise me about how the matters raised by this report are taken further .
“ The Chief Inspector is writing today to the Director of Social Services in the Vale requiring a response by May 29 .
“ I am determined that lessons are learnt from these tragic events and that all necessary action is taken to help prevent such circumstances happening again . ”
She said a review was already under way which would “ provide the basis for a national overview report on safeguarding children in Wales ” and would be published this autumn .
Keith Towler , the Children ’s Commissioner for Wales , said : “ I am encouraged by the swift acceptance of the recommendations .
However , I will need to be satisfied that the council ’s action plan will lead to these recommendations being implemented consistently and with immediate effect .
“ I will therefore be seeking reassurance when I meet with Mr Evans and the Care and Social Services Inspectorate Wales that stringent arrangements are now in place to safeguard all children and young people .
“ Ultimately these professionals have a duty to protect all children .
There is no room for error .
“ This is an inexcusable series of events and the harsh lessons the Vale of Glamorgan must learn from this should not be looked at in isolation .
Stringent safeguards should be in place by all local authorities to protect all young children across Wales . ”
The report will go before the council ’s cabinet and social services committee tomorrow .
Camping is one of the perennial summer activities that we all want to be part of .
Indeed , a lot of people in all walks of life and ages do prefer to go camping .
It is one way of relaxing and enjoying the best that Mother Nature can offer to us , allowing us to rest our mind and rejuvenate our body .
Wherever your are camping , or whatever reason you have in mind for doing so , camping will open you to a lot of activities and opportunities .
Rocky Point is one of the best places to go and have Rocky Point camping .
It ’s a place that can offer you a lot of opportunities and chances to enjoy the beauty of nature at its best .
You may choose to camp on the beach shores of Rocky Point or in any other places .
You may also opt to spend your camping at the Rocky Point camping RV , a little community of campers , complete with stores , CRs , and barbeque grills that gives you the homey comfort while you are away in Rocky Point .
But please do remember that whether you are camping on the sand dunes , beach side , or on the Rocky Point camping RV , do n’t forget to bring the essentials , like back packs , tents , food supply , first aid kits , Flashlights , and other camping equipment to provide you the same comfort that you enjoyed while you are at home .
People always say the story is the most important thing in good science fiction .
But excessively " plot - driven " science fiction is dismissed as mindless or worse .
What 's the difference between story and plot anyway ?
Advertisement
Are " plot " and " story " just two different ways of saying the same thing ?
They 're both about a sequence of events that starts in one place and ends in another ?
( Or goes in a circle , in a hopefully meaningful fashion . )
And yet , people seem to use them to describe very different things .
Advertisement
When people talk about a " plot - driven " science fiction book or movie , they 're usually implying that the characters are as wafer - thin as the exploding mint in Monty Python 's Meaning Of Life .
The only thing a " plot - driven " work cares about is marching us from one plot point to another .
There 's a spaceship that 's going to crash , and we have to stop it !
But if the spaceship does n't crash , then the hero 's mother will never have been born !
And so on .
It 's all about the mechanics of the plot .
( For some examples , see the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers Of America glossary of critiquing terms , which says " plot - driven " stories are ones in which the author forces the characters to go in the direction the plot requires , whether it makes sense or not .
Also , a commenter at SFSignal says serious science fiction is being replaced by plot - driven spectacle . )

Meanwhile , you hear creators , and fans , talk about " the story " with awe .
Joss Whedon , for example , talks regularly about how " the story " is the most important thing in his works , and everything else is secondary .
( Says Joss , " The STORY is in charge , the story that keeps on speaking to me , that says there is much more to tell about all these characters . " )
Usually , there 's an implication that " story " involves more of an emotional component , or some kind of magical alchemy , that 's not present in mere plot .

Here 's Doomsday Book author Connie Willis , talking in 1997 about how her religious beliefs affect ( or do n't affect ) her writing :
I think writers have to tell the truth as they know it .
On the other hand , I think every truly religious person is a heretic at heart because you can't be true to an established agenda .
You have to be true to what you think .
I think Madeleine L'Engle and C.S. Lewis both have times when they become apologists for religion rather than writers .
I want always to be a writer , and if my religion is what has to go , so be it .
The story is everything .

Samuel Delany talks , obliquely , about the relationship between plot and story in his book , About Writing , which I reviewed a while ago .
First , he quotes E.M. Forster , from his 1927 book Aspects Of The Novel :
The more we look at the story ( the story that is a story , mind ) , the more we disentangle it from the finer growth it supports , the less we shall find to admire .
It runs like a backbone - or may I say a tapeworm , for its beginning and end are arbitrary ... it is a sequence of events arranged in their time sequence - dinner coming after breakfast , Tuesday after Monday , decay after death and so on .
Qua story , it can only have merit : that of making the audience wonder what happens next .
And conversely it can only have one fault : that of making the audence not want to know what happens next .
These are the only two criticisms that can be made on the story that is a story ...
When we isolate the story like this and hold it out on the forceps - wriggling and interminable , the naked worm of time - it presents an aspect both unlovely and dull .
But we have much to learn from it .
Advertisement
Delany adds :
With some extraordinary exceptions throughout the history of all these fields , most comic books , TV series and action movies do n't have good stories .
Neither do most published novels , and for the same reason : the logic that must hold them together and produce the readerly curiosity about what will happen is replaced by " interesting situations " ( or an " interesting character " ) , which do n't relate logically or developmentally to what comes before or after .
That is to say , they are wildly illogical .
We cannot follow their development , even - or especially - if we try .
If we look at them closely , they do n't make much sense .
The general population , day in and day out , is not used to getting good stories .
Advertisement
You 'll notice that both Forster and Delany use the term " story " instead of " plot , " to describe the backbone of the narrative .
Delany also says that he and Forster share a healthy respect for the ancient power of the story , so it seems like in these quotes , both writers are using " story " to mean both " story " and " plot . "

And yet , I feel like I keep coming across the same dichotomy , especially as people talk about science fiction .
Stories are nobel and revered , plots are ugly and spine - like , best concealed by layers of muscle and fat .
So what is it that makes " plot " mechanistic and " story " magical ?
Here 's one theory that I 've come up with : plot is about the future , story is about the past .
Think about it this way : when you focus on the plot of a book or movie , it 's always about " What happens next ? "
You 're constantly watching to see how the hero 's predicament will turn out , and how the clues you 've picked up on will be resolved .
Advertisement
Meanwhile , we tell stories to answer the question , " How did we get here ? "
Like , for example , I want to know why the U.S. army is fighting in Iraq .
I can tell a story about how there was this evil dictator who invaded Kuwait , and we had to stop him , but then he kept flouting the terms of the peace agreement .
Or I can tell a story about how our president had an agenda that involved toppling the government of Iraq , and after a terrorist attack , he decided to use that as a pretext to invade .
Which story I tell depends on my viewpoint - Does the story begin in 1991 , or 2001 ?
And which elements do I include ?
But either way , I 'm telling a story about how things got to this point .
Advertisement
So maybe a good plot is something that takes you from A to B to C without wrecking your suspension of disbelief , and keeps you guessing about what 's going to happen next .
And maybe a good story is something that delivers you at a destination , and in the end you understand how the journey all led up to this point .
The best works , of course , do both .
And the worst works do neither .
But I guess I tend to think of it as more of a continuum , with most works falling somewhere in the middle .
What do you think ?
Be careful , Jake .
This is too easy .
It may be a trap .

A coalition of labor unions and progressive groups has put up a billboard along I - 94 between Minneapolis and St. Paul calling on Gov. Tim Pawlenty to certify Al Franken as a U.S. senator .
Photo below :
Sen. Norm Coleman ( R ) is appealing Al Franken 's election victory in the Minnesota Supreme Court .
The group responsible for this looming reminder of the unresolved Senate race includes Americans United for Change , AFSCME , Alliance for a Better Minnesota , and the Minnesota affiliates of AFL - CIO and SEIU .
Americans United for Change has a history of attention - grabbing message strategy ( see its construction of a bus devoted to President Bush 's legacy ) , but the group says this is its first billboard .
It has previously run TV ads with the same message to Pawlenty .

Tabla actualizada al 31 de diciembre de 2019 , ahora desde el año de 1935 .
Esta tabla considera al año de 1935 como inicio de los 14 períodos presidenciales consecutivos que de manera estable se han desarrollado hasta ahora .
También considera que en el año de 1970 se logró el nivel más alto de salario mínimo , real al final de un sexenio , y con mayor poder adquisitivo de la historia , conservando la Inflación bajo control .
La columna de Salario Actual Equivalente muestra el nivel que debería tener el salario actual para poder tener el mismo poder adquisitivo que en el año comparado , una vez hecha la actualización por inflación .
Por ejemplo , si en 2019 , tuvimos un salario mínimo de $ 102.68 y queremos saber cuanto debiéramos ganar para tener un salario equivalente al de 1970 , subimos por la columna color canela hasta encontrar la intersección con 1970 y encontramos que el salario diario actualizado sería de $ 267.47 .
Lo que significa que el salario de 2019 , $ 102.68 , dividido entre $ 267.47 es igual a 0.3839 , y que multiplicado por 100 arroja el 38.39 % que es el poder de compra del salario actual , si se le compara con el año de 1970 .
O a su vez que el salario de 2018 ha perdido el 61.61 % de su poder adquisitivo en dicho período .
La columna de la extrema derecha muestra el porcentaje de Ganancia o Pérdida de Poder Adquisitivo con respecto al año de 1970 , que es la base o referencia de esta tabla .
La parte más importante que debemos observar y entender , es la forma en que el sexenio de Luis Echeverría , aumentó el Salario Mínimo por decreto presidencial ( decisión unilateral ) a pesar de que la Inflación estaba sin control .
El resultado del desastre no se dio en su sexenio , entregando al final de su mandato en 1976 , el salario en su nivel más alto , equivalente a un 31.6 % arriba de 1970 .
Este aumento ficticio y sin soporte , fue inútil pues al siguiente año empezó a bajar su poder adquisitivo .
Observar que los efectos de las decisiones de esa índole , no se reflejan hasta sexenios posteriores .
OJO , LOS QUE PRETENDEN QUE EL EJECUTIVO DEBE AUMENTAR LOS SALARIOS POR DECISIÓN UNILATERAL Y AUTORITARIA ..
Seis años de Populismo de López Portillo , no solamente hicieron perder lo ganado , sino que para 1982 lo entrega un 11.37 % debajo del poder adquisitivo que tenía en 1970 .
Después de 1982 , la pérdida de poder adquisitivo fue estrepitosa , entregándolo
De la Madrid en 1988 con una pérdida acumulada de 48.87 % , Carlos Salinas , en 1994 con una pérdida de 59.19 % , Zedillo en 2000 con pérdida de 68.93 % y Vicente Fox y Calderón , hasta fines de 2012 con pérdida de 69.36 % y estancado por { 12 años , con respecto al año de 1970 .
¿ Que significado tiene ? , significa que este simbólico salario , pero que todavía se utiliza en algunas regiones , solamente puede adquirir el 30 % de lo que adquiría en 1970 .
El Populismo en acción ha resultado ser el más desastroso fracaso económico de nuestra historia .
¿ Que tanto beneficio pudo lograr el sexenio de Vicente Fox en este tan crítico aspecto ?
La respuesta es fácil , por fin se pudo frenar la caída .
Con López Portillo el salario mínimo se quedó 182 puntos porcentuales abajo del crecimiento de la inflación , con De Lamadrid 1612 puntos porcentuales atrás de la inflación , con Salinas de Gortari quedó 48 puntos porcentuales atrás , con Zedillo quedó 77 puntos porcentuales atrás , pero con Vicente
Fox se logró al menos , detener la caída quedando a solo 1.36 puntos porcentuales del crecimiento inflacionario .
¿ Como quedó Felipe Calderón ?
Por desgracia prácticamente igual que Fox , se detuvo la caída ; pero mi percepción personal me dice , que mientras no se logre incrementar , de forma gradual , el nivel de los salarios , será imposible crecer en base al consumo interno .
Quizá por esta simple y llana razón el PAN perdió la presidencia en 2012 , se olvidó que lo primero es buscar el bienestar de los ciudadanos incrementando sus percepciones por trabajo realizado , no por dádivas .
OJO , no por dádivas compra votos , esto es aplicable a todos los gobiernos y a todos lo partidos por igual .
Con la alternancia a un gobierno del PRI , todo siguió igual ; los incrementos salariales entre 2013 y 2016 fueron ínfimos y por el contrario se incrementó la deuda y se repartió el dinero a manos llenas , sin que llegara efectivamente a los que más lo necesitan .
Para el 2017 se decidió incrementar el salario mínimo algunos puntos por arriba de la inflación , pero el gobierno , altamente endeudado , aplicó un brutal incremento a las gasolinas , GASOLINAZO , que redujo el beneficio previsto por causa del incremento inflacionario .
En 2019 una nueva alternancia , ahora un gobierno de izquierda que ha prometido grandes cambios , pero hay que ser muy cuidadoso al observar las acciones que tienden a darte algo a cambio de nada .
Eso es imposible , un gobierno altamente endeudado como el actual , no puede ni debe regalar nada , todo tiene un costo y no se puede cubrir con más deudas .
Los gobiernos populistas demuestran ser de corte paternalista y protector , requerimos gobiernos que trabajen y generen riqueza para sus habitantes , no para ellos mismos .
Ahora habrá que ver como evoluciona el presente sexenio y observar su desempeño .
¿ Te promete más dádivas o está pensando en crear más fuentes de empleo productivas , y una mejor y más justa retribución salarial por tu trabajo ?
Piénsalo bien ...

John N's colleague 's approach to problem solving is best described as follows .
The solution to any given problem is to introduce two additional problems .
While this approach generated quite a many interesting implementations , it rarely produced the needed results : simple , custom software for their clients .
Ultimately , this approach led towards his de-hiring , which meant that John would have to maintain his old systems .
One project that John inherited was a fairly simple web application that tracked overtime .
Simple , that is , from the front end .
The back end PHP code was responsible for querying a MySQL database with queries similar to this :
SELECT * FROM bean_overtime_availability WHERE `startDateTime` >= DATE ( NOW ( ) ) AND `available` = 1 ;
Seems simple enough , right ?
Here 's the code used to generate that query .
public function getOvertimeAvailability ( ) { $ c = new Criteria ( ) ; $ c->leftParenthesis ( ) ; $ c->field ( ' startDateTime ' ) ; $ c->greaterThanOrEqualTo( ) ; $ c->quote ( $ this ->getToday ( ) ) ; $ c->rightParenthesis ( ) ; $ c->and Criteria ( Criteria::newCriteria( ) -> field ( ' available ' ) -> equal ( )-> quote ( 1 ) ) ; $ c -> addString ( ' order by startDateTime ; ' ) ; return $ this ->getPersistenceLayer ( ) -> selectBeans ( $ this->getOvertimeAvailabilityBeanDefinition ( ) , $c ) ; }
Thinking that the code looked far too simple , John assumed the Criteria class was a kind of magical black box that performed some kind of SQL - fu to make things a lot easier / more efficient .
And then he peeked into the Criteria class .
class Criteria extends Object { protected function add ( $c ) { $ this -> getList ( ) -> add ( $ c ) ; } protected function getList ( ) { if ( is_null ( $ this -> list ) ) $ this -> list = new ArrayList ; return $ this -> list ; } public function leftParenthesis ( ) { $ this ->add ( ' ( ' ) ; return $ this ; } public function rightParenthesis ( ) { $ this ->add ( ' ) ' ) ; return $ this ; } public function comma ( ) { $ this -> add ( ' , ' ) ; return $ this ; } public function space ( ) { $ this -> add ( ' ' ) ; return $ this ; } public function quote ( $ text ) { $ this -> add ( " \" $ text \ " " ) ; return $ this ; } public function field ( $ text ) { $ this -> add ( " `$ text` " ) ; return $ this ; } public function equal ( ) { $ this -> add ( '= ' ) ; return $ this ; } public function null ( ) { $ this -> add ( ' null ' ) ; return $ this ; } public function in ( ) { $ this -> add ( ' in ' ) ; return $ this ; } public function not ( ) { $ this -> add ( ' !' ) ; return $ this ; } public function notEqual ( ) { $ this -> not ( ) ; $ this ->equals ( ) ; return $ this ; } public function less Than ( ) { $ this ->add ( ' < ' ) ; return $ this ; } public function lassThanOrEqualTo ( ) { $ this -> less Than ( ) ; $ this ->equals ( ) ; return $ this ; } public function greater Than ( ) { $ this -> add ( ' >' ) ; return $ this ; } public function greaterThanOrEqualTo ( ) { $ this -> greater Than ( ) ; $ this ->equal ( ) ; return $ this ; } public function addCriteria ( $c ) { $ this ->leftParenthesis ( ) ; $ this ->add ( $c->toString ( ) ) ; $ this ->rightParenthesis ( ) ; return $ this ; } public function operator ( $operator ) { $ this -> add ( $operator ) ; return $ this ; } public function and Criteria ( &$ c ) { $ this -> add ( ' and ' ) ; $ this ->leftParenthesis ( ) ; $ this -> add ( $ c ) ; $ this ->rightParenthesis ( ) ; } public function orCriteria ( &$ c ) { $ this -> add ( ' or ' ) ; $ this ->leftParenthesis ( ) ; $ this -> add ( $ c ) ; $ this ->rightParenthesis ( ) ; } public function addString ( $str ) { $ this -> add ( $ str ) ; return $ this ; } public function toString ( ) { return implode ( ' ' , $ this ->getList ( ) -> getItems ( ) ) ; } static function newCriteria ( ) { return new Criteria ( ) ; } }

This comforter was made for the creator 's sister Marty who is also a Sudoku fan and chose the nine fabrics for it :
" Those nine fabrics in the center medallion are placed just as the digits of a solved Sudoku puzzle would be placed , with each of the different fabrics representing the digits one through nine .
This machine - pieced and tied comforter measures 98 " X 106 " .
While I did n't follow the published pattern exactly , ( designed by Susan Maynard Arnold from Brookshier Design Studio ) I was happy to have the Sudoku solution it provided ; otherwise Marty would have had to solve that mathematical puzzle for me first ! "

When dining out professionally , there are several reasons why I will rarely order a salad .
One reason is that I am not there for my health .
We all need more green vegetables , but I take care of my body by eating responsibly at home .
Whatever else you might find in my fridge , at all times there are greens – rapini , broccoli , kale , green beans or snap peas – blanched , shocked and ready to be sautéed with garlic .
The presence of these ready - to - eat vegetables means that they find their way into early morning meals , at an hour where my groggy brain yearns for bacon , eggs , toasted rye or challah .
They are there as one might keep soap by the sink , or screwdrivers in a toolbox , ensuring that one does not wash one 's hands with shaving cream or fix a shelf with bacon .
Another mainstay of the fridge is a head of lettuce .
I buy a head of romaine or red leaf lettuce every few days .
That 's why I live in Kensington Market , so I can have fresh produce , fish and meat .
But not all of us can live near our food .
If I were a condo dweller , at the mercy of the local mini-mart , I might have to make do with shrink - wrapped food and jacked - up prices .
When I was a teenager , we lived in the suburbs , where we made a weekly drive to a stadium - sized supermarket .
There are lots of vegetables at the supermarket .
But you can't go there every day .
That relationship demanded that we load up our cart / car / home for the week , checking for expiry dates rather than fresh , ready - to - eat produce .
Of course , back then I did n't know how to prepare vegetables .
These days , late in the afternoon , I take my lettuce and toss it with olive oil , lemon and salt .
In this way , I manage a steady supply of vitamins A and K , as well as the daily recommended dose of snobbery , somehow missing from Health Canada 's website .
The second reason not to order salad is professional .
A review is supposed to communicate to the reader the experience of dining at a particular restaurant .
Yes , it is important to inform the reader about the variety of food on the menu , not just my favourites .
And perhaps some diners would like to know what the salad tastes like .
But nearly every Western restaurant in this city serves a salad of baby spinach , roast beets and goat cheese .
The additions vary .
Sometimes there are walnuts or fancy , coloured beets – yellow or striped – other times a splash of truffle oil enters the story .
Rarely does it change much .
And more than once I have written of this salad , only to edit out the 50 or so words to make space for descriptions of more interesting food .
If there is an interesting salad , like the raw kale with tahini dressing at Live organic food bar , or the niçoise at downtown 's Forte restaurant , you will hear of it .
The all - iceberg lettuce salad on the opening menu at Grace restaurant on College St. was worth writing about .
Until I began this job , I had never been able to afford eating out on a regular basis .
These days I am lucky .
I am not too busy to make a salad .
And I spent enough years cooking for a living , so that I never consider the production of single meal to be a big thing .
When I eat out , it is a financial and dietary luxury .
But the most important reason to avoid salad is that eating out is supposed to be fun .
We all have our own relationship with restaurants .
They are a place to celebrate a special occasion .
Or they represent adventure , an opportunity to try new foods .

To a lot of urbanites , they are a prime source of sustenance .
There are Torontonians who eat out every day .
For them , salad is a healthy break .
Some believe that restaurants should not just feed us , but watch our calories , too .
There are often low - cal / low - carb options to appeal to this group .
There is even a Bay St. restaurant , Four , where all the dishes have fewer than 650 calories .
For me , restaurants are my job , but also my entertainment .
I find bars too crowded .
I love movies , but I am miserable in movie theatres .
Eating out is the one social act I participate in , and I would like it to be fun , not medicinal .
I no more want to put on my pants and leave home in order to eat a salad , than I would to eat bran pills or drink cough syrup .
how to find an alien forest
Light from alien worlds could have a telltale signal of a forest , hinting at an entire extraterrestrial ecosystem .
Illustration by Tyler Smith
Chirality seems to be a hot topic in astrobiology this month .
Just a few weeks ago , astrobiologists at NASA announced that they found a possible explanation as to why the amino acids present in all life forms we know today wind to the left .
Now , another team of scientists is taking what we know about chirality to a whole new level and thinking of using telescopes to hunt for vast bacterial colonies and forests on alien worlds .
In their experiments , photosynthetic organisms like cyanobacteria and plants polarize the light they reflect to produce a signature of the handedness of their molecules .
This means that a telescope able to image a planet in another solar system could detect a strong biomarker and let us know that the world we ’re seeing is not only habitable , but inhabited .
Now for the technical part .
While the molecular structure of amino acids in all living things on Earth is wound to the left due to the potential influence from meteors that fell to our young planet as it was forming , not every molecule in our bodies has a left - handed chirality .
Some compounds in our DNA are actually right - handed .
So what good would it do to look for polarized light from an alien forest which would probably have both right - and left - handed molecules present in its basic makeup ?
According to the team , light reflected by photosynthetic organisms has a bias towards a particular chirality in stark contrast to various minerals used as controls in their experiment .
Minerals have a fairly random distribution of chiralities and do n’t polarize light as definitively as living things .
Even water rich meteorites , which can have up to 18 % more left - handed molecules , would n’t be as homochiral .
This homochirality is what an “ astrobotanist ” would try to find in the spectrum of light from an extrasolar world .
Having a clear bias towards a particular handedness should be a sign of heredity and heredity is a sign of living things .
With a strong bias to the right or the left coming off the planet ’s flora or enormous colonies of microscopic fauna , we could safely theorize that we ’ve found an alien biosphere .
And since we’d be doing this light years away , we would n’t have to fret about cross-contamination tainting our data .
The idea of looking for photosynthetic aliens has been around for a while and was discussed in a Scientific American cover story which goes into another intriguing detail ; the possible colors of plants on other worlds .
On planets orbiting a very bright star , they could be blue to reflect most of the light they get .
If they did n’t , they ’d absorb too much energy and fry themselves to a crisp .
Around small , dim stars , the picture could be very different with black plants trying absorb any light they can .
Finally , around young flare stars , plants might need to be aquatic which would pose a big problem for telescopes .
Water would alter whatever light is being reflected by the extraterrestrial flora and potentially interfere with spectrometry readings .
Of course this is all based on our understanding of photosynthesis and that understanding is limited to one planet .
There ’s really no telling what a forest on a faraway planet would look like .
Originally , trying to give potential colors to alien plants was suggested as a quick and dirty way for an astronomer to figure out whether there might be something interesting on the planet ’s surface when we can build telescopes powerful and agile enough to take snapshots of exoplanets .
But the idea of looking for a chemical signature of heredity would skip the problems associated with guessing what photosynthetic alien biospheres would look like on a planetary scale and could make it easier to detect a more persuasive indicator for life than unidentifiable colored patches measuring less than a fraction of a fraction of a pixel at best .

Is that not an astonishing ruling ?
Same - sex couples who were married several months ago did so legally , but couples seeking the same status today seek an illegal contract -- illegal because of religious insanity .
Excuse me a second while my head explodes .
In other words , in the brief time after the first Supreme Court ruling on this issue in May 2008 until the religious crazies could get a ballot initiative before the voters last November -- a total of six months -- same - sex marriage was legal .
Now it 's not .
WTF ?
Today 's ruling indicates the Court was unwilling to , in effect , nullify the decision by a majority of California voters ( 52 % to 48 % ) who decided in the November 2008 initiative to deny the legal , civil right of marriage to couples who happened to be of the same sex .
That decision had , of course , no basis in law -- except mob law -- and had its origins exclusively in religious nuttiness and church - ordered persecution .
Today 's ruling codifies the right of the majority to tyrannize the minority -- at the very least where it concerns denying legal status to people who happen to be homosexual .
How else should one read the decision ?
It was only a year ago that the California Supreme Court struck down the state 's ban on same - sex marriage , saying sexual orientation , like race or gender , " does not constitute a legitimate basis upon which to deny or withhold legal rights " including , obviously , the right to sign a marriage contract that contains the same rights and responsibilities whether the signatories are homosexual or heterosexual .
Last year , writing for the 4 - 3 majority , Chief Justice Ronald George wrote , " We therefore conclude that in view of the substance and significance of the fundamental constitutional right to form a family relationship , the California Constitution properly must be interpreted to guarantee this basic civil right to all Californians , whether gay or heterosexual , and to same - sex couples as well as to opposite - sex couples . "
The ruling was comparable to the 1967 U.S. Supreme Court ruling in a Virginia case overturning that state 's ban on interracial marriage ( which was also a religious nut - ball ban to begin with ) .
The California ruling was about civil marriage ; about fundamental , equal rights under the law .
It has nothing to do with religion .
People who want to worship a god or an animal or a piece of furniture have a legal right to deny sanctifying a marriage between people who do not worship a god or an animal or a piece of furniture .
And that 's where it ends .
The State issues a marriage license , not a snarling pack of religious bigots .
But , we know the story of Prop 8 , do n't we .
Shortly after last year 's ruling on the denial of the civil right of marriage , the religious a** holes went to work and Proposition 8 was born in an attempt ( today proven successful ) to duplicate a 2000 voter referendum that banned same - sex marriage .
It was that law that was struck down in May of 2008 .
So , what now ?
For the time being , the Equal Protection Clause , part of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution , is dead , murdered in California by religious freaks who insist god said he did n't want the queers to marry .
The Clause provides that " no state shall ... deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws . "
Hey , ask any religious idiot and he or she will tell you without hesitation : " Gawd 's law is waaayyyyy more important than man 's law . "
The California Supreme Court today agreed with that steaming pile of religious bullshit .

Aussie Rules Football Player Tim Orchard Flashes His Penis Live On Air
Most athletes are content to just sit background in the locker room while a teammate is being interviewed on television .
Some might make a strange face or gesture .
In Australia , they take out their penises .
Tim Orchard of AFL Tasmania ’s Clarence has been suspended for the rest of the season after flashing his penis on television .
This was n’t a Visanthe Shiancoe incident either , as aside from having his junk out , Orchard was fully clothed .
Clarence club president Richard Mulligan said , “ We unreservedly apologise for any offence that may have been occasioned by the inappropriate action of the player concerned .
Certainly we consider it a very serious matter , one which goes to the very essence of the credibility and the public image of our footy club , and we ’ll take action accordingly . ”
Tim Orchard indeed issued an apology and will have to undergo counseling and perform community service .
Has n’t he interacted with the community enough already ?
Given all of the controversy about the sexual exploits of Australian Football League players , having a guy hang out with his wang out on live TV is n’t going to do anything to improve their image .
Or maybe it will get more viewers , who knows ?

May 22 , 2009 -- Japan has the world 's greatest life expectancy , and it's more than twice the life expectancy in Sierra Leone .
That 's according to a new report , World Health Statistics 2009 , issued by the World Health Organization .
The report shows that children younger than 5 account for nearly 20 % of the world 's deaths , and that child mortality is a major reason for the wide range in life expectancy among countries .
The World Health Organization 's new report is based on data from 2007 , the most recent year for which global life expectancy statistics are available .
The report shows that 14 countries had life expectancies of at least 81 years .
Here are those countries , along with their life expectancy for babies born in 2007 :
Japan : 83
Australia , Iceland , Italy , San Marino : 82
Andorra , France , Israel , Monaco , New Zealand , Norway , Singapore , Spain , Sweden : 81
At the other end of the life expectancy spectrum , 15 countries had life expectancy below age 50 .
Here are those countries and their life expectancy for babies born in 2007 :
Sierra Leone : 41
Afghanistan : 42
Lesotho , Zimbabwe : 45
Chad , Zambia : 46
Central African Republic , Guinea - Bissau , Mozambique , Swaziland , Uganda : 48
Burkina Faso , Burundi , Mali : Nigeria 49
In the U.S. , life expectancy for a baby born in 2007 is 78 years .
Chile , Cuba , Denmark , Kuwait , Slovenia , and the United Arab Emirates share that same life expectancy .
Obama committed to Iraq troop pullout despite attacks June 25 BARACK Obama is having no second thoughts about pulling US troops out of Iraqi cities , despite attacks that have killed 150 people in the past week , the White House says .
The latest incident , just six days before a deadline for American soldiers to withdraw from the cities , towns and villages under an agreement with Iraq , killed at least 62 people when a bomb went off in a Baghdad market .
White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said the top US commander in Iraq , General Ray Odierno , had told Mr Obama the deadline would be kept .
“ I know the president has had meetings and continues to have meetings about ensuring that we 're making sufficient political progress on the ground , ” Mr Gibbs said .
“ General Odierno has mentioned that we have seen violence greatly decrease even in the past many months from what it was , and he feels confident in moving forward . ”
Asked whether Mr Obama had any second thoughts about the pull back , or whether he had approached the Iraqi government about a change in arrangements , Mr Gibbs said : “ No , No . ”
Violence has dropped markedly in Iraq in recent months , with May seeing the lowest Iraqi death toll since the 2003 invasion .
But attacks remain common , particularly in Baghdad and Mosul .
Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki warned earlier this month that insurgents and militiamen were likely to step up their attacks in the coming weeks in a bid to undermine confidence in the Iraqi security forces .

With due deference to George Orwell , all contracts are equal .
But some contracts are more equal than others .
Contracts entered into by the hotshots at American International Group for $ 165 million in bonuses , signed just months before their web of financial cunning unraveled , are inviolate .
Contracts entered into by shop - floor workers at auto plants must be renegotiated , so that the taxpayers who bail out the industry do n’t coddle supposedly overpaid union members .
Contracts that secured “ retention ” bonuses for the same wizards who engineered the flimsy financial products that helped bring down the world economy went to 73 individuals who received $ 1 million or more — with the top honcho getting $ 6.4 million .
Contracts that secured retiree health benefits for autoworkers with creation of a special trust are being rewritten so that carmakers can use their own cut -rate stocks , not cash , to help fund their obligation to elderly people who once worked on assembly lines .
Contracts that were crafted at AIG early in 2008 — a few months before taxpayers sent their first installment of bailout money to the insatiable insurance giant — must stand .
The deals guaranteed that some bonus recipients would lock in as much money as they had received in 2007 , before the company ’s downward spiral .
Contracts agreed to by the United Auto Workers in 2007 trimmed wages and created the controversial trust for retiree health benefits that allowed the automakers to effectively remove some costs of the promised benefits from their own balance sheets .
That contract does not stand .
As just renegotiated by Ford — which did n’t take federal bailout money — and the UAW , workers gave up cost - of - living adjustments , two years of “ bonuses ” they ’d been promised instead of wage hikes , vacation days , break time and other benefits .
Rules are to be changed so that workers can stay on the job more than eight hours in variable shifts , without being paid overtime .
UAW President Ron Gettelfinger told Congress in December that workers and retirees both were ready “ to make further sacrifices ” to ensure the industry ’s viability in the wake of the credit crisis — a crisis caused in part by AIG ’s exotic financial instruments .
“ We are willing to do our part , ” Gettelfinger told the Senate Banking Committee .
AIG chief Edward Liddy told a House subcommittee Wednesday that though he runs a company now 80 percent owned by the taxpayers , it still must operate as a business that takes account of the “ cold realities ” of competition for customers , revenue and , yes , employees .
Because of this and “ certain legal obligations , ” the big bonus payouts went into the pockets of some of the people who messed up the credit markets so badly that average Americans now have trouble getting car loans and auto dealers struggle to keep operating .
AIG has thus far received $ 170 billion in taxpayer money .
General Motors , the car company considered to be in the deepest trouble , got $ 13.4 billion .
GM is currently in negotiations with the UAW that are likely to result in more concessions from the union .
Larry Summers , the chief White House economic adviser , said on Sunday that AIG ’s bonuses had to go through because “ there are contracts .
The government cannot just abrogate contracts . ”
Summers made the comments to ABC News three days after President Barack Obama learned of the bonus payments but uttered not a word publicly about them .
Now the White House and Congress are ablaze with indignation and vow to try to recoup every penny .
New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo , quicker and more sure - footed than the lethargic Obama administration , got an accounting of how the millions were doled out .
It shows , among other things , that 11 of those who received “ retention ” bonuses of $ 1 million or more — including an employee who pocketed $ 4.6 million — no longer work at the firm .
The top seven bonus recipients received more than $ 4 million each .
The top - tier wage for production workers at UAW plants is about $ 28 an hour .
New hires are paid $ 14 an hour .
Cuomo conveyed the preliminary results of his AIG probe in a letter to Barney Frank , chairman of the House Financial Services Committee .
“ Something is deeply wrong with this outcome , ” Cuomo wrote .
Something , indeed .

" If the US were to shift to a system of universal coverage and a single payer , as in Canada , the savings in administrative costs [ 10 percent of health spending ] would be more than enough to offset the expense of universal coverage " ( " Canadian Health Insurance : Lessons for the United States , " 10 pgs , ref no : T - HRD - 91 - 35 .

December , 1991 Congressional Budget Office
" If the nation adopted ...[ a ] single - payer system that paid providers at Medicare ’s rates , the population that is currently uninsured could be covered without dramatically increasing national spending on health .
In fact , all US residents might be covered by health insurance for roughly the current level of spending or even somewhat less , because of savings in administrative costs and lower payment rates for services used by the privately insured .
The prospects for con-trolling health care expenditure in future years would also be improved . "
( " Universal Health Insurance Coverage Using Medicare ’s Payment Rates " )
April , 1993 Congressional Budget Office
" Under a single payer system with co-payments ... on average , people would have an additional $ 54 to spend ... more specifically , the increase in taxes ... would be about $ 856 per capita ... private - sector costs would decrease by $ 910 per capita .
The net cost of achieving universal insurance coverage under this single payer system would be negative . "
" Under a single payer system without co-payments people would have $ 144 a year less to spend than they have now , on average ... consumer payments for health would fall by $ 1,118 per capita , but taxes would have to increase by $ 1,261 per capita to finance this plan . "

July , 1993 Congressional Budget Office
" Enactment of H.R. 1300 [ Russo ’s single payer bill ] would raise national health expenditures at first , but reduce spending about 9 percent in 2000 .
As the program was phased in , the administrative savings from switching to a single - payer system would offset much of the increased demand for health care serv-ices .
Later , the cap on the growth of the national health budget would hold the rate of growth of spending below the baseline .
The bill contains many of the elements that would make its limit on expenditures reasonably likely to succeed , including a single payment mechanism , uniform reporting by all providers , and global prospective budgets for hospitals and nursing homes . "
( " Estimates of Health Care Proposals from the 102nd Congress " ref : CBO paper , July 1993 , 57 pages )
December , 1993 Congressional Budget Office
S491 ( Senator Paul Wellstone ’s single payer bill ) would raise national health expenditures above baseline by 4.8 percent in the first year after implementation .
However , in subsequent years , improved cost containment and the slower growth in spending associated with the new system would reduce the gap between expenditures in the new system and the baseline .
By year five ( and in subsequent years ) the new system would cost less than baseline .
( " S.491 , American Health Security Act of 1993 " )
June , 1998 , Economic Policy Institute
" In the model presented in this paper , it is assumed that in the first year after implementing a universal , single - payer plan , total national health expenditures are unchanged from baseline .
If expenditures were higher than baseline in the first few years , then additional revenues above those described here would be needed .
However , these higher costs would be more than offset by savings which would accrue within the first decade of the program . "
Universal coverage could be financed with a 7 percent payroll tax , a 2 percent income tax , and current federal payments for Medicare , Medicaid , and other state and federal government insurance programs .
A 2 percent income tax would offset all other out - of - pocket health spending for individuals .
" For the typical , middle income household , taxes would rise by $ 731 annually .
For fully 60 % of households , the increase would average about $ 1,600 ... costs would be redistributed from the sick to the healthy , from the low and middle - income house - holds to those with higher incomes , and from businesses currently providing health benefits to those that do not .
" Even more important , greater efficiency and improved cost containment would become possible , leading to sizable savings in the future .
The impediment to fundamental reform in health care financing is not economic , but political .
Political will , not economic expertise , is what will bring about this important change . "

State Studies
November 1994 : New Mexico
Single Payer could save $ 151.8 million and cover all the uninsured
The Lewin consulting group was hired to perform a fiscal study of alternative reform plans for the state of New Mexico .
The study looked at single payer , managed competition , and an individual and employer - mandate .
The study concluded that a single - payer system with modest cost - sharing was the only plan that would cover all the uninsured and save over $ 150 million per year ( estimates given for 1998 ) .
Such a plan could be financed with a payroll tax of 7.92 percent ( employer 80 percent / employee 20 percent ) and a 2 percent tax on family income .
If patient cost sharing was eliminated , the single payer program would cover all the uninsured for a net increase in costs of $ 9.1 million .
The group ’s estimates of administrative savings were very conservative , about half of what other estimates have found .
Thus , it is likely that a single payer program in the state of New Mexico could provide coverage for all the uninsured with no increase in current health resources .

April 1995 : Delaware
Single Payer would save money in Delaware
A fiscal study of single payer in Delaware by Solutions for Progress found that Delaware could save $ 229 million in the first year ( 1995 ) .
In ten years , the cumulative savings would exceed $ 6 billion , over $ 8,000 for every person in Delaware .

The study ’s authors ’ note that they used a low estimate for administrative savings while using a high estimate for increased costs for utilization in order to assure a high margin for error and adequate funding .

Single Payer to save Minnesota over $ 718 million in health costs each year
A March 1995 study conducted by Lewin- VHI for the Minnesota legislature found that single - payer with modest co-pays would insure all Minnesotans and save Minnesota over $ 718 million health costs each year .
The projected savings are conservative since Lewin - VHI global budgets or fee schedules to control costs .

" In early 1997 , the Massachusetts Medical Society retained the services of two consulting teams to independently analyze the relative costs of a Canadian style single - payer system , and the current multi-payer health care system in Massachusetts . "
" While Lewin and SFP / BUSPH reports differed in their orientations and methodologies , they reached similar conclusions .
First , a single - payer system would achieve significant administrative savings [ between $ 1.8 and $ 3.6 billion ] over the current multi-payer system .
Secondly , these savings are of such a magnitude that the available funds would be sufficient to insure universal coverage in the state and provide comprehensive benefits including outpatient medications and long - term care and eliminate all out - of - pocket payments ( co- payments , deductibles ) . "
" The major difference in the studies findings had to do with the timing of achieving the cost savings .
SFP / BUSPH estimated that the savings could be in the first year of implementation of the system .
Lewin felt the savings would begin in year six . "

Single Payer only plan to cover all and save money in Massachusetts
In the summer of 2001 , the legislature allocated $ 250,000 to develop a plan for " universal health care with consolidated financing " for Massachusetts .
The pro-HMO consulting firm LECG studied three options ; only the single - payer option met the study criteria .
Despite their industry bias LECG reported 40 percent of every health care dollar spent in the state of Massachusetts goes to administrative costs .
The initial LECG report had two major flaws :
It did not include the costs of taking care of the uninsured in the non-single - payer plans , and it did not take into consideration the huge administrative savings possible under single - payer .
If these factors are taken into account , single payer is the only plan to cover everyone and save money .

June , 2000 : Maryland
Single Payer Would Save Money in Maryland
A single - payer system in the state of Maryland could provide health care for all residents and save $ 345 million on total health care spending in the first year , according to a study by the D.C. based consulting firm Lewin , Inc .
The study also found that a highly regulated " pay or play " system ( in which employers either provide their workers with coverage or pay into a state insurance pool ) would increase costs by $ 207 million .
Editors ’ Note :
The pro-business Lewin group probably underestimated the administrative savings from single payer and overestimated the administrative savings ( and hence understated the costs ) of their " pay or play " model .
Data from hospitals in Hawaii , where there are only a few major insurers , suggest that if you have more than one payer , there are few administrative savings .
However single - payer systems in Canada , the U.K. , Sweden and other countries have garnered administrative savings substantially larger than assumed by Lewin .
Hence the estimate by Lewin that single - payer universal coverage would cost $ 550 million less to implement in the first year than " pay or play " is high .

Universal Health Care Makes " Business Sense "
Single - payer universal health coverage could save Vermonters more than $ 118 million a year over current medical insurance costs and cover every Vermonter in the process , according to a study paid for by a federal grant and prepared for the Office of Vermont Health Access by the Lewis Group .
" Our analysis indicates that the single payer model would cover all Vermont residents , including the estimated 51,390 uninsured persons in the state , while actually reducing total health spending in Vermont by about $ 118.1 million in 2001 ( i.e. , five percent ) .
These savings are attributed primarily to the lower cost of administering coverage through a single government program with uniform coverage and payment rules "

April 2002 : California
State Health Care Options Project
A study of nine options for covering California ’s seven million uninsured by the conservative D.C. - based consulting firm of Lewin , Inc found that a single payer system in California would reduce health spending while covering everyone and protecting the doctor - patient relationship .
Three of the nine options analyzed by Lewin for their fiscal implications included single payer financing .
1. ) A proposal by James Kahn , UCSF , Kevin Grumbach , UCSF , Krista Farley , MD , Don McCanne , MD , PNHP , and Thomas Bodenheimer , UCSF , would cover nearly all health care services including prescription drugs , vision and dental for every Californian through a government - financed system while saving $ 7.6 billion annually from the estimated $ 151.8 billion now spent on health care .
2. ) A second proposal by Ellen Shaffer , UCSF - national health service - Would reform both financing of and the delivery system so that every Californian has a " medical home " , that is , a primary care physician with an ongoing relationship with that patient .
Like the Kahn et al proposal , it saves about $ 7.5 billion through various efficiencies .
3. ) The third by Judy Spelman , RN , and Health care for All , covers care for every Californian in a manner similar to the Kahn et al proposal but eliminates all out - of - pocket costs .
Its cost savings are estimated at $ 3.7 billion .
All three proposals stabilize the health care system , reduce paperwork , and protect the doctor - patient relationship by eliminating the role of for - profit HMOs and insurers .
The Kahn et al proposal envisions that the not - profit Kaiser Permanente , the state ’s largest integrated health system , would continue .

December 2002 : Maine
Single Payer an economically feasible option for Maine
The June 2001 Maine legislature created a nineteen member Health Security Board to develop a single payer system for Maine .
In July , the Board contracted with the consulting firm Mathematica Policy Research , Inc , ( MPA ) firm to study the feasibility of single payer in the state .
The firm found that single payer would cost about the same amount as the current system , while covering all 150,000 uninsured residents .
Depending on the benefits provided by the system , single payer would cost the same as current state health spending , or increase health spending by 5 percent .
( Note , the consultants were very conservative when estimating administrative savings , which could more than offset the 5 percent increase ) .
" Estimates from the model indicate that , under current policy , health care spending in Maine will continue on a path of steady increase — rising by 37 percent between 2001 - 04 and by 31 percent between 2004 - 08 .
The model projects that a single - payer health system would produce a net increase in total health care spending under most benefit designs that MPA estimated , but this increase in spending would decline over time as the system realizes savings through global budgeting , reductions in administrative costs , and enhanced access to primary and preventive care . "
" By reducing administrative spending and increasing overall demand for health care , a single payer system would generate some change in employment in Maine ...
However a single payer plan would improve health sector productivity by redistributing jobs from administrative to clinical positions . "
" In summary , a single payer system appears to be economically feasible for Maine . "

November 2002 : Rhode Island
Single Payer would save $ 270 million in Rhode Island
A study of single - payer in Rhode Island by analysts with Boston University School of Public Health and the consulting firm Solutions for Progress found that current health spending in Rhode Island is 21.5 percent above the national average and that incremental reforms cannot solve the state ’s health problems .
Solutions for Progress studied two models of single payer reform one with consolidated financing alone , and one with consolidated financing combined with " professionalism within a budget . "
They found that without health care reform , Rhode Island ’s costs would continue to rise , while both models of single - payer could provide universal coverage while saving an estimated $ 270 million in the first year .
At first , the administrative and bulk purchasing savings have the largest impact .
But over time , slowing the rate of inflation to 4 percent by making health professionals responsible for using resources prudently , ( " professionalism within a budget " ) has a larger impact .
Over six years , they estimate that consolidated financing alone would save $ 4.4 billion , while single payer with " professionalism within a budget " delivery system reform would save over $ 6.6 billion .
Again , both models of single payer would provide coverage for all the uninsured and improve coverage for all Rhode Islanders .

October 2003 : Missouri
Single Payer Would Save $ 1.3 billion in Missouri
Missouri Foundation for Health conducted a study on " health care expenditures and insurance in Missouri " .
A single payer health care plan in the state of Missouri would reduce overall spending by about $ 3 billion .
" Assuming the universal health care plan adopted a benefit package typically found in the state , spending among the uninsured and underinsured would rise by nearly $ 1.3 billion when fully implemented .
On the other hand , the use of a streamlined single claims and billing form ( electronically billed ) would reduce overall spending by about $ 3 billion .
As a result health care spending would decline by approximately $ 1.7 billion . "
" Even if the state would adopt a more generous benefit package - one more generous than 75 percent of all private insurance benefits in the state - overall spending would decline .
Overall health care spending would likely decline by $ 1.3 billion under the streamlined administrative structure . "

California could save $ 344 billion over 10 years with single payer
A study by the Lewin Group , finds that singlepayer would save California $ 343.6 billion in health care costs over the next 10 years , mainly by cutting administration and using bulk purchases of drugs and medical equipment .
The bill ’s author , Sen. Sheila Kuehl , D - Santa Monica , said the report " demonstrates that we can do it .
We need the will to do it .
It makes insurance affordable for everybody . "
Lewin Group Report : The Health Care for All Californians Act : Cost and Economic Impacts Analysis
January 19 , 2005
Fact Sheet
* The Lewin report , prepared by an independent firm with 18 years of experience in healthcare cost analysis , affirms that we can create a fiscally sound , reliable state insurance plan that covers all Californians and controls health cost inflation .
*
The Lewin report shows that all California residents can have affordable health insurance ; and that , on average , individuals , families , businesses and the state of California , all of whom are now burdened with rising insurance costs , will save money .
* In February , State Senator Sheila Kuehl ( D - 23 ) will introduce the California Health Insurance Reliability Act ( CHIRA ) , based on these findings .
CHIRA , based on the Lewin Report model will insure every Californian and allow everyone to choose his or her own doctor .
Savings Overall
The Lewin report model would achieve universal coverage while actually reducing total health spending for California by about $ 8 billion in the first year alone .
Savings would be realized in two ways :
The Act would replace the current system of multiple public and private insurers with a single , reliable insurance plan .
This saves about $ 20 billion in administrative costs .
California would buy prescription drugs and durable medical equipment ( e.g. , wheelchairs ) in bulk and save about $ 5.2 billion .
Savings for State and Local Governments
* In addition , state and local governments would save about $ 900 million , in the first year , in spending for health benefits provided to state and local government workers and retirees .
* Aggregate savings to state and local governments from 2006 to 2015 would be about $ 43.8 billion .
Savings for Businesses
* Employers who currently offer health benefits would realize average savings of 16 % compared to the current system .
Savings for families *
Average family spending for health care is estimated to decline to about $ 2,448 per family under the Act in 2006 , which is an average savings of about $ 340 per family .
* Families with under $ 150,000 in annual income would , on average , see savings ranging between $ 600 and $ 3,000 per family under the program in 2006 .
Cost Controls *
By 2015 , health spending in California under the Act would be about $ 68.9 billion less than currently projected .
Total savings over the 2006 through 2015 period would be $ 343.6 billion .
* Savings to state and local governments over this ten - year period would be about $ 43.8 billion .
Comprehensive Benefits
* The Lewin Report assumes an insurance plan that covers medical , dental and vision care ; prescription drug ; emergency room services , surgical and recuperative care ; orthodontia ; mental health care and drug rehabilitation ; immunizations ; emergency and other necessary transportation ; laboratory and other diagnostic services ; adult day care ; all necessary translation and interpretation ; chiropractic care , acupuncture , case management and skilled nursing care .
Efficiencies *
The Lewin Report shows that efficiencies in the system make these superior benefits available while generating savings .
Freedom to Choose
* The Lewin Report model assumes the consumer ’s freedom to choose his or her own care providers .
This means that each Californian will be free to change jobs , start a family , start a business , continue education and or change residences , secure in the knowledge that his or her relationships with trusted caregivers will be secure .

Impacts of Health Care Reform : Projections of Costs and Savings
By Kenneth E. Thorpe , Ph.D .
This fiscal analysis of the impact of four scenarios for health care reform found that the single payer model would reduce costs by over $ 1.1 trillion over the next decade while providing comprehensive benefits to all Americans .
The other scenarios would be improvements over the status quo , but would not reduce costs as dramatically or provide the same high - quality coverage to all .
Summary of the Coalition ’s Specifications :
Health Care Coverage for All
Cost Management
Improvement of Health Care Quality and Safety
Equitable Financing
Simplified Administration
Reform Models studied :
Scenario 1 : employer mandates ( supplemented with individual mandates as necessary )
Scenario 2 : expansion of existing public programs that cover subsets of the uninsured
Scenario 3 : creation of new programs targeted at subsets of the uninsured ( FEHBP model )
Scenario 4 : establishment of a universal publicly financed program ( single payer )

Single Payer Results , Excerpt :
COLORADO HEALTH SERVICES SINGLE PAYER PROGRAM
The Colorado Health Services ( CHS ) Program is a single payer plan that would provide coverage to all residents of the state , including state and local workers , and residents currently covered under Medicare , Tricare , Veteran ’s Health , Indian Health Services and Federal Health Benefits programs .
The program would provide all people with comprehensive health care benefits that cover the same list of services now covered by the Colorado Medicaid benefits package .
Consumers would have their choice of providers and hospitals within the state .
0 - number remaining uninsured
$ 1.4 billion - decline in health spending
All Other Plans , Results , excerpt :
BETTER HEALTH CARE FOR COLORADO
Better Health Care for Colorado provides a path to universal health care through a public program expansion and access to private insurance coverage with low - income subsidies through a Health Insurance Exchange .
Individuals eligible for public programs would receive benefits under those programs , and individuals who purchase private coverage would have access to a limited core set of benefits , with premiums copays .
467,200 - number remaining uninsured
$ 595 million - increase in health spending
SOLUTIONS FOR A HEALTHY COLORADO
Solutions for a Healthy Colorado provides coverage to all Colorado residents under a Core Limited Benefit Plan in the private sector and expands coverage under Medicaid and Child Health Plus ( CHP + ) .
People who are low income but who would not be eligible for the government programs would receive a premium subsidy .
133,400 - number remaining uninsured
$ 271 million - increase in health spending
A PLAN FOR COVERING COLORADO
A Plan for Covering Coloradans provides coverage to Coloradans through a public program expansion and a mandatory private pool for all residents not eligible for the public program .
It provides a minimum benefits package in a private pool and premium assistance based on income for those who cannot afford insurance .
All plans would provide a comprehensive minimum benefits package , and differ mainly on cost - sharing amounts .
106,500 - number remaining uninsured
$ 1.3 billion - increase in health spending

Comment by Dr. Don McCanne , PNHP Senior Health Policy Fellow :
Once again , fiscal analysis shows that the models of reform that build on our highly flawed , fragmented system of financing health care actually increase health care spending while falling far short on the goals of reform .
In contrast , the single payer model would provide truly comprehensive care for absolutely everyone while significantly reducing health care spending .
December , 2007 : Kansas
Single Payer would save $ 869 million
The Kansas Health Policy Authority hired the consulting firm of Schramm - Raleigh to do a fiscal analysis of five options for expanding coverage .
They found that single payer ( " the Mountain plan " ) would cover all the uninsured and reduce state health spending by $ 869 million annually .
The other plans would cover a portion of the uninsured and would raise costs between $ 150 million to $ 500 million in the state .

http://www.healthfund.org/...
Only Available Comparative Analysis of Current Proposals :
At this time the best we have from 2009 is the Commonwealth Fund / Lewin Group study from February 2009 showing that their proxy for single payer ( Stark ) was the only plan to control total cost U.S. costs and the only plan to actually get to 100 % coverage , better than the Obama / Congressional Democrats proposal of pubic option and mandates ( what they called Building Blocks ) , and of way way better than various other mostly Republican proposals :
Change in Health Spending by Stakeholder Group , Billions of Dollars , 2010
Key :
Stark = Single Payer - like ; total costs - 58.1 Billion ( that is 58 billion less to the country as a whole )
Building Blocks = mainstream Democratic proposal with public option and mandates .
+17.8 Billion ( that 's 17 billion more to the country as a whole ) .
Conclusion :
Everybody , good public option folks and other Americans , should know what we are getting with the best that we are being allowed to get now ... and what we are not getting !
For now , there ought to be a complete , honest , side - by - side comparison of all proposals , including single payer , by the Congressional Budget Office .
Per the table above , the side - by - side comparison should include not only the Federal government costs , but also the projected total U.S. cost and the costs to other stakeholders including state and local governments , employers and to individual , families and households of different income levels .
This is important , so that when we have to fight this again in a few years , it will be clear that the failures of the reform of 2009 were not due to government and Democrats doing too much , but were due to the failure to do enough and go to single payer national health insurance .
Update 2 :
Several folks do n't seem to get / believe / understand that single payer really is the best ( only ? ) way to get to 100 % universal coverage that is comprehensive in what it covers and yes , really controls both total costs ( e.g. %- GNP ) and cost to individuals and families ( e.g. , total of taxes + premiums + out - of - pocket ) .

Deep brain stimulation could help make memories .
Mice grew active neurons after deep brain stimulation .
Punchstock / Photodisc
Electrodes inserted into certain parts of the brain — in a technique known as deep brain stimulation — can stimulate the growth of new neurons that are used in memory formation , according to research in mice .
The findings show that artificially created neurons can be fully functional — a topic of hot debate in the neuroscience community .
Knowing that the cells are functional , rather than just useless growths , is a boost for those seeking to use the treatment against Alzheimer 's disease and other memory - degeneration disorders .
" I 'm hoping to help people who have difficulty remembering things , " says Scellig Stone , a neurosurgery resident and PhD candidate at the University of Toronto .
One of Stone 's supervisors , Paul Frankland of the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto , presented the results at the annual meeting of the Canadian Association for Neuroscience in Vancouver , Canada , on 25 May .
In his study , Stone electrically stimulated part of the limbic system in the brains of mice for an hour .
Rodent brains normally produce thousands of new neurons a day ; by 3 – 5 days after the procedure , the electrical stimulation had doubled that .
During this time of high neuron growth , the team injected the mice with iododeoxyuridine to label the newly formed cells .
Six weeks after the stimulation , the mice were trained to find a platform hidden underwater in a swimming tank .
Once the researchers were convinced the mice had learned the task , they examined their brains , looking for a protein called Fos .
Fos is produced only by active cells , and takes around 90 minutes to form , so the team could time their examination to pinpoint neurons that had been used explicitly in the memory task .
They found that the new neurons had the same level of Fos and were therefore just as active as other , older neurons .
" These new neurons are n't just sitting around doing nothing , " says Stone .
Turning back the clock
The mice used in Stone 's experiment did n't have a memory impairment to begin with , so it 's unlikely that their memory would have improved from the neuron growth .
But researchers assume that the growth of new , functional neurons in mice or people with dementia or other brain degenerative problems would help them .
There could be complications , however , Frankland admits .
" You might erase old memories , but become capable of making more memories , " he explains .
Frankland 's team has also looked at a few elderly 2 - year - old mice , and found that deep brain stimulation boosted their neuron growth by eight times their normal rate .
This rate of growth is similar to that seen in 2 - month - old mice , suggesting that their mental functions could be rejuvenated by the procedure .
However , the researchers have n't yet tested the older mice to see if they are better at making memories .
“ Now we can really see what neurogenesis is doing . ” Brian Christie
University of Victoria
" The reason why it 's so exciting is it 's potentially a neuro - regenerative or restorative therapy , " says Stone .
" He has an interesting technical advance , " says Brian Christie of the University of Victoria in Canada , who heard Frankland 's talk .
" Now we can really see what neurogenesis is doing . "
Previous methods for looking at the activity of artificially induced neurons — including chopping them out and seeing what happens — have yielded inconclusive results .
Previous studies have shown increased learning ability in animals after tasks such as exercise , for example , which is also known to help boost neuron growth .
But it 's hard to tell if the memory boost in these studies came directly from the new neurons , or from some other change in brain chemistry , notes Christie .
Frankland 's work is a big step forward , he says , because it helps to sort out exactly what is going on in the new neurons .
How do your neurons grow ?
More than 55,000 people are currently receiving deep brain stimulation as treatment for various disorders .
Most of these patients are being treated for Parkinson 's disease , and as the electrodes activate a part of the brain that controls motor function , the technique is not expected to prompt the growth of new neurons .
But patients being treated for depression , epilepsy and some other conditions do have the electrodes placed in circuits expected to prompt neuron growth .
ADVERTISEMENT
Another of Stone 's supervisors , Andres Lozano , has six patients in an early - stage trial of deep brain stimulation for Alzheimer 's disease .
This was prompted by another , accidental discovery , in which a patient who was undergoing deep brain stimulation for an obesity disorder started recalling vivid memories ( see ' Brain electrodes can improve learning ' ) .
That memory effect was different : it was instantaneous , and therefore not caused by the formation of new neurons .
But as patients with electrodes in this part of the brain are expected to sprout new neurons too , the trial could be used to study whether the new neurons become involved in memory formation , as they do in mice .
Lozano expects the first results in August .
Washington , D.C. - The Electronic Frontier Foundation ( EFF ) filed suit against the Department of Justice today , demanding the public release of the surveillance guidelines that govern investigations of Americans by the Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) .
The FBI 's Domestic Investigative Operational Guidelines went into effect in December of 2008 and detail the Bureau 's procedures and standards for implementing the Attorney General 's Guidelines on approved surveillance strategies .
" The Attorney General 's Guidelines are troubling , allowing for open investigative ' assessments ' of any American without factual basis or reasonable suspicion , " said EFF Senior Counsel David Sobel .
" The withholding of the Operational Guidelines compounds our concerns .
Americans have the right to know the basic surveillance policies used by federal investigators and how their privacy is -- or is not -- being protected . "
The FBI 's general counsel has acknowledged that " the expansion of techniques available [ to the Bureau ] has raised privacy and civil liberties concerns . "
Investigations can include the electronic collection of information from online sources and computer databases , as well as the use of grand jury subpoenas to obtain telephone and email subscriber information .
Other recent policy changes allow the FBI to engage in free - ranging investigation of Internet sites , libraries , and religious institutions .
EFF 's lawsuit comes after the Department of Justice failed to respond to a Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) request for a complete copy of the Domestic Investigative Operational Guidelines .
The suit demands the immediate release of the guidelines , as they are being withheld in violation of federal law .
" These policies have been in effect for more than six months and could have great impact on ordinary Americans ' lives , " said Sobel .
" The FBI must follow the law and release these guidelines to the public . "

After the EPA released its assessment , which USA TODAY reported on June 24 , California 's South Coast Air Quality Management District reviewed the data and found " gross overestimation " in Cerritos and several other places because the EPA relied on outdated or incorrect emission data .
The AQMD also tested emissions from a facility the EPA report blamed for much of the risk in Cerritos and found its current pollution levels were far lower than those the EPA cited .
The EPA sent a letter July 16 to Cerritos Mayor Bruce Barrows saying emissions from the facility " are now known to be at a safe level . "
The letter said the EPA would investigate further and promised " to continue to improve the accuracy " of the information it releases . )
The government 's latest snapshot of air pollution across the nation shows residents of New York , Oregon and California faced the highest risk of developing cancer from breathing toxic chemicals .
The results , compiled by the Environmental Protection Agency , represent the most sweeping analysis to date of the state of the nation 's air .
The analysis is based on emissions from 2002 , the latest year for which the EPA had detailed estimates of pollution from across the nation .
CLOSER LOOK : A county - by - county cancer risk map YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD : See data for your area MORE INFORMATION : Toxic air pollutants CANCER FORUM : Share your story FULL COVERAGE : Toxic air and America 's Schools Called the National - Scale Air Toxics Assessment , or NATA , the study is used by the EPA to identify parts of the country where residents could face the greatest health threats from air pollution .
The assessment found air pollution generally presented high health risks around major cities such as New York and Los Angeles — although some of the counties where the air was even worse were in rural areas of Mississippi and Kentucky .
Almost 2.2 million people lived in neighborhoods where pollution raised the risk of developing cancer to levels the government generally considers to be unacceptable .
There , toxic chemicals were significant enough that people who breathed the air throughout their lives faced an extra 100 - in - 1 million risk of getting cancer .
Many of those people — about 847,000 — lived in New York City .
The worst single neighborhood lay between two freeways in Cerritos , Calif. , outside Los Angeles .

In my last post we discussed irb ’s commands .
This post goes further into irb ’s innards , exploring all of its configuration options .
Gettin Ready
For starters , I refer you to the pickaxe which has an excellent section on configuring irb .
Also , this post assumes ruby 1.8.6 and irb 0.9.5 , though it should apply to 1.9ers .
Yes , I know I should get on the 1.9 train .
This post will cover every irb configuration option .
If I miss one , please let me know .
Not all of irb ’s features are enabled / used through configuration i.e. completion and xmp .
I ’ll save those for another blog post .
Let ’s first cover some irb configuration basics :
By default , irb loads the first configuration file it finds among these files : ~/.irbrc , .irbrc , irb.rc , _irbrc , $ irbrc and /etc / irbrc .
For the curious , read the source .
That file is also where most of irb ’s configuration is setup .
.
For the curious , read the source .
That file is also where most of irb ’s configuration is setup .
To override the default configuration file , set the IRBRC environment variable :
bash >
IRBRC =‘/i/like/my/irbrc/elsewhere’ irb
environment variable : Irb saves its configuration in a hash accessible through IRB.conf .
By convention , the config keys are symbols in all caps .
Simply set an option by setting a key ’s value : IRB.conf [ : SAVE_HISTORY ] = 1000
.
By convention , the config keys are symbols in all caps .
Simply set an option by setting a key ’s value :
Unlike irb commands in the last post , there is n’t much to getting most of the global configuration options :
bash > irb -f -- prompt simple >> IRB.conf.keys >>
[: CONTEXT_MODE , :PROMPT_MODE , :PROMPT , :INSPECT_MODE , :VERBOSE , :RC , :SINGLE_IRB , :USE_TRACER , :EVAL_HISTORY , :LOAD_MODULES , :LC_MESSAGES , :USE_LOADER , :SAVE_HISTORY , :MATH_MODE , :IGNORE_SIGINT , :IRB_RC , :AP_NAME , :MAIN_CONTEXT , :AUTO_INDENT , :BACK_TRACE_LIMIT , :DEBUG_LEVEL , :IGNORE_EOF , :IRB_NAME , :ECHO , :IRB_LIB_PATH ]
To get the full list of global irb configuration options , just grep it :
# Cd to your ruby source 's directory bash > cd / System / Library / Frameworks/Ruby.framework/Versions/1.8/usr/lib/ruby/1.8 #
You probably do n't want to see this output bash > grep - r ' conf\[\|@CONF ' irb.rb irb/
Each irb subsession copies the global config options into its IRB :: Context object .
Since you have easy access to this object through irb_context ( ) or conf ( ) , here ’s how you can figure out what configuration options you can change within irb :
bash > irb >> ( irb_context.methods - Object.methods ).grep(/=$/).sort => [ " ap_name= " , " auto_indent_mode= " , " back_trace_limit= " , " debug_level= " , " echo= " , " eval_history= " , " history_file= " , " ignore_eof= " , " ignore_sigint= " , " inspect_mode= " , " io= " , " irb= " , " irb_name= " , " irb_path= " , " load_modules= " , " math_mode= " , " prompt_c= " , " prompt_i= " , " prompt_mode= " , " prompt_n= " , " prompt_s= " , " rc= " , " return_format= " , " save_history= " , " use_loader= " , " use_readline= " , " use_tracer= " , " verbose= " , " workspace= " ] #
To change the ap_name >> conf.ap_name = " Doh ! " => " Doh ! "
Note that all these modify configuration options except for io= and workspace= which set a context ’s IRB :: InputMethod and IRB :: Workspace objects .
Since we ’re going to cover all the configuration options , let ’s group them into understandable chunks :
: SAVE_HISTORY ( number ) : Sets number of statements to keep in a history file .
: HISTORY_FILE ( filename ) : Specify a history file .
: EVAL_HISTORY ( number ) : Stores the outputs of the last number of statements in __ .
A sample config :
IRB.conf [ : SAVE_HISTORY ] = 1000 IRB.conf [ : HISTORY_FILE ] = " /i/like/my/history/here " IRB.conf [: EVAL_HISTORY ] = 200
Enabling an irb history with : SAVE_HISTORY allows you to reevaluate statements in two ways .
First , if your irb has a working readline library , you can look up and execute previous statements in reverse search mode .
To enter this mode , type Control - R.
Any keys you type will pull up the first statement that contains those letters .
Familiarize yourself with what Control - A , Control - E , Control - R and Enter keys do in this mode .
The second way is by using irb commands to manipulate and reevaluate several statements .
Although irb does n’t come with any such commands , utility_belt has some decent history commands .
I also have my own version that I blogged about a long time ago .
If :HISTORY_FILE is n’t set , irb uses the same directory and file format of the detected irbrc for the irb history file .
For example , ~/.irbrc leads to a ~/.irb_history whereas a ./ irbrc leads to ./irb_history .
For related discussion on this read : RC_NAME_GENERATOR .
The :EVAL_HISTORY option saves output / eval history per irb subsession in an IRB :: History object stored in __ .
The number it ’s given represents the number of the latest outputs to save .
An example of using this option :
bash > irb >> Math.cos 0 => 1.0 >> Math.cos Math :: PI/2 => 6.12323399573677e-17 >>
Math.cos Math :: PI => - 1.0 >> Math.cos Math :: PI * 3/2 => - 1.83697019872103e-16 #
Print out the eval history >> __ => 1 1.0 2 6.12323399573677e-17 3 - 1.0 4 - 1.83697019872103e-16 >>
__.class => IRB :: History # Creating and switching to another irb subsession >> irb Class >> : yo => : yo # New eval history >> __ => 1 :yo
If you ’re curious how / where irb sets the __ , see here .
In the same way , _ , which saves the last output of any statement , is defined here .
These options either take true or false except for : USE_READLINE .
: SINGLE_IRB : Enables all irb subsessions to be evaluated under the same binding .
Default is false .
: MATH_MODE : Enables math mode .
Default is false .
Enabling :MATH_MODE or irb -m , alters the default inspect mode and provides math commands by extending the Math module .
or , alters the default inspect mode and provides math commands by extending the module .
: RC : Enables loading an irbrc file .
Default is true .
Disabling :RC or irb -f , turns off any irbrc loading .
or , turns off any irbrc loading .
: USE_LOADER : Enabling : USE_LOADER overrides the default load ( ) and require ( ) with irb’s own commands , irb_load ( ) and irb_require ( ) .
Default is false .

Default is false .

Read this to learn more about these irb commands .
If you ’re unsure what I mean by override , read the implementation .
:IGNORE_EOF : Ignores end of line input ( Control - D in * nix ) or exits current subsession .
Default is false .
: IGNORE_SIGINT : If true , aborts current operation or returns to top level .
If false , exits irb .
Default is true .
: USE_READLINE : Enables using readline for input .
This is a tri-state option : true , false or nil .
Default is false or nil depending on readline ’s existence .
nil acts just like true except when irb is in inf - ruby - mode .
If you enable :SINGLE_IRB , all irb subsessions get evaluated under the same global binding , TOPLEVEL_BINDING .
This means that any local variables or methods you define are accessible across subsessions :
# This flag is n't mentioned in irb - h. Whoops . bash > irb -- single-irb >> it = 5 => 5 >> def say ( num ) ; puts " You ca n't escape this " + " binding ... " * num ; end => nil >> say it
You can't escape this binding ... binding ... binding ... binding ... binding ... => nil #
Start a new subsession >> irb Date # Method and local variable still exist >> say it
You can't escape this binding ... binding ... binding ... binding ... binding ... => nil
In my previous post ’s explanation of workspace commands , I mentioned that the one main difference they had from subsession commands was preservation of variables aka same binding .
Well , since enabling this option removes that difference , it ’s fair to ask :
What do workspaces offer that subsessions can ’t ?
The only answer I can come up with is that workspaces use the same context configuration .
: IRB_RC ( proc ) :
This proc is called every time a subsession is created .
: SCRIPT ( string ) :
This is used implicitly when irb is passed arguments on the commandline .
Sets irb in a file input mode in which it evaluates the file ’s contents as input and prints out the interaction to stdout .
( string ) :

Sets irb in a file input mode in which it evaluates the file ’s contents as input and prints out the interaction to stdout .
: LOAD_MODULES ( paths ) : At startup , loads the given paths using require ( ) .
Since require ( ) uses $ LOAD_PATH to find files , gems as well as paths relative to the current directory are valid paths .
.
Since uses to find files , gems as well as paths relative to the current directory are valid paths .
: CONTEXT_MODE ( number ) : Sets the type of binding that irb uses when evaluating statements .
Can be either 0 , 1 , 2 or 3 ( 3 is the default ) .
: RC_NAME_GENERATOR ( proc ) : Generates an irb config file .
Used by irb_history and irbrc .
When not set defaults to this .
Let ’s see if the :IRB_RC proc is called every time an irb subsession is created :
bash > irb # :IRB_RC is called at startup but it's not called this time since we have n't defined it yet .
#
The argument passed to lambda is the current context . >> IRB.conf [ : IRB_RC ] = lambda { |context| puts " Entered #{context. main} " } => #< Proc : [ email protected ] ( irb ) : 1> # Create subsessions >> irb ' testin ' Entered testin >> irb Array Entered Array
It sure does .
What if we only want to have the proc run once i.e. prevent future subsessions from calling it ?:
>> IRB.conf [ : IRB_RC ] = lambda { |e| puts " Entered #{e.main} " ; IRB.conf.delete(: IRB_RC ) } => #< Proc : [ email protected ] ( irb # 2 ) :1 > >> irb ' byebye ' Entered byebye >> IRB.conf [ : IRB_RC ] => nil #
Proc is n't called anymore since it does n't exist >> irb ' testin ' >>
Utility belt extends the functionality of this option by setting it to a hash of procs like this :
Object .
const_set ( " IRB_PROCS " , {} ) unless Object .
const_defined ?
( :IRB_PROCS ) IRB . conf [ :IRB_RC ] = lambda do IRB_PROCS .
each { | key , proc | proc .
call } end
With this version of :IRB_RC , multiple libraries / files can have their procs run if they define their entries in IRB_PROCS :
# in a rails - specific file IRB_PROCS [ : rails ] = lambda { " set my final rails irb tweaks here " } # ... in some other file IRB_PROCS [ : other ] = lambda { " other tweaks " }
Personally , I like to have my procs run once and to pass the current IRB :: Context object :
Object .
const_set ( " IRB_PROCS " , {} ) unless Object .
const_defined ?
( :IRB_PROCS ) IRB . conf [ : IRB_RC ] = lambda do | context | IRB_PROCS . each { | key , proc | proc .
call ( context ) ; IRB_PROCS . delete ( key ) } end
This option is used quietly whenever you pass irb an argument .
The argument , usually a file , is processed by Kernel#open and its result is fed to irb as input .
For example :
# Create a file message.rb : message = " irb from " message + __FILE__ # Run from the commandline bash > irb -f -- prompt simple message.rb >> message = " irb from " => " irb from " >> message + __FILE__ => " irb from blah.rb " >> bash >
Since Kernel#open can open a subprocess and read its output :
# Generates a mandelbrot set , from http://www.xcombinator.com/2008/02/22/ruby-inject-and-the-mandelbrot-set bash > irb -f " |curl -s http://gist.github.com/raw/120183/22aa68d0451ab2ac69a252f5d6a2acff2a04ea3b/gistfile1.rb "
# Prints out irb processing the code and then generates : ** ****** ******** ****** ******** ** * *** *****************
************************
***
**************************** ****************************** ****************************** ************************************
* **********************************

** ***** * **********************************
* ********************************** ************************************ ****************************** ******************************
****************************
************************
*** ***
*****************
******** ** * ****** ******** ****** **
Instead of opening a subprocess , you could just pipe a command into irb :
bash > curl -s http://gist.github.com/raw/120183/22aa68d0451ab2ac69a252f5d6a2acff2a04ea3b/gistfile1.rb
| irb -f # same output as above ...
This option is perhaps the only option whose use case I do n’t understand .
Depending on the option ’s value , irb statements are evaluated with a different type of binding :
0 : Creates binding with eval ( “ proc{binding}.call ” , TOPLEVEL_BINDING … ) .
1 : Creates binding in a temporary file .
2 : Create binding in a temporary file using threads .
3 : Creates binding with eval ( “ def irb_binding ; binding ; end ; irb_binding ” , TOPLEVEL_BINDING …)
My guesses for using values 1 and 2 are for security .
As for values 0 and 3 , the difference is that the former has access to TOPLEVEL_BINDING while the latter does n’t :
>> eval ( " a = 2 " , TOPLEVEL_BINDING ) => 2 >> eval " a " , eval ( " proc{binding}.call " , TOPLEVEL_BINDING ) => 2 >> eval " a " , eval ( " def irb_binding ; binding ; end ; irb_binding " , TOPLEVEL_BINDING ) NameError : undefined local variable or method `a ' for main :
Object from ( irb ) : 4: in `eval ' from ( eval ) : 1 from ( eval ) :
1
This option is used to generate irb config files i.e. irbrc and irb_history files in a standard way .
Since irbrc is already loaded when your config is read , most irb users would only have this effect their irb_history .
An example use case :
# In your irbrc : # This looks for the first config file that exists in /etc / irb / and then ~/.irb/ IRB .
conf [ :RC_NAME_GENERATOR ] = lambda { | name | [ " /etc/irb / # { name } .rb " , " #{ ENV [ ' HOME ' ] } /.irb/ # { name } .rb " ]. detect { | f | File . exists ? ( f ) } } #
In an irb lib for rails : load ( config ) if ( config = IRB .
rc_file ( " rails " ) ) # Loads /etc/irb/rails.rb or ~/.irb/rails.rb
: AUTO_INDENT ( boolean ) : Auto indents code when defining blocks , methods , classes , etc. Default is false .
: INSPECT_MODE ( booleanish ) :
When true or nil , formats output by calling inspect ( ) on the statement result .
When false just prints output .
Default is nil .
Note that setting this option from the commandline i.e. @context.
inspect_mode= is buggy : it needs to be called twice to set it to false when initially nil .
: When true or nil , formats output by calling on the statement result .
When false just prints output .
Default is nil .
Note that setting this option from the commandline i.e. @context.
inspect_mode= is buggy : it needs to be called twice to set it to false when initially nil . : ECHO ( booleanish ) :
When true or nil , a statement ’s output is printed .
When false , no output is shown .
Default is nil .
( booleanish ) :
When true or nil , a statement ’s output is printed .
When false , no output is shown .
Default is nil . : PROMPT ( hash ) : Hash of available prompts , mapping symbols to prompt hashes .
( hash ) : Hash of available prompts , mapping symbols to prompt hashes .
: PROMPT_MODE ( symbol ) : Current prompt , pointing to a key in : PROMPT .
A common irb complaint is that its output is too verbose .
Disabling this option makes irb print no output .
Here ’s a handy snippet that uses this option to toggle irb output :
def irb_verbosity_toggle irb_context .
echo ?
irb_context .
echo = false : irb_context .
echo = true end
Note : Utility belt has another way to toggle irb’s verbosity , although not as terse .
To create your own prompts , add an entry in : PROMPT .
Your prompt should be a hash with the following keys :
: PROMPT_I : Normal prompt
: PROMPT_S : Prompt when continuing a string
: PROMPT_C : Prompt when continuing a statement
: PROMPT_N : Prompt when indenting code
: RETURN : String that prefixes output of a statement .
Since this is passed to Kernel# printf ( ) , the output could be displayed with any of its string flags , though most choose %s .
Updated :
The different prompt types that start with : PROMPT * substitute string flags for certain values :
%N – Value from Irb.conf [ : IRB_NAME ]
%m – self.to_s
%M – self .
inspect
%l – Character needed to finish continuing a string .
Should be used with : PROMPT_S .
. %zi – Indent level with optional number z for printf width .
%zn – Line number with optional number z for printf width .
% % – Literal percentage sign .
For more details on prompts I suggest the Configuring the Prompt section in the pickaxe or just check out the irb implementation code .
Here ’s an example of creating a custom prompt :
bash > irb -- prompt simple # Create a basic prompt : DEMO >> IRB.conf [ : PROMPT ] [: DEMO ] = {: PROMPT_I => " normal > " , :PROMPT_S => " string_continue > " , >> :PROMPT_C => " statement_continue > " , :PROMPT_N => " indent > " , :RETURN => " << %s >>
" } => {: PROMPT_I=>" normal > " , :PROMPT_S=>" string_continue > " , :PROMPT_C=>" statement_continue > " , :PROMPT_N=>" indent > " , : RETURN = >" << %s >>
" } # Enable the created prompt >> conf.prompt_mode = :DEMO << :DEMO >> # PROMPT_I and PROMPT_C normal > 5 * statement_continue >
5 << 25 >> # PROMPT_S normal > ' yoda string_continue > ' << " yoda
" >> # PROMPT_N normal > class Yoda indent > end << nil >>

To better understand : BACK_TRACE_LIMIT , let ’s play ping pong :

( #use_tracer ) : USE_TRACER uses the Tracer standard library to trace statements .
Since Tracer is n’t that well documented , I should at least explain that it ’s basically a wrapper around Kernel#set_trace_func .
Here ’s what it looks like :
bash > irb -f -- tracer -- prompt simple / System / Library / Frameworks/Ruby.framework/Versions/1.8/usr/lib/ruby/1.8/tracer.rb:150 : warning : tried to create Proc object without a block / System / Library / Frameworks / Ruby.framework/Versions/1.8/usr/lib/ruby/1.8/tracer.rb:146 : warning : tried to create Proc object without a block >> :dude.to_s #0 :( irb ) :1: Object :-: - #0 :( irb ) :1:Symbol :> : - # 0 :( irb ) :1: Symbol : " dude " #
To turn it off >> conf.use_tracer = false # 0 :( irb ) :5: Object :-: - => false
Probably the most confusing aspect of Tracer is not knowing what the different fields delimited by ‘:’ represent .
Looking into the source reveals the fields in order are : thread number , file , line , klass , event type ( defined by Tracer : : EVENT_SYMBOL ) and the actual line of code ( – if line not found ) .
The main reason to describe these options is n’t to use them but to know there is little need to use them .

Massachusetts Democrat Barney Frank , along with over a dozen cosponsors , reintroduced legislation in Congress today to strengthen legal protections for state - authorized medical marijuana patients .
The bill , entitled the Medical Marijuana Patient Protection
Act of 2009 , seeks to amend the discrepancy between federal law and the laws of over a dozen states that have enacted regulations governing the therapeutic use of cannabis .
Thirteen states – Alaska , California , Colorado , Hawaii , Maine , Michigan , Montana , New Mexico , Nevada , Oregon , Rhode Island , Vermont and Washington – have enacted laws prohibiting medical marijuana patients from state prosecution .
Passage of the the Medical Marijuana Patient Protection
Act would ensure that medical cannabis patients or providers who are compliant with state law , such as Charles Lynch ( who was sentenced today in federal court ) , would no longer have to fear arrest or prosecution from federal law enforcement agencies .
Previous versions of the Medical Marijuana Patient Protection
Act were introduced in both the 108th and 109th Congress , but failed to receive a public hearing or a committee vote .
While campaigning for the presidency , Barack Obama promised not to use Justice Department resources “ to try and circumvent state ( medical marijuana ) laws ” — a pledge that has been repeated in recent months by US Attorney General Eric Holder .
Nevertheless , agents from the US Drug Enforcement Administration have continued to target medical marijuana providers in states that allow for the drug ’s use , and federal prosecutors have continued to bring federal anti-drug charges against defendants who were acting in accordance with their state ’s cannabis laws .

Solar Sees “ Exceptional ” Growth in 2008
For the year 2008 , solar output and installations grew globally !
Leading the world in photovoltaic markets , almost half of all new installations globally in 2008 occurred in Spain .
The United States came in third for top PV markets last year .
There are three types of solar energy : passive heat , solar thermal , and photovoltaic energy ( PV ) .
Photovoltaics use the sun ’s energy to create electricity , and the term comes from the two Greek words “ photo ” meaning light and “ voltaics ” meaning volts .
The future of PV energy is growing worldwide .
2008 Top Ten PV Markets
Spain 2,511 MW Germany 1,500 MW USA 342 MW South Korea 274 MW Italy 258 MW Japan 230 MW Czech Republic 51 MW Portugal 50 MW Belgium 48 MW France 46 MW
In 2008 , the global solar output grew to 5.5 GW , more the double the 2.4 GW of 2007 .
The European Photovoltaic Industry Association ( EPIA ) projects by 2013 the global PV market could reach 22 GW !
By 2030 , Greenpeace and the EPIA believe PV energy could provide electricity for 3.7 million people globally .
Furthermore , the PV market is good for the economy .
EPIA reports :
The PV industry has created more than 75.000 jobs in Europe in the last few years , the following countries have been leading this trend :
In Germany ( the largest PV market worldwide ) , employment in the PV sector rose from 1.500 ( 1999 ) to over 40.000 ( 2007 )
In Spain , until 2007 , more than 23.000 jobs were created
In Italy , until 2007 , 1.700 jobs were created
In France over 2.100 persons are today directly employed by the photovoltaic sector The European Photovoltaic Technology Platform estimates that the PV industry has the potential to create more than 200.000 jobs in the European Union by 2020 and ten times this number worldwide .
The growing PV market is great news for the economy and the environment !
The US should look towards Spain and Germany to see how they have been able to promote the technology with “ favorable policy frameworks ” .
The US has a long way to go to reach the number one spot in global PV markets .

It ’s time to show most passwords in clear text as users type them .
Providing feedback and visualizing the system ’s status have always been among the most basic usability principles .
Showing undifferentiated bullets while users enter complex codes definitely fails to comply .
Most websites ( and many other applications ) mask passwords as users type them , and thereby theoretically prevent miscreants from looking over users ’ shoulders .
Of course , a truly skilled criminal can simply look at the keyboard and note which keys are being pressed .
So , password masking does n’t even protect fully against snoopers .
More importantly , there ’s usually nobody looking over your shoulder when you log in to a website .

BBC News , Brazil
Brazil is a Catholic country , but in this row the Church has been controversial
The issue of abortion in Brazil has been making headlines not just in South America 's biggest country , but around the world .
The controversy began when news emerged from Pernambuco , a poor state in the north - east of Brazil , that a nine - year - old girl who had been raped was pregnant with twins .
It is alleged that she had been sexually abused for years by her stepfather , who is also suspected of sexually assaulting an older disabled sister .
He is now in prison .
Public interest in the case soared when the local Catholic archbishop tried to block the girl from having an abortion .
Brazilian law allows abortion only if there is a risk to the life of the mother or in cases of rape .
Doctors said the girl met both those conditions , and said she was so small her uterus was not big enough to carry one baby , never mind two .
Opponents of abortion say the girl could have safely had a Caesarean section .
In the end the abortion went ahead and the local archbishop , Jose Cardoso Sobrinho , said all those adults involved - the mother and the medical team - had been excommunicated .
The adults that approved , that have carried out this abortion , are excommunicated
Archbishop of Olinda and Recife , Jose Cardoso Sobrinho , 4 March
The archbishop later insisted it was not he who was ordering the excommunication , but that he had been simply restating the teachings of the Church .
His statement attracted widespread condemnation , led by Brazil 's President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva , who said as a " Christian and a Catholic " he deeply regretted the bishop 's conservative attitude .
Archbishop Sobrinho then added to the storm of protest by saying that while the stepfather had allegedly carried out a " heinous act " , excommunication did not automatically apply to him .
The controversy then spread to Rome where it appears to have provoked a surprising divergence of opinion at the highest levels .
Unforeseen consequences
One senior Vatican official appeared to back the Brazilian archbishop and then another to sharply contradict him .
It seems , however , the controversy may have led to other consequences in Brazil that Archbishop Sobrinho did not foresee , and which almost certainly he would not have welcomed .
Those who would like see a more liberal law on abortion say the fact that the Brazilian state - from the president down - rallied so firmly to the side of the doctors involved in this case will give renewed courage to their medical colleagues across the country .
Even in circumstances where abortion is legal , it seems doctors here have proceeded nervously , fearful some say of a negative reaction from the media or the Roman Catholic Church .
Anibal Faundes says issues are clearer following the controversy Anibal Faundes , professor of obstetrics at the University of Campinas , says legal abortions - of which there were 3,053 between January and November in 2008 - are now carried out in around 500 hospitals in Brazil , mainly in Sao Paulo and the south - east of the country .
He is clear about the most important consequences of the case involving the girl in Pernambuco .
" Everybody realised that Brazil is in favour of abortion in case of rape and risk to the woman 's life , " he says emphatically .
" That was not clear before .
But during the last two weeks it was perfectly clear if you are against abortion after rape and abortion when there is risk to the life of the person then everybody will be against you .
" That is what changed in the last two weeks . "
" Those within the Church that are extremely conservative with respect to this subject have lost a lot of ground , " he argues .
' Life must be protected ' Cardinal Odilo Scherer , archbishop of Sao Paulo , was reluctant to be drawn on the specific issues of the recent controversy .
Speaking generally , he told the BBC News website that the position of the Church in relation to abortion in cases of rape or a threat to the life of the mother was the same everywhere in the world .
" The Church 's position is always to defend life and trying all that is possible to first avoid these things happening , for this we need proper sex education , to teach people how to behave , in a socially responsible way .
" Secondly , to do everything possible to ensure life is protected , because no matter what happened to create this life , even if it was through violence , it will always be considered a human being , a helpless and defenceless human being .
Cardinal Odilo Scherer says the row may have damaged the Church " I can understand how a woman who is carrying a baby after being violently raped feels , but there is always a possibility to help this woman to cope with this situation .
There are many ways today that the medical profession can help to save the lives of this woman and child . "
He concedes , however , that some damage may have been done to the Church 's position .
" It is possible , yes , that it has , " he says .
" All this publicity , this criticism that was made of the Church has in some form weakened the position of the Church in defence of life and against abortion . "
Bleak
The case has also renewed attention on illegal abortions in Brazil - at one million per year , estimated to far outnumber legal procedures .
Every year , about 200,000 women seek medical help from the state system after having sought illegal procedures in back - street clinics .
Outside a bleak and graffiti - covered building which was once an abortion clinic in Sao Paulo , but which has now been closed by the authorities , Andrea has grim memories .
Andrea says the abortion clinic was like " a butcher 's shop " " I [ went through ] the process and I was n't left with any ill - effects , " she says of the illegal procedure .
" But this place was pretty much a like a butcher 's shop .
There was not any preparation , psychologically or clinically . "
When the clinic was closed , police said they found a secret corridor leading to a room where the patients stayed .
Out - of - date medicines and syringes believed to have been reused were also discovered .
For those with more money , there is access to better facilities .
Paula paid 2,000 reais ( $ 890 ; £ 610 ) for her abortion but says she was not concerned about the clinic , as it appeared to have acceptable standards .
She says she had an abortion because she was in the middle of a separation , and could n't afford to raise a child .
" It was clean and bright .
It was a big fancy place , and a lot of girls were there with mothers and boyfriends . "
Abortion - both legal and illegal - seems certain to be an issue that will make headlines again in Brazil in the not too distant future .
The Catholic Church may have been temporarily pushed onto the defensive , but it regards the issue as a crucial moral battleground , and is certain to return to make its case with renewed vigour in the months and years ahead .

Advertisement Health chiefs in Wales are dealing with a " massive " measles outbreak , with numbers already four times the highest figure recorded over the past 13 years .
Four nursery school children were treated in hospital as part of 127 cases across mid and west Wales , while there are another 39 cases in Conwy .
The National Public Health Service ( NPHS ) in Wales saw 39 cases last year .
Its highest figure in 2003 was 44 .
Officials appealed for parents to take up the MMR vaccine .
Dr Mac Walapu , consultant in communicable disease control for the NPHS , said : " For as long as there are children who do not receive their MMR vaccinations , there is the potential for outbreaks of measles to happen and we would remind anyone in Wales , and not just in the affected area . "
Children from the Hapus Dyfa nursery in Burry Port have been vaccinated
Why the NHS is facing a measles fight A spokeswoman added : " We need to be up front with parents . "
She added : " We try not to be too scary when we talk to people about this , but children die of measles and children are impaired by measles .
" It puts children in hospital .
The reality it is that this is happening now , in Wales .
Measles is very contagious . "
She said the outbreak was set to be the biggest in Wales since the MMR vaccine was introduced in 1988 .
Four children aged under two , who went to the Hapus Dyrfa nursery in Burry Port , were admitted to hospital but are now home .
The nursery has been following the NPHS guidelines and remains open .
Thirty two children have since been vaccinated .
Last week , the NPHS said its research had shown the MMR uptake in one school in the Carmarthenshire area was as low as 14.8 % .
The vaccine needs a 95 % uptake to achieve the herd immunity needed to ensure the disease cannot take a hold in individuals who are not vaccinated .
Latest figures show that 86 % of two - year - olds in Wales have been given the MMR vaccine , ranging in different areas from 78 % to 92 % .
This is short of the 95 % target which has already been achieved in Scotland .
The figure for England is around 85 % .
Official advice is that children should receive their first dose of the vaccine at the age of one and the second before they start school , and anyone in Wales who is older than this and has not received the full two doses of the vaccine should come forward for immunisation .

People are more used to using their smartphones today .
These are handheld devices and offer lots of conveniences .
They are portable and can be carried …
So far , the 2009 season has been one Cleveland Indians fans will want to forget .
The Indians are currently 10 - 16 and are the dictionary definition for the word inconsistency .
I do n’t know how long Eric Wedge is going to be around if The Tribe keeps looking like a big unpolished product .
When the season started , The Indians could not get a quality start from any pitcher in the rotation .
As this season rolls on , the starting pitching has gotten much better , but Jensen Lewis and Kerry Wood are finding ways to blow leads almost every other night .
It ’s getting old .
I ’m not sure how or why Jensen Lewis is still on the roster , but do know if he continues to pitch this bad that I might be able to buy him a beer after a Mahoning Valley Scrappers game he will be pitching in this August .
Kerry Wood looks great sometimes .
For $ 22 million , he better look great most of the time .
Travis Hafner , who I predicted would be hurt more than he would play this season , started the season with a bang , but is currently at his vacation home ( The Cleveland Clinic ) taking a break from that physically grueling platoon DH role .
Jhonny Peralta is another guy who needs to watch Tom Emansky ’s How To Hit videos , because he forgot .
Matt LaPorta is up , and even hit a homer already .
This is a guy that management said would be back toward the end of the year as he develops in Columbus .
Treveor Crowe , batting about .140 was sent packing back to Columbus .
Do the math with me .
Grady Sizemore ( 1 ) + Matt LaPorta ( 2 ) + Shin Soo Choo ( 3 ) + Ben Francisco ( 4 ) + Josh Barfield ( 1/2 ) + David Dellucci ( 5 1/2 ) = too many outfielders .
LaPorta is batting .100 and getting starts .
I am a big LaPorta believer , he is the future , but he is not ready yet .
I am sure that when I publish this article that The Indians will probably make me look like a fool and win doing all of the things I am saying they are struggling with .
If this is indeed the case , save the article and read it again tomorrow , it will make more sense then .
( CNN ) --
A pregnant British woman accused of trying to smuggle heroin onto a flight to Thailand from Laos was sentenced Wednesday to life in prison .
Briton Samantha Orobator has been sentenced to life in prison for heroin smuggling .
Samantha Orobator , 20 , was convicted of drug trafficking and sentenced after a three - hour trial , an official in the southeast Asian country said .
He declined to give his name because he is not authorized to talk to foreign media .
Orobator 's mother was in the courtroom , he said .
The British Foreign Office also confirmed Orobator 's sentence .
She was jailed last August at the airport in the Lao capital , Vientiane , and charged with carrying about half a kilogram of heroin .
London and Vientiane signed a prisoner transfer agreement last month , the Foreign Office said .
But it does not kick in automatically at this point , a Foreign Office representative told CNN Wednesday .
Do n't Miss Jailed Briton could be transferred from Laos to UK
" Before transfer can take place , the sentence must be final with no appeals or legal processes outstanding , " the representative said , declining to be named in line with policy .
" Both states and the prisoner have to consent to a transfer .
We are seeking access to Samantha " and will ask her " how she wants to proceed . "
Orobator is more than five months pregnant , and enters her third trimester on Saturday .
The circumstances under which she became pregnant in prison remain unclear .
She told her mother she was not raped in prison and that the father is not a Lao prison official .
A newspaper run by the Lao government reported Orobator as saying she impregnated herself with the sperm of another prisoner being held in the same jail .

Enlarge By William Welch , USA TODAY Mike DeMello , of Los Alamitos , Calif. , collects gold along the San Gabriel River in a sluice box that seperates gold from other materials .
ANGELES NATIONAL FOREST , Calif . 
Eyeing a flash of bright yellow at the bottom of the wet sluice box , Mike DeMello knew his rugged morning hike to this spot had been worth it .
He had found gold , if only a speck .
" This is the only way to work , " he grinned .
" This is like working for yourself . "
More than 150 years after the great Gold Rush that propelled California 's development , the prospect of striking it rich prospecting for gold remains very much alive .
Panners are appearing at streambeds due to the price of gold , the poor economy , and a 10.5 % statewide unemployment rate that leaves a lot of people with time on their hands , officials say .
" There 's quite a bit of new activity , " says Mark Springer , a geologist with the U.S. Bureau of Land Management in Sacramento .
" A lot of people are out prospecting for gold in particular because the price is pretty high right now . "
Gold , which is selling for more than $ 900 an ounce , has been found all over California , from near the Oregon border to the Mother Lode near Yosemite to the deserts of Arizona and Mexico .
Seasonal rains and snowmelt erode minerals , including gold , at higher altitudes and wash them down streams and rivers .
Claims on the rise
Most gold is extracted by mining companies whose claims can go back years , but in each of the past two years , mining claims in California have grown by more than 3,000 .
In the first three months of 2009 , 1,173 more claims were filed , government figures show .
As of the end of March there were 24,583 active gold - mining claims in the state .
Those figures do n't tell the full story because anyone can prospect for gold on many public lands without a claim .
A claim protects rights to minerals on a piece of land but in most cases is not necessary for the casual gold prospector , Springer says .
No one knows for sure how many people are actually actively searching for gold or how much is being found .
Prospectors who find pieces big enough to bring real money are n't inclined to reveal much about the location .
Local prospecting clubs all over the state report membership is up .
" When the price jumped over $ 600 an ounce , people started flocking in , " says Mike Beechler , vice president of the Route 66 Gold Miners club in Orange County .
" It 's the economy .
Some people are laid off and actually have the time to do this . "
As in the 19th century , those who supply prospectors may be doing best .
" We 're seeing a huge influx of new prospectors , " says Harrigan McGregor , owner of Gold Fever Prospecting , an online outfitter .
Labor - intensive work
The notion of striking it rich is , for most , an unrealized dream .
Casual prospectors often bring home only small gold pieces or powder .
Here in a mountain wilderness barely an hour 's drive from downtown Los Angeles , modern - day ' 49ers dig and pan and sift and sluice along the San Gabriel River , one of the state 's most popular and proven gold fields .
" There are better places to go , " says Martin Milas , a Los Angeles lawyer and president of the Prospectors Club of Southern California .
" It 's been known for over 150 years .
It 's just that , you can always get some color ( gold ) there . "
DeMello , 60 , and his prospecting partner , Mike Gavin , 53 , a Los Alamitos roofer idled by the business slowdown , drove 20 miles into the forest north of Azusa , Calif. , then hiked up a trail into East Fork Canyon and hopped rocks jutting out of the side of the fast - rushing river , passing trout fishermen , until they found a spot that looked promising .
Gavin shoveled furiously along the bank while DeMello sifted and sorted through the dirt .
Reducing his shovel contents to mostly sand , he deposited it slowly into a metal sluicer , a piece of equipment refined but little changed in a century and a half .
Placed for river water to run through it , the sluicer catches the heaviest particles in its carpet - like bottom — and the heaviest material is gold .
They did n't find enough to buy dinner , but they did get small pieces for their collections .
Downstream , Marc Montelius , 50 , of Whittier , was panning and sifting while three friends dug and offered advice from the riverbank .
He is a self - employed handyman waiting for an oil refinery job .
" I have no illusions of grandeur that I 'm going to strike it rich , " he said .
" It 's a good excuse to get out of the house . "
He found small pieces of gold and some small garnets , a deep red gemstone .
Nothing worth selling , he says .
" This is my first time , but I 've got my fingers crossed , " said Jacob Stephens , 23 , who spent the day with his mother and Montelius in the river .
He works for a car dealer and is waiting for a job to open with the county sheriff .
" You just keep panning for gold until you hear from them , " Cynthia Stephens said .
A few old campers and trucks along the road mark the spot where gold has been dug for generations .
" During the Depression , it was the same thing , " Milas said .
" They even had steam shovels in there , people living in cars .
With a little gold you could afford beans and have the wherewithal to make it through . "

Is it luck or skill that gets us to the goals and objectives we set for ourselves — gimmicks and software programs or practice and understanding ?
How many golfers are still using the putter they started with decades ago at a nine - hole cow pasture ?
How many of you are still bouncing between investment gurus and hedges in your search for the investment holy grail ?
The best athletes come to the competition with sound fundamentals , well thought out objectives , and the discipline to hone their basic technique with countless hours of practice .
The most successful investors come to the process with sound fundamentals , realistic goals and objectives , and a consistently applied discipline that embraces the cyclical nature of markets and economies .
Discipline is an ingredient in most long - term success recipes — business , sports , relationships , politics , veal scaloppini , etc .
Well , maybe not politics .
There are “ fundamentals ” involved in each .
Favorite foursome conversations provide clues to the particular fundamental that just failed you , as your duck - hooked tee shot comes to rest at the base of the dead pine tree , and possibly , just beyond the white stake .
“ Have you weakened your grip ? ” comments Larry .
“ Nah , he was lined up that way ; went right where he aimed it , ” Curley offers .
“ Might have worked out just fine if he had n’t picked his head up so soon , ” spouts Moe .
“ What are you guys talking about ?
I was set up to fade the ball but I swung way too hard at the bottom and closed down the club face , ” you bark as you tee up a provisional .
Grip , alignment , focus , target , and tempo— some major golf fundamentals .

During the cocktail hour at monthly AAII and NAIC meetings , or around the country club bar , you might overhear some of these : “ I ca n’t afford to play a lot of golf anymore .
My junk bond fund has reduced its payout to barely 2 % . ” Yeah , my retirement plans have been put on hold too .
I lost 60 % of my net worth when the government killed Lehman Brothers and Washington Mutual . ”
“ I was counting on my short - term Munis , CDs , and T - Bills to provide enough income to pay the bills , but the yields have gotten so low . ”
“ Two years ago , my portfolio was worth twice what it is today ; if only my advisor had taken the profits when we had them , and added to the income bucket of the portfolio . ”
Quality , diversification , income , asset allocation , and profit taking — some biggies in investing .
Surprisingly ( or perhaps not ) , it is more likely that the newbie or high - handicap golfer will seek help with the game ’s fundamentals than it is for the new or inexperienced investor to spend moment one on the basic concepts of investing .
Serious amateur golfers work at their game constantly ; amateur investors seriously avoid the work required to fine - tune their expectations .
Neither seems capable of avoiding an endless parade of props , programs , and short - term panaceas as they make their way around and through the hazards that torment all levels of golfer and investor from the very beginning of their quest for brilliance .
A round of golf has its ups and downs , hot streaks and bad breaks .
Investing has its rallies and corrections , scandals and frauds .
Why are these two frustrations so popular ?
Fundamentally speaking ( but not analyzing ) , investors need to wrap their heads around an asset allocation formula that is most likely to get them to a comfortable nineteenth - hole lifestyle .
Golfers need to wrap their hands around their clubs in a manner that will help them get to shorter term targets often enough to keep their Nassau partner smiling .
A properly aligned investment portfolio will be constructed with regular income producers and equities expected to have capital gains potential .
Each are viewed differently in terms of time and distance .
Golfers attempt to align themselves in a manner that will get them to the safest and most opportune position for the shot that comes next .
A golfer without a clear target for every full swing , chip , and putt will be thrown off course more often than not , gaining only the exercise value .
Similarly , an investor who fails to set multiple targets ( at least three : buy more , sell , and yield ) for every security will fail to gain full value from the investment exercise .
To be successful at either requires patience , reasonable expectations , and a mastery of the fundamentals .
With that in your bag or briefcase , you ’ll be prepared to follow in the footsteps of the Great One ’s fundamentals coach and say :
“ Hello ball . ”
