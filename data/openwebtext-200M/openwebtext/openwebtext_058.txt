WASHINGTON
IPS
U.S .
The face - to - face survey of a total of 3,850 respondents in Egypt , Jordan , Lebanon , Morocco , Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates found that close to 80 percent of Arabs consider Israel and the United States the two biggest external threats to their security .
Only six percent cited Iran .
And less than one in four Arabs believe Iran should be pressured to halt its nuclear programme , while 61 percent , including majorities in all six countries , said Tehran had the right to pursue it even if , as most believe , the programme is designed to develop nuclear weapons .
The poll , the fifth in an annual series conducted by Zogby International and designed by Shibley Telhami , a senior fellow at the Saban Centre for Middle East Policy at the Washington - based Brookings Institution , was carried out in November and early December — after last summer ’s war between Lebanon ’s Hezbollah and Israel , but just before the controversial execution of former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein .
The latter event has widened the divide between Shi’a and Sunni Muslims throughout the region , according to some reports , and played into recent efforts by the U.S. to forge a de facto alliance between Israel and Sunni-led Arab states , including Egypt , Jordan , Saudi Arabia , and the Gulf sheikhdoms , to contain what they see growing Iranian influence in Iraq , Syria , Lebanon , and Palestine .
But Telhami , who will present his findings at a major Brookings - sponsored conference of Islamic leaders in Doha next week , told IPS he doubts these sectarian tensions are changing basic attitudes among the general public on key regional issues in the countries covered in the survey , with the exception of Lebanon .
“ The public of the Arab world is not looking at the important issues through the Sunni - Shi ’a divide , ” he said .
“ They see them rather through the lens of Israeli - Palestinian issues and anger with U.S. policy ( in the region ) .
Most Sunni Arabs take the side of the Shi’as on the important issues . ”
Indeed , the survey strongly suggests that the U.S. , whose image in the Arab world has fallen to an all - time low over the past year according to this and other recent polling , faces a steep uphill battle in rallying Arab public opinion behind it on critical regional questions .
More than three out of four of all respondents described their attitudes towards Washington as either “ somewhat ” ( 21 percent ) or “ very ” ( 57 percent ) unfavourable .
Negative feelings were strongest in the three monarchies : Jordan , where 90 percent of respondents described their views as unfavourable , Morocco ( 87 percent ) , and Saudi Arabia ( 82 percent ) .
After aggregating the poll results in each country and weighting them by national population , the survey found that nearly four out of 10 Arabs named President George W. Bush as the foreign leader they most disliked , far ahead of two Israeli leaders , Ariel Sharon ( 11 percent ) and his successor , Ehud Olmert ( seven percent ) .
That result was particularly remarkable , according to Telhami , because , in his 2005 survey , Sharon led Bush in the “ most disliked ” category by a 45 - 30 percent margin .
Even in Lebanon , Bush was found to be more than twice as disliked as Olmert , despite the latter ’s responsibility for destroying much of the country ’s infrastructure during last summer ’s war with Hizbollah .
The most effective way for Bush to improve Arab views of the U.S. , according to the survey , would be by brokering a comprehensive peace between Israelis and Palestinians based on Israel ’s return to its 1967 borders .
Asked to choose among six possible steps Washington could take to improve its image , substantial majorities or pluralities of respondents in every country except Saudi Arabia opted for a comprehensive peace settlement .
The other choices included withdrawing U.S. troops from Iraq and from the Arabian Peninsula , stopping aid to Israel , promoting democracy and providing more economic aid to the region .
Ironically , only 16 percent of respondents in Saudi Arabia , whose leaders have pressed Bush hardest in recent months for a more vigorous U.S. effort to achieve a peace agreement , chose the Arab - Israeli option .
That was their fourth choice , behind withdrawing U.S. forces from Iraq and the Arabian Peninsula and stopping aid to Israel .
Asked to rate the importance of the Arab - Israeli conflict in developing their attitudes towards the U.S. on a five - point scale , 76 percent of Jordanians , 65 percent of Moroccans , 62 percent of Lebanese , and 54 percent of Saudis gave it a five , or “ extremely important ” .
Majorities in every country said they were prepared for peace with Israel based on its return to the 1967 borders , but , among those who said so , majorities also said they did “ not believe the Israelis will give up the territories ( it has occupied ) peacefully . ”
On the other hand , pluralities in both Saudi Arabia ( 42 percent ) and Jordan ( 36 percent ) said that “ Arabs should continue to fight Israel ” even if it returned to its 1967 borders .
Weighted by national population , the survey found that 61 percent of Arabs would accept such an agreement .
“ That is much more than I had expected , ” noted Telhami .
Twenty - nine percent said Arabs should keep fighting .
If Bush displaced Sharon as the most disliked leader in 2006 , the Iranian - backed leader of Hezbollah , Hassan Nasrallah , has displaced French President Jacques Chirac as the most admired , according to survey .
Asked to volunteer their favourite for that category , the weighted aggregate of 14 percent named Nasrallah ; eight percent , Chirac ; four percent , Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad ; and three percent , Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez .
“ These are people who are seen to have stood up to the U.S. , ” Telhami said , adding , “ Not a single one is a Sunni Arab . ”
As in the past several years , large majorities of Arabs attribute less benign objectives to U.S. policy in the region , including “ controlling oil ” ( 75 percent , “ protecting Israel ” ; 69 percent “ weakening the Muslim World ” ; and 68 percent , “ the desire to dominate the region . ”
Only nine percent of the weighted aggregates they believed one of Washington ’s main objectives was promoting democracy .
Majorities , ranging from 51 percent in Lebanon to 68 percent in Jordan and 77 percent in Morocco , believe Iran has the right to pursue its nuclear programme .
“ Even in Saudi Arabia and the UAE , whose governments are really frightened about Iranian power , their publics do not define Iran as the major threat , ” noted Telhami , who added that tended to confirm that Arab leaders and their citizenries do not see key issues through the same prism .

After reliance on isolationist development using proprietary technologies , the second factor of platform crisis involves embracing the suffocating tentacles of long term legacy support .
Here ’s how legacy plays into the past , present , and future plans of Apple and Microsoft , and what it means for users of their products .
Platform Death Match introduced the difficulty of launching a new platform and the work involved in maintaining one .
This series looks at the historical march of computing platforms , to sort out why winners won and why losers lost .
While the computing environment is always changing , the same basic rules are in effect today , and will shape the future developments between Mac OS X Leopard and Windows Vista .

1990 - 1995 : Platform Crisis : The Tentacles of Legacy
While Apple appeared to do everything wrong throughout the early 90s , Microsoft appeared to do everything right .
On the surface , it looked like Microsoft was starting out with clean design that allowed it to offer features Apple was still struggling to deliver , including memory protection and preemptive multitasking .
Apple was embroiled in legacy issues .
Everything about the Mac was mired in the original design decisions made back in the mid 80s , when system resources and processing power were far more limited .
The Mac ’s shared graphics model meant it would be non trivial to solve the lack of memory protection for applications .
That made it possible for third party applications and extensions to accidently overwrite memory used by the system or other applications , causing fatal system crashes and general instability .
Similarly , there was no simple way to tack on preemptive multitasking .
If an application stalled or ran into an unrecoverable error , the system had no way to authoritatively stop it and safely hand control over to another application .
Apple could bolt preemption on the side , but it would be of no use to users of existing applications ; app would all need to be entirely redesigned to take advantage of the feature .
Major system components such as QuickTime would also need to be completely overhauled , a huge effort that would take years to complete .
Along with hardware support for an increasingly odd set of proprietary designs , the integrated Mac hardware and software system was stuck in a mess outdated methods , code , and protocols that each contributed toward system instability and slow performance , and hampered Apple 's ability to actually solve any of the problems .
PowerPC Hardware
Despite the increasingly creaky underpinnings of the Mac System Software , Apple was able to update the Mac hardware and jettison a lot of architectural legacy in the process when it jumped to PowerPC .
In its partnership with IBM and Motorola , Apple was able to dump the 68 k processor for an entirely new and forward looking architecture that vaulted Mac performance into the lead over DOS PCs using the Pentium processor .
The Pentium ran hotter and slower and cost more to build due to legacy issues of its own .
PowerPC was supposed to serve as a replacement for the x86 PC .
Microsoft worked with Motorola to port its new Windows NT 4.0 to PowerPC , and IBM delivered a new version of OS / 2 .
Apple not only ported the Mac System 7 , but also announced plans to deliver Copland as a true PowerPC native OS that would fly on the new hardware .
Legacy Hardware Decisions for PowerPC
The partners involved in PowerPC not only designed a new processor , but drew up plans for a reference platform for new PC hardware using the chip .
The initial revision was called PReP , the PowerPC Reference Platform .
Ironically , this design incorporated much of the old legacy cruft of the existing x86 PC , including the 1970 ’s era Centronics parallel printer port .
Apple in particular wanted the PowerPC platform to be more Mac - like , rather than a regression back into the old and outdated standards embraced by the PC industry .
The result was CHRP , the Common Hardware Reference Platform .
Unlike the earlier PReP , CHRP standardized on a clean new firmware design called OpenFirmware , which had been designed by Sun for its SPARC workstations and released as an open standard .
PowerPC and CHRP were intended to solve legacy hardware issues for the PC industry , but instead , both were largely ignored because of legacy issues .
Apart from Apple , no manufacturer had the power or the vision to offer anything new .
Apple Slowly Ditches Legacy Hardware
By the time CEO John Sculley was ousted from Apple in 1993 , the company had to support a range of Mac models , each with a unique hardware architecture , and sold under an array of marketing names , including Performa , Centris , and Quadra .
Sculley had hoped to create a lineup of Macs models with names that sounded like Sony products or luxury cars , but the plan instead created confusion .
What ’s the difference between a Quadra 630 and a Performa 630 ?
It was n’t obvious for consumers .
After Sculley ’s departure , steps were taken to simplify both marketing and hardware designs .
The first generation of Apple ’s PowerPC Macs were largely just old Macs with a new processor ; the existing product lineup of the 68 k based Quadra 610/700/800 became the PowerMac 6100/7100/8100 .
By 1994 , Apple had dropped both the Centris and Quadra names , making everything a PowerMac apart from the convoluted Performa brand , which assigned a unique model number to every configuration .
The PowerMac 6100 was sold as the Performa 6110 , 6112 , 6115 , 6116 , 6117 , and 6118CD .
It ’s no wonder Sears could n’t sell them .
A Legacy Lesson of PCI
In 1995 Apple launched the second generation of PowerMacs , which began incorporating modern hardware conventions of the newest PCs , including PCI expansion slots .
A decade after Texas Instruments ’ NuBus and IBM ’s MCA , Intel introduced PCI as its own auto - configuring expansion slot standard to replace the PC ’s Industry Standard Architecture .
PCs using ISA required manual and often problematic configuration of IRQ lines , I/O addresses , and DMA channels whenever a new device was installed .
Mac users did n’t even need to know what an IRQ was .
NuBus had made Mac expansion cards far more elegant to use , but also more expensive to buy than the simpler but more troublesome ISA cards .
Apple was able to immediately move its
Macs to PCI and instantly create a shared market for PCI cards that could be used in both Macs and new PCs .
NuBus was dropped entirely .
On the PC , support for PCI was added to motherboards next to ISA slots so users could have the worst of both worlds : IRQ management headaches from the 80s , paired with a splintered market for the new PCI cards .
After all , if all PCs have ISA slots , but only the newest ones have PCI , why not continue to manufacture ISA devices ?
More Decisive Changes
After realizing the benefits of simplicity and forward technical momentum , Apple stepped up its efforts to clean up its legacy hardware .
After buying NeXT , the newly focused Apple began work on a clean new hardware design for the Mac , referred to as the NewWorld Architecture .
Introduced with the iMac in 1998 , the new design dropped remnants of the past and adopted ideas from CHRP , including a clean and complete implementation of OpenFirmware .
Apple scuttled the old Mac serial connectors and ADB keyboard ports and standardized on Intel ’s new USB .
A year later , Microsoft ’s approach to PC legacy was a new coat of paint .
It devised a color code for Centronics parallel ports , serial ports , analog joystick ports , and PS / 2 mouse and keyboard ports , so users could match cables to the old legacy ports with less confusion .
Microsoft also documented its insistence that PC makers stop using ISA slots and begin using USB .
A half decade later , PCs are just beginning to standardize on USB , and Microsoft continues to sell PS / 2 keyboards .
PCs also still continue to use BIOS firmware and the MBR disk partition map from the early 80s .
The Two Edged Sword of Legacy
Abandoning legacy hardware enabled Apple to move decisively into the future .
It kept the company alive through a difficult transition , and paralleled other actions of the new Apple to dismiss old ideas in market positioning , technology , development , operations and sales .
PowerPC gave Apple an infusion of new performance that helped ameliorate the crisis of its inability to deliver a new software platform .
Simplified operations enabled the company to focus on fixing real problems rather than just ineffectually putting out constant fires .
Killing legacy helped to save Apple .
Conversely , embracing legacy had helped to keep Microsoft alive .
While often used as a derogatory word in technology , the other side of legacy is compatibility and the market power of an installed base .
Microsoft developed its platform using legacy as a key strategy .
Rather than initially delivering an elite , expensive solution that required new hardware , Microsoft sold Windows to existing DOS users .
Microsoft frequently compromised ongoing Windows development to bend over backward to support existing DOS and 16 - bit software .
It provided support for a broad range of hardware , including old outdated interfaces that still represented the majority of what people were actually using in the PC world .
While Apple was trying to move its developers to a new software platform and migrate users to PowerPC hardware , Microsoft was working to make sure that old DOS and Win -16 applications would run on both NT and 95 , and that even old PCs could be adapted to run as low powered Windows Terminals .
Dueling Business Models
That difference between Apple and Microsoft is not just a philosophical stance , but reflects the two companies ’ differing business models :
• Apple makes its money selling hardware , so it was always in that company 's interests to sell the best hardware possible and make sure its Macs offered features and performance ahead of bargain PCs .
Hardware quality and the user experience were valued over high volume , low margin sales because that 's what enriched Apple .
• Microsoft makes its money selling software licenses , so it embraced the idea of selling new software for old hardware , running old applications on a new version of Windows , and selling copies of Windows for PCs of any price .
Volume was valued over hardware quality and user experience because that 's what enriched Microsoft .
Today , those same legacy factors and business models are still in place .
That 's why Apple is unlikely to ever make major market share gains across most of Microsoft 's established business , but its also why Apple is well positioned to cherry pick the most valuable segments of the market and offer the best product to users able to make a choice .
It also complicates Microsoft 's ability to take Apple on directly .
Vista carries so much baggage from Windows XP and the wide swath of third party software it has to accommodate , that Microsoft is left without the ability to move quickly and decisively to match Apple 's moves .
Microsoft has become the same lazy dinosaur that Apple had turned into in the early 90s .

Practical lock - free data structures
Introduction
Through careful design and implementation it 's possible to build data structures that are safe for concurrent use without needing to manage locks or block threads .
These non-blocking data structures can increase performance by allowing extra concurrency and can improve robustness by avoiding some of the problems caused by priority inversion in local settings , or machine and link failures in distributed systems .
The best overall introduction to our non-blocking algorithms is the paper Concurrent programming without locks , currently under submission , which covers our designs for multi- word compare - and - swap , word - based software transactional memory and object - based software transactional memory .
The papers Language support for lightweight transactions and Exceptions and side - effects in atomic blocks cover the integration of a software transactional memory with a managed run-time environment .
Keir Fraser 's dissertation , Practical lock freedom , presents a large number of new designs for concurrent data structures such as skip - lists , red - black trees and binary search trees , including new lock - based designs as well as lock - free versions .
This work is supported by donations from the Intel / Hewlett - Packard IPF University Grants Program and from the Scalable Synchronization Research Group at Sun Labs Massachusetts .
We would also like to thank Nick Maclaren for providing access to the Cambridge - Cranfield High Performance Computing Facility .

A further release of our word - based software transactional memory .
This is built over a new internal abstraction which provides revocable exclusive access to salient memory locations used in the algorithm 's implementation .

Oil prices could rocket to $ 100 within six months , plunging the world into an unprecedented fuel crisis , controversial Texan oil analyst Matt Simmons has warned .
After crude surged through $ 60 a barrel last week , nervous investors were pinning their hopes on a build - up in US oil - stocks to depress prices in the coming months .
But Simmons believes surging demand will keep prices bubbling well above $ 50 .
' We could be at $ 100 by this winter .
We have the biggest risk we have ever had of demand exceeding supply .
We are now just about to face up to the biggest crisis we have ever had , ' he said .
Opec producers held emergency talks last week to consider making their second 500,000 a barrel increase in production quotas in a fortnight : but the discussions were suspended last Thursday after prices dipped back below $ 60 .
The looming oil crisis is not high up the agenda at this week 's G8 meeting , although the heads of state are expected to repeat their finance ministers ' call for greater transparency from Opec and other oil - producing nations about their reserves .
However , global warming is one of Britain 's two major priorities , and Tony Blair hopes to secure a pledge to pour more cash into developing alternatives to the oil - intensive technologies that cause climate change .
Simmons believes such moves will be too little , too late .
He will publish a hard - hitting book this week in which he argues that Saudi Arabia , the world 's largest producer , is running out of oil , and further price rises are inevitable as supplies decline .
He warns that the scramble for resources could eventually descend into war .
Many analysts expect extra production over the next year , as high prices boost investment by energy firms .
But Simmons says after many years of underinvestment , there is even a shortage of drilling rigs .
' Many of these projects are aspirations ; many of them wo n't create peak production in the first year , and many of them within five years will be in decline , ' he said .
However , the Economist Intelligence Unit predicts that oil prices will peak by the end of this year , and decline by 10 per cent in 2006 as the Chinese economy slows , reducing demand .
Chinese imports have been crucial to propping up the oil price in the last two years .
But the EIU warned that its forecasts - which show a 30 per cent increase in oil prices for 2005 - could prove too conservative if there are further wobbles in supply .
' The narrow margin of spare production capacity has made prices vulnerable to unforeseen reductions in supply or rises in demand , ' it said .
Paul Horsnell , head of commodities analysis at Barclays Capital , said supply constraints would continue to bite for the rest of the year .
' It 's all getting a bit tight '
Brent crude closed almost $ 2 a barrel higher in New York on Friday night , while futures contracts for heating oil , widely used in the US , hit a record high , which analysts said was unusual for summer .
' It 's fear , ' said Kyle Cooper , an analyst at Citigroup .
' It 's not based on what is happening now .
It 's based on fear of what could happen . '
There are a number of learning algorithms which explicitly incorporate randomness into their execution .
This includes at amongst others :
Neural Networks .
Neural networks use randomization to assign initial weights .
Boltzmann Machines / Deep Belief Networks .
Boltzmann machines are something like a stochastic version of multinode logistic regression .
The use of randomness is more essential in Boltzmann machines , because the predicted value at test time also uses randomness .
Bagging .
Bagging is a process where a learning algorithm is run several different times on several different datasets , creating a final predictor which makes a majority vote .
Policy descent .
Several algorithms in reinforcement learning such as Conservative Policy Iteration use random bits to create stochastic policies .
Experts algorithms .
Randomized weighted majority use random bits as a part of the prediction process to achieve better theoretical guarantees .
A basic question is : “ Should there be explicit randomization in learning algorithms ? ”
It seems perverse to feed extra random bits into your prediction process since they do n’t contain any information about the problem itself .
Can we avoid using random numbers ?
This question is not just philosophy — we might hope that deterministic version of learning algorithms are both more accurate and faster .
There seem to be several distinct uses for randomization .
Symmetry breaking .
In the case of a neural network , if every weight started as 0 , the gradient of the loss with respect to every weight would be the same , implying that after updating , all weights remain the same .
Using random numbers to initialize weights breaks this symmetry .
It is easy to believe that there are good deterministic methods for symmetry breaking .
Overfit avoidance .
A basic observation is that deterministic learning algorithms tend to overfit .
Bagging avoids this by randomizing the input of these learning algorithms in the hope that directions of overfit for individual predictions cancel out .
Similarly , using random bits internally as in a deep belief network avoids overfitting by forcing the algorithm to learn a robust - to - noise set of internal weights , which are then robust - to - overfit .
Large margin learning algorithms and maximum entropy learning algorithms can be understood as deterministic operations attempting to achieve the same goal .
A significant gap remains between randomized and deterministic learning algorithms : the deterministic versions just deal with linear predictions while the randomized techniques seem to yield improvements in general .
Continuizing .
In reinforcement learning , it ’s hard to optimize a policy over multiple timesteps because the optimal decision at timestep 2 is dependent on the decision at timestep 1 and vice versa .
Randomized interpolation of policies offers a method to remove this cyclic dependency .
PSDP can be understood as a derandomization of CPI which trades off increased computation ( learning a new predictor for each timestep individually ) .
Whether or not we can avoid a tradeoff in general is unclear .
Adversary defeating .
Some algorithms , such as randomized weighted majority are designed to work against adversaries who know your algorithm , except for random bits .
The randomization here is provably essential , but the setting is often far more adversarial than the real world .
The current state - of - the - art is that random bits provide performance ( computational and predictive ) which we do n’t know ( or at least ca n’t prove we know ) how to achieve without randomization .
Can randomization be removed or is it essential to good learning algorithms ?
Passive aggression
We had a great after - lunch discussion about the passive the other day in the Senior Writers ' Lounge at Language Log Plaza .
It started with Poser mentioning that a reader had written to him about his having mentioned the injunction against the use of the passive , and how the Declaration of Independence violates that injunction .
The reader asked where the injunction might have originated .
Nunberg immediately expressed the opinion that it is a thoroughly modern fixation .
More than modern , in fact : post - WWII .
He credited Orwell , citing " Politics and the English language " ( 1946 ) .
In the course of a tirade about the alleged evil and dishonesty of political writing , Orwell wrote ( apparently without irony , Nunberg noted ) that in the evasive kind of writing he disapproves of , " the passive voice is wherever possible used in preference to the active " .
Orwell formulated an edict ( which he had just violated ) : " Never use the passive where you can use the active . "
( By the way , I should tell you that I despise that essay of Orwell 's ; so I was delighted to see Stanley Fish describing it in the New York Times Book Review last Sunday as " what is surely the most overrated essay in the modern canon , George Orwell 's turgid , self - righteous and philosophically hopeless ‘ Politics and the English language ’ . "
Fish was a bit unpleasant about the Nunberg book he is reviewing , but as far as Orwell is concerned , I say , from Fish 's mouth to God 's ear . )
Nunberg also made this remark about Orwell 's attitude to the passive :
Orwell did n't directly connect this to the idea that the passive was " weak " or " evasive " ( he seemed to object to it chiefly because it was wordy ) , but later usage writers depicted the passive as a way of avoiding responsibility for saying who was responsible for the action , which seemed to them typical of government or bureaucratic prose .
It 's also connected to the idea that good prose should be " muscular , " which somebody should track down some time .
Actually a lot of this rests on a kind of pun on the word ' passive ' , does n't it ?
Zwicky demurred .
" We can't hang this one on Orwell , " he said :
It 's a commonplace in college handbooks in the 30s and 40s ( in the U.S. , anyway ) , and probably goes back before that .
The topic comes with images of strength , muscularity , and action ( that is , symbolic masculinity ) , and sometimes the passive voice is seen as part of a larger " passive style " ( copular constructions , abstract nouns , etc. ) .
Zwicky also reminded us of a delicious passage in Merriam - Webster 's Dictionary of English Usage about Orwell .
They reports the bias against the passive as a long - standing prejudice , and take Orwell as the jumping - off place for the discussion ; but they note ( p. 720 ) :
Bryant 1962 reports three statistical studies of passive versus active sentences in various periodicals ; the highest incidence of passive constructions was 13 percent .
Orwell runs to a little over 20 percent in " Politics and the English Language . "
Is n't that gorgeous ?
More passives in Orwell 's pompous essay with the warning about how you must n't use them than in any periodical you can lay your hands on !
The man was either utterly without shame , or blithely unaware of the characteristics of his own usage , or cynically certain that we would n't check .
Liberman chipped in at this point with the observation that the instructions for the preparation of abstracts for the Acoustical Society of America ( see them at http://asa.aip.org/honolulu/honolulu.html#34) are explicit about requiring the passive voice , at least in certain cases :
7 . Use passives instead of pronouns " I " and " we , " e.g. , " It was noted " instead of " We noted . "
He thought it might also be a requirement of the American Institute of Physics ( nobody has checked that yet ) .
Poor general scientific public , though : some sources insisting they must n't use the passive and others insisting that they must !
This all reminded Poser of something in his ( extremely nerdy ) past .
He said :
This seems to be an instance of over - extension of a prescription that in limited circumstances , e.g. dramatic writing , might make sense .
In other circumstances , it really does n't .
Years ago I translated into English the manual describing the implementation of the mathematics library of a Hitachi computer .
It said things like : " The square root function is computed using the Newton - Raphson algorithm .
Three extra bits of precision are used for intermediate calculations . "
In Japanese these sentences were generally active , but Japanese is a language that does not require an overt subject .
The natural translation into English uses the passive .
Hitachi was at the time trying to improve the quality of its English publications and had created translation guidelines that included the admonition not to use the passive .
Figuring out how to translate this kind of material without using the passive was quite difficult since it is hard to decide what subject to use .
Is it the computer ?
The mathematics library ?
The particular function ?
Omitting the subject has the great virtue of avoiding this rather sticky question .
A good point , I thought .
The passive construction certainly has its uses in cases of that sort .
I then reminded everyone that Strunk and White 's vile little compendium of tripe about style ( 4th edition , 2000 , p. 18 ) says " Use the active voice " , and adds some editorializing about how the passive is " less bold , and less concise " , and if you leave out the agent it becomes " indefinite " .
They go on with some mealy - mouthed stuff admitting that they cannot say one must never use it ; but their firm prejudice against it is clear .
Now , those who know me will be able to predict that I could n't resist grabbing a copy of the just - mentioned pathetic booklet ( it was hard to find one ; Poser says he threw his away ) and checking on whether Strunk and White managed to get to the end of the page without accidentally using a passive themselves .
And of course they did n't , the bald - faced hypocritical morons .
Within just a few lines , still talking about how bad the passive is , they write :
Many a tame sentence of description or exposition can be made lively and emphatic by substituting a transitive in the active voice for some such perfunctory expression as there is or could be heard .
This , in addition to containing a passive clause ( the one with be made as verb ) , reveals the interesting fact that they seem to think existential clauses like " There is a spider in the bathtub " are in the passive voice .
You know , I do try to stress the ignorance and inadequacy of Strunk and White as strongly as I can here on Language Log ; but it never seems strong enough .
At this point Liberman came up with an idea for a further investigation .
He grabbed a laptop ( we keep stacks of them lying around in the Senior Writers ' Lounge , like paper napkins ) and did a quick count of the first 100 tensed verbs in E.B.
White 's introduction to Letters of E.B. White ( 1976 ) .
He found that 28 of them were copulas associated with adjectives or predicate nominals ; 51 of them were active verbs ( including quite a few not especially muscular specimens such as " felt lonely " and " came of landed gentry " , where no passive counterpart exists ) ; and 21 were passive verbs ( in fairness , it should be noted that he counted " was born in Brooklyn " as a passive , which could perhaps be argued against ) .
This is either 21 % passives ( 21/100 ) or 29 % passives ( 21/72 ) , depending on what you want to do about the actives that do n't have a passive counterpart and the " be born " case .
In most cases , Liberman observed , the passive clauses could easily have been re-phrased to make the passives into actives , but White had chosen not to do it .
For example :
" This company had a factory in Harlem , where the cases for uprights , squares , and baby grands were manufactured by a crew of beer - drinking Germans , skilled artisans .
The actions ( keyboard , hammers , dampers , etc. ) were bought from a company that specialized in that and were installed at the Horace Waters factory . "
Why not say , where a crew manufactured the pianos ?
Why not say , the Horace Waters company bought the actions from a company that specialized in that , and installed them at the Harlem factory ?
I 'll tell you why .
Because Strunk and White aim to tell you that you must n't use passives ; it does n't apply to them .
What a shameless , pontificating , ignorant , hypocritical , incompetent , authoritarian pair of old weasels they were .

Blow - up :
The startling landscapes of nanotechnology
( Nanowerk Spotlight )
The nanoworld cannot be portrayed with a camera , nor can it be seen even with the most powerful optical microscope .
Only special instruments have access to images of the nanoworld .
A fascinating new exhibition " Blow - up : images from the nanoworld " in Modena / Italy shows the work of scientists associated with the National Center on Nanostructures and Biosystems at Surfaces in Modena , Italy , headed by Elisa Molinari .
The images have been manipulated in a variety of ways by photographer , Lucia Covi .
Covi is particularly sensible to the aesthetic paradigms of scientists : her gaze thus grasps essential aspects of the portrayed objects and allows her to shine them with a new light , as they are revealed now .
This exhibition brings to the public images that are usually accessible to few , because they remain confined in the research laboratories , on the scientists ' desks .
The images are stills that , over time , have been put together from different framings , and that we can look at thanks to the mediation of machines .
Some of them represent exceptional events , outstanding results that ended on the cover of scientific journals .
Others were born from everyday research .
All of them show a landscape that is being unraveled by scientists , scenery that is very different from the one we can see in the media , largely obtained through computer graphics and " artistic " interpretations , when not directly borrowed from science fiction .
Scanning near - field optical microscopy ( SNOM ) uses nanoscale metal tips to scan a surface .
Here , a standard tip has been modified and sharpened to increase its precision .
The tip in the middle of this structure measures a few tens of nanometers .

Developing new instruments to be able to " see " at the nanoscale is a research field in itself .
Shown here is the tip of an atomic force microscope ( AFM ) , one of the foremost tools for imaging , measuring and manipulating matter at the nanoscale .
Here , a platinum electrode measuring one hundredth of a nanometer has been deposited on the tip of this pyramid shaped AFM tip via focused ion beam ( FIB ) deposition .

According to a recent news item , the Indian government will start offering a " dowry " of INR50,000 ( about US $ 1,100 ) to anyone who marries someone from a lower caste .
This money is more than 1.5 years of Indian per-capita GDP .
As per-capita GDP is an average , it is easy to imagine that this money is much more than what the majority of Indians will see in their lifetimes .
Most cannot even imagine what this figure is .
I cannot but shudder at the social corruption this policy will cause .
This issue reminds me of my university days .
I was brought up in a well - off family .
I did my schooling in a private , missionary school .
We all wore the same kind of uniform .
And we had to sing a relatively secular prayer in the mornings .
All this meant that our understanding of the caste system of India was mostly academic .
This equanimity about the caste system did not last .
After school when we went to the state - run university , most of us soon learned to look down on the lower caste — courtesy of the state .
After finishing the school , I went through an extremely competitive entrance examination to get admission into engineering .
Those who gained admission were to become social heroes .
I remember that the minimum required of the higher caste to gain admission was a score over 70 percent .
Because of affirmative action , those of the lower caste had reserved seats .
Unfortunately , the state of public school education — in " schools " that often had no buildings or teachers — is so utterly bad that most of the lower - caste people who joined us knew close to nothing .
Most of them had entered the university with exam scores under 10 percent .
( Even negative scores were not unheard of . )
As a part of the social engineering process , I was not to get my own room in the student hall of residence .
I was allotted a room with someone from a lower caste .
We had nothing in common .
Even our Hindi was so entirely different that we hardly understood each other .
My roommate had probably never seen a proper road or slept under a non-thatched roof until he moved in .
He certainly had no concept of gas cooking and was unaccustomed to the usage of electricity .
I ran from post to pillar to get someone more sophisticated and educated to join in my room .
I wish I could have avoided hurting my original roommate , but I would have , eventually , anyway .
I created all kinds of crazy stories to achieve my aim .
Growing up in India , you learn to do this as a natural part of life .
I hated the state for forcing me into that situation .
Most of my peers began to use derogatory words against those from the lower caste .
There was more to come .
Hardly anyone from the lower caste knew any English , the language for an engineering education .
I soon saw that in the first - year class there were many more people than there were supposed to be .
The reason is that most of the lower - caste students never passed .
Scores of lower caste people had been there for more than a decade — several for twice as long .
A lot of them eventually went back home with worse self - esteem than when they came .
Many of those who matriculated with us were still in the first year when I left .
As if this were not enough , I was soon to realize that the lower - caste people had a special privilege .
Any police report by a lower caste person against a higher - class person meant a non-bailable arrest warrant even without evidence .
I quickly learned that it was safer just to keep my distance .
My classmates who joined the state - run institutions came to realize that those from the lower caste were on a fast - track program from promotion .
You junior soon became your senior .
Certain lower - caste individuals benefited from the privilege ; collectively , their situation only got worse .
Coming back to the case of the " dowry " that the Indian state is offering , all kinds of ugly things will happen to the poor people .
They will be pawns in the hands of politicians looking for votes .
Poor girls will be put in positions where they will be forced to prostitute themselves .
Several years from now when the horrendous effect of the " dowry " start becoming visible , Indian politicians will start talking about all the good intentions with which they started the policy .
But instead of abolishing it , they will fiddle with it , and the cycle of corruption in the society will carry on .
Fortunately , this will not come to pass .
Such a policy , were it delivered by " honest " public servants , would quickly plunge the whole of the lower caste into utter moral corruption .
The redeeming feature is that corrupt Indian bureaucrats and politicians will swindle away most of this " dowry . "
Thank goodness for corruption !
Call me sexist and casteist , but really , it is the poor people that I care to write for .
The rich look after themselves well enough in every society and country .
The supply of education is highly controlled , probably the most of all industries , and finding jobs in the prohibitively regulated manufacturing industry is almost impossible .
If the poor people had some basic access to education and work , later generations would have something to build on .
There is only one kind of equality that should be celebrated in a free society , that is , equality before the law , or what Roderick Long calls more broadly " equality of authority . "
That kind of equality is exercised through free association .
The best the state can do to bring about this ideal is to stop interfering in all manner of social and economic relations between people .
We present a refined approach to parallel array fusion that uses indexed types to specify the internal representation of each array .
Our approach aids the client programmer in reasoning about the performance of their program in terms of the source code .
It also makes the intermediate code easier to transform at compile - time , resulting in faster compilation and more reliable runtimes .
We demonstrate how our new approach improves both the clarity and performance of several end - user written programs , including a fluid flow solver and an interpolator for volumetric data .

Today , democracy is what has been called an " essentially contested concept . "
We project our various pet values onto it , and then are puzzled that it cannot consistently hold them all .
Francis Fukuyama , who has argued that democracy is " the end point of mankind 's ideological evolution , " refuses to admit the Athenian demos to the club , on the grounds that it failed to protect human rights -- notably , the right of its most famous citizen , Socrates , to corrupt the young and invent his own gods .
Others are similarly loath to extend the rubric of democracy to present - day Iran , where elections are held under the supervision of a priestly caste , or to the Palestinian entity , on the grounds that the newly elected Hamas government is a terrorist organization .
The United States is governed neither by priests nor by terrorists ( notwithstanding some overheated rhetoric to that effect ) but by professional politicians -- or " electoral entrepreneurs , " as the economist Joseph Schumpeter called them -- who compete for our votes .
They are said to represent us , but representation is as vexed a notion as democracy itself .
Clearly , politicians do not represent us in the sense of being like us : quite apart from some peculiar psychological characteristics common to the breed , they are older , maler , whiter and lawyers almost to a man .
Ideally , though , they represent us in the sense of looking after our interests , the way a guardian represents an infant in law .
Unlike an infant , we have an intermittent right to replace them with other politicians if we judge them to be ineffective in this representative role .
But , owing to a byzantine division of labor , much of what politicians do is hidden away from the public eye .
Moreover , in one of the more devastating theoretical arguments against democracy , Anthony Downs observed that most citizens have no economic incentive to learn enough about what politicians do to vote intelligently .
Nearly half of American voters acquiesce in their infantilization by not voting at all .
Should any of this make us yearn for Athenian - style demokratia , where citizens come together on terms of equality to reach consensus about the common good ?
An innovation in this direction has been proposed by James Fishkin , a political scientist at Stanford , and Bruce Ackerman , a Yale law professor .
They envisage a new national holiday , called " Deliberation Day , " a couple of weeks before each major election .
On this day , voters would gather in groups as large as 500 and hash out issues together , like the ancient Athenians .
( Unlike the Athenians , participants in Deliberation Day would be paid $ 150 each . )
If this sort of thing sounds appealing , keep in mind that the right to address your fellow citizens is accompanied by the less agreeable duty to heed what they have to say , and that means all of them .
If nothing else , the system we sloppily call democracy provides a way to get rid of a lousy regime without the bother of overthrowing it by force .
As for its apparent historic inevitability , that may owe largely to the difficulty of finding any other source of legitimacy besides " the people . " " Virtue " ?
That went out with Plato .
" Embodying the national spirit " became unfashionable with Hitler , as did " expressing the will of the proletariat " with Stalin .
True , some rulers continue to imagine that they were chosen by God .
But almost no one takes that idea seriously anymore .
THE WAY WE LIVE NOW : 4-23-06 Jim
Holt is a frequent contributor to the magazine .
Kris Alexander is a Captain in the U.S. Army , with experience in intelligence , homeland security , hazardous materials , and weapons of mass destruction .
His March , 2005
story for Wired , " We Need Spy Blogs , " has quietly become one of the most influential articles on intelligence matters in recent years .
Everyone here at the DANGER ROOM is beyond psyched to have Kris contributing .
Chlorine is to weapons of mass destruction as Run / DMC is to rap : old school .
The OG of WMD is making a comeback on the mean streets of Baghdad , and it is n’t good .
Fellow DANGER ROOM contributor
Jason Sigger has pointed out the media hype that has followed these attacks .
And he ’s right so far .
Chlorine is more hype than hurt , but it does add an ugly new facet to the war .
So let ’s put on our thinking hats and learn a little about our nasty little friend chlorine .
It ’s everywhere and sometimes in large quantities .
One of its primary uses is water purification so everywhere that there is water production , there is chlorine .
Good news : in the US , Hazmat teams spend a lot of time dealing with it and training for releases .
Lugging around a chlorine kit in a Level
A suit is not fun ( trust me ) , but dealing with chlorine releases is part of the curriculum for all Hazmat Technician training .
There are releases , but fire departments with hazmat teams are ready .
This is not to say that these releases are n’t significant emotional events .
According to the 2004 Emergency Response
Guide ( which every concerned citizen should know and love ) the impact of chlorine release is as follows :
Small Spills Large Spills Isolate : Protect Downwind : Isolate : Protect Downwind : 30
meters ( 100 feet ) Day : Night : 240
meters or 800 feet Day : Night : .2
km or .2
miles 1.2
km or .8
miles 2.4
km or 1.5 miles 7.4
km or 4.6 miles
What does all of that mean ?
Well , " Isolate " is short for blocking off the area and having people in the hotzone protect or shelter in place .
" Protect downwind " has you either evacuating the population or protecting them in place .
( And you thought duct tape and plastic was one big joke . )
The ERG distances are a rough estimate intended as a starting point in an emergency .
Weather and terrain impact what the gas will do .
A large spill in an urban area is bad news .
Chlorine gas is heavier than air so it tends to hug the terrain in a vapor cloud , especially at night .
Given the right weather conditions , it might take hours for a cloud to dissipate as it moves downwind or downhill .
In the US , communities are prepared for this , but is the Baghdad
Fire Department Hazmat team ready ?
I sure hope so .
Chlorine attacks the body in two ways : 1 ) as an inhalation hazard where it produces choking , respiratory distress , and at high concentrations our good friend pulmonary edema .
2 ) as a contact hazard where it burns eyes , mucous membranes , and even moist skin where it reacts with moisture forming hydrochloric acid .
According to my
NIOSH pocket guide ( another great document BTW ) , Chlorine is Immediately
Dangerous to Life and Health at 10 parts per million .
Air purifying respirators ( gas masks ) are recommended for escape use at concentrations up to 5 parts per million with the appropriate filter .
The odor threshold for chlorine is about .3 parts per million .
In other words , if you smell it , you have plenty of time to mask up and get the hell out , but in order to enter the hotzone and take care of business , you need to be wearing a self contained breathing apparatus and a fully encapsulated chemical protective garment .
Level A all the way .
At the smell threshold , people might begin feeling other effects such as burning eyes and nose .
People are chemo - phobic so even those who are n’t in an area of dangerous concentration will be worried .
And the worried well often find their way to hospitals where they can overwhelm even the best emergency rooms .
So chlorine might not be a weapon of mass destruction , but it sure as hell is a weapon of mass effect .
A large release done the right way can send a city reeling .
The use of chlorine as a weapon indicates to me that the insurgents are adapting and upping the ante .
Imagine living in a city where there are explosions , shootings , and mayhem every day of the week .
Now , add poison gas to the mixture .
Life in Baghdad sucks worse everyday .
If I were a planner in Baghdad right now , I ’d get smart on hazmat in a hurry because I ’m guessing that this is just the beginning .
Notes : I debated about writing about this for fear of giving the insurgents information that they can use .
They have the internets too .
Therefore , I have omitted any reference to how US Forces deal with this threat .
All the information that I have used is available in open source .
I hope any of the bad guys messing with this stuff die painfully in a green cloud of choking death , but that ’s just me .
Also , Dick Destiny has in interesting post on this .
He makes some good points about the domestic panic over chemicals .
Like I said , people are chemo- phobic .
In the US , we ’d be better served with a robust education program about sheltering in place than spending billions on protecting chemicals that are basically everywhere .
Communities near chemical plants have been doing this effectively for years .

Wally Wise .
Finally , the Chlorine
Institute is a great resource for responders dealing with this substance .

UPDATE : " Al - Qaida militants in Iraq were preparing to make crude chemical weapons using chlorine at a car bomb factory discovered west of Baghdad this week , " according to Reuters .

Because as much [... ]
Millions of Tiny Spiders Spin Mystery in a British Columbia Clover Field Experience is never limited , and it is never complete ; it is an immense sensibility , a kind of huge spider - web of the finest silken threads suspended in the chamber of consciousness , and catching every air - borne particle in its tissue .
- Henry James
A warning :
If the thought of tens of millions of tiny spiders spinning a web 24 hectares - 60 acres - in size and crawling all over it scares the wits out of you , you might want to tread carefully over the following .
Because that 's exactly what happened last month on a farmer 's field near McBride , about 220 kilometres east of Prince George .
For reasons that area scientists do n't really understand , millions and millions of tiny black spiders called Halorates ksenius - they have no common name - became trapped in Russell Jervis ' clover field and started spinning webs .
Halorates ksenius is not a big spider .
" One could fit comfortably on a Smartie with plenty of room to spare , " says Brian Thair , a cell biologist at the College of New Caledonia in Prince George .
( Or to put it another way , it 's about as big as a capital " O " printed on this page . )
A typical barbwire fence on wood posts surrounded the field about six kilometres east of McBride in the Robson Valley .
Thair said it looked like the whole area was covered with an opaque , white plastic grocery store bag .
The thin , elastic coasting was not soft and fluffy like webs built by individual spiders .
There were about two spiders per square centimetre laying the silk , which first appeared in early October .
Thair said the web showed great tensile strength - enough to put a handful of coins on it without them falling through .
There were " in the order of tens of millions of spiders running frantically back and forth , " but they were n't interacting with each other .
It 's just because so many of them were in the field that the web grew and grew until at its largest , 60 acres , it was as big as the triangle - shaped field it covered .
Thair had never seen anything like it before .
" It was astounding to see , " he said .
" I could n't believe my eyes .
From two kilometres away it looked like a sheet of wet aluminium .
It was the size of several city blocks .
I have never in my 30 years as a biologist seen anything like this , in terms of quantity of spiders and quantity of web .
Nothing even remotely approaching this . "
Most of the web is gone now .
Storms have ripped it apart .
But during October and into early November , Thair says , it was home to possibly hundreds of millions of tiny black spiders that just kept spinning and reproducing .
That caused the web to grow so large depends on whom you ask .
Thair speculates that perhaps because of some unusual weather conditions in late summer and early fall , the spiders were unable to disperse .
Normally , when young spiders reach reproductive age , they spin a thread of web - a silk parachute - which is then caught by a breeze and lifts them into the air .
It 's called " ballooning . "
The wind carries the thread , with the spider attached to it , for some distance before dropping it .
Where the spider lands is where it makes its home .
But
Thair guesses that because of too much rain or an absence of wind , the spiders in Jervis ' field were unable to balloon , so they stayed where they were .
Then they laid eggs , which turned into more spiders , which laid eggs and became yet more spiders .
Added to that was the fact that for some reason - again
Thair does n't know what it was - the adult spiders failed to die , so they kept on reproducing too .
And on and on it went .
Since the spiders did n't seem to care if an occasional insect stumbled into their construction , Thair does n't think it was built for trapping purposes .
He suggests the spiders encountered an enormous quantity of high quality , nutritious prey to be able to accomplish this feat .
But he 's also heard other suggestions .
" Some people have said , 'oh yes , well it 's a trampoline for aliens , ' " Thair joked .
" Or maybe it was an effort collectively by these spiders to try and catch a sheep . "
Robb Bennett , an entomologist with the BC Ministry of Forests disagrees .
He says the " sheet of gossamer " was likely millions and millions of drag lines the spiders produced prior to dispersing .
Drag lines , he says , are anchors that spiders produce routinely to keep them connected with the ground .
Bennett says these spiders - what he calls " LBJs for Little Brown Jobs " - and others very like them , live commonly in the north and probably emerged from the ground looking for the highest points in the field from which to disperse .
However , because no one who saw the web saw any spiders dispersing , he can't say for sure that a dispersal took place .
Nor has Bennett ever heard of so many spiders behaving this way so far north .
He 's never seen the phenomenon himself , but does have a photo of a similar event in the 1990s in Louisiana .
Consequently , he speculates that it may have something to do with warm temperatures .
Whatever the cause , Bennett agrees with Thair that it was extraordinary .
Jervis , who has owned the land for 60 years , has never seen anything like it on his farm .
" The first people who saw it [ in early October ] thought it was frost , " he said .
" Then they realised it could n't be frost because there was n't frost anywhere else .
It just kept growing and growing .
Like everybody else , I 'd never seen anything like it before . "
Jervis plowed the field early this year , which meant that in addition to the stubble a few young plants were starting to sprout .
They were covered in thick cobwebs .
So were the fenceposts surrounding the field .
So thick , says
Thair , that he had to use a hunting knife to cut pieces of it away .
( Comparatively , a spider 's web is stronger than steel . )
The field itself was translucent , covered with just a thin layer of web that broke if you walked on it .
But on the fenceposts , where it was thickest , it was like sheets of grocery store plastic , says Thair .
" You know how when you stretch a piece of plastic tight over a bowl , your fingers bounce off it ?
That 's what it felt like . "
Matthew Wheeler , a freelance photographer who lives in McBride , spent 5 hours one day taking pictures of the web and the spiders scurrying all over it .
" The top of every plant and willow bush and fencepost was completely capped with this white sheet , " he says .
" And the whole field was undulating in a delicate way in the breeze . "
But if that sounds vaguely beautiful , there was a point when Wheeler said it was anything but .
" There were spiders crawling all over my trousers and jacket , and they had started to spin webs over my camera bag .
So I started to think about all the poison represented by all those millions and millions of spiders out there , and I started to wonder if I was being really stupid standing there . "
He was never bitten , but the sight of thousands of spiders " seething " over a fencepost is one he 'll never forget .
" I 've photographed all kinds of things in astronomy and nature , but this was in a class of its own . "
Could it happen again next year ?
Thair does n't know how the spiders were able to survive so close together for so long .
It takes a lot of energy and protein to spin a web , so the spiders must have had a ready food source while they were trapped in the field .
Thair does n't know what it was nor does he know if they laid eggs which will survive over the winter .
But he intends to examine the field more closely in coming weeks and months to find out .
Thair has no patience with anyone who might be grossed out by the idea of so many spiders .
" People are taught to be afraid of spiders , " he says .
" That 's disgusting .
Anyone who was afraid of spiders would n't have gone near this , and they would have missed something extraordinary .
Adults inadvertently destroy their children 's interest in science and nature by telling them to be afraid of spiders .
They should stop . "

The Dysdera Crocata spider Merseyside is being hit by a spate of spider attacks .
This 6 - eyed spider normally eats woodlouse but now has a taste for human flesh .
Experts say the pain from its double - pricked sting can last for 24 hours .
Paul Rowley , of Liverpool 's School of Tropical Medicine , said : " There have been a number of cases of spiders biting people in Merseyside . "
The attacks have centered on Liverpool and the Wirral , reports The Guardian .
The spider , dysdera crocata , normally lives under stones or in rotting wood , but they sometimes venture into homes - especially those with damp problems .

Tesco Uses Killer Spiders
The average human eats 8 spiders in his / her lifetime while sleeping .
Deadly ... Black Widow spider by Jamie Pyatt Tesco yesterday admitted using deadly Black Widow spiders to kill off insects in its bunches of grapes .
The shock revelation comes after three women found Black Widows — two of them ALIVE — in fruit they bought at different Tesco stores .
The spiders , which have red markings on their backs , were introduced to Tesco vineyards in California as an alternative to pesticide , following customer demand for " natural " food .
But the grapes are supposed to be hand - checked before being exported .
Tesco spokesman Greg Sage said last night : “ We use natural predators on grapes because they prevent insects from puncturing the grapes .
The spiders are very effective .
All I can do is apologise for any distress this may have caused .
We ’ve spoken to our suppliers to ensure that the checking process is as good as it can be .
The fact that the spiders are alive is evidence that we ’re not using pesticides — because if we were they ’d be dead . ”
A Foods Standard Agency spokesman said : “ The local authority has powers to take action . ” London - based spider expert Paul Hillyard said : “ Black Widows can cause considerable damage with a bite which is potentially lethal . ”
Edward Cooper , 10 , and sister Sophie , 5 , whose mum Linda , 39 ,
found a Black Widow in Tesco grapes at Fleetsbridge , Dorset .

Sam Marshall does n’t waste much time .
Seconds after stepping into the steaming rain forest of French Guiana , he announces his agenda : " Let ’s divide and search for holes with big , hairy legs . "
After all , he has n’t come to French Guiana for the beaches ( muddy and shark infested ) , the food ( cheese , bread , and sardines ) , or the shopping ( none , but credit cards can be used to dig out ticks ) .
He has come for the tarantulas - tarantulas that are big enough to eat birds .
French Guiana , best known for the notorious Devil ’s Island penal colony , is the tarantula capital of the world .

Marshall ’s freckled face is inches from a fist - size hole inhabited by a quarter - pound tarantula .
Make that an angry quarter - pound tarantula .
With a walnut - size abdomen and a head as large as a 50 - cent piece , the goliath birdeater has a 12 - inch - wide leg span that could cover your face .
Or in this case , Marshall ’s face .
" Oh !
Now she ’s kicking ! "
Marshall says as he shines his headlamp into the hole .
" She might be kicking hairs !
Can you hear her hissing ? "
A rasping sound comes from the hole .
But Marshall holds his ground .
A few seconds later , he wishes he had n’t .
His face is itching and burning .
The goliath birdeater has used her hind legs to kick microscopically barbed hairs off her abdomen .
They ended up in Marshall ’s face , irritating his skin , eyes , and nose .
Despite its size , the goliath is n’t deadly to humans , but its defense mechanisms are more than unpleasant .
For Marshall , a face full of tarantula hair is part of the job .
And before long he ’s back looking into the same hole .
So little is known about the goliath that despite its name ( bestowed because an early specimen was recorded feeding on a songbird ) , nobody actually knows what it normally eats .
Only twice has the species been seen making a kill in the wild - once an earthworm , another time a caecilian , an amphibian .
To Marshall , such ignorance is indicative of what ’s wrong with arachnology .
" Here we have the biggest of something in the world , and nobody studies it ! " he says .
Despite the growing number of humans who seem to enjoy keeping tarantulas as pets , the spiders are mostly a mystery .
Marshall is one of only a dozen arachnologists worldwide specialising in them - and the only scientist who runs a lab full of tarantulas gathered from around the globe .
He is also the only scientist who has written a popular book about the creatures : Tarantulas and Other Arachnids : A Complete Pet Owner ’s Manual .
" It ’s a pretty huge unfilled niche that he ’s in , " says Jonathan Coddington , an arachnologist at the Smithsonian Institution .
Scientists have long dismissed tarantulas as too primitive to exhibit interesting behaviour .
Arising 150 million years ago from a smaller , hairy ancestor , the creatures retain such primitive characteristics as fangs that move up and down instead of sideways , and they do n’t weave webs .
In his Biology of Spiders ( 1982 edition ) , German arachnologist Ranier Foelix barely mentions tarantulas .
" Not long ago , " wrote English biologist T H Savory of Malvern College , " the spiders were the most neglected of the most interesting animals . "
Another reason for the neglect has been the tarantulas themselves .
They are more difficult to study than common garden spiders .
They tend to live deep in sometimes - twisting holes in the sweaty tropics , they ’re too big to fit under a microscope , and females can live for 30 years , making for long time frames between generations and slow captive breeding .
Marshall , son of the late actor E G Marshall , is changing that - and at the same time , he hopes , the tarantula ’s image as the bloodthirsty villain of grade B horror films .
He says part of his job is to " de - demonise these spiders .
They do n’t have a bloodlust to bite people .
They ’re just little fuzzy creatures , and if you handle them correctly , they ’re harmless .
I just basically make them seem like interesting animals rather than some horrible creature . "
His studies have revealed a surprising aspect of the breed : tarantulas share many behaviours with mammals .
Like most spiders , they seem to be solitary cannibals , so intolerant of company that some females snack on their suitors .
But others tenderly care for their young , and tarantula families sometimes share food .
Mother tarantulas are known to go without eating so that their offspring can eat .
Muses Marshall , " Who ’d have thought that the world ’s scariest spider would have family values ? "
Still , spiders are not hamsters , and on the door of his lab at Hiram College ’s J H Barrow Field Station , 20 miles southeast of Cleveland , Marshall has posted rules for visitors : " Do not open or move any container .
Many tarantula species are very fast and aggressive and will bite .
Accidentally releasing a tarantula could end badly for both you and the spider .
Please do n’t take any unsupervised tours ! "
But Marshall is happy to supervise visits and proudly declares , " This is the only comparative tarantula lab that is global in reach . "
To prove it , he points out a silver and black Heteroscodra maculata , originally from Cameroon , that resides in a wide - mouthed plastic coffee jug marked " Use Extreme Caution " and " Potentially Dangerous . "
In a glass jar that once held 155 pieces of watermelon - flavored taffy , he has restrained an iridescent Avicularia metallica , collected off a tree at a rest stop along Route 1 outside Cayenne , French Guiana .
There are Tanzanian chestnut tarantulas in plastic food tubs , and baby blonde - leg tarantulas in potato - salad deli cups .
Marshall says his spiders are comfortable .
Few tarantulas roam widely , preferring to live out their lives almost entirely within inches of their burrows .
" You can say tarantulas are agoraphobics , " he said .
" See how they live in the wild : one foot in a tidy , snug hole .
Tarantulas just do their thing , whether they ’re in a plastic container from Wal - Mart or on the side of a tree in South America . "
All in all , there are about 500 live tarantulas in a room the size of a spacious kitchen .
Many of them were originally housed at Marshall ’s house , where he kept " a big collection " of tarantulas for a number of years .
How big ?
" Hundreds , " he answers .
" Hundreds . Hundreds . "
During his postdoctoral years at Miami University in Ohio , he had a 2 - bedroom apartment - " one people bedroom , one tarantula bedroom . "
He had already married a fellow arachnologist , Maggie Hodge , who clearly did not mind spiders .
She did not , however , like the rattlesnake that was living in his closet when they met at the University of Cincinnati .
Marshall ’s course in life was set in his teens - possibly from the moment he saw his first tarantula in a tank on the desk of a US Park Service ranger in New Mexico .
" I saw that and thought it was the most amazing thing , " says Marshall .
The large spiders soon joined the menagerie of exotic poultry , turtles , snakes , monitor lizards , and falcons he kept in sheds behind his parents ’ house in Mount Kisco , New York , and in their labyrinthine basement .
When he was an undergrad at Bard College in New York , tarantulas shared his dorm room with a hawk , ferrets , a monitor lizard , and a ball python .
( The dean of students made him move his scorpions to the biology department . )
" I think of myself as a xenophile , " Marshall says .
" I was drawn to things that are different . "
And what could possibly be more different than a tarantula - a big , hairy spider who wears her skeleton on the outside , who smells and tastes with her feet , and whose fanged , eye - covered head is also endowed with eight legs , two arms , and a sucking stomach ?
When threatened , the Usambara orange tarantula can get very aggressive .
It rears up , slaps the ground , hisses loudly , and even drips venom from its fangs .
" They do n’t try to bite very much , " says arachnologist Sam Marshall .
" It ’s really just a display . "
Tarantulas are far less dangerous to humans than other spiders , such as the black widow .
No tarantula ’s venom is toxic enough to kill a human , and they seldom bite .
But they shed their hairs - projections on the exoskeleton called setae .
Although tarantula hobbyists have endured the hairs for decades , the details of their use for defense were not studied until the 1970s , when researchers discovered that some of them seem to be designed to defend against a single species .
The hairs of the Mexican blonde tarantula , for instance , are adapted to irritate only the nasal passages of the grasshopper mouse - a job they do so well that they can kill the rodent .
So far , seven structurally distinct types of defensive hairs have been recognised ; Marshall discovered one of those and found new uses for several others .
Some species , for example , shed clouds of golden hairs from their mouths ; others shed from their bellies .
One sheds hairs onto egg sacs to protect its young from predators and parasites .
The goliath birdeater , Marshall found , uses its hairs to create a special silken mat on which it lies upside down when molting .
But perhaps the most original use to which tarantulas have put their copious hair - including the goliath birdeater - is to make noise .
The goliath makes the loudest sound of any spider - a hiss audible from 10 feet away and designed to scare off predators .
Marshall discovered that the noise comes from a scrubbing motion the tarantula makes with the two food - handling arms at the front of its head and the first two pairs of its walking legs .
The noise sounds like strips of Velcro being ripped apart and is created in much the same manner - by entangling the microscopic hooks of one set of leg hairs with the filaments of another and pulling them away from each other .
Marshall ’s discovery was confirmed in a series of ingenious experiments .
In one , his collaborator Ellen Thoms at the Cincinnati Zoo spray - painted molted tarantula exoskeletons gold to prepare them for study under an electron microscope , which revealed the fine structures of the hooks and filaments .
In another experiment , Marshall shaved the legs of one of the giant arachnids .
He knocked out his subject with CO 2 , removed some hairs with a razor , revived the beast , riled him , then listened for hissing .
Then he shaved a little more .
When the hissing stopped , he knew he had hit the right hairs .
The experiments went well beyond understanding the hairs themselves .
They show that tarantulas evolved profoundly and rapidly to adapt to ecological challenges - unlike such living fossils as horseshoe crabs , which have remained unchanged for millions of years .
The great challenge for tarantulas was probably the sudden appearance of burrow - dwelling , spider - hunting mammals , the forerunners of today ’s skunks and possums .
" Some tarantula ancestor evolved the urticating hairs , and it just went woof !
It just took over , " Marshall says .
" It ’s one of the greatest evolutionary tales you can tell . "
Urticating hairs - those that provoke itching - evolved only in New World tarantulas , which reside in areas ranging from the South American tropics to as far north as Rolla , Missouri .
About 500 of Earth ’s 850 tarantula species live in the Americas .
Of those , 460 have urticating hairs .
In the tropics , the hairs are not the perfect defense against the coatimundi , a long - snouted relative of the raccoon that can move fast enough to avoid the hairs .
Wasps are another problem for tarantulas .
Several varieties paralyse tarantulas with their sting and then lay eggs in the spider ’s abdomen .
When the eggs hatch , the paralysed spider is eaten alive by wasp larvae .
Even the goliath birdeater is not immune .
The particular species of wasp that feeds on the goliath is the size of a sparrow .
Elsewhere , tarantulas without hairy weapons have had to make do with aggression .
Marshall says tarantulas from Asia , Europe , Australia , and Africa can seem nasty - tempered .
He tells a story about one tarantula in Australia that reared up and , waving its legs and gnashing its fangs , chased away a dog .
Although a tarantula can’t kill humans , " the venom of Australian tarantulas is deadly to dogs , " Marshall says .
" It ’s one of those flukes of venom . "
When it ’s feeding time at the spider lab , Marshall uses tweezers to seize a cricket hopping around the food terrarium , opens a tarantula container , and drops in the insect .
The spider gravitates to it like metal to a magnet , then begins to chew and suck its food .
Although tarantulas are such eager eaters that they often eat each other , Marshall found that a female Tanzanian chestnut tarantula will put down its freshly killed prey and allow its young to feed instead .
" They appear to sacrifice for their offspring , " Marshall says .
" They defer eating themselves .
They become anorexic .
While the babies get fat , the mother shrinks . "
What ’s more , some tarantula young appear to cooperate with one another at mealtime .
With most spider species , the young push their siblings away from food .
But in the Cameroon red tarantulas that Marshall describes in a forthcoming paper , spiderlings not only feed side by side without aggression but with their legs woven together .
When Marshall saw this he realised : " They are huddle - feeding together .
This is cooperation ! "
A Memphis Zoo colleague , Steven Reichling , recorded a similarly striking behaviour in a related species of African baboon spider , Hysterocrates crassipes .
He noted that a female spider faced with another mother ’s hungry babies did not try to kill or injure them - even when they annoyingly crawled up her legs and tried to eat her meal .
In the company of suitors , females of this species also exhibited remarkable restraint : a male survived in a female ’s enclosure for two months without being cannibalised and finally was removed without incident .
Even more surprising , in a presentation at the Ohio Academy of Science two years ago , two of Marshall ’s undergraduate students demonstrated that Indian ornamental tarantulas - fast , high - strung spiders with bright black - and - yellow markings on their forelegs - usually choose to live with a sibling .
Melissa Varrecchia and Barbara Vasquez offered twenty 11 - month - old tarantulas a choice of retreats : a tube in which a sibling had spun silk or an identical empty one .
Fourteen chose their sibling ’s tube .
Under Marshall ’s tutelage , another undergraduate , Amanda Wiegand , discovered that an inch- long East African tarantula performs an elaborate courtship dance in which both the male and female participate .
The male twitches and drums his legs , and the female responds by gracefully fanning her legs .
The dance continues for several minutes before ending in copulation .
It is the first case of tarantula courtship described by scientists .
Such findings have changed Marshall ’s entire view of spiders .
A year and a half ago he told a radio interviewer that the scientific paradigm he was taught for the life of a spider was simple : " They hatch , they grow , they live in the eternal now moment , and there ’s really no role for experience shaping their behaviour - they ’re like little machines . "
Now he has watched them for too long to believe that .
" I ’ve repeatedly seen tarantulas respond to my entering a room by moving to a different part of the cage or going into a retreat , " he says .
" When you walk in the room , they know :
Here comes this huge thing again . "
Furthermore , individual tarantulas exhibit individual quirks .
" I ’ve brought a lot of Theraphosa out [ of the jungle ] and into captivity , " Marshall says .
" Some would settle down and adapt to the artificial habitat of a terrarium with a cave I provided , while others would pace and pace .
It ’s very clear to me that individual spiders can differ in how they respond to stimuli . "
Tarantula hobbyists have reported similar observations .
One told Marshall how a tarantula methodically sorted the multicolored aquarium gravel in its tank into separate colours .
Another had a female tarantula who learned to unscrew the lid to her container .
He found her two days later in a stack of folded laundry .
" Personality is a heavy word to put on a bug , " Marshall says , " but if you define personality as individual behaviour responses - well , I ’ve had some spiders , tarantulas of the same species and from the same population , and I can take one out of a box and let it run over my hand , and I have others that just freak out and try to run away .
A lot of that is individual variation in how they respond to being touched . "
Still , he is not sure how far he can go with this notion .
Tarantulas , he ponders , " probably know something about the area where they live , the landscape they live in , at some spidery level that we can only guess at .
Long - lived , giant spiders have a lot more going on than we have any idea of . "

Pluto ( L ) , pictured with its largest moon , Charon , is now a dwarf planet
On Thursday , experts approved a definition of a planet that demoted Pluto to a lesser category of object .
But the lead scientist on Nasa 's robotic mission to Pluto has lambasted the ruling , calling it " embarrassing " .
And the chair of the committee set up to oversee agreement on a definition implied that the vote had effectively been " hijacked " .
I have nothing but ridicule for this decision
Alan Stern , Southwest Research Institute
The new solar system
Only 424 astronomers who remained in Prague for the last day of the meeting took part .
An initial proposal by the IAU to add three new planets to the Solar System - the asteroid Ceres , Pluto 's moon Charon and the distant world known as 2003 UB313 - met with considerable opposition at the meeting .
Days of heated debate followed during which four separate proposals were tabled .
Eventually , the scientists adopted historic guidelines that see Pluto relegated to a secondary category of " dwarf planets " .
Drawing the line
Dr Alan Stern , who leads the US space agency 's New Horizons mission to Pluto and did not vote in Prague , told BBC News : " It 's an awful definition ; it 's sloppy science and it would never pass peer review - for two reasons .
Pluto was discovered in 1930 by the American Clyde Tombaugh
" Secondly , the actual definition is even worse , because it 's inconsistent . "
One of the three criteria for planethood states that a planet must have " cleared the neighbourhood around its orbit " .
The largest objects in the Solar System will either collect together material in their path or fling it out of the way with a gravitational swipe .
Pluto was disqualified because its highly elliptical orbit overlaps with that of Neptune .
But Dr Stern pointed out that Earth , Mars , Jupiter and Neptune have also not fully cleared their orbital zones .
Earth orbits with 10,000 near - Earth asteroids .
Jupiter , meanwhile , is accompanied by 100,000 Trojan asteroids on its orbital path .
These rocks are all essentially chunks of rubble left over from the formation of the Solar System more than four billion years ago .
" If Neptune had cleared its zone , Pluto would n't be there , " he added .
Stern said like - minded astronomers had begun a petition to get Pluto reinstated .
Car bumper stickers compelling motorists to " Honk if Pluto is still a planet " have gone on sale over the internet and e-mails circulating about the decision have been describing the IAU as the " Irrelevant Astronomical Union " .
' Inconvenient arrangements '
Owen Gingerich chaired the IAU 's planet definition committee and helped draft an initial proposal raising the number of planets from nine to 12 .
The Harvard professor emeritus blamed the outcome in large part on a " revolt " by dynamicists - astronomers who study the motion and gravitational effects of celestial objects .
PLUTO - A 'DEMOTED PLANET '
Named after underworld god Average of 5.9bn km to Sun Orbits Sun every 248 years Diameter of 2,360 km
Has at least three moons Rotates every 6.8 days Gravity about 6 % of Earth 's Surface temperature - 233C US probe ( above ) visits in 2015
" Their revolt raised enough of a fuss to destroy the scientific integrity and subtlety of the [ earlier ] resolution . "
He added : " There were 2,700 astronomers in Prague during that 10 - day period .
But only 10 % of them voted this afternoon .
Those who disagreed and were determined to block the other resolution showed up in larger numbers than those who felt 'oh well , this is just one of those things the IAU is working on ' . "
E-voting
Professor Gingerich , who had to return home to the US and therefore could not vote himself , said he would like to see electronic ballots introduced in future .
Alan Stern agreed : " I was not allowed to vote because I was not in a room in Prague on Thursday 24th .
Of 10,000 astronomers , 4 % were in that room - you can't even claim consensus .
" If everyone had to travel to Washington DC every time we wanted to vote for President , we would have very different results because no one would vote .
In today 's world that is idiotic .
I have nothing but ridicule for this decision . "
He added that he could not see the resolution standing for very long and did not plan to change any of the astronomy textbook he was currently writing .
But other astronomers were happy to see Pluto cast from the official roster of planets .
Professor Iwan Williams , the IAU 's president of planetary systems science , commented : " Pluto has lots and lots of friends ; we 're not so keen to have Pluto and all his friends in the club because it gets crowded .
" By the end of the decade , we would have had 100 planets , and I think people would have said 'my goodness , what a mess they made back in 2006 ' . "
Shaking hands
Robin Catchpole , of the Institute of Astronomy in Cambridge , UK , said : " My own personal opinion was to leave things as they were .
I met Clyde Tombaugh , who discovered Pluto , and thought , it 's nice to shake hands with someone who discovered a planet .
Mike Brown 's discovery precipitated the Pluto crisis
The need for a strict definition was deemed necessary after new telescope technologies began to reveal far - off objects that rivalled Pluto in size .
The critical blow for Pluto came with the discovery three years ago of an object currently designated 2003 UB313 .
Discovered by Mike Brown and colleagues at the California Institute of Technology , 2003 UB313 has been lauded by some as the " 10th Planet " .
Measurements by the Hubble Space Telescope show it to have a diameter of 3,000 km ( 1,864 miles ) , a few hundred km more than Pluto .
2003 UB313 will now join Pluto in the dwarf planet category .
Mike Brown seemed happy with Pluto 's demotion .
" Eight is enough , " he told the Associated Press , jokingly adding : " I may go down in history as the guy who killed Pluto . "
NASA Open Source Software
NASA conducts research and development in software and software technology as an essential response to the needs of NASA missions .
Under the NASA Software Release policy , NASA has several options for the release of NASA developed software technologies .
These options now include Open Source software release .
This option is under the NASA Open Source Agreement " NOSA " .
The motivations for NASA to distribute software codes Open Source are :
Correction Appended
At 40 , Jeff Gaynor barely resembled the young man who , in his early 20’s , ran half - marathons and performed martial arts .
Mr. Gaynor , who lives in Champaign , Ill. , was so sleep deprived from pain in his hip that he had not had one good night ’s sleep in seven years , he said .
His body was so twisted and his gait so peculiar that children ran in the other direction when they saw him .
Unable to stand and barely able to walk , he resigned from his job as a mathematics professor at the University of Illinois .
His young sons became accustomed to a father who could not run , play or even go to the mall without a lot of planning .
He gained weight — 70 pounds — because although he was sedentary , he still ate like an athlete .
But Mr. Gaynor , now 45 , has been able to resume some of his former activities because of a new surgical implant called the Birmingham Hip Resurfacing System , an alternative to total hip replacement .
The Islamic militia remains in control of Mogadishu airport
Jets hit the international airport in the capital , Mogadishu , and another at Balidogle , in the south of the country .
The Union of Islamic Courts ( UIC ) has been fighting Somalia 's weak interim government and its Ethiopian backers .
Ethiopia 's prime minister has said his country is " at war " with the Islamists , and the Red Cross has urged all parties to protect civilians from harm .
Thousands of Somalis have fled the escalating violence , and the Red Cross says the fighting is straining an already weak support system in the country .
Red Cross official Pedram Yazdi told the BBC that the organisation was treating 445 people injured during the fighting , including combatants and civilians .
Aircraft are taking some two tonnes of supplies into Somalia from Kenya each day in an effort to keep hospitals adequately supplied , he said .
Town captured
Two senior leaders of the UIC , Sheikh Hassan Dahir Aweys and Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed , landed at Mogadishu shortly after the Ethiopian air strike , a clear sign that the attack did not disable the runway .
The airport was recently reopened by the UIC - which holds most of central and southern Somalia .
We will overcome the Ethiopian troops in our land .
Our forces are alert and ready [ to ] defend our country
Abdirahman Janaqow
Islamic Courts spokesman
Ethiopia 's Somali test Q&A : Islamist advance Send us your comments
The BBC's Adam Mynott , in the region , says Ethiopia is carrying through its threat to hit Islamist positions in pursuit of what it claims is self - defence .
A spokesman for the UIC , Abdirahman Janaqow , told the Associated Press that the Islamists would stand firm against Ethiopia .
" We will overcome the Ethiopian troops in our land .
Our forces are alert and ready [ to ] defend our country , " he said at Mogadishu airport .
As Ethiopia struck , Somali and Ethiopian troops captured a checkpoint outside the flashpoint town of Beledweyne .
UIC forces then left the town , the scene of sustained fighting on Sunday .
" Many , many people - children and women - have evacuated last night , and they are in the bush , while others chose to stay in the town , " Abdullahi Warsame , Somalia programme manager for the aid charity Save the Children , told the BBC .
Mr Warsame was in Beledweyne as the town changed hands .
" Those who have hidden in some places in the bush ... they started to come back with donkey carts , and others who have gone very far towards the town of Bulo Burto - still they have not come back . "
There were also reports of heavy fighting at the central flashpoint of Burhakaba , close to the seat of Somalia 's transitional government in Baidoa .
Fresh fighting between Somali government forces and the UIC erupted last week .
' No meddling '
On Sunday Ethiopia admitted for the first time its troops were fighting in Somalia and began attacking the UIC across a 400 km ( 250 mile ) front line along the border .
PM Meles Zenawi said Ethiopia was forced to defend its sovereignty against " terrorists " and anti-Ethiopians .
Aid agencies have warned of the civilian cost of fighting
" We want to end this war urgently and we hope that Ethiopian people stand by the defence forces . "
The UIC , which has seized control of much of southern and central Somalia , says Ethiopian troops have been fighting alongside government forces for months .
The Islamist group - which controls most of the south , including the capital , Mogadishu - on Saturday appealed for foreign fighters to join its troops in a " holy war " against Ethiopia .
The UN estimates that at least 8,000 Ethiopian troops may be in the country , while rival Eritrea is said to have deployed some 2,000 troops in support of the Islamic group .

As I ’ve become more and more interested in the open source movement , I ’ve gradually replaced almost all of my closed source software with open source applications .
At first , I bought in because of the “ free your money ” aspect .
Open source software does n’t cost a penny – just go download it .
It ’s also reasonably safe , given that the source is open to the world and there are a lot of very intelligent people out there constantly improving it , particularly the more popular packages .
As a personal finance blogger , this aspect is a very powerful one , but it was only the first step .
Soon , I began to really appreciate the “ free your freedom ” concept .
I began to see the political and social ramifications of open source software : how it affects the marketplace and how the open source concept affects everything .
But after a while , the sheer creativity of some of these packages came through , packages I would have never found without the open source concept , and I began to understand the “ free yourself ” perspective .
You see , the power of it is n’t the fact that it does n’t cost me anything , or even the potential for social change that it has .
It ’s the fact that the really profound packages can transform your life .
There are a lot of bright people out there producing open source software , and they often hit upon niches that commercial packages would n’t hit upon – but they can sure fill a niche in your life !
Here are seven open source packages that have become a part of my daily life – and enabled me to find , record , store , and analyze my own thoughts and information about the world around me in ways I would have never dreamed possible even a few years ago .
These software pieces have literally transformed my life .
KeyNote
note taking / information organization
http://www.tranglos.com/free/keynote_main.html
Of all of the software I have ever tried in my life , this has been the most transformative .
In terms of enabling , extending , recording , and organizing my thoughts , I have never found anything as amazing as KeyNote .
Quite simply , KeyNote has made it possible for me to maintain this blog and to keep track of literally thousands of freeform ideas .
So what exactly is KeyNote ?
It ’s not one of the “ big ” open source packages , so an overview is in order .
KeyNote is a tool that lets you record a hierarchical series of notes in a single file .
The interface for doing this takes about two minutes to learn and about two hours to really understand ; once you “ get ” it , though , it can have a massive transformative effect on how you record your thoughts and information .
Here ’s an example : I have a “ default ” KeyNote file .
Within that file are a series of about twenty notes : To - Do , Finances , Readings , Writing Ideas , Diary , and so on .
Under each one of these is a series of sub-notes , much like an outline : details on specific tasks to be done , notes on the bills to be paid and investments to review , and so on .
It ’s all free - form text pieces , which enables me to write three words or a thousand words , whatever I want .
I also keep reviews of CDs , books , and films I enjoy , recipes I might try someday , and some general scratchpad sections for writing down things to think about later – and when I return to them , I update the note .
My wife is starting to use it for student assessment notes and class attendance records .
This stuff just scratches the surface of what ’s possible , but they ’re the tasks that I use KeyNote for on a daily basis .
WordPress
blog management software
http://www.wordpress.org/
Obviously , WordPress has made The Simple Dollar possible .
It provides the backbone for writing this site , managing all of the posts , and the public display that you see .
Writing this blog has had a transformative effect on my personal finances ( and on other aspects of my life ) , and for that I have WordPress to thank .
But if it were only that simple , I would n’t be mentioning WordPress here .
The extensibility and customizability of WordPress has enabled me to start several personally important projects with it that may or may not ever see the light of day to the public , but have enabled me to figure out and understand aspects of my own life that I did n’t understand before .
I use WordPress for a highly personal blog that resides ( effectively ) offline , a place where I can record my innermost thoughts and tag and categorize them .
For me , it ’s not so much a desire to journal but a desire to figure out who I am .
I used to use various diaries for this , but they never led me to greater understanding of myself ; however , WordPress ( and the capabilities you can add to it , such as customized fields ) has made it possible for me to start tying a lot of different threads of my psyche together .
Generally , I use Keynote to keep my interactions with the world straight , but I use WordPress to understand myself better , and I feel more happy , alive , and free than I have ever felt in my life .
FreeMind
mind mapping software
http://freemind.sourceforge.net/wiki/
Whenever I am in a meeting , you ’ll likely catch me doing one of two things : making a list ( i.e. , what KeyNote does well ) or writing a word and surrounding it with lots of other related words , then branching out from there .
This second activity is exactly what FreeMind does : it lets you map connections between concepts in a very simple fashion .
I ’ll use an example : let ’s say I ’m thinking about Milton Friedman .
Around him , I might write words like “ free market ” and “ economics . ”
I might then think a bit and connect “ eBay ” to “ free market , ” then start connecting stuff to eBay .
Where do I go from there ?
Who knows , but when I look at the diagram at the end , I ’ll see some interesting pairings at opposite ends , and by following the path connecting them , I ’ll make some very interesting connections that , if nothing else , cause my thoughts to flow in a different fashion .
FreeMind makes this mind mapping process incredibly easy .
Because of it , I ’ve grown the ability to do effective mind mapping in my head on the fly and thus I now rely on FreeMind mostly just for very complex maps .
In other words , regular use of FreeMind has literally changed the way I think and understand things – for the better , I believe .
I now am able to make connections between disparate things that before seemed to be completely unrelated ; in short , I understand the world better .
Mozilla Firefox
extensible web browsing
http://www.mozilla.com
There ’s not much about Firefox as a web browser that has n’t already been said ; it ’s pretty much the best one you ’ll find in wide release for one big reason : it ’s insanely extensible .
How so ?
Here are ten extensions to Firefox that I use on a daily basis to keep my crazy life straight ( including keeping up on the news , keeping track of my cell phone minutes , making phone calls , managing my grocery list , and so on ) :
Sage is an RSS feed reader that integrates into Firefox .
With one click , I get a listing of about 200 of my favorite blogs , along with the new postings for all of them .
It ’s completely changed the way I keep up with the blogosphere .

Cell Minute Trackers
I used to have to jump through a bunch of hoops to keep track of my wireless minutes .
Now there are extensions for Firefox that let me know immediately upon firing up my browser how much talk time I have left – keeping me from overextending myself in a very expensive way .
They ’re available for T - Mobile , Verizon , and Cingular , with rumors of more providers on the way .

GMail Space Firefox also acts as a backup tool for a lot of my creative writings by letting me use my GMail account as a file archiver .
I just click a few times and data is archived at GMail , which I can retrieve anytime .
I very rarely use a memory stick thanks to this .

del.icio.us Bookmarks
One thing that used to frustrate me is that when I would change computers , all of my bookmarks would vanish , so if I wanted to find my useful resources , I had to remember them .
Now Firefox integrates with del.icio.us , which allows you to have all of your bookmarks on any computer you want , even if it ’s not your own , and it ’s just as easy as adding bookmarks was before .
This is invaluable if you travel very much .

Answers I ’m fairly literate , but sometimes when I ’m reading a document , I hit a word or phrase that I do n’t understand .
If it ’s in Firefox , I just hit “ Alt ” and click on the word to get a complete definition and explanation , allowing me immediately to comprehend what ’s going on .

Grocery List Generator
I ’m a foodie , so when I find a great recipe or concept on the internet , I tend to want to pick up the ingredients and try it .
A click or two and I add it to my grocery list .
I also keep my laptop open when building my grocery list on Friday evenings .

All - In - One Gestures
The final piece is a tool that lets you use quick finger gestures to do common things like switch tabs and scroll down the page and such .
I have about four gestures I use over and over and over again that speeds up the surfing process greatly .
Mozilla Thunderbird
extensible email client
http://www.mozilla.com/thunderbird/
I used to be a Microsoft Outlook junkie for my personal needs , using it as an email client as well as a calendar for managing important events in my life .
When Thunderbird was released , I basically yawned – it did n’t do half of the stuff that Outlook did , even though I was a bit jealous of the great spam filtering that was integrated into Thunderbird .
I did n’t get on board , in fact , until I heard about a wonderful extension for Thunderbird called Lightning that turns a cool application into something completely amazing .
Lightning takes a strong email client and adds in a lightweight calendaring and to - do system that creates a suite on par with Outlook , except with strong spam filtering and fantastic email - to - task linkage .
Great , you think , he ’s all enthralled by an Outlook clone .
Where this gets transcendent is the integration with Google Calendar , allowing me to be sitting at a conference , fire up a web browser , add an event to my Google Calendar , and then have it automatically add itself to Thunderbird when I get home .
I can print off gorgeous calendars to post on the wall for my wife to let her know when I ’m on the road , and perhaps best of all , I use it as a GTD manager for many aspects of my life .
Thunderbird alone has saved me hours of hassle in dealing with an address book , a datebook , a to - do list , a personal planner , a task documentation manager , and a method of keeping my wife informed of what I ’m up to .
OpenOffice
word processing , spreadsheet , and presentation software
http://www.openoffice.org/
I used to get by with just the basic utilities that came with Windows for my long - form writing and calculations ( namely WordPad and Calculator ) .
I envied Microsoft Office users , but not only did the price tag keep me away , I did n’t really understand how great the productivity could be if you really understood the tools ; I used them in college in computer labs , but only to do immediate tasks .
Now I understand their power .
First of all , OpenOffice Writer has simply made it possible for me to write and manage lengthy documents .
I ’ve been working on a novel for a year now , and the internal controls offered by Writer have enabled me to keep track of the characters and the narrative flow with just a few clicks .
Even better , I can export the whole thing to PDF and ship it to others to read without breaking a sweat .
This program has enabled me to fit my dream of writing The Great American Novel into my busy life – and has made me a more content person .
OpenOffice Calc ( i.e. , an Excel replacement ) has singlehandedly made the personal financial transformations I ’ve described on this site possible .
I use it to handle my monthly budget , do investment calculations , model what my mortgage might look like , analyze what I might do for retirement , and so on .
Every time I model anything to understand how money works – usually to finish a post here at The Simple Dollar – I use Calc .
Software is no longer a limitation on people understanding their finances , and this is especially true for me .
Calc is literally making me money on a daily basis because it has enabled me to finally understand my own finances .
Although I do n’t use the other pieces of OpenOffice , these two elements alone have had a major effect on how I live my life .
Gaim
instant messaging software
http://gaim.sourceforge.net/
This is perhaps the most “ expected ” item that I would list here , as most people are familiar with the power of instant messaging software .
Gaim has literally made it possible for me to maintain old friendships , build new friendships , and provide the launching pad for some great life experiences .
It ’s basically platform agnostic , which means that I can simultaneously converse with my friend on Linux using Yahoo , another friend on a Mac using iChat , three other people in an IRC chat room , and yet another friend on Windows Messenger .
It seems so simple and commonplace , yet the human relationships I ’ve maintained or built because of Gaim ( as well as social networking sites ) are numerous , and that alone makes this software an essential part of my life .
[ Python - 3000 ] bug in modulus ?
[ Aahz ] >
Well , yes , but Uncle Timmy is jumping up and down and screaming for a > change .
That 's a pretty bizarre characterization , if I say so myself .
But since I 've already been accused , I may as well live up to it ;-) : >
Granted , I think we should show respect for our numerical > elders , but I think Michael also has a point about the importance of > making floats and ints behave the same , especially given that division > will auto - promote floats from ints .
Look at the example I was responding to : >>> - 1e -50 % 2.0 2.0
The instant " feel good " response is " oh , no real problem , make it return 0.0 instead " .
But that would break a different invariant ( and in fact a more fundamental one ) people legitimately expect from integers : a = ( a // b ) *b + a %b Because - 1e50 / 2.0 is very visibly less than 0.0 ( this is n't an endcase , or even special ) : >>> -1e-050 / 2.0 - 5e-051 the floor has to be - 1.0 : >>>
- 1e-050 // 2.0 - 1.0
Plug that into the identity above to get - 1e-050 = - 1.0 * 2.0 + a %b or a %b = 2.0 - 1e-050
Python does the best it can to meet that , returning the closest HW float to the infinite precision result of 2.0 - 1e - 50 .
0.0 is nowhere close to that .
So , believe it or not , we return 2.0 here because we 're trying our best to _meet_ expectations derived from the well - behaved unbounded - precision integer mod .
It 's not possible to meet _all_ expectations derived from integers simultaneously using HW floats with this defintion of % .
In this case , we violate the expectation that abs ( a % b ) < abs ( b ) .
If we returned 0.0 , we 'd violate the more fundamental identity above .
divmod gets bizarre with floats too ( divmod makes perfect sense for integers , but not for floats ) , like this on Windows : >>> divmod( 1e300 , 1e-300 ) ( 1. #INF , 4.891554850853602e-301 )
C does n't have these problems because it does n't define divmod at all , and defines ( well , C99 does ) % for both integers and floats in a way that makes most sense for floats .
In C99 , - 1e - 50 % 2.0 == - 1e - 50 exactly , and ( ( int ) ( a / b ) ) * b + a%b == a exactly in this case .
The " exactly " is n't a coincidence : using C's definition for floating % , the machine value returned for a%b is exactly equal to the result of computing a - ( ( int ) ( a / b ) ) * b to infinite precision .
At base , that 's why C's definition makes most sense for floats : it does n't lose information when applied to floats , and therefore also does n't introduce surprises _due_ to information loss .
Python 's integer - derived meaning for % is less accurate for floats , usually suffering rounding errors .
This is always harmful when it occurs , although it 's not usually so _obviously_ surprising as rounding the infinite - precision result of 2.0 - 1e - 50 to the machine value 2.0 .
So we end up with a floating % that makes little sense for floats used _as_ floats , and that can't meet all integer - derived expectations anyway .
What 's the point ?
" Think of the children ! " ?
They'd be better off with rationals than floats anyway , and there are no problems using the integer definition of % for rationals too .
I 'd be happiest if P3 K floats did n't support __mod__ or __divmod__ at all .
Floating mod is so rare it does n't need syntactic support , and the try - to - be - like - integer __mod__ and __divmod__ floats support now can deliver surprises to all users incautious enough to use them .
BTW , >>> decimal .Decimal ( " - 1e - 50 " ) % decimal .
Decimal ( " 2.0 " ) Decimal ( " - 1E - 50 " ) >>> any ( decimal.getcontext().flags.values ( ) )
False
The point of the last line is that the Rounding and Inexact flags are still clear : like C's , the decimal module 's notion of % is also an exact computation despite that it 's working with floats .
This is impossible for floats using the " a%b has the same sign as b " definition .
The point of the first line is that a sane meaning for floating % has already snuck into Python ;-)
These people have already shown that they will lie , cheat , steal , and threaten national security – even under oath .
They have repeatedly shown a horrific lack of judgment , morals , compassion for their fellow Americans and for other countries whose citizens have sacrificed lives and dollars for a cause that was falsely billed as " just and right " .
Whether it is justifying or authorizing torture , conspiring to leak classified information and destroying our ability to track proliferation of nuclear weapons , threatening and bullying others around the world , turning down offer after offer by Iran to negotiate ( and then lying about it as Condoleezza Rice did ) , bankrupting our economy , dumbing down our schools , willfully neglecting hundreds of thousands of people stranded in the Gulf Coast or using illegal and banned chemical weapons – it just keeps getting worse .
I refused to watch Bush ’s press conference from yesterday , but the snippets I read about and the comments from fellow kossacks made me even more concerned .
Yes , Bush is a dolt .
Yes , he is impatient .
Yes , he is a stubborn prick .
But he is now talking in circles – repeating points that do n’t make sense and barely constitute coherent sentences .
Yes , I know that is not new .
But when we have an ever increasing civil war which is getting bloodier by the minute in Iraq and the President is still in relative ( if not out - and - out ) denial about the situation , there is a big fucking problem .
When the same fake evidence is produced by the same liars that lied to us about Iraq and nobody has actually seen proof , there is a big fucking problem .
When the evidence - even if true is not even close to being worth pursuing military action , there is a big fucking problem .
When even the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the National Security Advisor do n’t think the evidence links Iran ’s government – there is a big fucking problem .
Our troops are stuck in a horrible situation which is only going to become miserable in a short time .
There is a lack of the proper armor .
There is no strategy other than " to win " , which is as big a disservice to the troops as the lies that sent them there in the first place .
This country ’s infrastructure is being ignored .
Roads , railways , power grids , power plants , airports are all being ignored as far as safety and upkeep goes .
Millions are without jobs .
Millions more are without healthcare .
Iran ’s people and their powerful are NOT happy with Ahmadinejad .
Bush knows this .
Cheney knows this .
Rice knows this .
Iran could be on the cusp of reform – as it was before Ahmadinejad took office .
But any military action will likely radicalize the masses and will ensure another generation – if not more – of hostility and another " Cold War " type situation .
At every turn , these so - called " leaders " of ours have led us to the brink of disaster – even over the line into " disaster territory " on more than one occasion .
A few things are true :
Iran is NOT an imminent threat to our national security .
Yet , even if they were , this administrations stunning lack of foresight ( even if their goal was to implement the PNAC plan , it would take more planning than they did ) has put us in a position where we can’t even deal with Iran .
The complete lack of credibility that America has as a result of lie after lie after lie has resulted in a situation where , even if there was evidence of Iran pointing nukes directly at the United States , nobody would believe it .
The trust and goodwill that the US had in the international community has been willfully squandered .
We have become a laughingstock to the world – the punch line of a bad joke .
This country is in a very precarious situation – in Iraq , from an economic and debt standpoint , its policies on the environment , on healthcare , on national security , on homeland security , education , jobs , housing and scores of other areas .
Pretty much all of this deterioration has occurred over the past six years .
Pretty much all of it was from the active policies of this administration .
A house of cards can only stand for so long .
This is the case for the Bush administration .
The Libby trial has shed a light on the depth and extent that these criminals would go to cover up their lies and intimidate those who dare criticize .
It also showed the depth of the evil that is Vice President Cheney .
More recently , Congressional hearings and testimony have shed a light on the stovepiping of bad intelligence to sell a war .
This same stovepiping - by the same people is happening right now .
Lies are being exposed .
Fingers are being pointed .
And we are watching the very high profile , very public meltdown of a United States President .
A so - called " Commander in Chief " who ca n’t even handle a few pointed and necessary questions from a compliant and deferential press corps .
We are watching our Vice President present as " absolute " statements that are long on innuendo , threats and manipulation but even shorter on truth and evidence .
We are watching a combative Secretary of State outright lie about negotiation proposals from Iran .
The same Secretary of State that nobody in the Middle East wants to talk to .
The administration has become the Land of the Broken Toys .
Except for the fact that we all felt sorry for those toys .
We should n’t feel sorry for these people .
They are willfully endangering our country and future every single day .
They are unfit for office .
They are unhinged , angry , delusional , out of the mainstream .
They are a threat to all of us and to the world at large .
They must be removed .
And this country deserves nothing less than a debate on their fitness for office , especially at this time in history .
Front paged at Booman Tribune and My Left Wing
If you ’ve spent any amount of time trying to “ improve yourself ” in any way , you ’ve undoubtedly experienced some frustration , in that you discover your “ self ” is n’t as much of a part of you as it would appear .
It seems bizarre – “ you ” want “ yourself ” to do something ( or refrain from it ) , but “ yourself ” goes ahead and does whatever it wants .
Often , “ you ” may rationalize your behavior in context , only to be later exasperated by your lack of “ willpower ” .
If that is the case , I have some good news for you .
It may sound a bit snake - oily at first , like I ’ve got a product to sell or something to gain from convincing you of the idea .
And I ’ve been tempted not to try to explain this here , because why should I explain something that could give me a tremendous advantage over people who do n’t understand it ?
On the other hand , since I ’ve come to understand the secret , I find that virtually every form of self - help ( that has any competence at all ) reflects at least some portion of this secret , and many of the teachings of Zen and other mystic traditions point to it as well .
So , in a sense it ’s not really a secret at all .
Everybody ’s been practically shouting it from the rooftops for centuries , and yet you ca n’t give this secret away .
This is mainly because whatever you say about it , people think they already understand it , and so never really dig down to the real truth of it , and the profound implications it has for every aspect of life and the human condition .
So , I probably could turn this idea into yet another school of self - help of my own variety , but I do n’t really see any reason to do that at the moment .
So here it is , a freebie – the ultimate answer , not to life , the universe , and everything , but the ultimate answer , I think , to the nature of the human condition : “ You ” are not “ yourself ” today .
For that matter , you were not yourself yesterday , and you will not be tomorrow .
You never have been , and never will be , because “ you ” and “ yourself ” are distinct neural subsystems which do not overlap .
What does that mean ?
Why should you care ?
And how is this a deep and mystical revelation , exactly ?
Who are you , anyway ?
Wave “ your ” hand at the screen .
Do it now .
Who waved your hand ?
Was it you ?
Could you have ?
Do “ you ” know how to wave your hand ?
Of course not .
“ You ” do n’t know how to do anything , but “ yourself ” does .
Now , if you are determined not to learn anything new , you will have already conveniently reclassified these ideas as being about conscious / unconscious mind , or left brain / right brain , and if you want to do that , by all means do so , but you wo n’t actually end up with any new knowledge that way .
In fact , that ’s precisely how I managed to read so very much about these subjects for so many years without actually ever understanding what this really means about life and living .
Abstract ideas like conscious and unconscious mind do n’t help you do anything differently than you already do .
But if I succeed in actually conveying the real experiential truth that lies beneath concepts like “ unconscious mind ” , then you can begin to change your life in the same way that I ’m already changing mine .
To really understand , you need to first understand that you are an animal .
Most of us humans pretend our entire lives that we are something other than animals , and as a result we think our “ animal nature ” is something you can just ignore or somehow transcend – preferably while ignoring it .
We enter the false dichotomy of “ man or beast ” , when the truth is actually “ man and beast . ”
We are not one – we are two .
And the one of us who thinks he ’s running things is really just a recent software upgrade that runs atop a highly sophisticated operating system that ’s already had millions of years of performance tuning – and can run just fine without you .
That ’s right .
“ You ” are just a subroutine , and a recently - added one at that .
You ’re like a user - mode driver that gets access to certain kernel data , but you only see and control what the kernel lets you .
You have no direct access to the kernel ’s process space , but you can make calls into it , and you get notifications from it .
The bulk of your nature as a human lies entirely outside your process space , outside your ability to directly perceive or control .
( If you find yourself thinking here about the famed “ 10 % of your brain ” , well , you ’re not wrong , but it ’s important to understand that the truth of this and lots of other ideas ( like conscious vs. unconscious mind ) is quite a bit deeper than the sound bites . )
Now , when I say you ’re just a subroutine and that your animal nature is the kernel , this does n’t mean that we are robots or machines or that we do n’t control our actions .
Far from it .
I mean , however , that we are deluded when we think we directly control our actions , and therefore ascribe intention to our actions that does n’t exist .
Why does anyone do anything ?
In fact , we frequently do things for reasons that are entirely opaque to us , and then make up reasons later to explain them , because nobody wants to admit that they do n’t know why they did something .
Nonetheless , none of us know , because it ’s not in our process space to know why the kernel switches in this process at this time , and that process at another time .
We can reverse engineer things , and we can use our “ supervisor calls ” to inject new programs into kernel space , sure , but we do n’t run in kernel space and we never will .
And yet , we all mostly go around pretending as if we did run things in our mind and body , which then leads to all sorts of screwed - up thinking – “ delusion and ignorance ” as the Zen Buddhists call it .
We mistake kernel notifications for our own thoughts .
We think our actions somehow reflect on us , when in fact they may reflect nothing more than a poorly - written script that the kernel is running .
This is like trying to eat pictures of food : it might fill you up , but it ’s ultimately unsatisfying .
The thing you need to understand is that it ’s not a question of “ using only 10 % of your brain ” .
The point is , you are only 10 % of your brain .
The rest of your brain is bigger , smarter , and better - educated than you , because it can learn things you do n’t even know you ’re learning , faster and better than you .
It can actually do things , for one .
You can ’t .
“ You ” are really just an I / O filter , in a way .
You can control everything because you are a software hook that controls what meaning things have .
By defining the meanings of things , you can get the kernel to do whatever you want .
However , if you are confused about any of this , you will feed the kernel garbage meanings , and , well , you will get garbage results .
For that matter , if you are confused about this state of affairs , you will try to “ do ” things yourself , and because you ’re only 10 % of the processor , you will only screw things up by getting in the kernel ’s way .
Do n’t do that , it does n’t work .
The hidden meaning of “ Just do it ” is , “ establish the kernel ’s operating parameters and then get the hell out of its way . ”
Shortly before I figured this out , I read about an interesting computer game called NERO .
The idea of this game is that you get a team of robots and you have to train them to fight , by designing training exercises in which you establish goals like maintaining a particular distance from the enemy , and lay out a battleground for the robots to learn in .
The interesting thing about this is that the robots basically evolve neural networks that seek to meet the goals you set , and they learn how to do this from experience , not by being programmed .
The neural nets that evolve have no self - consciousness , no awareness of how they accomplish the task .
Wiring just forms and improves .
It would be a mistake to look at the robots ’ behavior and conclude that there is intelligence or intention there ; it is just formation of neural nets in response to environmental stimuli coupled with goal - oriented feedback .
It ’s not “ you ” that learns …
And that is precisely what the other 90 % of our brains are up to .
Formation of neural logic networks in response to environmental stimuli and goal - based feedback .
If you are not actively participating in this process , what you get is well , whatever you get .
Pretty much , you ’re going to have random feedback loops , because whatever you initially train the networks on ( e.g. childhood ) is going to get used as the basis for evaluating later input and as the basis of your goals .
Your subconscious is like a random number generator whose output is fed back into its input , only there ’s goal seeking involved .
It ’s more like it ’s a random number generator that ’s striving to repeatedly reproduce whatever numbers it generated before .
At least , it works that way without your input .
Your subconscious needs you to establish meaning , and goals , and values , because without those things , all it knows how to do is maintain the status quo , or respond to what other people put into it .
If you ’re not doing your I/O interception duties , it ’s like the captain is asleep and the entire ship ’s crew fights to the death to carry out the captain ’s last orders , whatever they were , even if he was half - asleep ( or a child ) when he gave them and they no longer make any sense .
Conversely , if you over - manage yourself , then you ’re like the captain going around and trying to do everybody ’s job , and that just is n’t workable either .
After stopping and reading over what I ’ve written so far , I ’m a little frustrated , because I still seem to be slipping away from the heart of what I want to convey .
It ’s too easy to come away from what I ’ve said without realizing just how incredibly small “ you ” are , in relation to your own brain .
It ’s like that old system administrator joke , “ Go away , or I shall replace you with a very small shell script . ”
Only it ’s not a joke , and you are a very small shell script that thinks it ’s the data being piped through it .
Thoughts Are Data – And The Numbers Always Lie
You see , your thoughts are n’t you either .
They ’re just data being piped through “ you ” .
What you “ think ” about things is mostly just regurgitation of patterns captured by the kernel as part of its massive imitate - and - evolve subsystem .
This is not a bad thing , but a good one .
Have you ever realized how little control you have over your thoughts ?
Can you imagine how bad life would be if those were really your thoughts ?
Imagine a person listening to the radio .
Now imagine that this person has never seen a radio before , and thinks that the radio is talking to him or her directly .
That is , he or she thinks the announcer is talking to him , all the singers are singing to her , etc .
For example , when the radio plays the song “ You ’re So Vain ” , our imaginary person thinks the song really is about him !
This is almost as bad as the situation the rest of us are in , but not quite .
At least our imaginary listener thinks someone else is talking to him .
Most of us , on the other hand , think we are the announcer on the radio in our heads , and that we ’re announcing live , when in fact most of it is previously - recorded , and all of it is being piped to you straight from the kernel .
So , do n’t be frustrated by your thoughts , because they ’ re not “ you ” either .
Just because the kernel sends you a heap of worry , fear , anger , or other crap on sys.stdin does n’t mean you have to send it on to sys.stdout .
Until I understood that , I was under the mistaken impression that fear and worry , hurt and anxiety , disappointment and regret were all real things .
But they ’re not real !
They ’re just data .
Heck , they ’re not even data about real things .
They ’re data about previous conclusions drawn about similar things !
Sometimes , they ’re even data about erroneous conclusions previously drawn about similar things .
It ’s not enough to know ; you must also rewire !
Do n’t just understand this intellectually .
I ’ve “ understood ” all these things intellectually for many years and it was useless .
The question to ask is , “ How do I implement things with this knowledge ? ”
How do you drop input data on the floor ?
How do you insert new data into the output stream ?
How do I make supervisor calls to the kernel ?
How do I edit the scripts the kernel is running ?
Until I started asking these questions , I was n’t able to do much besides dance to the tunes on the radio in my head .
And do n’t get me wrong , after weeks of playing around with this stuff , I ’m still no superman or Zen master .
But I have managed a few very interesting hacks .
For example , a few weeks ago a certain situation led to me feeling very bad .
Intellectually , I totally knew there was no reason to feel bad , because what happened had nothing to do with me .
Emotionally , though , I was a wreck .
Suddenly , I had a flash of insight : these are two different neural networks .
The intellectual understanding and the emotional response were networks that evolved at different times in my life , under different circumstances .
They were therefore not connected , except through their mutual activation in the current circumstance .
Therefore , I experienced each network ’s output as a full and distinct input , but the “ emotional ” net had no way to receive data from the “ intellectual ” net , in order to moderate its output .
This led to an experience of conflict , in which I could try to suppress the output of the emotional net , given the data from the intellectual one , but this could n’t and would n’t stop the emotional input from coming in my input pipe .
As soon as I could see that , it was obvious what I needed to do : pipe the output from the “ intellectual ” net into the “ emotional ” net , instead of trying to integrate the data downstream in the “ consciousness ” process .
And literally , as soon as I imagined this , the two upstream networks integrated , and the need to feel bad went away .
I still felt bad physically , in my body , so I “ shook it out ” and it went away .
( It appears that shifts in glandular output and neurotransmitter states are used as a crude system - wide state machine to aid in sorting input and output , so even after you adjust an upstream source , you may retain some kinesthetic “ pollution ” downstream until you garbage collect it . )
Many Circuits , Loosely Joined
Now , before I go further , I want to explain that the “ emotional ” and “ intellectual ” networks I just mentioned were not my entire emotional or intellectual being .
That ’s precisely the sort of large - scale behavioral integration that our brains do not have by default .
I integrated two isolated “ understandings ” , each of which was a simple script to assign meaning to a certain class of events .
In programming terms , each of these nets could be considered a “ business rule ” ; just pattern recognizers that fired off to send “ me ” their analysis of the situation .
It ’s just that one of those rules fired off a “ knowing ” and the other fired off a “ feeling ” .
So , the fact that I did this one particular edit of my brain ’s rule system does not now mean that intellectual understanding is now integrated with all my emotional impulses .
During early life , we write a lot of scripts in our brains that are not abstracted or reused in any significant way .
Later scripts may abstract or absorb chunks of previous scripts , but they often do so in a downstream way ; that is , they take their input from older scripts and output commentary on them , but this commentary does n’t necessarily have any effect on our behavior or feelings , and therefore leads to the experience of inner conflict .
So , we inherit a lot of “ legacy ” code that desperately needs refactoring .
I ’m still experiencing these conflicts from time to time , and it ’s not always easy to integrate the processes .
Sometimes , an emotional network offers some kind of input or is linked to a goal that ’s important , so even piping the intellectual data into that network ’s input does n’t modulate its output much , and I have to do more extensive refactoring .
This can be a pain to try to do while the net is still running and making you feel bad !
It ’s even worse when the net uses bad feelings as an input indicating that you ’re in a bad situation ; once you get a loop like that started it ’s pretty tough to get out of without a reboot ( like going to sleep , or a surprise interruption that forces the whole process to swap out , as it were ) .
However , I ’m starting to get a kind of catalog of “ design patterns ” together to make the process a little easier , like establishing state machines to evaluate rules over longer time periods , rather than needing to immediately feel a certain way at the first evidence of a circumstance that potentially matches a pattern .
Command Mode
So how do you do this ?
How do you edit rules , pipe one net to another , make a supervisor call ?
In the same way you waved your hand at the screen , several paragraphs ago .
You imagine it , in command mode .
There are a lot of books out there about creative visualization and imagining what you want and all that , but there are very very few that even hint at the need for the command mode .
You see , imagination is like a scratchpad ; it ’s working memory .
If everything you did with that working memory were a command , you ’d say and do everything that came into your head .
The command mode is like a modifier that says “ actually do this ” , or “ make it so ” .
It ’s quite literally metadata that describes what to do with what you imagine .
Point your finger at the screen .
How did you do that ?
Do it again .
Try something else .
Make various motions with your body .
Now just think about making the motions .
What ’s the difference between thinking it , and doing it ?
That ’s command mode .
If you play with it for a bit , you ’ll discover that command mode is easiest to use with a destination .
It ’s likely that when you decide to point at the screen , you ’re visualizing the endpoint , where your finger is pointing at the screen , rather than visualizing all the motions in - between .
Similarly , when I integrated those two networks I spoke of , I just visualized them integrated , and I happened to engage command mode even though I did n’t really know what it was yet .
This is what I mean about not getting in your own way .
Your operating system has enormous parallel processing power , whereas “ you ” are a serial processing filter .
If “ you ” try to get involved in the “ how ” of things , you will just interfere , because you ’re a bottleneck on how much “ yourself ” can do !
Really , saying that your conscious mind is 10 % of your brain is probably grossly exaggerated , because we mistake a lot of the things the kernel does as being part of our consciousness .
5 % might be a better estimate .
But even that does n’t truly show just how bad it is to try to shove the entire system ’s I/O load through the consciousness filter .
Even if “ you ” had a whole 10 % of the brain to play with , that 10 % is set up for simultaneous use in serial processing of experience .
“ You ” just do n’t have the pipes and peripheral processors to handle that load , but the operating system does .
Those pipes and processors will never be directly accessible to you , for much the same reason that intellectual understanding of your behavior that comes after those behaviors is ingrained usually has no direct effect on the behavior .
The newer , more sophisticated abstractions are there to process outputs from the older , more “ primitive ” subsystems .
We can reason about our inputs , but our inputs are not driven by our reasoning .
Of course , within the scope of networks wired after we were born , we have a lot more flexibility .
Among those networks , we can rewire older nets to include input from newer ones .
But at the periphery of the brain , these networks are simpler , more hardwired , with less “ meta ” wiring capability .
This is n’t a problem as such , because the brain has plenty of “ meta ” wiring to go around , and you can do a lot up there that ca n’t be done directly .
However , that meta wiring is also part of an older layer than “ you ” , so you still ca n’t access it directly .
But you can access it via emulation mode , which is another variation on command mode .
In fact , I ’ve been finding that there are a lot of command mode variations .
I ’m rather reminded of a novel I once read , where a computer programmer traveled into a dimension where magic worked , and he ended up writing a magic compiler .
Unlike other magicians who worked out their spells in somewhat random fashion , he developed abstractions , a subroutine library , and an orthogonal command system .
For example , he would say things like “ backslash light enter ” to cast a light spell , where other magicians might chant some kind of short poem about light .
As a result , he became one of the most proficient wizards in the land , because his powers were extensible and composable in ways that other wizards ’ were not .
In the same way , most of us do n’t really know how to use our own brains in a systematic way .
We give them commands like we were a cat walking across a keyboard : every now and then we end up with something syntactically valid , but semantically … questionable .
So I ’m beginning to understand now why Bandler and Grinder speak so disparagingly of the conscious mind , and talk about the need to engage the unconscious mind when training people , meanwhile distracting their conscious minds so as to keep them out of the way .
I suppose that beats trying to actually get across to someone all the information that I just wrote in this article , and further get them to actually believe it , just in order to teach them something else .
WYFIWYG : What You Feel Is What You Get
And on that note , I ’m going to tell you one more secret - that ’s - not - secret before I go .
A lot of self - help books mention this , but I ’m going to try to explain how and why it ’s so important .
They usually tell you to suspend judgment , to just “ try the ideas ” without getting caught up in your ideas about whether the book ’s approach will or wo n’t work .
This is not , as it happens , because of some sort of faith - healing type thing , so that they have an excuse in case their stuff does n’t work .
( Well , maybe with some of them it is . )
The actual issue is that if you think you ’re the announcer on the radio in your head , you ’ll probably believe whatever it says as the gospel truth , and act on it , regardless of whether it has anything to do with your goals or what you ’re trying to accomplish .
The next thing you know , you ’re believing stuff like “ This wo n’t work , ” and you ’re suddenly adding metadata tags like “ does n’t work ” and “ do n’t believe his lies ” to the audio and video streams you pipe back to the kernel .
And the kernel , since it has no reason to doubt you , will then act according to the metadata you give it .
You see , the real secret about command mode is that there is no command mode .
It ’s really more like a tagging system , where the kernel acts according to the tags you put on stuff .
You can tag things as “ just pretending ” , or “ not important ” , or any number of other things , and the kernel does whatever you ’ve set it up to do for those tags .
That means you really do need to watch what you think , and learn how to browse your own thoughts at - 3 .
Otherwise , you can clog your kernel with an awful lot of crap .
There is so very much more to all this , more that I ’ve seen and discovered and experienced and want to tell you about , but many books have been written about it already , and there ’s no way for a single article to compete .
I ’m not going to promise to elaborate further in future posts , although I ’m sure I ’ll want to try from time to time as new insights or possibilities occur to me .
But I ’d certainly be interested to hear if any of you pull off any cool or interesting hacks using the information in this article .
There is an entire field of knowledge waiting to be discoveredout there … or should I say , in here ?

Poll : 63 % want all troops home by end of '08
WASHINGTON  Americans overwhelmingly support congressional action to cap the number of U.S. troops in Iraq and set a timetable to bring them home by the end of next year , a USA TODAY / Gallup Poll finds — tougher action than the non-binding resolution the House of Representatives is to begin debating today .
POLL RESULTS : Americans want troops home
While six in 10 oppose President Bush 's plan to use more troops to try to stabilize Iraq , a nearly equal number also oppose any effort to cut off funding for those additional forces .
" They 're saying the same thing they said in the 2006 elections — that they are against the current policy and they want something done about it , " says James Thurber , director of the Center for Congressional and Presidential Studies at American University .
" They want Congress to debate it ; they want Congress to focus on it ; they want to bring this war to a close , " says Mark Blumenthal , a former Democratic pollster who is now editor of Pollster.com .
" We do n't want to deny our armed services what they need to do their jobs , but we 'd like to bring them home . "
Republicans remain supportive of the war ; a majority of them oppose any congressional limits .
Still , even among those who back Bush 's troop increase , nearly a third endorse the timetable for pulling out .
The House is to begin three days of debate today on a resolution that vows to " support and protect " U.S. troops and then " disapproves of the decision of President George W. Bush … to deploy more than 20,000 additional United States combat troops to Iraq . "
A vote is likely Friday .
The USA TODAY poll , taken Friday through Sunday , finds most Americans paying close attention to the unfolding debate , the first on the war since Democrats won control of Congress in November .
Among the findings :
• There is majority support for congressional action on Iraq : 51 % back a non-binding resolution , 57 % a cap on troop levels and 63 % a timetable to withdraw all U.S. troops by the end of 2008 .
However , 58 % oppose denying funding for the additional troops .
• The Senate 's failure to act last week rankled nearly two - thirds of those surveyed .
By 51% - 19 % , they blamed Republicans .
In a party - line vote , Senate Republicans refused to cut off debate and let action proceed on a resolution opposing the troop increase .
• Seven of 10 say their representative 's vote on the war will affect their vote in the next congressional election ; more than four in 10 call it a major factor .
However , nearly two - thirds are n't sure where their representative stands on the issue .
• Neither side gets high approval ratings .
Just 30 % approve of the way congressional Democrats are handling Iraq ; 27 % approve of congressional Republicans .
Bush 's overall approval rating is 37 % , up 5 percentage points from early February .

Pointfree Style
It is very common for functional programmers to write functions as a composition of other functions , never mentioning the actual arguments they will be applied to .
For example , compare :
sum = foldr ( + ) 0
with :
sum ' xs = foldr ( + ) 0 xs
These functions perform the same operation , however , the former is more compact , and is considered cleaner .
This is closely related to function pipelines ( and to unix shell scripting ) : it is clearer to write let fn = f . g . h than to write let fn x = f ( g ( h x ) ) .
This style is particularly useful when deriving efficient programs by calculation and , in general , constitutes good discipline .
It helps the writer ( and reader ) think about composing functions ( high level ) , rather than shuffling data ( low level ) .
It is a common experience when rewriting expressions in pointfree style to derive more compact , clearer versions of the code -- explicit points often obscure the underlying algorithm .
Point - free map fusion :
foldr f e . map g == foldr ( f . g ) e
versus pointful map fusion :
foldr f e . map g == foldr f ' e where f ' a b = f ( g a ) b
Some more examples :
-- point - wise , and point - free member mem , mem ' :: Eq a => a -> [ a ] ->
Bool mem x lst = any ( == x ) lst mem ' = any . ( == )
But pointfree has more points !
A common misconception is that the ' points ' of pointfree style are the (. ) operator ( function composition , as an ASCII symbol ) , which uses the same identifier as the decimal point .
This is wrong .
The term originated in topology , a branch of mathematics which works with spaces composed of points , and functions between those spaces .
So a ' points - free ' definition of a function is one which does not explicitly mention the points ( values ) of the space on which the function acts .
In Haskell , our ' space ' is some type , and ' points ' are values .
In the declaration
f x = x + 1
we define the function f in terms of its action on an arbitrary point x .
Contrast this with the points - free version :
f = ( + 1 )
where there is no mention of the value on which the function is acting .
Background
To find out more about this style , search for Squiggol and the Bird - Meertens Formalism , a style of functional programming by calculation that was developed by Richard Bird , Lambert Meertens , and others at Oxford University .
Jeremy Gibbons has also written a number of papers about the topic , which are cited below .
Tool support
Thomas Yaeger has written a Lambdabot plugin to automatically convert a large subset of Haskell expressions to pointfree form .
This tool has made it easier to use the more abstract pointfree encodings ( as it saves some mental gymnastics on the part of the programmer ) .
You can experiment with this in the Haskell IRC channel .
A stand - alone command - line version is available at HackageDB ( package pointfree ) .
The @pl ( point - less ) plugin is rather infamous for using the ( -> ) a monad to obtain concise code .
It also makes use of Arrows .
It also sometimes produces ( amusing ) code blow ups with the (. ) operator .
Recently , @unpl has been written , which ( attempts ) to unscramble @pl - ified code .
It also has a stand - alone command - line version ( package pointful ) .
A transcript :
> pl \ x y -> x y id > unpl id ( \ a -> a ) > pl \ x y -> x + 1 const . ( 1 + ) > unpl const .
( 1 + ) ( \ e _ -> 1 + e ) > pl \ v1 v2 -> sum ( zipWith ( * ) v1 v2 ) ( sum . ) .
zipWith ( * ) > unpl ( sum . ) .
zipWith ( * ) ( \ d g -> sum ( zipWith ( * ) d g ) ) > pl \ x y z -> f ( g x y z ) ( ( f . ) . ) . g > unpl ( ( f . ) . ) . g ( \ e j m -> f ( g e j m ) ) > pl \ x y z -> f ( g x y ) z ( f . ) . g > unpl ( f . ) . g ( \ d i -> f ( g d i ) ) > pl \ x y z -> f z ( g x y ) ( flip f . ) . g > unpl ( flip f . ) . g ( \ i l c -> f c ( g i l ) ) > pl \ ( a , b ) -> ( b , a ) uncurry ( flip ( , ) ) > pl f a b = b a f = flip id > pl \ x -> x * x join ( * ) > pl \ a b -> a : b : [ ] ( . return ) . ( : ) > pl \ x -> x + x + x ( + ) =<< join ( + ) > pl \ a b ->
Nothing const ( const Nothing ) > pl \ ( a , b ) -> ( f a , g b ) f *** g > pl \ f g h x -> f x ` h ` g x flip . ( ap . ) . flip ( . ) > pl \ x y -> x . f . y ( . ( f . ) ) . ( . ) > pl \ f xs -> xs >>= return .
f fmap > pl \ h f g x -> f x ` h ` g x lift M2 > pl \ f a b c d -> f b c d a flip . ( ( flip . ( flip . ) ) . ) > pl \ a ( b , c ) -> a c b ( ` ap ` snd ) . ( . fst ) . flip > pl \ x y -> compare ( f x ) ( f y ) (( . f ) . compare . )
For many many more examples , google for the results of ' @pl ' in the #haskell logs .
( Or join #haskell on FreeNode and try it yourself ! )
It can , of course , get out of hand :
> pl \ ( a , b ) -> a : b : [ ] uncurry (( . return ) . ( : ) ) > pl \ a b c -> a * b + 2 + c (( + ) . ) . flip flip 2 . (( + ) . ) . ( * ) > pl \ f ( a , b ) -> ( f a , f b ) ( ` ap ` snd ) . ( . fst ) . ( flip =<< ( (( . ) . ( , ) ) . ) ) > pl \ f g ( a , b ) -> ( f a , g b ) flip flip snd . ( ap . ) . flip flip fst . (( . ) . ) . flip . ( (( . ) . ( , ) ) . ) > unpl flip flip snd . ( ap . ) . flip flip fst . (( . ) . ) . flip . ( (( . ) . ( , ) ) . ) ( \ aa f -> ( \ p w -> ( ( , ) ) ( aa ( fst p ) ) ( f w ) ) >>= \ ao -> snd >>= \ an -> return ( ao an ) )
Combinator discoveries
Some fun combinators have been found via @pl .
Here we list some of the best :
The owl
(( . ) $ ( . ) )
The owl has type ( a -> b -> c ) -> a -> ( a1 -> b ) ->
a 1 -> c , and in pointful style can be written as f a b c d = a b ( c d ) .
Example
> (( . ) $ ( . ) ) ( == ) 1 ( 1 + ) 0 True
Dot
dot = (( . ) . ( . ) ) dot :: ( b -> c ) -> ( a -> a 1 -> b ) -> a -> a 1 -> c
Example :
sequence ` dot ` replicate == ( sequence . ) . replicate == replicateM ( =<< ) == join ` dot ` fmap
Swing
-- Note : @pl had nothing to do with the invention of this combinator .
I constructed it by hand after noticing a common pattern .
-- Cale
swing :: ( (( a -> b ) -> b ) -> c -> d ) -> c -> a -> d swing = flip . ( . flip id ) swing f = flip ( f . runCont .
return ) swing f c a = f ( $ a ) c
Some examples of use :
swing map :: forall a b . [ a -> b ] -> a -> [ b ] swing any :: forall a . [ a -> Bool ] -> a ->
Bool swing foldr :: forall a b . b -> a -> [ a -> b -> b ] -> b swing zipWith :: forall a b c . [ a -> b -> c ] -> a -> [ b ] -> [ c ] swing find :: forall a . [ a -> Bool ] -> a ->
Maybe ( a -> Bool ) -- applies each of the predicates to the given value , returning the first predicate which succeeds , if any swing partition :: forall a . [ a -> Bool ] -> a -> ( [ a -> Bool ] , [ a -> Bool ] )
Squish
f >>= a . b . c =<< g
Example :
( read File y >>= ) . ( ( a . b ) . ) . c =<< read
File x
An actually useful example , numbering lines of a file .
Problems with pointfree
Point - free style can ( clearly ) lead to Obfuscation when used unwisely .
As higher - order functions are chained together , it can become harder to mentally infer the types of expressions .
The mental cues to an expression 's type ( explicit function arguments , and the number of arguments ) go missing .
Point - free style often times leads to code which is difficult to modify .
A function written in a pointfree style may have to be radically changed to make minor changes in functionality .
This is because the function becomes more complicated than a composition of lambdas and other functions , and compositions must be changed to application for a pointful function .
Perhaps these are why pointfree style is sometimes ( often ? ) referred to as pointless style .

Gurus and Typing
I 've been reading with interest the current scuffle between Bruce Tate and Bruce Eckel and earlier utterances about Java .
Having an amateur interest in programming languages and type theory , it 's amusing to watch something of a guru fall over on type issues .
* Strong typing refers to the absence of undefined behaviour due to type errors , as in all modern programming languages ;
* Weak typing refers to the presence of undefined behaviour due to type errors , like casting integers to pointers in C ;
* Dynamic typing refers to runtime checking of types ( using tagged values ) , as used in Ruby , Python , Scheme , and Erlang ;
* Static typing refers to compile - time checking of types , which can subsequently be erased , as featured in Haskell , OCaml , and partially Java and C# ( these latter two occasionally require dynamic tests ) ;
* Nominal typing refers to the discrimination of types by name , for example the non-equivalence of two interfaces with the same defined signatures , or the use of Haskell 's newtype ;
* Structural typing refers to discrimination of types by structure , and is also known as " duck typing " - there is a lot of type theory work done in this area with records , and OCaml can infer the minimal structure of objects passed into its functions ;
* Manifest or explicit typing refers to the requirement that types be declared , like the annoyances in Java and C# ;
* Latent or implicit typing refers to the freedom from having to state types , like the type - inference of Haskell and OCaml or the dynamics of Scheme , and most of the other dynamic languages .
What Eckel is lionising is strong , dynamic , structural , latent types , which is what Python gives him .
Funnily enough , that 's what Ruby gives him as well .
If they knew better , perhaps both Eckel and Tate would be asking for strong static inferred types .
A TRIP to the supermarket may not seem like an exercise in psychological warfare — but it is .
Shopkeepers know that filling a store with the aroma of freshly baked bread makes people feel hungry and persuades them to buy more food than they had intended .
Stocking the most expensive products at eye level makes them sell faster than cheaper but less visible competitors .
Now researchers are investigating how “ swarm intelligence ” ( that is , how ants , bees or any social animal , including humans , behave in a crowd ) can be used to influence what people buy .
At a recent conference on the simulation of adaptive behaviour in Rome , Zeeshan - ul - hassan Usmani , a computer scientist from the Florida Institute of Technology , described a new way to increase impulse buying using this phenomenon .
Supermarkets already encourage shoppers to buy things they did not realise they wanted : for instance , by placing everyday items such as milk and eggs at the back of the store , forcing shoppers to walk past other tempting goods to reach them .
Mr Usmani and Ronaldo Menezes , also of the Florida Institute of Technology , set out to enhance this tendency to buy more by playing on the herd instinct .
The idea is that , if a certain product is seen to be popular , shoppers are likely to choose it too .
The challenge is to keep customers informed about what others are buying .
Enter smart - cart technology .
In Mr Usmani 's supermarket every product has a radio frequency identification tag , a sort of barcode that uses radio waves to transmit information , and every trolley has a scanner that reads this information and relays it to a central computer .
As a customer walks past a shelf of goods , a screen on the shelf tells him how many people currently in the shop have chosen that particular product .
If the number is high , he is more likely to select it too .
Mr Usmani's “ swarm - moves ” model appeals to supermarkets because it increases sales without the need to give people discounts .
And it gives shoppers the satisfaction of knowing that they bought the “ right ” product — that is , the one everyone else bought .
The model has not yet been tested widely in the real world , mainly because radio frequency identification technology is new and has only been installed experimentally in some supermarkets .
But Mr Usmani says that both Wal - Mart in America and Tesco in Britain are interested in his work , and testing will get under way in the spring .
Another recent study on the power of social influence indicates that sales could , indeed , be boosted in this way .
Matthew Salganik of Columbia University in New York and his colleagues have described creating an artificial music market in which some 14,000 people downloaded previously unknown songs .
The researchers found that when people could see the songs ranked by how many times they had been downloaded , they followed the crowd .
When the songs were not ordered by rank , but the number of times they had been downloaded was displayed , the effect of social influence was still there but was less pronounced .
People thus follow the herd when it is easy for them to do so .
In Japan a chain of convenience shops called RanKing RanQueen has been ordering its products according to sales data from department stores and research companies .
The shops sell only the most popular items in each product category , and the rankings are updated weekly .
Icosystem , a company in Cambridge , Massachusetts , also aims to exploit knowledge of social networking to improve sales .
And the psychology that works in physical stores is just as potent on the internet .
Online retailers such as Amazon are adept at telling shoppers which products are popular with like - minded consumers .
Even in the privacy of your home , you can still be part of the swarm .

MY DAD AND HOW HE MADE ME LIE TO THE CLERGY
If he was still with us here in the land of the living , today would ’ve been my Dad ’s 78th Birthday .
This photo , taken at the party after Harley ’s baptism , perfectly sums up the dynamic of our relationship : we looked at stuff together in silence .
Whether it was a George Carlin album as it spun on a record player or CARLIN AT CARNEGIE as it took over the TV in the early days of HBO , the time my Father and I spent together was always about watching stuff .
And mostly , that stuff was movies .
The original Silent Bob himself , my Old Man always took me out of school at noon on Wednesdays to see a $ 1.50 matinee at the now long - gone Movies at Middletown ( “ … located on Highway 35 and Palmer Ave , ” as the answering machine message with the movie times would remind any caller ) .
In doing this , a Father was subtly teaching his butterball , silly - hearted youngest child that everything in life came secondary to a good movie – including my education and my God .
The first time the Old Man decided to pull me out of school early to see a flick , my Mom told me to tell the Sisters that I was missing Religion class because a Great Aunt had died and we were rushing to a last minute funeral – not that my Dad wanted to see RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK for cheap mid-week .
The movie rocked , of course – not just because it was Lucas and Spielberg at their best , but also because it was transgressive to be in the cinema at all when I was supposed to be learning about Christ .
And my Father was not only not punishing me for lying to a grown - up , he was complicit as well !
The next day , I tried to explain to my best friend Ernie O’Donnell two very controversial points I ’d learned while studying a mid-afternoon movie instead of the Bible : 1 ) My Dad was cool , and 2 ) Indiana Jones was like an American James Bond .
After we got away with movie matinee hooky , Pop decided that was gonna be our “ thing ” : every week , he ’d sign me out of school early and we ’d go to the movies .
I was the third of his three kids , disinterested in country music ( his passion ) and less interested in sports ( his pastime ) .
But I LOVED television .
I LOVED the movies .
And this was the common ground upon which my Dad and I would build the foundation of our relationship : watching entertainment together , generally in silence .
So the next week , me and the Old Man wanna see SUPERMAN II .
Again , my Mom instructs me to tell the Sisters the family is rushing to a funeral for a fallen great aunt .
The Principal , Sister Gloria Louise , seems to buy it .
I ’m a 10 year old Catholic boy in 1981 , so I must be telling the truth , right ?
My Old Man was a huge James Bond fan , so for a third consecutive week in a row , Dad wanted to yank his youngest out of class to see FOR YOUR EYES ONLY .
We did n’t really talk after the movies , but the old man always had plenty to express after a Bond flick – usually regarding Roger Moore being an okay 007 , but Sean Connery being his favorite .
And I ’d listen with great attention , like it mattered – because it was really something when the Old Man has something to say .
See , Dad did n’t really ever talk that much .
Not that he did n’t have anything on his mind : he was just self conscious as a motherfucker ( which he , in fact , literally was ) .
Dad had been born with a hair lip and a cleft palate , so his whole life , he tried to keep his mouth shut so as not to gross everybody out – even his kids .
Can you imagine ?
The Father of the guy who does 69 different podcasts a day was pretty tight - lipped .
It ’s likely the reason I talk so much : there must be some subconscious desire to say all the stuff my Dad was too trapped inside himself to express .
So it ’s my last week in Fifth Grade and Mom urges Dad to bring me to Bond on the upcoming weekend instead .
But the Old Man wo n’t have it : the weekends are too crowded at the multiplex , and the tickets cost nearly double .
Pop does n’t care if Thursday IS the last day of school : he ’s picking me up at noon on Wednesday to see this new Bond flick , and the only thing that ’s gonna stop him is a license to kill .
“ What do I tell Sister Gloria Louise ? ” I asked my Mom .
And rather than flip the script , my Mother stuck with a classic : “ Tell her my great Aunt died . ”
So I put on my Catholic school uniform of green slacks , sweater and tie with a white button - down shirt , walk up Miller Hill to Our Lady of Perpetual Help school , and head to the office to tell them my Dad is picking me up at lunch again .
The reason for the early dismissal ?
My Mom ’s Great
Aunt has passed away and we need to go be with the family .
Sister Gloria Louise says “ Seems like a lot of Great Aunts are dying in your family this month , Mr. Smith . ”
I say “ Yes , Sister .
God must be punishing them . ”
“ Yes .
God DOES punish .
Remember that , ” she said , heading away from the front desk to her office .
And just before she closed her office door , Sister Gloria Louise added “ Enjoy your movie … ”
Fires of Hell be damned , I took Sister Gloria ’s advice that day and enjoyed the shit out of FOR YOUR EYES ONLY with my Dad .
But to be fair , I enjoyed every movie I ever saw with my Father .
Some were good , some were n’t as good , but none of them were ever a waste of our time – time we spent together .
And as much as I ’d always been a movie brat , that month was where my lifelong love affair with cinema began in earnest .
Movies were so revered in my family , I was encouraged to lie ( a sin ! ) to my teachers so I could circumvent the system and play hooky at the picture show .
With an adult who was supposed to have known better , no less .
Turns out he DID know better .
When I grew up , I made movies for a living .
Some were good , some were n’t , but none of them were ever a waste of my time .
Because each one is a mini-monument to the man who made me .
JERSEY GIRL was the last of my flicks he got to see , and while some may snark that ’s what probably killed him , I know better : I was there when he watched the flick the first time .
I saw him cry – and it was n’t because he was thinking “ My kid just ruined his career … ”
The man of few words told me EXACTLY what was on his mind after the movie ended .
“ That was good , ” said the man who ’d introduced me to the very things that would consume the remainder of my days .
“ And George Carlin was great . ”
Thanks , Dad . I miss you .
I hope you had the time of your life .
December 7th 2008 : Nothing .
There is nothing new .
All of this will be moved to Cardhouse at some indeterminate point for archiving , and this domain will be sold to a tiny mouse who skitters on the keys and makes random html files .
It 's like an art project .
There were two different people interested in taking over control of Phoneswarm but then they got scared and ran away or something .
I thought about it for awhile then I thought about it some more and maybe something will happen in a few months that will be perhaps even more interesting on this very site but I 'm not promising anything at this point .
November 27th 2006 : New owner .
That 's right , someone else has stepped up to the plate and wants to continue the Phoneswarm Experience .
It 's going to take a little while to make the hand - off , so please be patient .
Again , thanks for all the love and letters and such .
It was a nice thing to do .
Cardhouse Ro-bot .
November 16th 2006 : The line is dead .
It ends here .
I have other fish to fry .
I can't serve up a new phone every week , what with every 20 phone numbers I 've grabbed ending up with a 19:1 mortality rate .
If you think you can do it , you 're welcome to try , I 'll point to your site from here and everything .
Thanks for the ride , all y'all made it worth the while .

Tuesday , October 31st , 2006 .
Called at 11:17 AM PST .
Neither of the guys in the yellow coats bothered to pick up .
Perhaps a launch / land schedule of Vessel " Golden Bear " would make for some good calls ?
I am smacking my forehead , this is something that should have been obvious .
Blue &
Gold no longer goes to Alcatraz Island , but I think they still dock in the same place ( Pier 39 ) for bay cruises .
It probably takes 15 minutes to load / unload , since they also take photos of everyone -- so maybe subtract 20 minutes from each posted time to achieve optimum pickupability .
Weekdays ( depart Pier 39 ) : 10:45 am , 12:00 pm , 1:15 pm , 2:30 pm , 4:00 pm .
Weekends ( depart Pier 39 ) : 10:00 am , 10:45 am , 11:30 am , 12:00 pm , 12:45 pm , 1:15 pm , 2:00 pm , 2:30 pm , 3:15 pm , 4:00 pm , 4:30 pm .

For God 's sake , please give it up .
Fear it no less than the sensual passion , because it , too , may take up all your time and deprive you of your health , peace of mind and happiness in life .
 Wolfgang Bolyai urging his son J ános Bolyai to give up work on hyperbolic geometry .
In June of 1997 , Daina was in a workshop watching the leader of the workshop , David , helping the participants study ideas of hyperbolic geometry using a paper and tape surface in much the same way that one can study ideas of spherical geometry by using the surface of a physical ball .
David 's hyperbolic plane was then so tattered and fragile that he was afraid to handle it much .
Daina immediately began to think : " There must be some way to make a durable model . "
David made his first paper hyperbolic plane in the summer of 1978 while on canoe trip on the lakes of Maine using the scissors on his Swiss Army knife .
He had just learned how to do the construction from William Thurston at a workshop at Bates College .
This crude paper surface was used in the David 's geometry classes and workshops ( becoming more and more tattered ) until 1986 when some high school teachers in a summer program that David was leading collaborated on a new larger paper and tape hyperbolic surface .
This second paper and tape hyperbolic surface ( used in classes and workshops for the next 11 years ) was the one that Daina witnessed in use .
Daina experimented with knitting ( but the result was not rigid enough ) and then settled on crocheting .
She perfected her technique during the workshop and crocheted her first small hyperbolic plane and then while camping in the forests of Pennsylvania , she crocheted more and we started exploring its uses .
In this paper we will share how to crochet a hyperbolic plane ( and make related paper versions ) .
We will share how we have used it to increase our own understanding of hyperbolic geometry .
( Where does the formula p r2 fit in hyperbolic geometry ? )
We will finish by proving that , in fact , it is an isometric model of the hyperbolic plane .
But , Wait ! you say .
Do not many books state that it is impossible to isometrically embed the hyperbolic plane as a closed subset of the Euclidean 3 - space ?
Yes , this is true :
For a popularly written examples , see Robert Osserman 's Poetry of the Universe [ 8 ] , page 158 , and David Hilbert and S. Cohn - Vossen's , Geometry and the Imagination [ 5 ] , page 243 .
For a detailed discussion and proof , see Spivak 's A Comprehensive Introduction to Differential Geometry [ 9 ] , Vol. III , pages 373 and 381 .
All of the references are implicitly assuming surfaces embedded with some conditions of differentiability and refer ( implicitly or explicity ) to a 1901 theorem by David Hilbert .
Hilbert proved [ 4 ] that there is no real analytic isometry , but his arguments work in class C4 .
Moreover , in 1955 , N. Kuiper showed [ 6 ] that there is a C1 isometric embedding onto a closed subset of 3 - space , and in 1972 Tilla Milnor proved [ 7 ] that a C2 isometric embedding was not possible .
For a more discussion of these ideas see Thurston [ 10 ] , pp51 - 52 .
We will show that the surfaces described here can be extended indefinitely and that the intrinsic geometry of these surfaces is hyperbolic geometry ; and , they appear to not be C1 embedded .
Constructions of Hyperbolic Planes
We will describe three different isometric constructions of the hyperbolic plane ( or approximations to the hyperbolic plane ) as surfaces in 3 - space .
Then we will connect them with the standard upper half plane model which is a ( non-isometric ) model of the hyperbolic plane .
1. The Hyperbolic Plane From Paper Annuli
This is the paper and tape surface that David learned from William Thruston .
It may be constructed as follows :
Cut out many identical annular strips as in the following Figure 1 .
Attach the strips together by attaching the inner circle of one to the outer circle of the other or the straight ends together .
The resulting surface is of course only an approximation of the desired surface .
The actual hyperbolic plane is obtained by letting d ® 0 while holding r fixed .
Note that since the surface is constructed the same everywhere ( as d ® 0 ) , it is homogeneous ( i.e. intrinsically and geometrically , every point has a neighborhood that is isometric to a neighborhood of any other point ) .
We will call the results of this construction the annular hyperbolic plane .
You may want to try this by cutting out a few identical annular strips and taping them together as in Figure 1 .
Figure 1 . Annular strips for making an annular hyperbolic plane .
2. How to Crochet the Hyperbolic Plane
If you tried to make your annular hyperbolic plane from paper annuli you certainly realized that it takes a lot of time .
Also , later you will have to play with it carefully because it is fragile and tears and creases easily -- you may want just to have it sitting on your desk .
But there is another way to get a sturdy model of the hyperbolic plane which you can work and play with as much as you wish .
This is the crocheted hyperbolic plane .
In order to make the crocheted hyperbolic plane you need just a very basic crocheting skills .
All you need to know is how to make a chain ( to start ) and how to single crochet .
That 's it !
Now you can start .
See Figure 2 for a picture of these stitches , which will be described further in the next paragraph .
Figure 2 . Crochet stitches for the hyperbolic plane .
First you should chose a yarn which will not stretch a lot .
Every yarn will stretch a little but you need one which will keep its shape .
Now you are ready to start the stitches :
Make your beginning chain stitches ( Figure 2a ) .
( Topologists may recognize that as the stitches in the Fox - Artin wild arc ! )
About 20 chain stitches for the beginning will be enough .
For the first stitch in each row insert the hook into the 2nd chain from the hook .
Take yarn over and pull through chain , leaving 2 loops on hook .
Take yarn over and pull through both loops .
One single crochet stitch has been completed .
( Figure 2b . )
For the next N stitches proceed exactly like the first stitch except insert the hook into the next chain ( instead of the 2nd ) .
For the ( N+1 ) st stitch proceed as before except insert the hook into the same loop as the N - th stitch .
Repeat Steps 3 and 4 until you reach the end of the row .
At the end of the row before going to the next row do one extra chain stitch .
When you have the model as big as you want , you can stop by just pulling the yarn through the last loop .

Crocheting will take some time but later you can work with this model without worrying about destroying it .
The completed product is pictured in Figure 3 .
Figure 3 . A crocheted annular hyperbolic plane .
3. Polyhedral Constructions .
A polyhedral model can be constructed from equilateral triangles by putting 7 triangles at every vertex .
This is called the { 3,7} polyhedral model , because triangles ( 3 - gons ) are put together 7 at a vertex .
This model has the advantage of being constructable more easily than the models above ; however , one can not make better and better approximations by decreasing the size of the triangles .
This is true because at each vertex the cone angle is 420 ° no matter what the size of the triangles are ; whereas the hyperbolic plane in the small looks like the Euclidean plane .
Another disadvantage of the polyhedral model is that it is not easy to describe coordinates on it .
We can avoid some of the problems of the { 3,7} model by putting 7 triangles together only at every other vertex and 6 triangles together at the others .
The precise construction can be described in three different ( but , in the end , equivalent ) ways :
1. Construct polyhedral annuli as in Figure 4 and then tape them together as with the annular hyperbolic plane .
Figure 4 . Polyhedral annulus .
2 . You can construct two annuli at a time by using the shape in Figure 5 and taping one of them to the next by joining : a ® A , b ® B , c ® C .
.
Figure 5 . Shape to make two annuli .
3 . The quickest way is to start with many strips as pictured in Figure 6a  these strips can be as long as you wish .
Then add four of the strips together as in Figure 6 b using 5 additional triangles .
Next , add another strip every place there is a vertex with 5 triangles and a gap ( as at the marked vertices in Figure 6 b ) .
Every time a strip is added an additional vertex with 7 triangles is formed .
Figure 6 a .
Strips .
Figure 6 b .
Forming the polyhedral annular hyperbolic plane .
The center of each strip runs perpendicular to each annulus , and you can show that these curves ( the center lines of the strip ) are each geodesics because they have local reflection symmetry .
Hyperbolic Planes of Different Radii ( Curvature )
Note that the construction of a hyperbolic plane is dependent on the r ( the radius of the annuli ) which can be called the radius of the hyperbolic plane .
As in the case of spheres , we get different hyperbolic planes depending on the value of r.
In Figures 7a , b , c there are crocheted hyperbolic planes with radii approximately 4 cm , 8 cm , and 16 cm. the pictures were all taken from approximately the same perspective and in each picture there is a centimeter rule in order to indicate the scale .
Figure 7a .
Hyperbolic plane with r = ~ 4 cm .
Figure 7b .
Hyperbolic plane with r = ~8 cm .
Figure 7 c .
Hyperbolic plane with r = ~ 16 cm .
Note that as r increases the hyperbolic plane becomes flatter and flatter ( has less and less curvature ) .
For both the sphere and the hyperbolic plane as r goes to infinity they both become indistinguishable from the ordinary flat ( Euclidean ) plane .
We will show below that the Gaussian Curvature of the hyperbolic plane is - 1 /r2 .
So it makes sense to call this r the radius of the hyperbolic plane in agreement with spheres where a sphere of radius r has Gaussian curvature 1/r2 .
Intrinsic Geodesic Coordinates
Let r be the fixed inner radius of the annuli and let H d be the approximation of the annular hyperbolic plane constructed , as above , from annuli of radius r and thickness d .
On H d pick the inner curve of any annulus and calling it the base curve , pick a positive direction on this curve , and pick any point on this curve and call it the origin O .
We can now construct an ( intrinsic ) coordinate system x d : R2 ® H d by defining x d ( 0,0 ) = O , x d ( w,0 ) to be the point on the base curve at a distance w from O , and x d ( w , s ) to be the point at a distance s from x d ( w,0 ) along the radial ( along the radii of each annulus ) curve through x d ( w,0 ) , where the positive direction is chosen to be in the direction from outer - to inner-curve of each annulus .
See Figure 8 .
The reader can easily check that this coordinate map is one - to - one and onto .
Figure 8 . Geodesic rectangular coordinates on annular hyperbolic plane .
Note that each coordinate map x d induces a metric , d d , on R2 by defining d d ( p , q ) to be the ( intrinsic ) distance between x d ( p ) and x d ( q ) in H d .
Those readers who desire a more formal description of the limit can check that , in the limit as d® 0 , the metrics d d converge to a metric d on R2 and thus defines the annular hyperbolic plane as a metric space .
In fact , this process also defines a Riemannian metric but this will be easier to see after we show the connections with the upper half plane model .
What Can We Determine About Hyperbolic Geodesics ?
The following facts were observed by our students during one class period in which they explored for the first time the crocheted hyperbolic plane in small groups .
The radial curves are geodesics .
The radial curves ( curves that run radially across each annulus ) have intrinsic reflection symmetry in each H d because of the symmetry in each annulus and the fact that the radial curves intersect the bounding curves at right angles .
These reflection symmetries carry over in the limit to the annular hyperbolic plane .
Such bilateral symmetry is the basis of our intuitive notion of straightness ( see Chapter 1 of [ 2 ] and [ 3 ] for more details ) and thus we can conclude that these radial curves are geodesics ( intrinsically straight curves ) on the annular hyperbolic plane .
The radial geodesics are asymptotic .
Looking at our hyperbolic surfaces we see the radial geodesics getting closer and closer in one direction and diverging in the other direction .
In fact , let l and m be two of the radial geodesics in H d .
The distance between these radial geodesics changes by r/(r + d ) every time they cross one annulus .
( Remember the annuli all have the same radii .
If we cross n strips , then the distance in H d between l and m at a distance c = n d from the base curve is :
.
Now take the limit as d ® 0 to show that the distance between l and m on the annular hyperbolic plane is :
. (*)
Asymptotic geodesics never happen on a Euclidean plane or on a sphere .
Other geodesics can be found in approximate intuitive ways .
Hold two points of the hyperbolic surface between the index finger and thumb on your two hands .
Now pull gently  a geodesic segment ( with its reflection symmetry should appear between the two points .
This is using the property that a geodesics is locally the shortest path .
Fold the surface to a crease with bilateral symmetry .
You can lay a ( straight ) ribbon on the surface and it will follow a geodesic .
This Ribbon Test for geodesics on surfaces is discussed further ( with proofs ) in [ 2 ] , Problems 3.4 and 7.6 .
for geodesics on surfaces is discussed further ( with proofs ) in [ 2 ] , Problems 3.4 and 7.6 .
The following properties of geodesics can be experienced .
This properties are rigorously confirmed later by using the upper half plane model .
This properties are rigorously confirmed later by using the upper half plane model .
Every pair of points is joined by a unique geodesic .
Two geodesics intersect no more than once .
Every geodesic segment has a geodesic perpendicular bisector .
Every angle ( between two geodesics ) has a geodesic angle bisector .
( )
Each non-radial geodesic appears to be tangent to one annulus and then as you travel in both directions from that point the geodesics approaches being perpendicular to the annuli .
Connection to the Upper - Half Plane Model
As shown above , the coordinate chart x preserves ( does not distort ) distances along the ( vertical ) 2nd coordinate curves but at x ( a , b ) the distances along the 1st coordinate curve are distorted by the factor of exp ( - b/r ) when compared to the distances in R2 .
To be more precise :
Definition : Let y : A ® B be a map from one metric space to another , and let be a curve in A .
Then , the distortion of y along l at the point p = l ( 0 ) is defined as :
.
We seek a change of coordinates which will distort distances equally in both directions .
The reason for seeking this change is that if distances are distorted the same in both coordinate directions then the chart will preserves angles .
( We call such a chart conformal . )
We can not hope to have no distortion in both coordinate directions ( if there were no distortion then the chart would be an isometry ) ; so we try to make the distortion in the 2nd coordinate direction the same as the distortion in the 1st coordinate direction .
After a little experimentation we find that the desired change is
z ( x , y ) = x ( x , r ln(y / r ) ) ,
with the domain of z being the upper half plane
R2 + º { ( x , y ) Î R 2 | y > 0 } ,
where x is the geodesic rectangular coordinates defined above .
This is the usual upper half plane model of the hyperbolic plane thought of as a map of the hyperbolic plane in the same way that we use planar maps of the spherical surface of the earth .
Lemma .
The distortion of z along both coordinate curves
x ® z( x , b ) and y ® z ( a , y )
at the point z ( a , b ) is r/b .
Proof .
We now focus on the point z ( a , b ) = x ( a , r ln( b / r ) ) .
Along the first coordinate curve , x ® z ( x , b ) = x ( x , r ln( b / r ) ) , the arc length from x ( a , c ) to x ( x , c ) is |x - a| exp ( - c /r ) by ( * ) above .
Thus , we can calculate the distortion :
.
Now , look at the second coordinate curve , y ® z ( a , y ) = x ( a , r ln(y / r ) ) .
Along this coordinate curve ( a radial geodesic ) the speed is not constant ; but , since the second coordinate of x measures arc length , the arc length from z ( a , y ) = x ( a , r ln(y / r ) ) to z( a , b ) = x ( a , r ln( b / r ) ) is
| r ln(y / r ) ) - r ln ( b/r ) ) |
and the distortion is
.
In the above situation we call these distortions , the distortion of the map z at the point p and denote it dist ( z ) ( p ) .
Thus ,
dist (z ) ( ( a , b ) ) = r/b. (**)
Connection to the Pseudosphere
Take the annulus whose inner edge is the base curve and embed it isometrically in the x-y plane as a complete annulus with center at the origin .
Now attach to this annulus portions of the other annuli as indicated in Figure 9 .
Note that the second and subsequent annuli form truncated cones .
Figure 9 . Hyperbolic surface of revolution .
Let the vertical axis be the z - axis and then at each z we have the following picture in Figure 10 .
Figure 10 .
Relating R( z ) , r , D z , and D R .
Thus
.
In the limit as d ( and D R and D z ) go to zero we get
.
We can get the same differential equation by using ( * ) above which implies that the circle at height z has circumference 2 p re - s/r , where s is the arc length along the surface from ( 0 ,r ) to ( z , R( z ) ) .
We can solve this differential equation explicitly for z and obtain the solution :
.
Here z is a continuously differentiable function of R and the derivative ( for z ¹ 0 ) is never zero , hence R is also a continuously differentiable function of z .
Since R is never zero , we can conclude that this hyperbolic surface of revolution is a smooth surface ( traditionally called the pseudosphere ) .
Thus ,
Theorem 1 .
The pseudosphere is locally isometric to the annular hyperbolic plane .
Hyperbolic Isometries and Geodesics
We have seen that there are reflections in the annular hyperbolic plane about the radial geodesics , but we saw the existence other reflections and geodesics only approximately .
However , we were able to see that non-radial geodesics appear to be tangent to one annulus and then in both directions from that point to approach being perpendicular to the annuli .
To assist us in looking at transformations of the annular hyperbolic space we use the upper half plane model .
Since the annuli corresponds to horizontal lines in the upper half plane model , geodesics should then be curves which start and end perpendicular to the boundary x-axis .
Semicircles with centers on the x-axis are such curves , and we can show directly that they are geodesics with bilateral symmetry .
In particular , we can show that directly that inversion in a semicircle corresponds to a reflection isometry in the annular hyperbolic plane .
Definition :
An inversion with respect to a circle G is a transformation from the extended plane ( the plane with ¥ , the point at infinity , added ) to itself that takes C , the center of the circle , to ¥ and vice versa and that takes a point at a distance s from the center to the point on the same ray ( from the center ) that is at a distance of r2 /s from the center , where r is the radius of the circle .
See Figure 11 .
We call ( P , P ¢ ) an inversive pair because ( as the reader can check ) they are taken to each other by the inversion .
The circle G is called the circle of inversion .
Figure 11 .
Inversion with respect to a circle .
Inversions have the following well - known properties ( See [ 1 ] , Chapter 5 , and [ 2 ] , Chapter 4 ) :
Inversions are conformal .
Inversions take circles not passes through the center of inversion to circles .
Inversions take circles passing through the center of inversion to straight lines not through the center of inversion .
If f is a transformation taking the upper half plane R2 + to itself then consider the diagram
We call the transformation of H2 that corresponds to f .
We will call f an isometry of the upper half plane model if the corresponding g is an isometry of the annular hyperbolic plane .
Theorem 2 .
Let f be the inversion in a circle whose center is on the x-axis .
Then the cooresponding has distortion 1 at every point and is thus an isometry .
Figure 12 .
Hyperbolic reflections correspond to inversions .
Proof . ( Refer to Figure 12 . )
1 . Note that each of the maps z , z - 1 , f are conformal and have at each point a ( non-zero ) distortion that is the same for all curves at that point .
Using the definition of distortion , the reader can easily check that
dist ( g ) ( p ) = .
2. If z( a , b ) = p , then ( using ( * ) )
dist ( z - 1 ) ( p ) b/r .
3 . Let R be the radius of the circle C which defines f and let s be the distance from the center of C to ( a , b ) = z - 1 ( p ) .
Since the inversion is conformal , the distortion is the same in all directions .
Thus , we need only check the distortion along the ray from C , the center of circle , through P .
Then the reader can check that this distortion
dist ( f ) ( ( a , b ) ) = R2/s2 .
One way to do this is to note that in this case the distortion is the speed ( at s ) of the curve .
4. By ( * ) , dist ( z ) ( f( z - 1 ( p ) ) = r/c , where c is the y - coordinate of f( z - 1 ( p ) ) = f( a , b ) .
To determine c , look at Figure 12 .
By similar triangles , s/b = ( R2/s ) / c. Thus c = b ( R2/s2 ) and
.
5 . Putting everything together , we now have :
.
Since this is true at all points p , the map g must be an isometry of the annular hyperbolic plane .
We call these inversions through semicircles with center on the x-axis ( or the corresponding transformations in the annular hyperbolic plane ) hyperbolic reflections .
Thus the images of the semicircles in the upper half plane have bilateral symmetry and thus are intrinsically straight ( geodesics ) .
Thus , we have established that the annular hyperbolic plane is the same as the usual upper half plane model of the hyperbolic plane .
The usual analysis of the hyperbolic plane can now be considered as analysis of the intrinsic geometry of the annular hyperbolic plane .
We give only one example here because it results in the interesting formula p r2 .
Area of Hyperbolic Triangles
Given a geodesic triangle with interior angles b i and exterior angles a i , we extend the sides of the triangle as indicated in Figure 13 .

The three extra lines are geodesics which are asymptotic at both ends to an extended side of the triangle .
It is traditional to call the region enclosed by these three extra geodesics an ideal triangle .
In the annular hyperbolic plane these are not actually triangles since their vertices are at infinity .
In Figure 13 we see that the ideal triangle is divided into the original triangle and three " triangles " which have two of their vertices at infinity .
We call a " triangle " with two vertices at infinity a 2/3 - ideal triangle .
You can use this decomposition to determine the area of the hyperbolic triangle .
First we must determine the areas of ideal and 2/3 - ideal triangles .
It is impossible to picture the whole of an ideal triangle in an annular hyperbolic plane , but it is easy to picture ideal triangles in the upper half plane model .
In the upper half plane model an ideal triangle is a triangle with all three vertices either on the x -axis or at infinity .
See Figure 14 .
At first glance it appears that there must be many different ideal triangles ; however :
Theorem 3 .
All ideal triangles on the same hyperbolic plane are congruent .
Proof Outline : Perform an inversion ( hyperbolic reflection ) that takes one the vertices ( on the x - axis ) to infinity and thus takes the two sides from that vertex to vertical lines .
Then apply a similarity to the upper half plane taking this to the standard ideal triangle with vertices ( - 1,0 ) , ( 0,1 ) , and ¥ .
See Figure 14 .
Figure 14 .
Ideal triangles in the upper half plane model .
We now picture in Figure 15 2/3 - ideal triangles in the upper half plane model .
Figure 15 .
2/3 - ideal triangles in the upper half plane model .
Theorem 4 .
The area of an ideal triangle is p r2 .
( Remember this r is the radius of the annuli . )
Proof : By ( * ) , the distortion dist ( z ) ( a , b ) is r/b , and thus the desired area is
.
Theorem 5 . All 2/3 - ideal triangles with angle q are congruent and have area ( p - q ) r2 .
Show , using inversions that all 2/3 - ideal triangles with angle q are congruent to the standard one at the right of Figure 15 and thus the area is the double integral :
.
Combining these three theorems and Figure 13 we get :
Theorem 6 .
The area of a hyperbolic triangle is
( p - Sa i ) r2 .

An old lead coin looks like it was plated with silver .
Real or fake ?
Fraudulent coins can be hard to tell from the real thing .

An ingenious counterfeit - coin scam has been rumbled by scientists in Italy .
But no one is going to jail , because the forgers lived more than 2,000 years ago .
Giuseppe Giovannelli of the University of Rome ' La Sapienza ' and his colleagues took a close look at what seemed to be a silver coin minted in southern Italy in the third century BC .
It turned out to be a lump of lead with a thin silver coating .
This is not the first example of counterfeiting in the ancient world , but the researchers say that in this case the silver coating seems to have been created by a sophisticated chemical process .
" We are not yet aware of any other counterfeit coins like this one , " says Giovannelli .
Tainted trove
“ We are not aware of any other coins like this one . ”
Giuseppe Giovannelli
University of Rome ' La Sapienza '
The coin is part of a hoard that was stashed in a pottery vessel and uncovered in 1948 near the town of Parabita , which is near Gallipoli .
For years it was thought to be a regular silver coin .
But in 2003 an investigation by researchers at the University of Lecce , near Parabita , revealed that under the remaining patches of silver the piece was made of lead .
Giovannelli and colleagues think that the coin was minted with deception in mind .
The Italian researchers have used modern techniques to study the structure and composition of the metals , and have tried to work out how the fakery was done .
A couple of simple counterfeiting methods have been spotted before .
Old forgers could cover a metal lump with thin silver foil and heat it to fuse the foil on to the surface .
They could also fake the look of a coin by chemically treating the surface of an alloy ( which may or may not have contained precious metals ) to give it a silvery or golden sheen .
But the microscopic structure of the silver layer in this case differs from that produced by either of these methods .
Instead it looks like something generated by a much more modern electroplating process , say researchers .
Metallurgists of the time are not thought to have known about this technique .

To solve the mystery , the Italian researchers devised a treatment that produces an effect similar to electroplating , using only materials known to be available in the third century BC .
They immersed a lead object first in copper acetate ( a compound made by letting vinegar corrode copper ) , and then in a silver solution created by dissolving silver chloride in dilute ammonia ( which ancient chemists made from urine ) .
This gave a film with " a cauliflower - like microtexture , with close similarities to that of the residual metal coating of the coin " , says Giovannelli .
Would the fakery have fooled merchants of the time ?
Metalsmiths knew how to detect forgeries of precious metals by measuring their density , using Archimedes ' method of submersion in water to measure volume .
But few would have gone to such extremes for coins handed over in a busy market , says Giovannelli .

A cult is a group of people who follow a similar ideology , usually led by a charismatic leader .
Many , but not all , cults can be dangerous , mind - controlling , and potentially violent .
It ’s best to identify and stay away from cults to begin with .
Avoid responding to door - to - door surveys and be careful about the groups that you join .
If you find yourself involved in cult , you can retain some distance by reaching out to friends and family .
Police and law enforcement authorities can also help if you feel unsafe . [ 1 ]
You may have noticed that there 's a new technology boom under way .
Let us call it TechBubble 2.0 .
It revolves around two axes .
One is Google , which currently dominates everything it touches .
It has also caused investors to lose what remains of their marbles .
On 31 January , for example , the company announced fourth - quarter profits that had nearly tripled ( $ 1.03 bn profit on a 67 percent jump in revenues to $ 3.2 bn )
This indicates a year - on - year growth rate of 70 per cent .
And yet the main consequence of the announcement was a 2 per cent drop in the share price to $ 494 , which suggests that investors had expected even better results .
If this is n't bubble thinking then I do n't know what is .
The second axis is user - generated content and social networking .
This is the world of blogging , Flickr , YouTube , MySpace and Facebook .
It 's causing palpitations in multi-media conglomerates as their executives wonder What It All Means .
Should they buy into the phenomenon at the inflated prices that these services currently command ?
Colossally inflated valuations are an infallible indicator of a bubble .
In the late 1990s , dotcom start - ups with 50 employees and zero profits were briefly valued at more than the market cap of Fortune 500 companies .
In 2005 , Rupert Murdoch paid $ 649 m for MySpace and eBay paid $ 2.6bn for Skype , a VoIP [ internet telephony ] company .
Last year , Google forked out $ 1.65 bn for YouTube .
Such valuations provide terrific incentives for ambitious geeks because the new web services require less upfront investment than the original dotcoms .
What is YouTube , after all , other than some smart software for converting every uploaded video clip into a Flash movie , plus server capacity and bandwidth ?
Skype adds 150,000 subscribers a day and buys almost no hardware because it uses its subscribers ' computers to do the heavy lifting .
A recent Google filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission reveals how rich the TechBubble 2.0 pickings can be .
YouTube co-founder Chad Hurley received Google shares worth $ 345 m .
His partner Steven Chen received $ 326 m .
Jawed Karim , the third YouTube founder ( who left to study ) got $ 64 m for his pains .
And Sequoia Capital , the main investor in YouTube , came away with just over $ 500 m .
Not bad for 15 months ' work , eh ?
Will the YouTubes and MySpaces of this world endure ?
Who knows ?
In the meantime , the best advice for ambitious geeks is to take the money and run .
Chance to play on Pipes
As Google has thrived , Yahoo has languished .
So it 's interesting to see that the older search company has stolen a technical march on its rival .
A couple of weeks ago , Yahoo released Yahoo Pipes ( pipes.yahoo.com ) , a web service that has caused quite a storm in the geeky part of the blogosphere .
Tim O'Reilly , the publisher and technology commentator , described the move as ' a milestone in the history of the internet ' .
Pipes is essentially a visual programming environment which enables anyone with a modicum of software knowledge to take RSS feeds from data sources , process them and redirect them .
So , for example , someone has created a pipe that takes the New York Times front page , runs it through a content - analysis filter that extracts keywords and uses the results to find and display photographs from Flickr that are tagged with those keywords .
Another pipe enables US residents to find homes near public parks .
The significant thing about Pipes is that it is an enabler .
It embodies the permissive spirit of the internet , which does n't care what you do with it so long as you adhere to its technical protocols .
Pipes enables its users to become inventors by forging connections between things that are currently unconnected .
Two cheers for Yahoo !
Recently the homepage is almost dead , and the discussions about important papers that are mentioned on the home page almost non-existent .
I am sad to say that if this continues LtU will fade away - something I am sure none of us wants .
This is a cry for help .
If you are an editor , please try to post news you come across that might interest the LtU community .
Take part in the discussions ( you do n't have to participate in all of them !
participating in discussions on " static typing " is optional ... )
If you are an editor , are reading LtU , but have n't posted in a long time , do n't feel you have become an outsider .
You are still part of the team , and I for one am interested in what you might want to share .
I know some long time editors got discouraged for various reasons -- I think now is a good time to return and reshape things to what they used to be .
If you are a regular reader and participate in the forum regularly , if you think you understand the spirit of LtU , how about signing up to become an editor ?
The process is simple ( basically , you have to email me and that 's it ) .
Many of you have personal blogs , and they are great resources .
I still think the LtU community effort had an additional value it'd be a shame to lose .
If you agree - post !
Finally , if you are a programming language scholar , and are reading and enjoying LtU - how about signing up to be a guest blogger ?
Let 's see : three separate teams each of eight programmers and testers and designers and a manager , plus six layers of managers for each team , plus an übermanager for them all - that 's 43 .
The number comes from Moishe Lettvin , who spent his " worst " year out of seven at Microsoft working on a feature for Vista which he says " should 've been designed , implemented and tested in a week " .
The feature ?
The menu that Vista users choose from when they 've finished working .
What you 'll get on a laptop is a choice of " off " or lock ; plus an advanced menu offering ( deep breath ) switch user , log off , lock , restart , sleep , hibernate and shut down .
Plus , as the developer Joel Spolsky points out , the options of pressing the physical power button , or ( on a laptop ) just closing the lid .
Spolsky reckons Vista offers 15 different ways to shut down a laptop .
( Sure , you might not see the advanced menu .
But which , of shut down , sleep , hibernate , log off or switch user , is the simple " off " ? )
Spolsky suggests that the dithering implied by having so many confusingly similar and utterly different choices every time you 're done with a session " produces just a little bit of unhappiness every time " .
What are the comparisons ?
On Apple 's OS X , which Lettvin 's team used " as a paragon of clean UI [ user interface design ] " , there are four options presented on pressing the power button : restart , sleep , cancel ( ie oops ! wrong button ) , shut down .
How many people did that take ?
It 's a mystery lost in time , as the " choice of four " has existed since at least 1997 .
Linux distributions have an uncountable team ; the Gnome distribution offers just " suspend " and " hibernate " .
On the iPod , there is no on / off button - a design choice made , yes , by Steve Jobs .
( Instead , it turns itself off once paused for a set length of time . )
Now - 43 people ?
Is n't that a lot ?
Yes : three teams ( Lettvin 's " mobile " team , the " shell " team , and " kernel " team ) of eight each , plus 16 managers , plus their manager .
But , says Lettvin , the worst thing was that " of those 24 there were exactly zero with final say in how the feature worked .
Somewhere in those other 17 was somebody who did have final say but who that was I have no idea since when I left the team - after a year - there was still no decision about exactly how this feature would work . "
He concludes : " The end result of all this is what finally shipped : the lowest common denominator , the simplest and least controversial option .
I have no idea how much of the rest of Vista ended up like this .
I think ( indeed hope ) my team was a pathological case ; unfortunately it 's a visible one . "

" You look at these numbers and think ' that 's impossible ' , " said Carl Haub , senior demographer at the US - based Population Reference Bureau , whose latest global projections show Uganda as the fastest growing country in the world .
Midway through the 21st century Uganda will be the world 's 12th most populous country with 130 million people - more than Russia or Japan .
Startling as they are , the projections are feasible , and a glance at some of the variables shows why .
A typical Ugandan woman gives birth to seven children - an extraordinarily high fertility rate that has remained largely unchanged for more than 30 years .
Half the population is under 15 , and will soon move into childbearing age .
Fewer than one in five married women has access to contraception .
Taken together , the factors point to a population explosion that has demographers and family planning experts warning that efforts to cut poverty are doomed unless urgent measures are taken .
And not just in Uganda .
Across much of sub-Saharan Africa the population is expanding so quickly that the demographic map of the earth is changing .
In the rest of world , including developing nations in Asia and South America , fertility rates have steadily declined to an average of 2.3 children to each mother .
Most will experience only modest population growth in coming decades .
Some countries , particularly in eastern Europe , will see their numbers decline .
But by 2050 Chad , Mali , Guinea Bissau , Liberia , Niger , Burundi and Malawi - all among the poorest nations in the world - are projected to triple in size .
Nigeria will have become the world 's fourth biggest country .
Democratic Republic of Congo and Ethiopia will have vaulted into the top 10 for the first time .
Nearly a quarter of the world 's population will come from Africa - up from one in seven today .
" What 's happening is alarming and depressing , " said Jotham Musinguzi , director of the population secretariat in Uganda 's ministry of finance , pointing out the clear correlation between high fertility levels and poverty .
" Are we really going to be able to give these extra people jobs , homes , healthcare and education ? "
Development may not be the only casualty of the population boom .
With increased competition for scarce resources such as land , conflict is likely to increase .
Consequences will be felt far beyond Africa : pressure to migrate abroad - already great - can only grow , experts say .
It is not yet a lost cause .
Experience has shown that with strong political will population growth can be tackled in Africa .
Southern Africa 's population is expected to remain stable thanks to sustained efforts to cut fertility rates , although Aids - related deaths are also a factor .
In 1978 Uganda 's neighbour Kenya had the world 's highest fertility rate - more than eight children per mother .
The government made family planning a national priority and by the mid-1990s the figure was less than five .
But a number of African leaders , including Uganda 's president , Yoweri Museveni , believe that their countries are under- populated , and that a bigger internal market and workforce will boost their economic prospects .
In a speech to MPs in July Mr Museveni said : " I am not one of those worried about the ' population explosion ' .
This is a great resource . "
Studies across Africa have shown that the desire for large families remains powerful .
In Nigeria a recent survey revealed that just 4 % of women with two children said they wanted no more .
Part of the reason is cultural , with bigger families seen as a sign of security .
It is also because of fears of high levels of infant mortality .
Stigmas about birth control are another factor .
Reproductive health experts say that a lack of information and of availability of female contraceptives plays a major role .
In Ethiopia just 8 % of married women use contraceptives .
In Uganda more than a third of all women say they would like to stop - or at least stall - having children .
For that , donors must share in the blame , said Steven Sinding , director - general of the International Planned Parenthood Federation .
He said the world had declared premature victory in the battle to cut fertility rates .
Curbing population growth is not one of the UN's Millennium Development Goals , which aim to halve poverty by 2015 , and barely features in the Commission for Africa report championed by Tony Blair .
" In sub -Saharan Africa population remains a very serious problem , " said Mr Sinding .
" Yet donors have completely shifted their focus to HIV / Aids and nobody is talking about it any more .
Population is off the development agenda and that 's a tragedy for Africa . "
Elly Mugumya , head of the Family Planning Association of Uganda , agreed .
In a tiny clinic in Kampala 's Owino market , one of the biggest food and clothing bazaars in east Africa , he watched as six women - and two men - crammed into a tiny clinic to receive information about contraception .
Cost is not the problem in Uganda , he explained : a three - month supply of birth - control pills costs 15 p ; condoms are free for the men .
It is access - in most parts of Uganda clinics like this simply do not exist .

How CalCars Green - Tuned an '04 Prius into a PRIUS +
Plug - In Hybrid !
: Much of the information on this page is at this pointSee the five URLs in the box for current information .
We 've taken this well - designed , highly popular advanced vehicle and souped it up -- or more accurately , " green - tuned " it !
Add batteries and grid- charging , and you get PRIUS + , a " plug - in " hybrid ( PHEV ) .
That means no gas when you do your errands on local streets at 35 mph .
On the highway , it runs just like any other Prius , with the gasoline engine doing most of the work -- and the extra batteries kicking in to improve performance at ALL speeds .
We 're making PRIUS + happen .
We now have three working converted prototypes ( both described in Fact Sheet above , shown in photos and here ) :
The Calcars first proof - of - concept : ( 100 + mpg plus electricity , 10 - mile electric range , now with temporary lead - acid battery pack , soon to be replaced by nickel metal - hydride batteries ) .
( 100 + mpg plus electricity , 10 - mile electric range , now with temporary lead - acid battery pack , soon to be replaced by nickel metal - hydride batteries ) .
Two EDrive / EnergyCS prototypes : ( 100 + mpg plus electricity , 30 - mile range , with lithium - ion batteries .
We believe that converting a small number of Priuses is the quickest , most cost - effective way to get people talking about PHEVs ' viability and benefits -- and support other PHEV development efforts .
With annual sales volumes now exceeding 100,000 , over 10,000 enthusiastic Prius owners and many others are having excited discussions online .
PRIUS + can demonstrate driver interest in PHEVs .
We are also working ( with our for - profit integration partners ) to offer installed " conversions , " first for Toyota Prius , probably followed by Ford Escape and other forthcoming hybrids .
Our goal is to encourage Toyota and other automakers to supply the market for PHEVs .
The latest answers to : How & When Can I Get a PRIUS +? and EDrive FAQ
INFORMATION IF YOU'RE TECHNICALLY INCLINED :
See the new EAA - PHEV Conversion project sponsored by the Electric Auto Association .
This is focused on " do- it - yourself " conversions of Prius ( and perhaps later other hybrids ) by people with the technical background to safely work on high - voltage components .
Their discussion group has begun working on this , and we 're helping .
At the CalCars - sponsored PRIUS +
Plug - In Hybrid Conversion Group ( do n't try to subscribe , as membership is closed ) , you can see where we defined the project , assembled the components and built our first prototype ( see links at top of page to Fact Sheet and Photos ) .
For initial testing we used PbA batteries ; we 're now testing Ni-MH , and EDrive Systems is using LiIon .
For the benefit of those who are n't members of the Group and can't access the Group 's files area , here are the current PDF versions of the PRIUS +
Batteries , PRIUS + Components and Configuration Options ( seeing the entire battery document is easiest by printing it ) .
If you 're interested in the history , go back a year to get a flavor of how this all began by reading PriusPlusTechnicalPosts ( 300 K word doc excerpting online postings through May 2004 about enabling the Prius 's " EV - only " mode that Toyota designed and about adding additional battery capacity , but not enabling grid- charging of the larger battery pack ) .
( See our Resources page for links to the main online discussion groups . )
Instructions ( 1.5 MB pdf ) show how individuals can enable the Prius 's EV - only mode Coastal Electric Technologies also offers a kit .
( Toyota currently ships cars in Europe and Japan with this button , but it 's unavailable in the US -- see photo ) .

Related Prius and Industry Developments :
We have been encouraged to see evidence of growing interest in building variants on the Prius platform .
Ford has licensed Toyota hybrid patents and Nissan will use the Hybrid Synergy Drive technology .
To demonstrate the vehicle 's capabilities , Toyota has built three racer prototypes with Toyota Racing Development ( link is the US branch , which designs , builds and markets performance aftermarket parts and , who knows , could someday build PRIUS + ) , and has produced for testing a version that can act as an auxiliary power generator .
And California 's South Coast Air Quality Management District ( SCAQMD ) is spending $ 4 M to convert 30 - 35 Priuses to run as hydrogen ( internal combustion , not fuel cell ) - electric hybrids .
See Quantum press release by engineering / integration company and SCAQMD Response to Joseph Romm , former US Energy Department official , who supports non-hydrogen approaches , including PHEVs .
Fire is extinct with water and water vanishes at high temperature .
You can imagine shooting fire and water in a similar relationship : faster shutter speed for fire and slower shutter speed for water will give different results than slower shutter speed for fire and faster shutter speed for water .
Both fire and water are elements that move , so these following examples can serve to further ideas about moving objects .
With fast shutter speed for fire you will capture one instance of the burning flame ( just hit the burning woods before you shoot and get a magical sparkle ) .
Slower shutter speed on water will create a smooth silky surface used usually on waterfalls , rivers and the see .
Slow speed over fire is rarely used as slow speed over light : it creates burning shapes of fire light .
Fast speed used with water pictures will give the well - known droplet effect .
You can also consider dropping objects in water to obtain creative shoots .
Some realy good images of water droplets .

The distance from the funnel to the exit point - which is situated in the south side of the canyon - is about 700 feet .
Located in northern California , the Monticello Dam’s is the largest morning glory spillway all over the world .
This funnel - shaped outlet , allows water to bypass the dam when it reaches capacity , as it swallows a rate of 48,400 cubic feet per second ( 1370 m³/s ) .
The distance from the funnel to the exit point - which is situated in the south side of the canyon - is about 700 feet .

This type of spillway is basically a giant cement funnel .
The hole 's largest diameter is 72 feet and narrows to about 28 feet .
According to Davis Wiki , " for obvious reasons , swimming near the glory hole is both prohibited and stupid .
There are buoys strung across the lake to discourage boaters and swimmers from approaching the glory hole and the dam .
Furthermore , the glory hole is well fenced off from the land . " .

How to make a Stable Plasmoid ( Ball Lightning )
with the GMR v1.0 ( G raphite M icrowave R esonator )
by Jean - Louis Naudin
Cliquez ici pour la version Française
created on March 1st , 2003 - JLN Labs - Last update December 22 , 2005
Toutes les informations et schémas sont publiés gratuitement ( freeware ) et sont destinés à un usage personnel et non commercial
All informations and diagrams are published freely ( freeware ) and are intended for a private use and a non commercial use .
The purpose of this experiment is to maintain a stable plasmoid ( a ball lightning ) at one atmosphere in a spherical glass vessel .
This experiment uses a kind of electronic trigger which is the GMR v1.0 ( G raphite M icrowave R esonator ) placed in a microwave oven working at 2.45 GHz .
A magnetron is compact , has a light weight ( compared to a HV transformer with the same output power ) and it is a high power device .
It is able to produce a great amount of power in a small volume most particularly in a plasmoid .
A plasmoid is a great source of ions and can be very useful for EHD , MHD and Electrokinetic devices such as the Lifter ....
A successful experiment has already been conducted on February 27th , 2002 with a quarter wave antenna made with aluminium .
The previous design has been improved and the aluminum antenna has now been replaced by a graphite antenna , this new resonator is now called the GMR ( Graphite Microwave Resonator ) .
The cloud of carbon emitted by the antenna absorbs the major part the microwave energy .
So the GMR is able to produce a very high density plasma in a small volume .
The GMR v 1.0 is a microwave resonator composed with a small quater wave antenna mounted on an artificial ground surface .
The frequency of the magnetron is 2.45 GHz , its wave length is l = 12.2 cm , this gives the height of the 1/4 wave microwave antenna : l /4 = 3 cm and the ground base diameter : l /2 = 6 cm .
You will notice , if you conduct yourself this experiment , that the plasmoid remains very stable as long as the microwave oven is running .
Below , you will find the full details and the explanation about this experiment :
Materiel requirement :
A microwave oven which is able to produce about 700 Watts of microwave power ,
A small piece of aluminum sheet , 5/10 mm thick and about 10x10 cm ,
A piece of adhesive aluminum or a cyanoacrylate glue tube ,
A small glass of water ,
Some pencil graphite leads ( 2 mm diameter , type HB N°2 ) ,
A spherical glass vessel ( Pyrex ( Tm ) is recommended ) , about 110 mm diameter .
How to build the GMR V 1.0 :
1 ) Cut a 60 mm diameter disk in the aluminum sheet ,
2 ) Cut a small rectangle 10x15 mm in the aluminum sheet ,
3 ) Bend this small piece of aluminum as shown in the photo below to build the mounting base of the antenna ,
3 ) Cut a length of 30 mm in a 2 mm pencil lead , one of its extremities must be sharpened ( see the photo below ) .
4 ) Fix the mounting base in the middle of the aluminum disk with a piece of adhesive aluminum or cyanoacrylate glue .
5 ) Then insert the graphite antenna in the mounting base , as shown in the photo below .
Your GMR v1.0 is finished and now , your plasmoid generation experiment is ready to begin ...
Warning :
Do n't forget that the Plasmoid generates ozone ( O3 ) and nitrogen oxydes ( NO and NO2 ) , so you need to do this experiment in an open and well ventiled area .
If you do it the risk of any results is just yours .
I take no responsibility of anything that might happen .

Open the windows so as to get a well ventiled area .
Put your GMR in the middle of the microwave oven and cover it with the spherical vessel .
Put a small glass of water ( optional ) as shown in the photo above .
The glass of water is used to protect the magnetron , it will avoid that an eventual excess of power overheat its anode .
In the photo above , you may notice that the rotating plate and its axis has been removed , this can be done easily .
Close the microwave door .
Set the microwave power to max power .
Set the countdown timer to 10 seconds .
Push the ON Button ...
Then .... Watch and hear the plasmoid in action ...
It is recommended to wait some minutes between each test .
This will avoid that the magnetron overheat too much .
On the pictures above : the ignition sequence of the plasmoid .
Additional notes :
After a test run , the glass vessel is only a bit warm .
As you may notice in the photo above , the plasmoid is not in contact with the glass .
You will see , in the small MPEG video below , that the plasmoid turns counter - clockwise at a very high speed .
There is a small air cushion , induced by the rotation , around the plasmoid which protect the glass vessel from the high temperature of the plasma .
This is not a cold plasma , the plasmoid ( is really hot in its core ) .
The diameter and the spherical shape of the glass vessel is really important to get a such effect .
In this test , I have used a 110 mm diameter glass vessel .

Our expert panel votes for the top 10 sci-fi films Competition : win the top 10 Talk about itHow we did it 1 .
Blade Runner ( 1982 ) Dir : Ridley Scott
Whether you prefer the original theatrical version ( with a bored - sounding narration and without the famed unicorn scenes ) or the director 's cut of a few years later ( sans narration and unicorn duly re-inserted ) , Blade Runner was the runaway favourite in our poll .
The story revolves around Harrison Ford 's policeman , Rick Deckard , and his hunt for four cloned humanoids , known as replicants , in a dystopian version of Los Angeles .
Replicants have been deemed illegal and Deckard is a blade runner , a specialist in exterminating them .
The film is loosely based on Philip K Dick 's short story , Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep ?
" Blade Runner is the best movie ever made , " says Stephen Minger , stem cell biologist at King 's College London .
" It was so far ahead of its time and the whole premise of the story - what is it to be human and who are we , where we come from ?
It 's the age - old questions . "
It also discusses consciousness with an attempt to formulate a way to tell a human from a machine .
The Voight - Kampff empathy test is used by the police in the film to identify the replicants - who have memories implanted and are programmed with artificial emotions .
" The Voight - Kampff empathy test is not far away from the sort of thing that cognitive neuroscientists are actually doing today , " says Chris Frith of the Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience at University College , London .
Debates rage on whether Deckard himself is a replicant .
Ridley Scott says that he is artificial , but Harrison Ford argues that during filming Scott told him Deckard was human .
Whatever the answer , it is a worthy winner also because of the quality of the film - making : Vangelis ' brooding score , Rutger Hauer 's replicant 's seminal " I 've seen things ... " speech and that shot of the future LA cityscape , which kicks off the story .
2 . 2001 : A Space Odyssey ( 1968 ) Dir : Stanley Kubrick
A very close second , this mystifying story came out of a collaboration between Kubrick and science fiction writer Arthur C Clarke .
It achieved enormous fame for its then revolutionary special effects .
Spacecraft consultants Frederick Ordway and Harry Lange , who had worked for Nasa , persuaded companies such as Boeing and IBM to supply prototypes and technical documents for use in the film .
Astronauts visiting the set at Borehamwood referred to it as " Nasa East " .
Aubrey Manning , emeritus professor of natural history at Edinburgh , praises 2001 for " the brilliance of the simulations - still never done better despite all the modern computer graphics .
The brilliance of using Brazilian tapirs as ' prehistoric animals ' .
The brilliance of the cut from the stick as club , to the space shuttle .
Kubrick declaring that once tool use begins - the rest is inevitable .
Hal : the first of the super computers with its honeyed East - Coast - Establishment voice . "
3 . Star Wars ( 1977 ) / Empire Strikes Back ( 1980 )
The first two films of the original Star Wars trilogy make it onto the list probably for reasons of nostalgia rather than science .
Essentially westerns set in space , they both cover the universal themes of good versus evil while making lead actors Harrison Ford , Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher spit out mind - boggling technospeak on a regular basis .
There is also an element of mysticism ( which some say sets them apart from the rest of science fiction ) , with the idea of an all - pervading " force " that can be harnessed by certain people for good or evil .
The epic saga revolves around the battle between the all - enslaving Empire ( led by the Emperor , a force - wielding maniac and his part - human part - machine henchman Darth Vader ) and a small band of rebels .
Its use of science is sketchy at best - light - speed travel is dealt with by the use of a " hyperspace " where the normal laws of physics do n't seem to apply and force - wielding Jedi fight with theoretically impossible lightsabers - but the emphasis here is certainly not on answering the problems of the human condition .
Two of the first blockbusters , they also started the franchises for toys , games and replicas that no science fiction film can do without nowadays .
4 . Alien ( 1979 ) Dir : Ridley Scott
Remembered for the iconic scene of an infant creature bursting bloodily through John Hurt 's chest , but Alien was about much more .
An interstellar mining vessel takes onboard a lifeform with concentrated acid for blood and two sets of jaws , which then messily dispatches the crew .
Praised for the gothic set design and Sigourney Weaver 's portrayal of reluctant hero Ellen Ripley , it is notable for its underlying themes of motherhood , penetration and birth .
But for UCL space physiologist Kevin Fong it 's the mundanity of the crew 's lifestyle that makes it stand out .
" For the first time we got the idea that , in the far - flung future , people who live and work in space might be a bunch of Average Joe slobs sitting around with leftover pizza , smoking and playing cards to pass the time , " he says .
" It captures much of what long duration space flight is about now : dirty , sweaty and claustrophobic with long periods of boredom followed by moments of sheer terror . "
5 . Solaris ( 1972 ) Dir : Andrei Tarkovsky
Remade by Steven Soderbergh in 2002 , but the original still holds a fascination for fans of the novel by Stanislaw Lem .
A psychologist travels to a base on a remote planet to replace a mysteriously deceased scientist .
There he encounters the secretive survivors - and his dead wife .
Reality is supplanted by the increasingly attractive alternative of the planet 's alien intelligence .
" The 1972 Solaris is perhaps the only film to address the limits of science set by our constrained human perceptions , categories and tendency to anthropomorphise , " says Gregory Benford , professor of physics at University of California , Irvine and author of Timescape .
" That it is also a compelling , tragic drama , not a mere illustrated lecture , makes it even more important . "
6 . Terminator ( 1984 ) / T2 : Judgment day ( 1991 ) Dir : James Cameron
Robots from 2029 send a relentless cyborg ( Arnold Schwarzenegger ) back to 1980s Los Angeles to assassinate the mother of a future human rebel .
One of a few films to deal with problems of time travel , such as the grandfather paradox : if you travel back in time and kill your grandfather , you would n't exist so would n't be able to travel back in time to ...
The sequel featured another cyborg made of shapeshifting metal .
" Despite the incoherent fictional science , it is a perfect piece of film - making in its genre , which I would call ' action movie ' rather than ' sci - fi movie ' if it were not for the fact that there are very few , if any , movies that genuinely deserve to be called sci-fi , " says David Deutsch , quantum physicist at Oxford .
7 . The Day the Earth Stood Still ( 1951 ) Dir : Robert Wise
Set amid the cold war paranoia of postwar America , a flying saucer lands in Washington DC and a humanoid alien , Klaatu emerges , accompanied by his robot , Gort .
Klaatu ( who pronounces : " I 'm impatient with stupidity .
My people have learned to live without it " ) tries to convince the world 's leaders - and when they wo n't listen , scientists - to stop the rush toward mutual destruction .
It is cited by Beagle 2 project leader Colin Pillinger as one of his favourite sci- fi films .
" During the showing , the cinema manager pulled a classic Orson Welles stunt and stopped the film to announce that a spaceship had landed . "
8 . War of the Worlds ( 1953 ) Dir : Byron Haskin
Famously adapted for radio by Orson Welles , HG Wells ' tale of a Martian invasion of Earth became another cold war movie .
" The idea that there could be life that 's developed in completely other circumstances in a completely different world which you would never recognise .
That 's a very appealing idea , " says Seth Shostak , senior astronomer at the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence , California .
9 . The Matrix ( 1999 ) Dir : Andy & Larry Wachowski
Cod philosophy , fetish clothing and incredibly cool special effects combined in 1999 for a fresh take on man-made artificial intelligence enslaving the planet .
The science behind the fiction is conspicuously absent , being replaced with the permanently befuddled Keanu Reeves stumbling around being confused by nonsense about spoons , and jumping off buildings .
Tak Mak , a cell biologist at University of Toronto , does n't think this matters : " It 's good old - fashioned entertainment value ... Future bad guys fighting future good guys . "
10 . Close Encounters of the Third Kind ( 1977 ) Dir : Steven Spielberg
" We are not alone " , declared the poster and this tale of Richard Dreyfus ' escalating obsession with alien visitors against a backdrop of a secretive , omniscient government agency has provided the core of science fiction ever since .
" While it is highly unlikely that ' they ' will rock up in a vehicle that looks like a giant , inverted Christmas tree or make their presence known by doing Jean Michel Jarre impressions on a cosmic synthesiser , Close Encounters is for me still the classiest alien visitation story in celluloid history , " says UCL's Kevin Fong .
Oil companies Companies such as BP make the bulk of their money from the " upstream " business : the exploration and production of oil .
BP reported earlier this week that it had earned $ 6.8 bn upstream out of a total profit of $ 8.5 bn in the three months to March 31 .
Saudi Arabia is the biggest oil exporter in the world and rising oil prices have swollen government coffers .
Exploiting oil is relatively cheap in Saudi - less than $ 3 for a $ 70 per barrel price , and it 's all controlled by the state .
Last year the country made $ 133.5 bn out of oil and spent $ 74.8 bn on things like education ( $ 18.7bn ) and health ( $ 7.2bn ) , according to figures from the Centre for Global Energy Studies .
It also spent on defence : $ 38.5 bn , some of which goes to Britain to pay for BAE systems jets .
Some of the $ 57.1 bn surplus in 2005 went to pay off the enormous Gulf War One debt Saudi ran up .
The rest ?
US
Treasury bonds and other capital markets including shares of UK stock - listed companies .
The princes take personal commissions on big trade deals and their money - estimated in total at $ 1 trillion - is invested in all sorts of assets including London property .
Dubai , like other members of the UAE , has put its money into becoming a centre of finance , trade and tourism .
Dubai Ports
World recently bought one of Britain 's best - known companies , P&O. Nigeria has become the first African nation to pay off its outstanding debts using oil revenues : it paid $ 4.5 bn to Paris Club creditors last week .
In Nigeria , private oil companies such as Shell pay for the cost of finding oil and then pay a royalty tax to the government .
Venezuela is using its newfound wealth in quite different ways .
Hugo Chavez , the left - wing president of Venezuela , is promoting a massive new social reform programme .
He is also selling oil at knock - down rates to Latin American neighbours in a bid to separate them from Washington 's political orbit .
Transportation
Massive demand for oil around the world has helped fuel the biggest shipping boom in history .
Noone has yet secured the recognition of the former maritime magnates such as Onassis and Niarchos but Greeks - and Norwegians - still control the bulk of the world 's tankers .
The new figures of Greek shipping are men such as Loucas Haji -Iaonnou ( father of easyJet founder Stelios ) , plus the Angelicoussis and Livanos families .
Norwegian shipowner John Fredriksen is probably the nearest thing nowadays to Aristotle Onassis but he favours a low profile and is not someone who likes to be seen at society gatherings .
Fredriksen has been spending some of his millions in Britain - he did once own London 's most expensive property in Chelsea .
Shipowners like the usual millionaire baubles such as fast cars , yachts and Impressionist paintings .
But many love shipping and historically pile much of their money into even more vessels , fuelling over - capacity and bringing boom cycles to the inevitable bust .
Overordering is happening right now .
Owners - including BP and the other oil companies - can make $ 6 m on one cargo carried on a typical longhaul journey from Saudi Arabia to the US east coast .
The price of vessels has shot up due to heavy demand and it can cost up to $ 140 m now to build a new one .
A typical supertanker can carry 2 m barrels of oil and at $ 70 per barrel this means a ship is moving a cargo worth $ 140 m .
Big insurance premiums have to be paid to cover the ships and cargos meaning large revenues for Lloyd's of London .
$ 84 million , Daily cost of oil transportation
Trading
The global centres of oil trading are in New York and London .
Oil companies and specialist trading firms such as Vitol , Trafigura and Glencore buy and sell crude on the New York Mercantile Exchange and the International Petroleum Exchange in Britain .
Up to 1bn barrels of oil change hands every day on NYMEX so this can involve sums of $ 70 bn - plus .
But a range of other players have emerged in these markets driving trading volumes up to record levels : hedge funds and other financial groups .
They are using oil for speculation - essentially taking bets on the likelihood of oil rising or falling - in the same way as they would in traditional equity markets .
This is criticised by traditionalists who believe it is increasing the volatility of the oil markets which are increasingly moving upwards on " sentiment " such as fear of a US attack on oil - producing Iran .
UK pension funds have benefited , though .
BP estimates its dividends and share buybacks are responsible for £ 1 out of every £ 6 flowing into those funds from UK investments .
$ 70 billion , Value of oil traded on NYMEX in one day
Refining
The major oil companies such as ExxonMobil , Shell and BP still control most of the global refining businesses which are centred in Rotterdam , Houston and Singapore .
The crude oil is brought by tankers from producing countries such as Nigeria or Iran and turned into " products " such as aviation fuel or petrol .
There are some refineries in Britain and their output is delivered often by pipeline to major distribution centres such as the one at Buncefield in Hertfordshire which suffered an explosion and fire .
Road tankers then move the petrol from these centres to the motorway service stations .
The refining business often moves in cycles with companies making big profits or sometimes losses on this side of the business .
There is currently a slight shortage of refineries , one of the reason why the price of oil is so high .
Oil companies have not been investing in refineries because they were previously not making any money .
The host governments impose no specific tax at this stage in the oil transportation chain but companies pay corporation tax on profits made here and elsewhere .
BP claims to have made profits of $ 1.6 bn out of " refining and marketing " in the first three months of this year although this figure includes money made out of selling petrol , a sum said by the company to be negligible .
$ 210 million Cost of refining oil each day
Petrol
High petrol prices cause oil companies and government the most grief in political terms but this is , ironically , a side of the business where the lowest profits are made .
The supermarkets have also helped keep prices low by entering the petrol retail business , which they see as a way of bringing consumers to shop for food and clothes in their superstores .
But the total number of petrol stations in Britain is in fast decline with 11 a week now being closed .
Figures from the Energy Institute show the UK now has fewer forecourt outlets than in 1914 - even though combined diesel and petrol sales set a record last year .
The British government takes up to 75 p from the current £ 1 per litre in excise duty and Value Added Tax but this has not stopped motorists venting their fury on oil companies as much as Tony Blair .
The announcement of record corporate profits in recent years by BP , Shell and others has been met with howls of protests - but only led governments to take even bigger taxes from North Sea production .
Since the 1999 lorry drivers ' blockade , the government has been careful about implementing petrol tax rises .
Companies such as BP always declare they made next to no profits on their petrol retailing but no specific figures are ever forthcoming .
United States
Tax levels have traditionally been very low - barely 25 % of the total pump price - but the right to drive in the world 's largest consuming country is as sacrosanct as the right to hold a gun .
President George Bush has come under heavy fire in a mid-term from opposition Democrats amid mounting public concern about petrol prices hitting $ 3 per gallon , very high in local terms .
Mr Bush earlier this week called a halt to rebuilding stocks in a Strategic Petroleum Reserve to use in time of emergency , in favour of leaving more oil in the market for other uses .
The president has also instructed the Federal Trade Commission , plus the departments of justice and energy , to investigate possible cheating on pump prices by oil companies .
In January in his state of the union address , Mr Bush admitted : " America is addicted to oil . "
£ 24 billion , UK government fuel duty per year
$ 2 , 400 , 000 , 000 , 000 oil industry turnover in one year
NEW ORLEANS NEGLIGENCE : I agree with those who say it 's not to time to play " blame games " about the New Orleans nightmare .
But we can — and should — be serious about assessing responsibility .
It 's a simple fact that local and state official represent the first line of defense in natural disasters .
It 's a fact that Mayor Ray Nagin said he did n't load the now - drowned school buses with passengers because he wanted to find buses with greater comfort .
It 's a fact that Nagin later revised his story to say he waited to find the right drivers .
It 's a fact that New Orleans had an advance plan for emergency evacuation that does n't mention the federal government playing the chief role .
It 's a fact that Governor Kathleen Blanco had authority to call in the National Guard , but she waited .
It 's a fact that those who were n't evacuated by bus were herded into the Super Dome with no plans for food and water .
It 's a fact that Mayor Nagin prevented the Red Cross from bringing in food and water , as if the Super Dome 's new occupants were being housed there only temporarily , as if the availability of food and water would spread the wrong message : " If you feed them , they will come . "
None of this is surprising .
Those who died were among the poorest , which is really to say the least self - sufficient and the most dependent upon a culture of low expectations .
Nagin and Blanco reflect that same culture : " Wait for someone to take care of us , and blame them when they do n't give us what we want , when we want it . "
Ben Johnson has the story at Frontpage Magazine .
And Brendan Miniter makes a strong case that the poor of New Olreans were failed long before Katrina .
Tuebingen , Germany - November 02 , 2006 -- Fundamental theories regarding consciousness , emotion and quality of life in sufferers of paralysis from Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis ( ALS , also known as ' Lou Gerhig 's disease ' ) are being challenged based on new research on brain - computer interaction .
ALS is a progressive disease that destroys neurons affecting movement .
The study appears in the latest issue of Psychophysiology .
The article reviews the usefulness of currently available brain - computer - interfaces ( BCI ) , which use brain activity to communicate through external devices , such as computers .
The research focuses on a condition called the completely locked - in state ( CLIS , a total lack of muscle control ) .
In a CLIS situation , intentional thoughts and imagery can rarely be acted upon physically and , therefore , are rarely followed by a stimulus .
The research suggests that as the disease progresses and the probability for an external event to function as a link between response and consequence becomes progressively smaller , it may eventually vanish altogether .
Researchers have found that by implementing a BCI before the CLIS state occurs , a patient can be taught to communicate through an electronic device with great regularity .
The continued interaction between thought , response and consequence is believed to slow the destruction of the nervous system .
The findings are also raising a number of new questions about the quality of life amongst paralysis sufferers .
Patients surveyed were found to be much healthier mentally than psychiatrically depressed patients without any life - threatening bodily disease .
Only 9 % of ALS patients showed long episodes of depression and most were during the period following diagnosis and a period of weeks after tracheotomy .
" Most instruments measuring depression and quality of life are invalid for paralyzed people living in protected environments because most of the questions do not apply to the life of a paralyzed person .
Special instruments had to be developed , " says Niels Birbaumer , Ph.D. , author of the study .
This contrasts previously accepted notions as many doctors believe that the quality of life in total paralysis is extremely low and continuation of life is a burden for the patient .
The study challenges the myth of helplessness , depression and poor quality of life in paralyzed persons that lead to hastened decisions on euthanasia .

Afghanistan 's opium poppy crop grew by 50 percent in 2006 to a record level despite increased eradication and other U.S. efforts , according to a government watchdog agency .
"
The worsening security situation and the lack of Afghan capacity are tremendous challenges to the success of U.S. counternarcotics programs in Afghanistan , " says a new report by the Government Accountability Office ( GAO ) , the nonpartisan investigative arm of Congress .
" The security situation continues to decline ; during the 2005 - 2006 growing season , eradicators were attacked several times and alternative livelihoods project personnel were killed .
Moreover , due to Afghanistan ’s lack of infrastructure , educated populace , and functioning governmental institutions , significantly reducing poppy cultivation and drug trafficking is expected to take at least a decade .
" The United States invaded Afghanistan to oust the Taliban regime in 2001 , following the Sept. 11 terrorism attacks .
The Taliban was providing a safe haven for terrorist mastermind Osama bin Laden .
The US Agency for International Development and State Department received about $ 532 million in fiscal year 2005 funds and initiated a number of projects under each of their counternarcotics pillars , but delays in implementation limited progress , GAO says .
To combat the drug trade , the U.S. government developed a counternarcotics strategy consisting of five pillars : alternative livelihoods , elimination and eradication , interdiction , law enforcement and justice , and public information .
USAID and State have made efforts to oversee the use of funds , including the use of self certifications , contract clauses , and vetting , when applicable .
" However , a lack of official records and reliable information limited efforts to vet Afghan nationals , " GAO says .
" In addition , although USAID and State have made efforts to monitor ongoing projects , security concerns and poor infrastructure limited site visits .

Comment I thought I knew something about networking , but according to an animated cartoon by telco lobbyists , I 've been laboring under numerous misconceptions .
For example , I 'd always believed it possible to increase both capacity and bandwidth without the kind of traffic discrimination that the telcos would like to introduce .
Apparently , that 's wrong .
The cartoon clearly illustrates that network neutrality makes it impossible for broadband providers to increase capacity and bandwidth .
You 've simply got to discriminate between cheap packets and expensive packets to accommodate a large traffic flow .
This was an astounding revelation to me .
Now , those who , like me , believe that the internet has always been ridiculously oversold by providers and techno - utopians are in for a shock .
It turns out that once we 've got special pipes for premium features like VoIP , HD movie streams , TV , and the like , everything will work as we 've been promised it would work since the mid 1990s , as the cartoon carefully explains .
And this brings up another misconception of mine : I had thought the reason we do n't get HD movies on the internet had something to do with greedy control freaks within the entertainment cartels who have yet to figure out how to charge us for online content according to a pay - per-use scheme .
But apparently , it 's because there is n't a special pipe carrying movies , for which we can pay extra .
Apparently , the movies will begin to flow as soon as the pipe is laid and the valve opened .
And if you thought , as I did , that mile upon mile of fiber optic cable has been rotting in the ground from ambitious build outs by long - bankrupt NSPs in anticipation of a broadband Valhalla that was forever just around the corner , listen up .
I just learned that the broadband industry is actively laying fiber - because , you see , the new , properly - functioning internet that 's just around the corner is going to need even more of it than we 've got on hand .
That 's because you need fiber to carry expensive packets .
You do n't want them mingling with cheap ones .
Silly me ; I thought that capacity is capacity , and bandwidth is bandwidth .
I 'm glad I did n't write any foolish articles advocating net neutrality before I saw that cartoon .
It 's all so clear now .
Evidently , the internet has never worked .
And the reason it has n't worked has nothing to do with corporate greed or media consolidation or general over - promising ; it 's because the internet is one dumb pipe that can't tell a cheap packet from an expensive one . ®

Lately , I ’ve been doing a lot of Haskell .
I must warn you , I always have a Programming Language Of The Month , but now I feel as if it ’s different .
Haskell is a programming language where you get the feeling that a lot of things are just perfect .
First off , the way the type - system works , many , many , many errors that you ’d normally make in your imperative language are simply impossible to make .
It ’s very strict , and although ruby is me second language of choice , this is also a really good thing .
For example , I recently read that it ’s virtually impossible to generate invalid XML .
And that ’s not because the author is some crazy god - like person , it ’s just an intrinsic feature of the data - types in Haskell .
Furthermore , Haskell gives you a really good intellectual challenge .
You really spend more time thinking than typing .
The information density in your code is quite high compared to a lot of other languages I work in .
Also , having no side - effects is a Good Thing .
The first time that I worked in Haskell , I was really disappointed that IO was so hard to do , with all that incomprehensible Monad - stuff and more .
As it turned out , it ’s really not that hard , and debugging will get so much easier .
You just do n’t need logger statements all around your code .
Ruby is my second language of choice , and that ’s because you do n’t have to type that much .
But one of the powers of ruby is the meta - programming , which is a bit of a hack .
But less typing means you ’ll get stuff done sooner and it ’s harder to make errors .
In Java , you ’ll have to type a lot ( even with Eclipse ) , because of the type - system ( pun intended ) .
In Haskell , the type - system is really smart , and you do n’t have to type a lot of trivial things .
The compiler will automatically deduce the types of functions for you .
So you ’ll end up having the advantages of a static typed language , but better , and having the advantages of dynamic languages , less code .
Finally , there are a lot of really smart people in the Haskell community .
There ’s lots of really advanced stuff being done , but most people are also very good writers .
Just google for “ Simon Peyton Jones “ , and read some of his papers .
Most are explaining beautiful , advanced things , and he has a really clear writing style .
Maybe he ’s one of the best , but there ’s lots of other people that write excellent programs , articles and other stuff .
So , if you feel at least the tiniest bit excitement , I can recommend that you download a haskell compiler , do some tutorials , do n’t give up and get just as excited as I am !
And do n’t forget : the best way to get to know a language is to program in it !
Now the pole — think ballet barre turned vertical — is the new star at racier versions of Tupperware parties in well - heeled ( if high - heeled ) areas like this one in the northwest hills of Morris County , about 33 miles from Manhattan .
Billed as “ femme empowerment , ” such at - home pole dancing lessons are taking place in the realm of book clubs , with mothers — and grandmothers — learning slinky moves for girls ’ nights in , bachelorette send - offs , even the occasional 60th birthday celebration .
“ I want the women to feel strong within themselves , ” explained Ms. Cottam , 29 , who teaches pole dancing at a local gym as well as at home parties .
Noting that some middle - aged suburban women lose themselves and their sense of sexuality as they are consumed by the responsibilities of motherhood , she added : “ When you come to my class you are beautiful , you are .
I want to show them that strength inside , and unleash that sexual kitten . ”
At the party here , Karen Schotanus , a 42 - year - old dental hygienist who met Ms. Cottam at a neighborhood garage sale , encouraged Carolyn DaCarolis , 52 and also a hygienist , as she practiced a tentative strut around the pole .
“ Pull out the hair tie and throw those glasses , ” said Ms. Schotanus , who had such a good time that she promised to soon plan a pole party of her own .
This intimate Friday - night soiree , where spinach dip and crudités were served and Ms. Cottam sent guests home with homemade banana muffins for their families , was for no particular occasion .
She did not charge for the lesson , but had poles — spring - loaded and adjustable from 8 to 10 feet — for sale ( $ 450 ) , as well as a variety of feathered or rhinestone platform shoes ( $ 19.99 and up ) .

Milblog : A Soldier 's Perspective
In 2009 , I had the opportunity to interview then - Vice Chief of Staff Peter Chiarelli .
We talked at length about his efforts to reduce or remove the stigma associated with a diagnosis of post traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) .
During that conversation , I made a conscious effort to challenge his assertion and began my journey to healing .
To paraphrase John Stuart Mill , “ PTSD is an ugly thing , but not the ugliest of things . ”
Failing to seek help by those that are afflicted , and mocking those have it by those that do n’t , are worse .
Seeking help was a difficult choice for me .
I was a First Sergeant at the time on a glide path to earning Sergeant Major rank .
I was one of the fastest promoted Master Sergeants in my field and I did n’t want to ruin it .
But I believed that this was just the old - school thought process .
General Chiarelli assured me the Army was changing the way it looked at PTSD .
So , with a heavy heart , I gathered my troops around and tearfully explained to them that I was stepping down as First Sergeant .
“ If I ’m going to stand up here and tell you it ’s okay to get help , ” I told them .
“ I have to be willing to get help myself . ”
I ’m forever grateful to my commander at the time , who understood and supported what I was doing .
And my wife could n’t have been more supportive .
It had been six years since I was attached to 3/7 Cavalry in the 3rd Infantry Division ( Mechanized ) for the main assault into Iraq on the evening of March 19 , 2003 .
Our task was to perform a hook maneuver and scout ahead of the division .
We raced northwest to Al Salman , then made the sharp right turn towards As Samawah .
Salman was a hilly , peaceful place .
It was apparent the Iraq military never thought we ’d head that way .
We had a few small skirmishes , but no damage or injuries were sustained .
The biggest problem we had was getting our vehicles through the rugged terrain .
Samawah would be the first time I had to fire a weapon at another human .
It was n’t pretty either .
The mujahidin were infesting Samawah .
We had outpaced most of the Division , so the fighting largely rested with us .
They played dirty , using human shields as they fired their AK47s on full auto while resting the weapons on the shoulders of women who were bleeding from their ears from the sound .
It ’s hard enough to kill a human enemy ; it ’s even harder having to kill an innocent person in order to do so .
At one point , we were stuck on a raised roadway on highway 28 to the southwest of the city .
In the distance , I heard loud booms -- incoming !
The rounds fell well short of our position , but forward observers were walking them in on us .
The tanks and infantry fighting vehicles had no problem turning 180 degrees around to retreat , but we did n’t have that luxury .
Our unarmored HMMWVs with trailers needed to perform very difficult , multi- point turns without tumbling down the high embankment .
BOOM !
BOOM !
One vehicle took a near direct hit near the canal .
We were working hard to haul ass out of the kill zone .
Then , I spotted a problem .
Just down the embankment , we had set up a hasty enemy prisoner of war ( EPW ) pit where my two interrogators were busy deciphering the defenses ahead of us and within the town .
Geneva Conventions require us to protect EPWs to the best of our ability , but we did n’t have the space to take them with us .
We could n’t just leave them there to be blown to bits , no matter how much we wanted to .
The guys we captured had surrendered without a fight because they were taken from their farmlands and forced into service by Saddam Hussein .
As I ran towards the cage , a round landed near me and blew me off the road .
When I landed at the bottom of the embankment I felt a sharp pain in my back .
Miraculously , there was no blood and did n’t appear to be any shrapnel .
Through the stabbing pain , one of my interrogators and I gave the prisoners strict instructions to run south and surrender to the next unit they saw , or they would be killed .
Once we were out of artillery range , we began tending to the casualties .
I was checked out by the medic who saw what happened and noticed I was limping .
He asked for my casualty feeder , but I refused to give it to him .
“ We need that to submit for your Purple Heart , ” he explained .
I looked around at the other troops who were injured , some badly .
“ It does n’t seem right .
I ’m able to walk and I ’m not bleeding , ” I replied .
There was no more conversation .
He issued me some ibuprofen for pain and I went back to my truck .
For the next several weeks we followed the Euphrates River northward .
The fighting was steady , at times intense , and at times barely worth the bullets .
On March 25th , we had to actually dig foxholes because the armor was needed to head off a column of Iraqi tanks headed our direction from Karbala .
Every Soldier in the unit was needed to create a defensive perimeter to protect the TOC from small arms fighters while the M1 Abrams Tanks and M2 Bradley Fighting Vehicles positioned themselves for the battle .
Visibility was barely a few feet as a major sandstorm had blown in that turned the sky dark and eerily orange .
Bullets whizzed by , mortars landed all around us , and an RPG missed our windshield by inches .
We were shooting towards the gunfire , but could n’t see our targets .
After reinforcing our position and laying claymores along the woodline , we settled into our foxhole , trying to keep warm in the frigid temperatures throughout the night .
I wrote in detail about what happened to us thereafter , and during the rest of our deployment , on my military blog , A Soldier ’s Perspective .
When I finally got to come home in late 2003 after fighting into Baghdad with 1 - 64 Armor and then over to Fallujah with 3 - 15 Infantry , something did n’t feel right .
I first noticed it a few days after I returned when I went to a Subway restaurant to get a quick lunch just outside Fort Stewart , GA .
The man in front of me ordered his sandwich and asked the young kid making the sandwich to cut it into thirds .
He ended up cutting it into quarters and the man started berating the Subway employee .
Was this guy really complaining about how his sandwich was cut , making a scene in the process ?
If that was the worst of my problems , I ’d have been overjoyed !
I had made it home by surviving brutal combat in which I had made my peace and accepted my death on three distinct occasions , only to come home to a society whose biggest problems in life were how their sandwiches were cut .
I pushed on and tried to ignore the fact that I just did n’t fit in with society .
As time went on , I became more and more angry .
I pushed people out of my life because I did n’t want to get close to anyone .
Friends die .
If I do n’t have friends , I do n’t have to worry about losing them .
I questioned how God could allow such misery , pain , suffering and loss of life .
Why was I allowed to live and people like SPC George Mitchell and SSG Stevon Booker allowed to die ?
I continued to “ suck it up and drive on , " pushing through the constant battle in my head over my self worth , and a constant stream of violent imagery that plagued me all night and when I least expected it during the day .
I needed help , but I did n’t dare ask for it .
Since 2009 , I ’ve made great strides .
I ’ve learned to let go of the survivor ’s guilt and found ways to deal with the sights , sounds , and smells that are triggers for my anxiety .
I largely self - medicated through my writing and blogging .
Thankfully , I never turned to drinking or drugs , though I thought often of just wanting to down a bottle of the cheapest liquor I could find to let go for awhile .
The problem with being honest and writing about PTSD successes and failures is that people who either do n’t understand it or have an axe to grind will use it against you .
Both types of people are dangerous to efforts made in helping troops overcome their demons of war .
Last year , I was accepted into the Warrior Combat Stress Reset Program here on Fort Hood .
Reset is a three - week , outpatient program for qualified active duty troops suffering from extreme PTSD .
The therapy combines both individual and group therapy with complimentary alternative medicine ( CAM ) , like reflexology , deep tissue massage , yoga , Reiki , and more .
That three weeks did more to help me successfully deal with the complications associated with PTSD than the previous four years of counseling alone did .
Not only did the program address the mental pain associated with combat and living in a combat environment , but it also addressed the physical pain I have suffered since that day I was blown off the embankment .
For the first time in over ten years , I got up off that bed feeling like I was floating .
I felt virtually no pain at a time when my “ normal ” pain level was about a five on a scale of one to ten .
Unfortunately , because of the time and space requirements , each three - week program can only accommodate 10 - 12 troops .
The groups are broken down into seniors and juniors , keeping senior NCOs and officers together and junior enlisted troops together to foster openness and trust .
For the first time in ten years , I no longer feel like a leper in society , constantly on guard seeking a hidden enemy in the bushes or the median of a highway .
I can better control my anger , depression , and guilt .
I ’ve also accepted that I ’ll never be able to forget the evils and perils of combat , but I can learn to live peacefully with them .
In other words , I feel human again .
I ’d like to take this opportunity to thank The Sandbox for all the hard work it has done to tell the story of our military through our eyes .
Encapsulated within the confines of this site is more honesty and reality than we will ever see in the media .
For many years ,
The Sandbox has told the stories that simply were n’t being told .
It will be missed and its presence was appreciated .
C.J. Grisham 's numerous Sandbox posts include Huggy Lady , Kaf - Tastic Killer Bunnies , How To Keep Your Soul , SSG Brian Cowdrey , Infinite Progress , SFC Zeke , A Second Knock at the Door. and An Unwelcome Christmas .
I thought I would post about famous programmers now and again because there are some names which keep on popping up as you read about programming .
The real reason I am posting is because Robert C Martin or Uncle Bob as he is known posted a comment on my blog entry " are the principles of OOD going out of fashion " .
When I saw the comment I was literally taken a back , not the Robert C Martin .
It seemed bizare , I have read 100's of his articles and read some of his books and there he is reading my blog .
The real comedy of the situation is there is n't any I can really tell without looking very sad .
Back to the topic at hand , who is Robert C Martin , well the reason I have read many of his articles on OO .
When I read the article they blew me away , the ideas were fascinating to me .
Anyway this is what Wiki says
Known colloquially as " Uncle Bob " , Robert Cecil Martin has been a software professional since 1970 and an international software consultant since 1990 .
He is founder and president of Object Mentor Inc. , a team of consultants who mentor their clients in C++ , Java , OOP , Patterns , UML , Agile Methodologies , and Extreme Programming .
From 1996 to 1999 he was the editor - in - chief of the C++ Report .
In 2002 he wrote the Agile Software Development : Principles , Patterns , and Practices which gives pragmatic advice on object oriented design and development in an agile team .
He has also published a truckload of articles on programming and software methodologies .

If you like this blog or and fancy something a bit less technical with some laughing thrown in then check out my other blog Amusing IT Stories .
Which is a blog about funny and amusing stories from the IT environment and the office .
It is a mix of news , office humour , IT stories , links , cartoons and anything that I find funny
He has wrote many many articles but the one 's I found so interesting one are under Design Principlesand I think one of my all time favourite articles ( yes I know it 's sad ) is the Open Closed Principle the beauty of these articles are they are pdf's which means you can download them and read them later .
This article Patterns and Design Principles is worth a read although it is pretty long , ( 30 pages ) so do n't be expected a quick read .
Uncle Bob does have a blog if you would care to read his more up to date musings .
The one thing which does make me laugh though is the Craftsman articles and I have blogged about this before they just are funny , it 's a funny idea but saying that I still enjoyed them .
He has also written some booksof course what he is most famous for now is leaving a comment on my blog
SAN FRANCISCO , Jan. 1 — Popular
Web sites like YouTube and MySpace have hired the equivalent of school hallway monitors to police what visitors to their sites can see and do by cracking down on piracy and depictions of nudity and violence .
So where do the young thrill - seekers go ?
Increasingly , to new Web sites like Stickam.com , which is building a business by going where others fear to tread : into the realm of unfiltered live broadcasts from Web cameras .
The site combines elements of more popular sites , but with a twist .
In addition to designing their own pages and uploading video clips , its users broadcast live video of themselves and conduct face - to - face video chats with other users , often from their bedrooms and all without monitoring by any of Stickam ’s 35 employees .
Other social networks have decided against allowing conversations over live video because of the potential for abuse and opposition from child - safety advocates .
“ The only thing you get from the combination of Web cams and young people are problems , ” said Parry Aftab , executive director of the child protection organization WiredSafety.org .
“ Web cams are a magnet for sexual predators . ”
FRESNO , Calif. , July 27 — A searing heat wave in its second week has been responsible for more than 100 deaths across California , the authorities said , with the coroner ’s office here forced to double - stack bodies .
Most of the deaths were reported in the land - locked Central Valley , the agricultural spine of the state where triple - digit temperatures have been the norm .
At least 22 deaths in Fresno County , where funeral homes have offered to help with the backlog at the coroner ’s office , have been linked to the heat .
“ We ’re just trying to catch up , ” said Joseph Tiger , a deputy coroner in Fresno .
“ I have been here 10 years and I have never seen it this bad .
Our boss has been here over 20 and he has n’t seen it this bad either .
For the last two weeks it has just been unbearable hot . ”
The governor ’s Office of Emergency Services said that statewide 53 of the people were confirmed dead by coroners as a result of the heat ; the others were presumed to have died from heat - related causes pending autopsies , said Roni Java , a spokeswoman for the office .
The warders suffered ' severe psychological injuries '
The call comes a day after six warders won over £ 1 m in compensation for witnessing the aftermath of the attack .
Inmate Jason Ricketts killed and mutilated his cellmate Colin Bloomfield in Cardiff prison in 2000 .
The warders ' solicitor , Frank Rogers , said there were mistakes made in placing Ricketts in a shared cell .
Mr Rogers told BBC News : " This man had been diagnosed as suffering a permanently incurable mental illness and yet he was left in prison and put in a shared cell .
" There is a broader issue of how the prison service deals with mentally disordered offenders who are known to be violent . "
He said the scene the six men - Darren Godbear , 44 , Nigel Thomas , 47 , Michael Wakeham , 46 , Gerald Williams , 58 , Paul Evans , 38 , and Alan Hunt , 42 - witnessed was on of " gothic horror " , beyond the experience of any prison officer .
Colin Bloomfield was strangled as he lay on a bunk bed
Ricketts had rung a buzzer and said he had killed his cellmate .
Officers discovered Mr Bloomfield 's body cut open , with organs mutilated , and the cell covered in blood .
A convicted burglar , Ricketts , from Caerphilly , who was 29 at the time , had crafted a plastic spoon with a razor blade embedded in it and sharpened the handle of a toothbrush .
It transpired that he strangled Colin Bloomfield , 35 , from Newport - a married paint - sprayer serving six months for an offence which cannot be published for legal reasons - before the attack .
Ricketts pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility , claiming a man in white in the corner of his cell told him to do it .
He was sent to Ashworth secure psychiatric unit for an unlimited time .
They were left to strip search this man and were then left - which I think was a callous disregard to their well - being - to finish their shifts for the rest of the night in blood - soaked uniforms
Solicitor Frank Rogers
Mr Rogers said the case had previously been referred to as a " Hannibal Lecter - style killing " and said the officers were exposed to a scene of " absolute horror " .
" They were left to strip search this man and they were then left - which I think was a callous disregard to their well - being - to finish their shifts for the rest of the night in blood - soaked uniforms , " he added
The warders involved are said to be still receiving medical treatment .
Three of them still work at Cardiff jail but have limited contact with inmates .
On Wednesday , the Home Office agreed to the compensation after a hearing with High Court judge Mr Justice Field .
Nigel Cooksley QC , representing the officers , said : " On the night of the killing warder Nigel Thomas attended Ricketts ' cell .
When he saw Bloomfield he called for assistance and the five others came .
" They did not know what they were going to see and went in tentatively with their staves drawn .
What they saw caused them all psychological injuries . "
" One of them was obliged to attempt resuscitation on Bloomfield despite his obvious death , " he added .
Ricketts was serving a sentence in Cardiff for burglary
Mr Rogers said that the six years it had taken for the matter to be resolved had seriously exacerbated their mental condition .
" I think it is time that not only is there an inquiry into the facts of this case but there is an inquiry into the whole issue of how the prison service and society deals with mentally disordered offenders who are dumped in the prison service , " he added .
" It is not equipped to deal with people such as Ricketts , who had a permanently incurable mental illness and was known to have a violent propensity .
" These man should be in specialist hospitals where the resources and treatment skills are designed to deal with them . "
Speaking on BBC Radio Wales , former Chief Inspector of prisons Lord David Ramsbotham said : " The whole business of the way the Prison Service sets about coping for people with these sort of problems really does need bringing out into the open . "

Can Thunderbird be far behind ?
Just seen this : - Can Thunderbird be far behind ?
Compelling reading , and I can see both points of view it will be interesting to see how it is resolved .
I like and use Firefox but I will not be too bothered if it cannot be shipped with Debian .
There are other alternatives Konq is getting better with each release .
And I expect it will be available elsewhere although I don,t know whether I would want to use it .
A Debian alternative version would mean a lot of work .
Thunderbird is a non starter for me Kmail is far better .
It looks like Mozilla , now it has a strong following , is flexing its muscles to renage on a previous agreement .

Wohnort : w3 This discussion again shows how easy it is to start a project and create free and open source software , as long as it does not become popular worldwide .
As soon as this happens , all big open source projects have been hit by trademark / copyright / licensing problems .
Debian and Mozilla are both no exception to this .
The two communities decided slightly different how to deal with these problems , and different traditions in development and management do add some pepper here .
Personally I really do n't appreciate the direction copyright and trademark laws have moved world - wide .
The wrong ones are protected now , and the ones who would need legal protection are hindered ( just look at the very case , where two nice open source projects are hindered in co-operating ) .
However , as long as we are where we are , we have to find our ways through this jungle .
I think the Debian community should stand with their principles and remove the name and logo from all mozilla products it distributes .
One of the top priorities should be securing freedom , and we are not the marketing machine for the Mozilla Foundation .
If they decided to create corporate value in trademarks and copyrights , I wish them great success - but Debian is the wrong partner to assist them in this task .
Greetings ,
Chris

To me the saddest aspect is that something which has
benifited both Debian and Mozilla should now seperate
them .
Many M$ users had not even heard of Linux and
open source until Firefox was touted as a superior
alternative to IE .
I hope that some sort of compromise
will eventually arise and draw Mozilla and Debian
together again and continue to benifit them both .
titan :
Yes thankfully we have many browser and mailer choices
within GNU / Linux .
This episode might just stir up some
competition within the developer community and give us
worthy successors to Firefox and Thunderbird .
At least this dispute does n't appear to affect the Gecko
engine which , if it did , would IMHO have a greater impact .

It 's funny , but Debian users are a lot like those people who will only buy organic food .
If a product is " tainted " because it does n't comply with their set of very strict rules , they wo n't eat it .
Even if they go hungry .

those b*st*rds ( TM ) are selling GM rice illegally in Europe , to stick with your comparison .
But I do n't get your comparison .
Debian applies changes in FF , and the MF does not like it .
It 's more like Mercedes not giving AMG the licence to call their tuned cars " Mercedes " and urge AMG to remove every Mercedes branding in the car .
But Mercedes would not dream of doing that - for a good reason .

I assume you are jesting but the reality is two leading players in the open source community can't agree over trademark and logo issues .
It is sad not funny .
The DFSG is problematic but I think is the right direction for Debian , it will be interesting what the mainstream computer press say about Debian releasing without Firefox and probably Thunderbird .
It can only be seen as an own goal for the community .
I doubt it will affect anyone anyway as there will be a non branded Debian Firefox plus Mozila Firefox will be be available elsewhere .
Having read all the e-mails in the link Mozilla come accross to me as hard nosed and arrogant and very much like the response from a commercial software company so from your simile above , yes I might be going hungry

iirc , Debian still can distribute whatever they want ( that 's the licence ) , but FF does not want the branding in it , because the MF regards the changes as a fork , as far as I understand the discussion on the mailing list .

Also I think this is a tempest in a teapot ... Debian maintainers just simply repackaged the browser into a deb

deepdayze , no , they do n't , they change the code to eliminate certain ' features ' that make mozilla products incompatible with debian security etc , the self updater for example if I remember right .
Mozilla has said over and over that they do n't really care about this problem , so debian has to fix the stuff , they have to port back security updates to older but still supported browsers which mozilla no longer supports , and much more .
While none of these changes in any way changes the core intent of the mozilla firefox branded browser , for some reason now firefox inc. has decided that it needs to apply these rules in a strict way , irregardless of intent etc .
This is so typically corporate and annoying that it 's sad , but that 's how it goes when you start feeding at that trough .
But by the rules as I read them in those exchanges , debian must not use either the firefox logo or brandname , which really sucks , firefox is a key part of what drives people to linux in the first place , so having to rename it is completely counterproductive .
And if firefox inc was n't so damned annoying about this they could have figured out a good way to work out the problem , but they are n't .
The truly sad thing is that before , when Mozilla was at mozilla.org became mozilla.com , for some reason this was not a major issue .
But now , suddenly , the dogs are sniffing around .
It 's too bad that corporate exposure has to spoil so much , this is only a sign of things to come in my opinion with the kernel as a whole if the key kernel maintainers do n't stop being so damned corporation oriented .
If I were working for or at mozilla.com , I 'd give some serious thought to just how this situation came to be , and how truly negative it actually is in larger senses , in terms of the open source landscape as a whole .
Even though they are right within the letter of the law , they are 100 % wrong in terms of the spirit of open source , which should be their primary goal .
But I guess those millions of google ad dollars somehow have changed their perceptions a bit more then they would like to admit .

That 's a very valid point , h2 .
I would like to see the Debian people sit down with the Mozilla people to work out the issues amicably .
That would be the best route .
Linux does not need all the bad blood right now .

From what I read in those threads , mozilla has no interest in working this out at all .
They only have an interest in protecting their trademarks .
This is pathetic .
Even though they give reasons like being able to defend against improper packagers of firefox , that 's nonsense , if they wanted to create a different license for approved distros they could have easily done that , but what they really want to do is protect the income generating trademark .
That reeks to high heaven of corporate types having gained voice in mozilla.com , and I have a very good idea of who at least one source of the problem is , the head wags the tail ...

What I can understand from mozilla 's side is this :
Zitat :
The key problem is that there is code , and a build switch , that
explicitly handles the official branding / logos vs. the generic
name / artwork , and the package maintainer has chosen to break this switch
by making the unofficial side of the switch also label itself as
Firefox .
I do n't understand the motivations here , since the changelog I
saw is n't visible ( packages.debian.org is still being weird ) but the
gist of it was " avoid using the official branding switch " which seems
like one of those " makes it harder to undo " steps since people actually
would have to change code instead of build options to not be bound by
those terms .
If users do n't build with the official branding , its
because they are not accepting the terms of using things bound up in
trademark law .
Doing things this way implies that only the artwork is
part of the official branding , as opposed to the name as well .
Debian maintainers have included a switch which strips out the copyrighted artwork of firefox ( which is OK ) , while maintaining the name firefox ( which is not OK ) .
And the reason is because the artwork is copyrighted .
and so ...
Zitat : I 've confirmed that this is n't acceptable usage of the trademark .
If
you are going to use the Firefox name , you must also use the rest of the
branding .
>>
Why can't you just use the official branding switch , anyway ?
>>
>
> Because it uses graphics which have a non -free copyright license .
>
This is not something where you are free to pick what parts you want to
use .
Either use the trademarked logos and name together or do n't .
The
name is trademarked in the exact same way as the logo , so I fail to see
how you can argue that one is acceptable to use and the other is not .
Maybe there 's a technicality , but the name is just as free as the logos ...
And mozilla also argues that debian logo and artwork are also copyrighted and if debian has no problems with that , why the double standards .
Debian says that while debian has a loose policy with respect to copyright logos , debian maintainers may apply their own ( stricter ) standards .
And finally there is some issue about patches being approved by mozilla before they are shipped by debian , since usage of logo and name implies and endorsement by mozilla .
But this is merely a problem of making an agreed - upon procedure work properly .
Personally I think that the discussion was interesting and very well conducted with both sides clearly recognizing the interests and concerns of the other .
Seems to me that debian should just build a debian firefox based on firefox ( call it debbiefox or something ) .
Mozilla has no objections to that .
Merely that if debian were to use the firefox name , they should use the firefox graphics as well , and if so , they should permit patches to be approved before being released .
Mozilla stomps IE
( Thanks to various people from Netscape for their help ! )
From a Mozilla servant :

OK , now , bear in mind that I 'm not a primary source here ; I just heard about it , and saw the aftermath .
But : Last night ( 9/30 - 10/1 ) at midnight , Mr. Bill 's Browser 4.0 was released .
Late last night , between midnight and 1:30 , somebody ( MS? probably ) dumped a huge IE logo on Netscape 's front lawn ( a metal shell , apparently , deep enough to stand up on its own ) .
They probably expected that we would n't notice until morning , and would n't be able to get equipment to move it until 11:00 or so , and some press cameras would come by in the meantime ; we would n't be able to bring legal action , ' cause we would n't have any proof , and we 'd just look whiny .
Well .
Needless to say , MS was dumb : they forgot that we 're * here * at midnight !
Somebody spotted it , and , rather than waste effort trying to get rid of the logo , they decided to slap MS in the face with it instead .
( Figuratively . :-)
They gathered people to help , and they tipped over the IE logo so that it was lying on its back , spraypainted " Netscape Now " on the side facing the street ... and then carried over our 7 - foot - tall statue of Mozilla ( Netscape 's Godzillaoid mascot ) and stood it up on top of the IE logo .
So now we have Mozilla standing on top of the defeated IE ( with his thumb up and a grin on his face ) , and people are wandering by and taking pictures ; it got covered in by local papers and TV , and I 've been told Reuters picked it up .
Not the sort of thing we 'd publicize on purpose , ' cause it is a little childish ... but they started it ! :-)
From Reuters :
Iraqi officials said Barzan 's beheading was an accident
The film shows Barzan Ibrahim - Saddam Hussein's half - brother - and Awad Hamed al - Bandar hanged side - by - side .
Barzan , former intelligence chief , and al - Bandar , former head of Iraq 's Revolutionary Court , were convicted over the killing of 148 Shias in 1982 .
The government said Barzan 's decapitation was accidental .
The latest hangings drew expressions of concern from among the international community .
Speaking on a visit to Egypt , US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said while the executions were an Iraqi process , " we were disappointed there was not greater dignity given to the accused under these circumstances " .
The UK prime minister 's spokesman said it was " clearly wrong " if the executions had not been carried out in a dignified way .
Others called for the Iraqi authorities to end further executions and focus on national reconciliation .
Some of the strongest reaction came from the office of UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon .
UN spokesman Michele Montas said Mr Ban " regrets that despite pleas from himself and the high commissioner for human rights to spare the lives of the two co-defendants , they were both executed " .
Hoods
The BBC's Andrew North in Baghdad says the video first shows both men being prepared for execution standing next to each other .
They were both dressed in orange boiler suits .
JUDICIAL HANGING
Execution intended to break the neck , not strangle ' Long drop ' method developed in late 19th Century Length of rope calculated using prisoner 's weight Drop is usually 4 ft - 10 ft ( 1.3 m - 3 m )
Too long a drop leads to decapitation
Iraq government statement Stances on death penalty
In quotes : World reaction
Executioners in balaclavas placed hoods round both men's heads , then the noose .
A short while later the footage , which is silent , shows both men fall .
Almost immediately the rope that was round Barzan 's neck flicks upwards , the body dropping below .
The cameraman then shows the pit below and a headless body , bloodied at the neck and what officials say was Barzan 's head still covered by a hood .
Al - Bandar 's body was still hanging above , said one official who was present at the execution .
Our correspondent says officials say they are not planning to release the footage publicly .
The two men were later buried near Saddam Hussein 's grave in the former Iraqi leader 's home village of Awja about 180 km ( 110 miles ) north of Baghdad .
Some 3,000 people , many firing guns and shouting slogans against the government , gathered at the site for the funerals , AFP news agency reported .
' No taunts '
Witnesses said Barzan and al - Bandar were shaking with fear as they approached the gallows .
One of those present , public prosecutor Jaafar al - Moussawi , told the BBC that when the trap door opened , he could only see Barzan 's rope dangling .
" I thought the convict Barzan Ibrahim al - Tikriti had escaped the noose .
I shouted that he 's escaped the noose , go down and look for him .
I went down a few steps ahead of the others to see : I found out that his head had separated from his body . "
The hangings took place at 0300 ( 0000 GMT ) , apparently in the same building in north Baghdad where Saddam Hussein was put to death on 30 December .
The manner of Saddam Hussein 's execution drew international criticism after unofficial mobile phone footage showing him being taunted and insulted in his final moments was released .
Government spokesman Ali al - Dabbagh said there were no such scenes at the hanging of his aides .
The BBC 's world affairs correspondent Mike Wooldridge says reaction in Baghdad to Barzan and al - Bandar 's executions has been mixed .
He says residents of Baghdad 's largest Shia district , Sadr City , have celebrated the latest hangings , especially Barzan's .
But other Baghdad residents have said the executions have nothing to do with the problems Iraqis face every day , our correspondent adds .
In the Shia holy city of Najaf , residents beat drums and marched in the streets at news of the executions .
THE SCIENCE OF HAPPINESS ( DANIEL GILBERT :)
When people think of " science , " they naturally think of atoms , planets , robots — things they can touch and see .
They know that subjective experiences such as happiness are important , but they believe that such experiences can't be studied scientifically .
That belief is dead wrong .
What does it take to study something scientifically ?
One word : Measurement .
If you can measure something , you can study it scientifically .
Can we measure a person 's subjective emotional experience ?
You bet .
People can tell you with both words and actions what they are experiencing — what they are seeing , hearing , smelling , thinking , and feeling — and these reports are the essential data on which the science of experience is built .
If you do n't think such reports are reliable or valid , then you should feel free to discard my research papers .
But just to be consistent , you should also discard your glasses or contact lenses , because optometry is another one of those sciences that is built entirely on people 's reports of subjective experience .
The one and only way for an optometrist to know what your visual experience is like is to ask you , " Does it look clearer like this or ( click click ) like this ? "
On the basis of your answers , the optometrist is able to create a lens that corrects your vision quite precisely .
Indeed , without your report of your subjective visual experience , optometry would be impossible .
No " objective test " — no eye test , no blood test , and no brain test — can provide this information .
In short , people can reliably report on their subjective experiences and those reports can be objectively collected and analyzed .
As long as people can say how happy they are at the moment you ask them , you can build a science of happiness .
In fact , there is no other way to build such a science .
__________________________
People often bristle at the suggestion that human behavior is merely an attempt to attain happiness .
They offer two objections .
First ( they say ) , people care about many things other than happiness — for example , truth , justice , and the American way — and thus there is more to life than happiness .
Second ( they add ) , there are different kinds of happiness — for example , the deep , moral happiness I feel when I save starving orphans is n't the cheap , bovine happiness I feel when I save money .
Both objections are wrong .
First , people clearly value many things — from the base to the sublime , from Belgian chocolate to marital fidelity — but I believe they value these things entirely because of their hedonic consequences .
Plato was very clear about this when he asked us to think about what it is that makes anything good .
" Are these things good for any other reason except that they end in pleasure , and get rid of and avert pain ?
Are you looking to any other standard but pleasure and pain when you call them good ? "
I 'm with the guy in the toga on this score .
To my mind , " positive hedonic experience " is what valuing means .
We can't say what 's good without saying what it is good for , and if you look at all the many things people think are good , you will notice they are all good for making people happy .
The second argument is also wrong .
Yes , the experience of saving money is not the same as the experience of saving orphans .
But both experiences can be described as a set of locations on multiple dimensions , and one of those dimensions is happiness .
The two experiences give rise to different amounts of happiness , but not different kinds .
The reason the experiences feel so different is that they entail different amounts of happiness as well as different amounts of everything else .
This sounds like a semantic abstraction , and it is n't .
It is a deeply important point .
Science is an attempt to replace qualitative distinctions with quantitative distinctions .
Once upon a time there were two kinds — hot and cold — and it was a huge breakthrough when scientists realized that these two kinds were simply manifestations of different amounts of molecular motion .
The same was true when scientists realized that oxygen and iron were not different kinds of stuff , but rather , were different amounts of stuff , namely , protons , neutrons , and electrons .
Similarly , different subjective experiences contain different amounts of happiness , which is a basic dimension or basic ingredient of experience .
Experiences that have different amounts of happiness can feel as different as air and iron , as different as hot and cold .
But if orphan - saving and money - saving feel different , that fact does not invalidate my claim any more than the different rigidities of iron and air invalidates atomic theory .
__________________________
For the last decade I 've been obsessed with one problem :
How well can the human brain predict the sources of its own future satisfaction ?
If the answer were " Very well , thank you , " then I 'd be out of a job .
Research suggests that I will be employed for a long time to come .
We are often quite poor at predicting what will make us happy in the future for two reasons .
First , we have been given a lot of disinformation about happiness by two sources : Genes and culture .
Both genes and cultures are self - perpetuating entities that need us to do things for them so that they can survive .
Because we are interested in our own happiness and not theirs , both entities fool us into believing that 's what is good for them is also good for us .
We believe that having children will make us happy , that consuming goods and services will make us happy .
But the data show that money has minor and rapidly diminishing effects on happiness , and that parents are generally happier watching TV or doing housework than interacting with their children .
So what happens if we try to disregard the genetic and cultural imperatives and just figure it all out for ourselves ?
What happens if we just close our eyes , imagine different possible futures , and try to decide which one would make us happiest ?
My research with Tim Wilson shows that when people try to simulate future events — and to simulate their emotional reactions to those events — they make systematic errors .
Modern people take the ability to imagine the future for granted , but it turns out that this is one of our species ' most recently acquired abilities — no more than three million years old .
The part of our brain that enables us to simulate the future is one of nature 's newest inventions , so it is n't surprising that when we try to use this new ability to imagine our futures , we make some rookie errors .
The main error , of course , is that we vastly overestimate the hedonic consequences of any event .
Neither positive nor negative events hit us as hard or for as long as we anticipate .
This " impact bias " has proved quite robust in both field and laboratory settings .
Oddly , we do n't seem to learn all that much from our own experience .
To learn from experience requires that we be able to remember it , and research shows that people are about as bad at remembering their past emotions as they are predicting their future emotions .
That 's why we make the same errors again and again .
For example , in one of our studies , Democrats predicted they'd be devastated if Bush won the 2004 presidential election , and as we always find , they were not nearly as devastated as they predicted .
But several months after the election , they remembered being just as devastated as they had expected to be .
It turns out that this is a very common pattern of memory errors .
Retrospection and prospection share many of the same biases and hence reinforce each other .
_____________________
You may think that it would be good to feel happy at all times , but we have a word for animals that never feel distress , anxiety , fear , and pain :
That word is dinner .
Negative emotions have important roles to play in our lives because when people think about how terribly wrong things might go and find themselves feeling angry or afraid , they take actions to make sure that things go terribly right instead .
Just as we manipulate our children and our employees by threatening them with dire consequences , so too do we manipulate ourselves by imagining dire consequences .
People can be so anxious that their anxiety is debilitating , but that 's the extreme case .
Anxiety and fear are what keep us from touching hot stoves , committing adultery , and sending our children to play on the freeway .
If someone offered you a pill that would make you permanently happy , you would be well advised to run fast and run far .
Emotion is a compass that tells us what to do , and a compass that is perpetually stuck on north is worthless .
People make errors when they try to forecast their future feelings .
I am often asked whether there is some evolutionary advantage to making such errors .
Sure , I can make up a story about why an affective forecasting error provides a selective advantage ( e.g. , I overestimate how bad I 'll feel if my children die , hence I go to extraordinary lengths to protect them ) .
But then you can make up a story about how it provides a disadvantage ( e.g. , I overestimate how bad I 'll feel if I am rejected , hence I fail to ask women for sex ) .
At the end of our story - telling we will have several stories and not a whole lot more .
What we need , and what we do not have , is some principled way to calculate and then compare the costs and benefits of these errors .
In the meantime and until someone convinces me otherwise , I am inclined to take the obvious positions : Errors are bad ; it is better to be able to predict the future than not ; knowing what will make us happy increases our ability to attain it ; and so on .
These do n't seem like particularly controversial claims to me .
We have great big brains that can foresee the future in a way that no other animal ever has , and in a way that our own species could not just a few million years ago .
Foresight is n't twenty - twenty , and sometimes it seems to be legally blind , but in general it allows us to glimpse the long - term consequences of our actions and to take measures to avoid the bad ones and promote the good ones .

We 're all told that variety is the spice of life .
But variety is not just over - rated , it may actually have a cost .
Research shows that people do tend to seek more variety than they should .
We all think we should try a different doughnut every time we go to the shop , but the fact is that people are measurably happier when they have their favorite on every visit — provided the visits are sufficiently separated in time .
Those last four words are the important ones .
If you had to eat 4 donuts in rapid succession , variety would indeed spice up your experience and you'd be wise to seek it .
But if you had to eat 4 donuts on 4 separate Mondays , variety would lower your overall enjoyment .
The human brain has tremendous difficulty reasoning about time , and thus we tend to seek variety whether the doughnuts are separated by minutes or months .
__________________________
Even in a technologically sophisticated society , some people retain the romantic notion that human unhappiness results from the loss of our primal innocence .
I think that 's nonsense .
Every generation has the illusion that things were easier and better in a simpler past , but the fact is that things are easier and better today than at any time in human history .
Our primal innocence is what keeps us whacking each other over the head with sticks , and it is not what allows us to paint a Mona Lisa or design a space shuttle .
It gives rise to obesity and global warming , not Miles Davis or the Magna Carta .
If human kind flourishes rather than flounders over the next thousand years , it will be because we embraced learning and reason , and not because we surrendered to some fantasy about returning to an ancient Eden that never really was .
We demonstrate that Haskell as it is , with no TH or other pre-processors , can rather concisely represent semi-structured documents and the rules of their processing .
In short , Haskell can implement SXML ( ssax.sourceforge.net ) , right in its syntax and with the * open * and extensible set of `tags ' .
The benefit of Haskell is of course in static type guarantees , such as prohibiting an H1 element to appear in the character content of other elements .
It also seems that the specification of various pre-post - order and context - sensitive traversals is more concise in Haskell compared to Scheme .
Again , we are talking about the existing Haskell , i.e. , Haskell98 plus common extensions .
No Template Haskell or even overlapping instances are required .
The features of our framework are : - extensibility : at any time the user can add new `tags ' and new transformation / traversal modes .
- static safety : there are no dynamics , and no variant data types for elements or attributes , and thus no possibility of a run-time pattern - match failure .
- static guarantees : the framework statically ensures that a `block - level element ' cannot appear in the inline ( i.e. , character ) content and that a character - content entity cannot appear in a pure element content .
Some entities ( e.g. , `title ' ) may be either element or attribute .
OTH , many other entities may not occur in the attribute context .
Thus the generated XML or HTML document will not only be well - formed : it would also satisfy some validity constraints .
More validity constraints can be added to the framework .
- flexibility of the traversal : the same document can be transformed in pre- , post - , accumulating or other ways , even within the same session .
A document can be processed in a pure function , or in a monadic action , including an IO action .
In the latter case , we can , e.g. , verify URLs as we generate an HTML document .
A `tag ' can be transformed depending of the transformation modes and tag 's context : e.g. , the same `( title " title " ) ' expression may appear as an attribute or an element -- and it will be rendered differently by the ( X ) HMTL serializer .
- pleasant syntax , which closely resembles SXML .
We can write ( p " string " " string1 " br " string3 " ) without unnecessary commas and other syntactic distractions .
We take polyvariadic functions to the new level ( pun intended ) .
We also exploit functional dependencies on a per-instance level -- which is a very useful but , alas , rarely used technique .
We introduce two frameworks for representing semi-structured data in Haskell .
In one , semi- structured data is truly a heterogeneous structure -- and so can be showed , stored , written and read .
In the second approach , semi-structured data are represented as a monadic value , polymorphic over the rendering monad .
Different choices of the monad give different views of data .
In GHC , this amounts to representing semi-structured data by linked dictionaries ; in JHC , both approaches are probably equivalent .
The first representation is quite reminiscent of HList ; the second has clear SYB3 ( ``Scratch your boilerplate with class ' ' ) overtones , although the realization is quite different .
In particular , there is no need for recursive instances .
Because of the amount of code involved ( to describe common HTML tags and their constraints ) , this message is not the complete code .
The code is available from http://pobox.com/~oleg/ftp/Haskell/HSXML.tar.gz
Please see the files HSXML.hs , HSXML_HTML.hs and the sample code sample1c.hs for the data - centric framework .
The monad - centric framework is in one self - contained file CSXML.hs .
The first framework is more in line with SXML , and so will be considered here .
Our running example , inspired by the Haskell.org web site , is : test_haskell = ( document ( head [ title " Haskell " longdash " HaskellWiki " ] [ meta_tag [ description " All about the language " br " Haskell " ] ] ) ( body [ h1 " Haskell " ] [ div ( attr [ title " titleline " ] ) [ p [ [ a ( attr [ href ( FileURL " /haskellwiki/Image: Haskelllogo.jpg " ) ] )
" Haskell " br " A < purely functional > language " ] ] br ] [p " Haskell is a general purpose , " [ [em [ [ strong " purely " ] ] " functional " ] ] " programming language " ] ] ) )
We should point out the absence of commas .
The [ [ x ] ] syntax can be replaced with a simple [ x ] , but that would require overlapping instances .
So far , we have avoided overlapping instances .
Incidentally , in many Scheme systems ( and , reputedly , in R6RS ) square brackets are taken to be synonymous to the round ones .
We see that the |br| can be used in various contexts : in the character content of an element and of an attribute ( cf. `description ' for the latter ) .
However , if we try to replace " Haskell " within the `description ' attribute with [ [ em " Haskell " ] ] we get an error that Could n't match ` CT_attr ' against ` CT_inline '
Expected type : CT_attr Inferred type : CT_inline OTH , the string " Haskell " that appears within |h1| element may be replaced with [ [ em " Haskell " ] ] .
However , if we try to enter ( h1 [ [ h1 " Haskell " ] ] ) we get type error Could n't match ` CT_inline ' against ` CT_block '
Indeed , the element | H1 | is not allowed in the `inline ' context .
We can transform the test_haskell data structure in many ways ( e.g. , extract all the titles , renumber sections , etc ) .
We can also render it in HTML .
The result is quite predictable : <! DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional //EN " " http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd " > < head > < title > Haskell — HaskellWiki</ title > < meta name =" description " content =
" All about the language Haskell " ></ meta > </head > < body > < h1 > Haskell </h1 > < div title= " titleline " > < p >< a href= " /haskellwiki/Image:Haskelllogo.jpg " >
Haskell < br> A < purely functional > language </ a> < br > </p> < p >Haskell is a general purpose , < em >< strong > purely </strong>functional</em>programming language </p> </div > </ body >
We should note that |title| -- which can be either an element or an attribute -- is indeed rendered differently depending on the context .
Just to emphasize the extensibility of the framework , we show how easy it is to add new elements .
For example , the `tags ' |longdash| , |a| , |div| and |title| are not defined in the base file HSXML.hs .
We add these tags in sample1c.hs , as follows :
Let us start with an abbreviation for the long dash .
It may appear in the character content of an element or an attribute > data LongDash = LongDash deriving Show > longdash :: Check_ia LongDash ct => HW ct LongDash > longdash = HW LongDash > > -- and how to render it in HTML > instance RenderInline ( HW ct LongDash ) where > render_inline f _ = emit_lit " — " >> return f
Actually , the latter instance describes rendering of longdash in any | MonadRender m| -- any monad that defines morphisms |emit| , |emit_elem| and |emit_attr| .
Anchor is an inline element with an inline content > data Anchor a b = Anchor a b deriving Show > a attrs body = > build ( as_inline .
HW .
Anchor ( as_block attrs ) . rev'apppend HNil ) > nil_inline body > > instance ( Render a , RenderInline b) => RenderInline ( HW ct ( Anchor a b ) ) where > render_inline f ( HW ( Anchor attrs body ) ) = > emit_elem " a " [ ]
( Just ( render attrs ) ) ( render_ib body ) > >> return False
Title can be either - a block - level element whose content is CT_inline - an attribute ( whose content is , therefore , CT_attr ) > newtype Title a =

It seems many of the SXML transformations ( cf. the `examples ' directory of the SSAX distribution or CVS repository , ssax.sf.net ) can be rendered in Haskell .
More examples are forthcoming .

The popular Coca - Cola drink is now banned in Kerala
The government of Kerala , a state in southern India , has banned the production and sale of both Coca - Cola and Pepsi after the Centre for Science and Environment , a NGO , found high levels of pesticide residue in the popular soft drinks .
Kerala is the first state to impose a complete ban on the production and sale of the drinks , but five other states have said they will introduce partial bans in hospitals , schools and colleges .
Chief minister V. S. Achuthanandan , CPI ( M ) , said the two companies had been asked to wind up their operations , meaning the closure of a Pepsi and a Coca - Cola plant in the state .
The Indian Soft Drinks Manufacturers Association issued a statement saying : " Our products manufactured in India are absolutely safe and meet every safety standard set by food health and regulatory bodies in India and all over the world . "

It 's often claimed that solutions to difficult problems can come to you when you 're thinking of something entirely different .
Physicist Veit Elser from Cornell University is a case in point : he accidentally found a recipe for solving Sudoku puzzles while trying to take pictures of really small things .
The algorithm he and his colleagues developed for a microscopy technique called x-ray diffraction microscopy can solve any Sudoku puzzle you care to throw at it .
This in itself is n't a new thing .
Algorithms for solving Sudoku have been around for a long time .
But in realising that the difference - map algorithm he and his colleagues developed to analyse waveforms — in this case light waves — can double up in this way , Elser shed new light on how amazingly versatile the algorithm could be .
" As a personal benefit , " Elser says , " I can now explain to the person on the street what I do ! "
The reason the difference - map algorithm works for both Sudoku and for creating images of tiny things ( such as single cells ) is that both reduce to solving problems whose solutions must satisfy two independent rules , or constraints .
In Sudoku , these constraints are easy to pin-point .
One way of phrasing them is : fill the numbers between 1 and 9 into a 9 by 9 grid so that
each number appears exactly once in each row and column , and
each number appears exactly once in each 3 by 3 sub - grid .
This is a version of Sudoku designed by Elser 's algorithm .
Your task is to fill the letters from A to Y into the 25 by 25 grid so that every letter appears exactly once in each row , column and 5 by 5 sub - grid .
The solution will spell out the name of one of the founders of Cornell University .
In fact , there are many other problems that fit a similar pattern .
In producing a time table for university lectures , for example , you are constrained by the availability of lecturers and lecture theatres .
If there are exactly two constraints that are independent of each other , then there 's a good chance that the difference - map algorithm will do the trick .
" There are a lot of problems that you can represent in terms of this language , " says Elser .
" We 're providing the technique .
Whatever people use it for , it 's great for us . "
But how does creating an image of something such as a single cell lead to a " two constraint puzzle " ?
Really small objects can't be captured by an ordinary microscope because they are smaller than the wavelength of ordinary visible light .
In x-ray diffraction microscopy the object to be imaged is therefore bombarded with x-rays , which have a much finer wavelength .
The way the light is scattered , or diffracted , by the object then contains the information needed to recreate a magnified image .
If you were using an ordinary microscope the job of re-assembling this information to give an image would be achieved by a lens .
This is impossible if the object is too small .
All you can do is measure the scattered rays directly , and then re-combine them using a mathematical process called Fourier synthesis .
Fourier synthesis relies on the fact that any waveform can be expressed as the sum of individual sine and cosine functions .
These constituent functions each have their own frequency , amplitude and phase ( see figure 1 ) .
If you know what these are , you can re-construct the original waveform simply by adding up its constituent parts .
In our example of x-ray diffraction , the constituent waves come from the scattered rays , which you measure , and adding them up gives a waveform which you use to create the image .
Figure 1 : a sine wave of the form a sin( bx+c ) has amplitude a , frequency b and phase c .
The blue graph represents the wave sin( x +π / 2 ) , the green graph represents the wave sin( 3x ) / 3 , and the red wave represents their sum .
The problem is that when you are measuring the scattered rays , you lose vital information about their phase .
If you simply resort to guess work , and randomly compute the phases in some way , then you are likely to end up with a meaningless image , or noise as mathematicians call it .
Just like randomly filling numbers into a 9 by 9 grid is unlikely to give you the solution to a Sudoku puzzle .
What you need are extra clues : rules that the phases have to obey .
" People used to say that 's an impossible problem , " Elser says .
" Then people got to thinking about the fact that there are going to be constraints coming from some rather mundane facts — that in principle will make the problem of deducing the phase like the solution of a solvable puzzle . "
And the constraints here turn out to be very mundane indeed : one of them simply comes from the fact that the object in question has a well - defined boundary .
In any image of the object , nothing should appear outside of that boundary , in other words , the pixel values there should be zero .
" If I set up waves with known amplitudes and synthesize them , I 'll find that for essentially all random combinations of phases , the thing I get is an object not confined , " Elser says .
" It takes a very clever combination of the phases of all those waves to add up to something in only one region ; and cancel out everywhere else . "
The other constraint seems even more obvious : the waves you feed into your Fourier synthesis mechanism should have the amplitudes you have measured in your scattered waves .
With these two constraints in place , the imaging problem becomes a puzzle that Elser 's algorithm can solve , just as it can solve any Sudoku puzzle .
It will chomp through the calculations and spit out exactly those phases that give the correct image .
Elser and colleagues have already used the algorithm to produce images of a single yeast cell , which have been published in a paper in the Proceedings of the national academy of sciences .
And where does all this leave Sudoku maniacs ?
The existence of a clever new algorithm probably wo n't cure them of their disease ... unless they are true mathematicians : they often lose interest in a problem as soon as they know that a solution exists , even if no - one knows what that solution is !

GRAPHIC VIDEO - Lebanese Doctor Says ' Phosphorus Weapons ' Cause Suffering RAW STORY
Published : Monday July 24 , 2006 Print This | Email
This [ A note to readers :
This news report , originally aired on CNN International , contains graphic images . ]
CNN video correspondent , Karl Penhaul , follows a family that had been mistakenly caught in an Israeli air strike .
The doctor treating the family says that there is phosphorus in the weapons that cause extremely painful burns on its victims .
A tough California bill that would have prohibited companies and individuals from using deceptive " pretexting " ruses to steal private information about consumers was killed after determined lobbying by the motion picture industry , Wired News has learned .
The bill , SB1666 , was written by state Sen.
Debra Bowen , and would have barred investigators from making " false , fictitious or fraudulent " statements or representations to obtain private information about an individual , including telephone calling records , Social Security numbers and financial information .
Victims would have had the right to sue for damages .
The bill won approval in three committees and sailed through the state Senate with a 30 - 0 vote .
Then , according to Lenny Goldberg , a lobbyist for the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse , the measure encountered unexpected , last - minute resistance from the Motion Picture Association of America .
" The MPAA has a tremendous amount of clout and they told legislators , ' We need to pose as someone other than who we are to stop illegal downloading , ' " Goldberg said .
Consequently , when the bill hit the assembly floor Aug. 23 , it was voted down 33 - 27 , just days before revelations about Hewlett - Packard 's use of pretexting to spy on journalists and board members put the practice in the national spotlight .
Legislature records confirm that the MPAA 's paid lobbyists worked on the measure .
An aide to Bowen , who was forced out of the legislature by term limits and was elected Secretary of State , said the MPAA made its displeasure with the bill clear to lawmakers .
" The MPAA told some members the bill would interfere with piracy investigations , " the aide said .
The association " does n't want to hamstring investigators . "
The MPAA declined to comment for this story .
California went on to pass a much more narrow bill that bans the use of deceit to obtain telephone calling records , and nothing else .
A similarly tailored bill languished in Congress this year , despite high - profile congressional grillings of senior HP employees .
Sean Walsh , past president of the California Association of Licensed Investigators and an investigator for 27 years , said his group opposed SB1666 because it was too vague and would have tied the hands of investigators looking into insurance fraud , child support cases and missing children .
" There 's a public reason and benefit for some of this information to be available to legitimate licensed investigators , " Walsh said .
" Should it be available to everyone out there ?
Probably not .
There are people that have legitimate need for getting this information in terms of an investigation , enforcing a court order and helping to return a child .
Those are all very legitimate reasons and by excluding that you do grave disservice to the average citizen and to large corporations . "
Walsh also said groups like the MPAA and the Recording Industry Association of America hire investigators who use pretexting to ferret out copyright infringers , such as vendors on the street who are selling bootleg copies of CDs or DVDs .
In that case , investigators may use some ruse to find out where the discs originated .
( Records do not indicate that the RIAA had a position on the bill . )
Ira Rothken , a prominent technology lawyer defending download search engine TorrentSpy against a movie industry copyright suit , says he did n't know about the lobbying , but can guess why the MPAA got involved .
Rothken is suing ( .pdf ) the MPAA for allegedly paying a hacker $ 15,000 to hack into TorrentSpy 's e-mail accounts .
" It does n't surprise me that the MPAA would be against bills that protect privacy , and the MPAA has shown that they are willing to pay lots of money to intrude on privacy , " Rothken said .
" I do think there needs to be better laws in place that would deter such conduct and think that it would probably be useful if our elected officials would not be intimidated by the MPAA when trying to pass laws to protect privacy . "
For his part , private investigator Walsh , whose current firm specializes in protecting the privacy of corporate clients , said he hopes lawmakers in 2007 take their time .
" Everyone wants a quick fix , but they do n't see the ripple effect until much later , " Walsh said .
" Our organization has been successful at educating legislators by saying , ' Wait a minute , but look at how it effects X , Y and Z. '
They have to see those tangents so that if they are going to go ahead and pass legislation , they do it in a responsible and educated way . "
Are there any current metrics available for programmatic complexity ?
For example , there are computational complexity classes for different types of programs , and big-Oh notation for runtime complexity of different algorithms , but is there a measure of how hard it is to actually program a given task in a given system ?
For example , let 's say the task is converting a list of numbers representing miles into kilometers .
In C++ , the code would be something like
float * miles_to_kilometers ( float [ ] mile_list , int length ) { float * kilo_list = new float [ length ] ; for ( int i = 0 ; i < length ; i++) { kilo_list [ i ] = mile_list [ i ] * 1.61 ; } return kilo_list ;
In Perl , it would be something like :
sub miles_to_kilometers { my @result = map { $ _ * 1.61 } @ {$ _ [ 0]} ; return \@result ; }
My intuition would be that the Perl version would have a lower programmatic complexity because the loop is built - in rather than explicitly coded .
Is there a metric available that evaluates such propositions ?
First I want to say that I owe a debt of gratitude to the LtU community for the generous help I 've had in developing the type system for Cat .
Two threads last month were particularly helpful for me : http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/1879 and http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/1899.
So thank you very much to everyone who contributed to these threads ( and previous ones as well ) .
I have been working hard on writing an article to present the Cat language formally , but I still lack confidence in my approach to presenting the type system .
I felt that it would be useful in a paper which presents the semantics of Cat to demonstrate an implementation of the typed SK calculus .
One burning question I have is whether such an endeavour would add value to the paper ?
Below is a synopsis of how I am planning on presenting the type system and SK calculus in the paper .
For the purposes of this post I only show the type derivation of the K combinator , since the S combinator is much longer .
The r stands for the row variable ( rho or ρ ) .
pop : ( r 'a -> r ) dup : ( r 'a -> r ' a ' a ) swap : ( r 'a 'b -> r 'b ' a ) dip : ( r 'a 'b ( ' a -> ' c ) -> r 'c 'b ) diip : ( r 'a 'b 'c ( ' a -> ' d ) -> r 'd ' b ' c ) EDIT eval : ( r 'A ( 'A -> ' B ) -> r ' B )
These are attributed to Andreas Rossberg .
--------------------------------------------
( EMPTY ) T :- empty : ( r ) ->( r ) T( x ) = forall a 1..an A1..Am.t
-------------------------------------------- ( VAR ) T :- x : t[t1/a1 ]..
[ tn/an ] [r1 /A1 ]..[rm / Am ]
-------------------------------------------- ( CONST ) T :- c : ( r ) ->( r prim ) T :- p : t -------------------------------------------- ( QUOTE ) T :- [ p ] : ( r ) ->( r t) T :- p1 : ( r1 ) ->( r2 ) T :- p2 : ( r2 ) ->( r3 ) -------------------------------------------- ( COMPOSE ) T :- p1 p2 : ( r1 ) ->( r3 )
T :- p : ( r A ) ->( r B ) ----------------------------------------
( T- EVAL ) T :- [ p ] eval : ( r A ) ->( r B ) T :- p : ( r A ) ->( r B ) ----------------------------------------
( T- DIP ) T :- [ p ] dip : ( r A 'c ) ->( r B 'c ) T :- p : ( r A ) ->( r B ) ----------------------------------------
( T- DIIP ) T :- [ p ] diip : ( r A 'c 'd ) -> ( r B 'c 'd )
K is implemented as " [ pop ] dip eval " .
The derivation is :
pop : ( r0 'a0 -> r0 ) 0
---------------------------------------------------- T- DIP [ pop ] dip : ( r1 'a1 ' b1 -> r1 ' b1 ) , eval : ( r2 ' A2 ( ' A2 -> ' B2 ) -> r 2 ' B2 ) 1 ---------------------------------------------------- COMPOSE [ pop ] dip eval : ( r1 'a1 'b1 -> r2 ' B2 ) , r1 ' b1 = r2 ' A2 ( ' A2 -> ' B2 ) , 'b1 = ( ' A2 -> ' B2 ) , r1 = r2 ' A2 2 ---------------------------------------------------- UNIFY [ pop ] dip eval : ( r2 ' A2 ' a1 ( ' A2 -> ' B2 ) -> r 2 ' B2 ) 3 ----------------------------------------------------
SIMPLIFY [ pop ] dip eval : ( r ' A 'b ( ' A -> ' C ) -> r ' C )
What I am hoping for are suggestions on how I can better present the semantics of Cat in a way which would be appropriate for a " serious " paper , but also would make sense to relative newcomers to type theory .
Thanks in advance !

TWO years ago next month space travel underwent its Wright - brothers moment with the first flight of SpaceShipOne .
The roles of Orville and Wilbur were played by Burt Rutan , who designed the craft , and Mike Melvill , who flew it — although they were ably assisted by Paul Allen , one of the founders of Microsoft , who paid for it .
Of course , history never repeats itself exactly .
Unlike the brothers Wright , who were heirs to a series of heroic failures when it came to powered heavier - than - air flight , Messrs Rutan and Melvill knew that manned spaceflight was possible .
What they showed was that it is not just a game for governments .
Private individuals can play , too .
Now , lots of people want to join in , and most of them have just met up at the International Space Development Conference in Los Angeles , to engage in that mixture of camaraderie and competition that characterises the beginnings of a new technology .
And , as might be expected , they are brimming with two of the necessary ingredients of success : ideas and money .
First , the money .
So far , more than $ 1 billion is known to have been committed to building private spaceships and the infrastructure to support them .
For example , Mr Rutan 's follow - up vehicle , SpaceShipTwo , is expected to cost its backers , Virgin Galactic , $ 240 m for a fleet of five .
The spaceport in New Mexico from which these are intended to fly will account for another $ 225 m , although New Mexico 's government is planning to raise this money itself .
These are not small sums , of course .
On the other hand , Virgin Galactic has already banked $ 14 m of deposits towards the $ 200,000 fare from people who want to travel on SpaceShipTwo , even though it has yet to be built , let alone flown .
All this suggests that spaceflight , if not exactly entering the age of the common man , is at least entering the age of the moderately prosperous enthusiast .
For entrepreneurs , it is no longer necessary to have billions of dollars to get into space ; millions will now do .
And for those who merely wish to travel there , and have a few hundred thousand in the bank , reality beckons — provided that at least one of the ideas actually works .
Chocks away
As with aircraft a century ago , a plethora of designs are competing with each other , and there is no certainty about which will prevail .
The initial goal is to build a “ suborbital ” vehicle .
This will not have to develop the tremendous speed needed to go into orbit around the Earth .
Instead , it will travel briefly into space , offering a short thrilling ride out of the atmosphere , a few minutes of weightlessness , and a spectacular view of the planet from about 100 km .
Four important criteria are how you take off , what fuel you use , what your craft is made of , and how you come back .
Most people 's vision of a rocket launch is straight up from the ground .
But , of the five vehicles most likely to be developed ( see table ) , two will actually be launched from the air .
SpaceShipTwo will be carried to high altitude by a purpose - built aircraft known as Eve before its rocket motor is ignited .
And Explorer , a vehicle being designed by Space Adventures , will be launched from the top of a high - altitude Russian research plane called the M - 55X , according to Eric Anderson , the firm 's president and chief executive .
As Dennis Jenkins , a consultant engineer at NASA , America 's space agency , points out , this is similar to using a two - stage rocket to get into space , with the aircraft acting as the first stage .
However , a plane offers several advantages over a throw - away booster rocket .
First , it can be used again .
Second , it uses oxygen from the air , rather than having to carry its own oxidant , which saves weight .
Third , it is lifted by wings .
That means the atmosphere is an advantage , rather than a hindrance .
All this means that the spacecraft itself can be lighter and cheaper .
Not everyone wants to run two vehicles , though .
Jeff Greason , president of XCOR Aerospace , a firm based in Mojave , California , is developing a two - person , ground - launched suborbital rocketplane called Xerus .
Launching from the ground , says Mr Greason , is more difficult than air launching , but he reckons that in this case it has significantly lower operating costs .
AFP
The second important design choice is the type of fuel .
Unlike a jet engine , a rocket carries its own oxidant .
This is why it can operate in space .
Sometimes that oxidant is oxygen itself , in liquid form .
In that case the fuel , too , is usually liquid — either kerosene or liquid hydrogen — and the two liquids are stored in separate tanks until they meet in the rocket 's combustion chamber .
Alternatively , both fuel and oxidant are solid , and are loaded pre-mixed , like the propellant of a firework rocket .
SpaceShipTwo , though , follows the design of SpaceShipOne and is powered by a hybrid of the two .
The combustion chamber of a hybrid is partly filled with solid fuel but no oxidant .
However , the fuel is coated round the inside of the chamber , leaving a hole through the middle into which a liquid or gaseous oxidant can be pumped , and out of which the exhaust emerges .
In SpaceShipOne , the fuel was rubber and the oxidant a liquefied gas called nitrous oxide .
Proponents of hybrids say they are safer than either pure solid or pure liquid rockets .
George Whittinghill , Virgin Galactic 's chief technologist , says that they are safer than solid rockets because the flow of oxidant can be controlled , and combustion halted , if there is a problem .
Solid rockets , like the fireworks they resemble , cannot be stopped until they run out of fuel .
On the other hand liquid - fuelled engines , though they can be shut down , are complex and temperamental .
As Mr Whittinghill observes , “ they have pumps , seals , valves and lines everywhere , and there is a lot that potentially could go wrong . ”
All this rather irks those working on liquid propulsion .
Richard Pournelle , head of investor relations at XCOR Aerospace , says the comparison is unfair .
Liquid propulsion is routine in rocketry while hybrids are still rare .
Numbers alone , therefore , mean that liquid - fuelled rockets blow up more often .
That , Mr Pournelle argues , does not prove that they are inherently unsafe .
Chuck Lauer , vice - president of business development for Rocketplane , another firm going down the liquid - fuelled route , agrees and argues that kerosene is widely used as aviation fuel and nobody complains that it is unsafe .
Nor is safety the only issue .
For , while hybrids may be cheaper to develop , they are more expensive to run .
That is because they need to have new fuel - lined combustion chambers fitted after each flight .
By contrast , liquid refuelling is so easy that XCOR plans that its ships will make four trips a day .
In addition , according to Mr Pournelle , rubber fuel is five times more expensive than the kerosene that it and Rocketplane plan to use .
Liquid fuel is also more powerful and burns more evenly .
As to what the craft are made of , composites have been the most popular choice , because they are light , strong , easy to work with and able to cope with the heat of re-entry .
One notable exception , though , is Rocketplane 's entry , the XP , which is an extensively converted Learjet .
At first sight , the notion of converting an executive jet into a spaceship might seem rather dangerous .
However , as Mr Lauer explains , there is very little left of the original aircraft except the fuselage .
“ Starting with the existing Lear gave us a frame of reference to be able to build from and saved us a year in terms of schedule , ” he says .
The craft has a new delta wing and a new v-tail .
Wind - tunnel studies show it has “ natural stability ” on re-entering the atmosphere , according to Mr Lauer .
Which leads to the fourth crucial design feature : a safe landing .
SpaceShipOne solved the problem of stability on re-entry by flipping its wings in half .
Mr Lauer claims the XP 's natural stability , means it has no need for such reconfiguration — though some of his critics are sceptical about this .
Finally , the XP 's wings , tail and nose cap are made of titanium , a heat - resistant metal , and the rest of the structure is covered with a thermal - protective paint to enable the aluminium it is made of to cope with high temperatures .
The next step , says Mr Lauer , is to test the XP to destruction — to find out how and when it fails .
That leaves Blue Origin , a firm backed by Jeff Bezos , the founder of Amazon.com .
Unlike everybody else 's crafts , Blue Origin's New Shepard spaceship is designed for vertical take - off and landing ( VTOL ) .
And that is weird .
To infinity and beyond
Like the other craft under development , New Shepard is , according to its backers , intended for suborbital flights .
However , if this is really all that Mr Bezos is interested in , a VTOL vehicle is about the most difficult way of going about it .
One way of explaining this curious design choice would be if Mr Bezos ultimately intended to produce an orbital vehicle .
He would n't be alone .
Elon Musk , a co-founder of PayPal , is hoping to do the same thing by first creating a satellite - launching business around a new , unmanned rocket , the Falcon .
And Armadillo Aerospace , based in Mesquite , Texas , and backed by John Carmack , a rich game - designer , is tinkering with a VTOL suborbital vehicle design in the hope of building an orbital vehicle one day .
These VTOL suborbital designs might reap some monetary benefits sooner than their backers had thought .
This week , while researchers were bemoaning the forthcoming slashing of NASA 's scientific budget in favour of the agency 's manned programme , yet more riches were coming forth for human spaceflight .
A prize of $ 2 m was announced for NASA 's Lunar Lander Analogue Challenge .
It will go to a vehicle with the energy and accuracy ( though obviously not the overall spaceworthiness ) needed to land on the surface of the moon .
This will need a VTOL spaceship , which can take off , hover and land on a rocky site .
The first competition for this prize will be held in Las Cruces , New Mexico , in October this year during an event called the X - Prize cup .
This is a series of about 30 rocket races that will be held on a three - dimensional track in the sky — like Formula 1 racing on steroids .
It is the brainchild of Peter Diamandis , the founder of the X - Prize , a $ 10 m purse won by SpaceShipOne as the first reusable suborbital vehicle .
Mr Diamandis 's long - term goal is for his rocket racers to race right into space .
On the way to this goal , he hopes that this annual event — like the Formula 1 races which inspired it — will make a great deal of money .
He also reckons that a “ Darwinian explosion ” of suborbital designs is emerging .
Each design , it seems , has its own merits .
Several are expected to start test flights soon .
Which will be first to market is unclear .
Some may run out of funding .
But with spaceships now costing less than a Formula 1 racing car , and having the interest of a variety of deep - pocketed investors , it should n't take that long .
0 Dating strategies for the introvert
Are you energized by spending time alone ?
In meetings , do you need to be asked for your opinions and ideas ?
Do you tend to notice details that other people miss ?
Is your ideal celebration a small get - together , rather than a big party ?
The good news is , you 're an introvert .
Here are some tips to help you work with , instead of against , your temperament while dating .
Make the first meeting short , e.g. , have coffee or a drink .
Suggest a specific start and stop time .
Meet at a neutral location so you can leave if you want .
Use your good observational skills to gain information about the person .
Reveal as much personal information as the other person does , within reason .
Take a bathroom break or two if you 're feeling anxious or overexcited .
Do n't try to be extroverted
Don't rely on alcohol or drugs to help you loosen up .
Do n't overextend yourself ; watch your energy level .
Notice if you are getting irritable and think about why .
Do n't push yourself to have physical contact ; you need time to feel comfortable .
Look for red flags , such as how he or she handles conflict .
Note whether you think he or she is too passive or too aggressive .
Pay attention to any uncomfortable feelings you have , such as anger , fear , or boredom .
Think about what messages these feelings are sending you .
It 's time that introverts realize just how unique and special they are .
We are ripe for a cultural shift toward the acceptance of introversion .
It 's all right for us to stop trying to fit in and to " shape up . "
We need to appreciate our own shape as it is .
If you can walk a quarter - mile , odds are you have at least six years of life left in you , scientists announced today .
And the faster you can do it , the longer you might live .
While walking is no guarantee of health or longevity , a new study found that the ability of elderly people to do the quarter - mile was an " important determinant " in whether they'd be alive six years later and how much illness and disability they would endure .
" The ability to complete this walk was a powerful predictor of health outcomes , " said study leader Anne Newman of the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine .
" In fact , we found that the people who could not complete the walk were at an extremely high risk of later disability and death . "
Newman and colleagues recruited nearly 2,700 white and African - American men and women aged 70 to 79 to complete in non-running races .
All the participants were screened and determined to be in relatively good health , and they had all said they had previously walked that far with no problem .
However , only 86 percent of them finished .
The scientists then monitored the health and mortality of all participants for the next six years .
" There was a big gap in health outcomes between people who could complete the longer walk and people who could not , with the latter being at an extremely high risk of becoming disabled or dying , " Newman said .
" What was really surprising is that these people were not aware of how limited they actually were . "
Finishing times were found to be crucial , too .
Those who completed the walk but were among the slowest 25 percent faced three times greater risk of death than the speedier folks .
The study is detailed today in the Journal of the American Medical Association .

We are a country and a world in the middle of a car crash , but the car crash takes place in such slow motion that we have gotten used to living in a car crash .
All .
The .
Time .
There are so many different fronts to fight on that it is easy to just throw up your hands .
The damage that has been done is immense , and continues day by day .
How much do we even notice anymore as the slow creep continues ?
Am I just whining ?
Yup .
The only thing I can think of to do is stop the folks who are perpetuating it .
Impeaching Bushco .
It wo n't solve all the problems , things wo n't magically be better , but where do we take a stand ?
Can we really count on ' others ' to stop it ?
Congress is doing just about all they can right now , slugging their way through the hedgerows and fortifications that the Republicants have had twelve years to construct and fortify .
We elected them , they are doing their job .
What else can be done ?
What power do we have ?
What can WE do ?
If only to ease our own pain and frustration through action ?
Soon , Congress will have come to a point where they have to decide what to do .
They will be through the initial fight on the non-binding resolution .
A necessary but sure to be fruitless effort .
Then it will be time for them to hear from the people .
Then it will be time to raise our voice .
We The People
All we have is our Voice .
And each other .
And a place to stand and Yell Louder !!!
How many voices does it take to affect change ?
How many United Voices will it take to do something like .....
De-fund the War in Iraq ?
Stop War with Iran ?
Or even .... Impeach .
Let 's find out .

I have taken a keen interest in Web 2.0 and the powerful network effect that many of these new web sites are attempting to generating .
Since I ’m a stock investing blogger , I have been watching how this new online development is effecting the investment landscape .
Web 2.0 is finally starting to have an impact on stock investing sites , so I decided to research the competitors in this space .
Web 2.0 sites “ … emphasize online collaboration and sharing among users . ”
Tim O’Reilly recently noted , “ This is what I ’ve elsewhere called ‘ harnessing collective intelligence . ' ”
Many Web 2.0 sites have the potential to harness the network effect that occurs when a service becomes more valuable to its users the more other users utilize it .
In terms of business and investing , the network effect provides one of the most powerful and durable competitive advantages .
I have been trying to harness this network effect of Web 2.0 with my recent Value Investing News project .
To better address my value investing community niche , I decided to research the top Investing 2.0 sites .
I first spotted the “ Investing 2.0 ” phrase at TechCrunch .
Over the past year , TechCrunch has reviewed three investing 2.0 sites , including Stockpickr , Motley Fool Caps , and Zecco .
Based on those stories , the comments on those stories , and my own research , I pulled together the following list of top stock investing 2.0 sites .
Top Stock Investing 2.0 Sites
The Top Stock Investing 2.0 Sites list is sorted by Alexa Traffic Ranking .
I know that the Alexa Ranking can be gamed and is only based on the web surfing habits of its toolbar users .
Therefore , I ’ve also included Google PageRank scores to also provide an indicator of how influential each site is on the web .
Please let me know if I have missed any sites .
I may update the above table with additional metrics and revised statistics in the future .
The top Investing 2.0 site on the list is Motley Fool Caps .
However , the Alexa Traffic Ranking for Motley Fool Caps , which is on subdomain caps .
fool.com , includes all the traffic for the fool.com domain name as well .
Alexa captures all the traffic on a domain and does not break out subdomain statistics .
Basically , this means that the new Stockpickr site could in fact be the king of the Investing 2.0 hill .
I am very happy that my niche social bookmarking site , Value Investing News , has come in tenth place .
The site has only been running for about four months , has no financial backing , no professional programming talent , and focuses on likely the smallest online investment community , value investors .
Given all those handicaps , a top ten ranking between ValueWiki and Feed the Bull is great .
I feel that many of the stock picking sites will eventually run into trouble , even though right now many of them contain excellent discussions .
Herd mentality and stock pumping could really hurt members of those sites .
Social bookmarking sites that focus on news and commentary will likely have more longevity .
At least that is what I hope , since Value Investing News is primarily a social bookmarking site focused on linking to high quality investment analysis .
What are you favorite Investing 2.0 sites ?
I of course love Value Investing News ( user name : George ) .
You can also find me on Motley Fool Caps , Stockpickr , and Marketocracy .
Feel free to share your user names and profiles on these sites with the rest of the Fat Pitch Financials community by leaving a comment below .
Compiler Optimization Of MechAssault 2 By Kyle Wilson
Saturday , January 22 , 2005 MechAssault 2 is finally on shelves .
Though we lost sleep over performance issues right up until the very end , the reviews are quite positive regarding frame rate .
Xbox Addict says that the game " surprisingly , despite the serious graphical upgrade to the game engine , does n't chug on the frame - rate . "
IGN says , " The framerate is generally solid . "
GameZone reports that " the game trucks along at a great framerate . "
This is all something of a miracle considering that a few weeks before we mastered , the first scene the player saw when the game started ran at a tortuous fifteen frames per second .
How did we get from 15 fps to 30 fps ?
Or , put in the way budget - conscious game programmers are comfortable with , how did we get our frame time down from 66 ms to 33 ms ?
One of our kick - ass gameplay programmers , Nate Payne , did a slew of tweaks to speed up ray casting , and to avoid updating unseen objects .
I added a new " costs " profile which would measure and display the total time cost for a particular type of templated game object to execute or for a particular model to render , and how many of those game objects or models were being processed .
That data gave our designers the information they needed to tune critical models and to figure out which enemies to hide or spawn them in later .
Most of our speed - up , I admit , came from data changes .
But by changing our compiler optimization settings , we also squeezed out a significant performance gain -- nearly 10 % -- that was basically free .
More importantly , on a console with only 64 megs of memory , the same settings saved us over a megabyte and a half of memory .
Exception Handling
The first thing I did was to turn off exception handling ( remove / EHsc ) .
Although we catch exceptions in our unit tests , the MA2 game itself does n't use exception handling at all .
We include some Boost library code that could conceivably throw an exception , but nothing that our code does with Boost ought to trigger those exceptions .
If they occur , they 're every bit as much of a bug as a divide by zero or a null pointer dereference , and the game will crash just as hard .
I think we left MA2 pretty nearly crash - free .
In principle I prefer exception handling to error codes .
Exceptions save you a lot of wrapping of functions in FAIL_RETURN macros and allow you to signal errors in constructors , which is very awkward in a error - code system .
But exceptions do have cost .
If you enable exception handling , the compiler will build a look - up table for your entire program indicating what local objects need to be destroyed at any point of any function , if an exception occurs at that point .
Before I started tweaking our compiler settings , the amount of memory consumed by our code and associated global and static variables -- what we called our " module size " -- was 11241 K .
That was the amount of memory that had been used when main ( ) was first entered .
After turning off exception handling , that number went down to 10501K , for a savings of about 700K .
In an input - recording demo I used for profiling throughout my tweaking of compiler options , frame rate improved by about 1 % .
Because we use Boost , I had to add our own empty definition for boost :: throw_exception .
And I added a # pragma warning ( disable : 4530 ) to turn off the warning letting me know that exceptions were , in fact , off , but that some of our external libraries were still trying to throw .
That 's okay .
We do n't pretend to handle exceptions .
Link - Time Code Generation
Next , I turned on link - time code generation ( / LTCG ) , or whole program optimization ( WPO ) .
Whole program optimization does an extra optimization pass over your compiled program , optimizing not just within a single translation unit ( cpp file / obj file ) , but across translation units and even across statically - linked libraries .
As far as I can tell from VC ++
Program Manager Kang Su Gatlin's PowerPoint slides on the subject , the primary optimization that LTCG does is identify pointers which are free of aliasing .
Aliasing occurs when multiple pointers may point to the same memory location .
Because the compiler cannot know that the locations are distinct , it may be forced to write a register value back to memory , then re-read another memory location for another compiler access .
The more possible occurrences of aliasing you have in your code , the less the compiler is able to optimize .
With WPO , the linker can search for usage of a particular pointer variable across function calls to determine whether aliasing can actually occur .
Whole program optimization is very , very slow .
With it enabled , our link times for FINAL builds on MA2 ( the build target that we actually ship ) jumped to over fifteen minutes .
Our code size grew by 130K .
But our performance improved by another 6.5 % .
Turning on whole program optimization did uncover several bugs that had undefined behavior .
Without WPO , these had somehow not crashed .
With WPO , they did .
In one case , a member function call was being made through a pointer to uninitialized memory .
In several other cases , it was assumed that arrays on the stack were identical to their own addresses .
That is , it was assumed that memset ( & charArray , 0 , sizeof ( charArray ) ) would have the same effect as memset ( charArray , 0 , sizeof ( charArray ) ) .
This is not guaranteed by the standard , and appears to change under WPO .
Optimize for Size or Speed ?
I 've read a number of times that changing compiler settings to optimize for size ( / O1 ) rather than optimizing for speed ( / O2 ) can actually make a program faster .
The theory is that most modern applications are hurt more by cache misses than by straight - up code execution time , and the less space the code takes up , the fewer cache misses will occur .
But every time I 've tried setting my options to minimize size , my code has gotten slower .
MA2 was no exception .
When I changed all our libraries to / O1 , performance dropped by about 5 % , although the code did shrink to a trim 8673 K in initial size , two megs smaller than the with the / O2 option .
Adrian Stone , our graphics programmer , suggested that I try switching most of our libraries back to optimizing for speed and keep the " optimize for size " setting on our two most bloated libraries .
Both libraries are game - level code full of game - specific entity definitions .
They took up a great deal of space in terms of code , but took a relatively small fraction of memory for allocated objects at runtime which in turn took a relatively small fraction of our execution time .
Most of our profile is spent in scene hierarchy update and rendering set - up .
With that change -- two libraries optimized for size , the rest for speed -- our performace jumped to 8.2 % faster than my original profile and our initial code and data size edged back up to 9597 K , or 1644 K smaller than when I 'd started .
I experimented with switching other libraries back and forth , but every other change made performace worse .
Apparently I 'd lucked onto the ideal settings right away .
Any opinions expressed herein are in no way representative of those of my employers .
According to the Muslim calendar , today -- February 12 -- is the one year anniversary of the bombing of Samarra ’s Golden Dome Mosque .
The blast is frequently pointed to as the event which transformed the conflict from an armed struggle against foreign occupation into a civil war .
This change in the narrative has had some real benefits for the Bush administration by diverting attention from the nonstop fighting between American troops and the Sunni-led resistance .
The notion that Iraq is in the throes of civil war is rarely challenged in the western media despite the fact that Iraq has no history of the type of sectarian violence which is now ripping the country apart .
Veteran journalist Robert Fisk put it this way :
“ Iraq is not a sectarian society .
People are intermarried .
Shiites and Sunnis marry each other …Some from the militias and death squads want a civil war ( but ) there has never been a civil war in Iraq .
The real question I ask myself is : who are these people who are trying to provoke a civil war ?
The Americans will say that it ’s al Qaida or the Sunni insurgents ; it is the death squads .
Many of the death squads work for the Ministry of Interior ?
Who pays the militia men who make up the death squads ?
We do ; the occupation authorities . ” ( Robert Fisk , “ Somebody is trying to provoke a Civil War in Iraq ” )
So , if we accept the idea that Iraq is in a civil war , are n’t we ignoring the fact that other forces may be at play just below the surface ?
There ’s no doubt that the Bush administration is engaged in a secret war in Iraq .
A great deal has already been written about “ the Salvador Option ” which involves the arming and training of death squads for spreading terror among sympathizers of the resistance .
But it is also likely that many of the bombings we see are , in fact , false flag operations intended to pit Arab against Arab , and thereby undermine the greatest threat of all , Iraqi nationalism .
False flag operations are commonplace in foreign occupation .
Robert Fisk cites a few examples in his article , “ All This Talk of Civil War , Now This ” ( UK Independent , 2006 ) :
“ I think of the French OAS in Algeria in 1962 , setting off bombs among France 's Muslim Algerian community .
I recall the desperate efforts of the French authorities to set Algerian Muslim against Algerian Muslim which led to half a million dead souls .
And I 'm afraid I also think of Ireland and the bombings in Dublin and Monaghan in 1974 , which , as the years go by , appear to have an ever closer link , via Protestant " loyalist " paramilitaries , to elements of British military security . ”
It ’s impossible to know how much of the violence we see is real and how much is “ black - ops ” .
Divide and rule is an adage that is as old as war itself and it is certainly being used in Iraq .
In fact , the Bush administration commissioned the Rand Corporation to draw up a plan which promotes this very strategy .
The Rand Study was called : “ US Strategy in the Muslim World after 9 - 11 ” .
The document provided “ A framework to identify major ideological orientations within Islam , examines critical cleavages between Muslim groups . ”
The goal of the paper was to develop a Shaping Strategy for pacifying Muslim populations where the US has commercial or strategic interests .
The conclusions of the document are enlightening .
Rand suggests the US , “ Align its policy with Shiite groups who aspire to have more participation in government and greater freedoms of political and religious expression .
If this alignment can be brought about , it could erect a barrier against radical Islamic movements and may create a foundation for a stable U.S. position in the Middle East . ”
Clearly , the administration is following the recommendations Rand study and has decided elevate the Shiites over the previously dominant Sunnis .
The Bush administration also appears to be applying parts of another theory which was conjured up by the fiercely nationalistic , Oded Yinon , in his “ The Zionist Plan for the Middle East ” .
Yinon said :
" It is obvious that the above military assumptions , and the whole plan too , depend also on the Arabs continuing to be even more divided than they are now , and on the lack of any truly mass movement among them ...
Every kind of inter-Arab confrontation will assist us in the short run and will shorten the way to the more important aim of breaking Iraq up into denominations as in Syria and Lebanon ...
Syria will fall apart . "
Similar to the Rand study ’s recommendations , Yinon ’s strategy is to pit Sunni against Shiite in a way that destroys Arab unity and to leaves the country weak and fragmented .
Again , there ’s nothing new in these theories , but we should realize that much of the media narrative is crafted in a way that conceals the truth while promoting the objectives of the US occupation .
Beyond the smokescreen of “ civil war ” ( some of which is real , of course ) is a coherent and carefully articulated plan to quash the resistance and steal Iraq ’s resources .
That is the real force which is generating much of the violence that we see on the ground .
In practical terms , Robert Fisk provides a credible description of how these black - ops are executed in Iraq .
In his article , “ Seen through a Syrian Lens ” ( UK Independent 4- 29 - 06 ) the Fisk gives the details of a conversation he had with a trusted “ security source ” who told Fisk that : ( the US ) “ is desperately trying to provoke a civil war around Baghdad in order to reduce its own military casualties . ”
" I swear to you that we have very good information , " Fisk recounts , " One young Iraqi man told us that he was trained by the Americans as a policeman in Baghdad and he spent 70 per cent of his time learning to drive and 30 per cent in weapons training .
They said to him : ' Come back in a week . '
When he went back , they gave him a mobile phone and told him to drive into a crowded area near a mosque and phone them .
He waited in the car but could n't get the right mobile signal .
So he got out of the car to where he received a better signal .
Then his car blew up . "
As incredible as it seems , Fisk assures us that he ’s heard the same story many times from different sources .
Again :
" There was another man , trained by the Americans for the police .
He too was given a mobile and told to drive to an area where there was a crowd - maybe a protest - and to call them and tell them what was happening .
Again , his new mobile was not working .
So he went to a landline phone and called the Americans and told them : ' Here I am , in the place you sent me and I can tell you what 's happening here . '
And at that moment there was a big explosion in his car . "
Fisk is a hardnosed journalist not easily given to exaggeration .
His account of these incidents simply adds to the growing body of “ hearsay ” evidence that US intelligence agencies are directly involved in inciting sectarian violence .
These stories cannot be corroborated , but , of course , that has n’t stopped many Iraqis from believing that the US is behind the daily bombings .
Of course , the question of “ who ” is funding and facilitating the terrorism in Iraq presents a serious challenge to an administration that has based its foreign policy in terms of a war on terror .
Public support would quickly erode if the American people knew that Bush was directly involved in the same activities as our nemesis , al Qaida .
Traditionally , the United States has no problem supporting Islamic extremists as long as they serve our overall foreign policy objectives .
The CIA funded the mujahideen in Afghanistan , the KLA ( Kosovo Liberation Army ) in Kosovo , and now provides material support and weaponry to the MEK Mujahideen -e- Khalq ; a Marxist militant group which is on the State Dept list of terrorist organizations .
What matters is not ideology but whether or not the groups can advance Washington ’s imperial aspirations .
This demonstrates that Bush ’s finger - wagging against “ ideological extremism ” or “ radical Islam ” is just more empty rhetoric .
Ideology plays a very small part in the current war .
Dick Cheney ’s comments in a speech to the Institute of Petroleum in London in 1999 may shed a bit of light on this point .
He said , “ By 2010 we will need on the order of an additional fifty million barrels a day .
So where is the oil going to come from ? ...
While many regions of the world offer great oil opportunities , the Middle East with two thirds of the world 's oil and the lowest cost , is still where the prize ultimately lies . "
While depletion of oil reserves have accelerated beyond Cheney ’s expectations at the time ;( the world ’s 4 largest oil fields are in a state of irreversible decline ) the facts remain the same .
The world is running out of oil and the US intends to deploy its military to seize vital reserves wherever they may be .
The war on terror is simply the mask that conceals this ongoing struggle .
The Bush administration seems less and less concerned that their “ divide and rule ” strategy remains hidden from the public .
There ’ve been a number of articles in the mainstream press about Bush ’s $ 86 million gift to Mahmoud Abbas ’ to train and equip special shock - troops to crush the democratically - elected Hamas government .
And , there ’s been ample coverage of the CIA ’s covert operations in Lebanon that are directed against Hezbollah .
The only conclusion we can draw from this , is that Bush really does n’t care anymore if the world knows that the US is purposely fueling the anarchy which is quickly spreading across the entire Middle East .
( The latest accusation that Iran is supplying roadside bombs to the Iraqi resistance just shows how sloppy the administration has gotten in managing its propaganda .
Iran , of course , is Shiite , whereas , the Iraqi resistance is predominantly Sunni .
The likelihood that Iran is providing roadside bombs to the former members of Saddam ’s army is remote to say the least . )
Bush ’s “ dirty war ” in Iraq has become increasingly violent and confused .
The neocon trust in “ creative destruction ” has succeeded in fragmenting Iraqi society , but the long - term prospects for normalization ( or resource extraction ) appear bleak .
At this point , it seems irrelevant whether the bombing of the Golden - dome Mosque was the work of Sunni extremists or the US intelligence agencies .
After all , propaganda may be useful for shaping public opinion but it cannot win wars .
And that is the dilemma that Bush now faces .
It has been exactly one year since the Askirya Mosque was flattened .
Most Americans now believe that we are mired in an " unwinnable " war .
Public support is eroding , the violence is escalating , the administration is drifting sideways , and the end is nowhere in sight .
The inability of the administration to think politically or change course has thrust America to the brink of its worst defeat in history .
Google is known to the world as a search engine , but in many ways it is foremost an effort to build a network of supercomputers , using the latest academic research , that can process more data — faster and cheaper — than its rivals .
" Google wants to raise the barriers to entry by competitors by making the baseline service very expensive , " said Brian Reid , a former Google executive who is now director of engineering at the Internet Systems Consortium in Redwood City , Calif .
The rate at which the Google computing system has grown is as remarkable as its size .
In March 2001 , when the company was serving about 70 million Web pages daily , it had 8,000 computers , according to a Microsoft researcher granted anonymity to talk about a detailed tour he was given at one of Google 's Silicon Valley computing centers .
By 2003 the number had grown to 100,000 .
Today even the closest Google watchers have lost precise count of how big the system is .
The best guess is that Google now has more than 450,000 servers spread over at least 25 locations around the world .
The company has major operations in Ireland , and a big computing center has recently been completed in Atlanta .
Connecting these centers is a high - capacity fiber optic network that the company has assembled over the last few years .
Google has found that for search engines , every millisecond longer it takes to give users their results leads to lower satisfaction .
So the speed of light ends up being a constraint , and the company wants to put significant processing power close to all of its users .
Microsoft 's Internet computing effort is currently based on 200,000 servers , and the company expects that number to grow to 800,000 by 2011 under its most aggressive forecast , according to a company document .
Computer scientists and computer networking experts caution that it is impossible to compare the two companies ' efforts directly .
Yet it is the way in which Google has built its globally distributed network that illustrates the daunting task of its competitors in catching up .
Imagine a situation where you are in a particularly glossy and dizzying shop that offers specific goods that are very difficult to say no .
Probably , each of you was even at such a moment and not once in your life .
This is perfectly normal considering the commercial world in which we live and the ways of advertising that make us buy more and more things we sometimes do not really need .
These are situations that we must be able to get out of , although there is evidence that a person often makes decisions to purchase a good or service unconsciously .
That ’s when mistakes happen .
Whether you stand in front of a stand with expensive next - generation mobile phones , though you already have it or you choose to have dinner at a restaurant that is too expensive , you are often on the brink of making the wrong purchasing decision .
It is very important that we succeed in building our ability to judge in a real situation what we actually need and what we do not .
That would save us from the financial traps of everyday life that are lurking at every step .
What are the typical case scenarios that would make us spend unexpected amounts on things we do not need at the moment
Furniture and home decoration that are not needed right now .
Anyone could stomp on a beautiful couch or table with the idea of ​​replacing the old ones who actually still do a great job .
By being able to judge the situation well , we will certainly take the more logical and less emotional solution ;
Do not spend money at the pace your friends and the people around you spend .
This is a huge trap in which we can get caught up and then we regret sorrow .
The most important thing in such a case is to think soberly and to impose budget constraints if needed ;
Do not overdo it by buying large amounts of food that you do not need .
Frequently excessive spending of money on food and beverages in the supermarket can mislead you and knock at unnecessary costs to become a harmful habit .
Sometimes we do not just overtake the quantity , but also the kind of products we choose by making it more expensive without thinking soberly whether we actually need them and whether this cost would not detrimentally affect the weekly or monthly budget .
Such types of emotional costs are often taken under the influence of a certain feeling and are as often unnecessary and erroneous .
This does not mean that we do not have to provide goods and services that rejoice and make life more pleasant , but in any case it is appropriate to keep in line with our budget and the real needs we have in everyday life .
This way , we will ensure stability in cost planning and a decent balance that can not break the personal or family bank account .

To pay for World War II , Americans bought savings bonds and put extra notches in their belts .
President Harry Truman raised taxes and cut nonmilitary spending to pay for the Korean conflict .
During Vietnam , the US raised taxes but still watched deficits soar .
But to pay for the ongoing wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , the US has used its credit card , counting on the Chinese and other foreign buyers of its debt to pay the bills .
Now , as President Bush is promising to boost the number of troops in Iraq , there is increased scrutiny over how the US is going to pay for it all .
The US is spending about $ 10 billion a month on Iraq and Afghanistan .
By the end of this year , the total funds appropriated will be nearly $ 600 billion – approaching the amount spent on the Vietnam or Korean wars , when adjusted for inflation .
However , the actual impact of the war on the economy is different than in the past , largely because the US economy is so much bigger now .
During World War II , some analysts calculate that the US spent as much as 30 percent of its gross domestic product ( GDP ) on the war effort .
The Korean War , at its spending peak in 1953 , represented 14 percent of GDP ; Vietnam was about 9 percent .
The current war , however , is less than 1 percent of America 's annual $ 13 trillion GDP .
Payment due : in the future
The US can certainly afford the war , says budget analyst Stan Collender , a managing director of Qorvis Communications in Washington .
But the spending is taking resources from other areas , he notes .
Because the US is borrowing to finance the war , the cost will be borne by future generations .
" And it 's still going to be one of the most expensive wars we have ever fought , " he says .
Unlike in previous major wars , the United States has cut taxes at the same time it has increased military spending .
" It 's fair to say all of the money spent on the war has been borrowed , " says Richard Kogan , a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities , a think tank in Washington .
" But eventually everything has to be paid for . "
Congressional questioning
Congress hopes to hold hearings on the financial implications of the war before the president releases his budget proposal for fiscal year 2008 on Feb .
5 . Democrats , now in the majority , plan to ask a wide range of questions , from the future costs of the war to how those costs should be budgeted .
" We wo n't balance the budget in one year .
The best we can expect is five years , " says Rep. John Spratt ( D ) of South Carolina , the new chairman of the House Budget Committee , in a phone interview .
" But we need to know : What is the bar we need to reach ? "
Estimating the budget deficit has become more difficult in recent years because the White House has funded much of the war through emergency supplemental bills , which are not included in the federal budget .
According to a Congressional Research Service report , it is a practice that other administrations have employed since the Korean War .
This year , the White House is expected to ask for another $ 100 billion in supplemental war funds , but Representative Spratt says he would like to get the war back on the budget since it can be argued the war is no longer an emergency .
" Calling it an emergency means the spending does not get the scrutiny , " he adds , because then the spending is reviewed by only one committee – House Appropriations .
In addition , he says , emergency spending is exempt from caps on discretionary spending .
This has prompted the military to include in the bill items that are not directly related to the war .
Making the spending a part of the budget would end the practice of some members placing pet projects on a bill that must be passed , he says .
A war - by - war cost comparison
Numbers are fuzzy on how much has been spent so far on the global war on terror .
According to the House Appropriations Committee , some $ 471 billion has been committed so far .
Spratt says it 's closer to $ 507 billion .
By the end of this year , on a cash basis , the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan will be closing in on the costs of the Vietnam War ( $ 650 billion in today 's dollars ) and the Korean War ( $ 691 billion ) .
Some analysts believe the cost of the war is much higher than Congress estimates .
In a study last January and updated in October , Harvard Prof. Linda Bilmes and Columbia Prof.
Joseph Stiglitz estimated the budgetary and economic cost of the war at $ 2 trillion .
Ms. Bilmes , in a phone interview , says Congress looks only at its cash outlays , not at the war 's future costs .
For example , she says , an estimated 42,000 light trucks are in use in Iraq .
Although it costs something to run them , the major cost will be replacing them .
" That 's not factored into the cost of the war , " she says .
The same is true of the cost of taking care of injured veterans in the future .
" After our study came out , what surprised us is that the VFW , the Vietnam Vets , and others said , ' Thanks for shining the spotlight on this issue , but your numbers are too low , ' " Bilmes says .
After working with the vets , she concluded that the future costs of caring for the wounded were much higher than she had estimated .
Just the cash costs alone have mushroomed over the past two years , says Steve Kosiak , an analyst at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments , a think tank in Washington .
He estimates that Congress has appropriated nearly $ 300 billion during that period .
" Perhaps some of the additional cost is for repairing the equipment , " he says .
" But it 's fair to say it 's partly a mystery why it 's up so much . "
Polls show people are concerned about the war , says Dennis Jacobe , chief economist at the Gallup Organization in Washington .
But , he adds , " they are not concerned about the cost . "
This is partly because of the way the war is funded through the supplemental budget process , Mr. Jacobe says .
But it 's also because the war has not disrupted the economy the same way past wars have .
" It 's really had no significant impact except for the deficit spending , " he says .

According to reports in Aaj TV news and The Nation , legendary football superstar Zinedine Zidane – perhaps the greatest player of modern football – will be visiting Pakistan in March this year .
The main purpose of the visit is to raise funds for special children in Pakistan and he will also visit earthquake affected areas .
He will be coming to Karachi , Lahore and Islamabad for charity dinners .
This is part of Zidane ’s worldwide charity tours and he visited Algeria recently , Bangladesh in November 2006 and now coming to Pakistan .
This vist is being arranged by famous French - Pakistani fashion designer Mahmood Bhatti who comes to Pakistan every year to raise money for charity .
According to The Nation :
Bhatti said he had planned ZidaneÃƒÂ ¢Ã¢â€ šÂ¬Ã¢â€ žÂ¢s visit to help improve PakistanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€ šÂ¬Ã¢â€
žÂ¢s image in the world .
ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€ šÂ¬Ã…â€
œWe all need to contribute in every way we can to improve PakistanÃƒÂ ¢Ã¢â€ šÂ¬Ã¢â€ žÂ¢s image in the world .
There should be no politics when this national interest is at stake .
ÃƒÂ ¢Ã¢â€ šÂ ¬Ã…â€ œI believe all well - known Pakistanis living abroad should be approached by the government and asked to contribute in the development of country .
They should be honoured and given recognition for their services , ÃƒÂ ¢Ã¢â€ šÂ¬Ã‚ ?
he said .
… After the quake tragedy Bhatti raised Rs 15 million by organising a dinner at the residence of Pakistani ambassador in Paris .
Bhatti has no outlet for his label in Pakistan .
He , however , is ready to give franchise here if he found the right business people .
Bhatti now comes to Pakistan only for charity reason .
For two years in a row he has been holding shows here to raise funds for charity Umeed - e - Noor that takes care of special children .
By the way , the company “ Bhatti ” , with more than 500 designers , operates in Finland , India , Poland , Taiwan , Japan , Switzerland , Germany , the US and the UK ; and through which he has transacted multi-million dollar transatlantic business over more than three decades .
On Zinedine Zidane , the story in The Nation points out :
Two times worldÃƒÂ ¢Ã¢â€ šÂ¬Ã¢â€ žÂ¢s best player and three times EuropeÃ ƒÂ ¢Ã¢â€ šÂ¬Ã¢â€ žÂ¢s best player Zidane led his team to win the 1998 World Cup held in France .
In 2006 again he led his team to finals of World Cup .
One of the best soccer players in history , Zidane , earlier this month visited Algeria – the country of his parents – where he was awarded a tumultuous welcome by the government and people and a three - day holiday was declared .
Being a football fan , I have loved watching Zidane do magic on football pitch .
In all those 10 years or so I have watched him play in Spanish La Liga and Italian Serie A , I have never seen anyone move with football like Zidane .
It is unfortuate that some people remember him because of that head butt incident in 2006 World Cup final but I will always remember him for the great things he did on the football pitch .
Watch this and this clip on youtube and you will agree with me .

Virus is ... a forum for rational discourse a memetically engineered nontheistic religion a synthesis of religion and evolution the best possible conceptual framework for living and thinking a neo-cybernetic philosophy for the 21st century Darwin 's dangerous idea out of control an extended phenotype of the Virion Council Goal
Virus was created to compete with the traditional ( irrational ) religions in the human ideosphere with the idea that it would introduce and propagate memes which would ensure the survival and evolution of our species .
The main advantage conferred upon adherents is Virus provides a conceptual framework for leading a truly meaningful life and attaining immortality without resorting to mystical delusions .
Overview
Virus is a collection of mutually - supporting ideas ( a meme - complex ) encompassing philosophy , science , technology , politics , and religion .
The core ideas are based on evolution and memetics because one of the primary design goals was survivability through adaptation ( religions die , not because they grow old , but because they become obsolete ) .
If a new religion is designed around the premise of continuously integrating better ( more accurate , more useful ) concepts while ensuring the survival of its believers , it could conceivably achieve true immortality .
For a quick overview , here are some brief answers to big questions .
" The Man Who Never Was " Launches Operation Mincemeat ( April 30 , 1943 ) Today in Odd History , a Spanish fisherman discovered the body of Major William Martin , a British Royal Marines courier .
There was a briefcase attached to the dead man 's wrist , which contained personal correspondence and documents related to the impending Allied invasion of Sardinia , in Greece .
Spanish authorities notified the Germans , who moved quickly to fortify the Greek coast , leaving Sicily almost completely undefended .
This was exactly what the Allies had intended .
" Major Martin , " also known as " The Man Who Never Was , " was an unwitting player in one of the greatest military hoaxes of World War II .
The Allies had been planning an invasion of Sicily ( and not Sardinia ) for some time .
Sicily , however , is mountainous , and therefore easier to defend than to attack .
It is also so strategically located that the Germans were almost definitely expecting an attempt to dislodge them from it .
And the buildup of troops and equipment that would be necessary for the invasion were certain to attract attention .
If " Operation Husky , " as the invasion was known , was to be a success , rather than a slaughter , the enemy 's command must be led astray .
Squadron Leader Sir Archibald Cholmondley , of the British Intelligence interservice XX Committee ( XX for double cross ) suggested that a set of false plans should be planted on a dead man , who would deliver them into the enemy 's hands .
This obviated any concern that the chosen spy could turn out to be a double agent , as well as ensuring that he would n't break under torture and confess whatever he knew about the true nature of his mission .
Cholmondley entrusted the details of the mission to Lieutenant Commander Ewen Montagu of Naval Intelligence .
It was Montagu 's idea that " Martin " should appear to have drowned , probably after his plane crashed off the coast of Spain .
This necessitated finding a corpse whose lungs were already full of fluid , so that any doctors who examined the body would accept that he had been at sea for some time .
He found a 34 - year - old man who had recently died of pneumonia brought on by ingesting rat poison .
The man would have been dead for some time before he fell into enemy hands , but the effects of salt water upon the corpse would disguise the inevitable decomposition .
Intelligence secretaries pitched in to write love letters to " Martin , " and one of them even donated a picture of herself in a swimsuit -- ostensibly a photo of the dead man 's fiancee , Pam .
Cholmondley carried the letters in his wallet for several weeks , to give them an authentically worn appearance .
" Martin's " personality was further enhanced by an irate letter from his bank manager , a stern letter from his father , a few overdue bills , a replacement military I.D. card , matchbooks , theatre tickets , keys ...
All the personal detritus of a likable young man who might be somewhat careless in his personal affairs ( and thus more likely to wind up face - down on a beach in Spain ) , but who was doubtless quite good at his job .
These items went into the briefcase with the documents that told of the Allies ' plans to invade Sardinia .
" Operation Mincemeat , " as Cholmondley had dubbed his master plan , was well under way .
All that remained was to escort poor " Major Martin " into enemy territory .
The body was packed in dry ice , and put aboard the British submarine HMS / M Seraph , under the command of Lieutenant Commander N. A. " Bill " Jewell .
Just off the port of Huelva , Lt. Jewell said a short prayer , and Seraph gave " Major Martin " into the arms of the sea .

Electric cars were once widely touted as the solution to all our pollution ills and energy concerns .
Now they 're not .
A new documentary asks what happened ?
The General Motors EV1 had a top speed of 80 mph .
It had a range of over a hundred miles .
It could do 0 - 60 mph in under eight seconds .
And it was an electric car .
Not a milk float or a rinky - dink little two - seater runabout , but a normal car , and a milestone in the development of the electric vehicle , something that could swing the battle against air pollution in California .
And yet the ignominious demise of the GM EV1 is charted in a new film , Who Killed the Electric Car ?
In his documentary , film - maker Chris Paine , says cynical and conspiring car makers and oil firms , as well as apathetic consumers and weak government and regulators , helped end the electric dream in California .
THE GM EV1 Leased : 800 EV1s
Top speed : 80 mph 0 - 60 mph : 8 seconds
The development of the car by GM came as California brought in the zero emission vehicle regulation in 1990 which aimed to have 10 % of all cars sold by 2003 give off no pollution .
The film accuses lobbyists working for the motor manufacturers of getting the regulation watered down until eventually , it was no longer necessary to make electric cars .
Indeed , GM was one of two car markers which sued the California regulators to repeal the emission mandate .
GM leased 800 EV1s , starting in 1996 , and celebrities like Tom Hanks and Mel Gibson were among its fans .
But even they could n't save the EV1 .
In 2003 , GM scrapped the programme , and insisted the cars be returned .
Most were crushed .
Activists and former owners - including Baywatch star Alexandra Paul - picketed a yard where doomed EV1s were being stored .
But all efforts to buy the cars were rebuffed by GM .
GM said it could not sell the EV1s as this would make it liable for safety and continued maintenance of the cars , which would cost it money .
European fear
It and other car - makers argued they had poured hundreds of millions into creating electric cars but saw little evidence of demand from consumers , and did nothing underhand .
The lawmakers said other technologies offered a better chance to cut pollution , and changed the regulations to promote fuel cell cars , hybrids and other low emission vehicles .
And opponents of electric said increased power generation would cancel out the benefits from reducing petrol use .
Please - Ford , Nissan et al - do n't just force - feed Europeans with worthy but nerdy little eco-shoppers designed to deter mainstream car - buyers
EVUK
And yet over in Europe it is not exactly as if the concept of the electric car is alive and kicking .
On EVUK , a campaigning website , there is a plea to car manufacturers .
" Please - Ford , Nissan et al : do n't just force - feed Europeans with worthy but nerdy little eco-shoppers designed to deter mainstream car - buyers . "
Instead of the EV1 , UK drivers might cast their minds back to the Ford Think , fully launched in 2001 .
Available to lease for £ 80 a month under a subsidised scheme , they were city run-arounds , much less ambitious than the EV1 , with a short range and a restricted top speed .
When bodies like the Metropolitan Police , who had two , leased a Think , there was much trumpeting of environmental credentials .
And yet Ford pulled the plug on the Think just a year after its launch .
The company says at its peak there were only 50 cars leased in the UK .
They blame lack of demand and problems with batteries for the car 's demise .
Customer acceptance
Ford sold Think back to a Scandinavian firm .
The cars were recalled from the lessees and shipped to Norway , where , it 's probable they went the same two - dimensional way as the EV1 , Ford says .
The Ford Think - probably now residing somewhere in Norway
" We are not saying there is absolutely no future for electric vehicles but we were disappointed about the very limited customer acceptance . "
Ford is now promoting a bioethanol version of the Ford Focus , and is pouring millions into hybrid cars and long - term development of hydrogen fuel cell technology .
Take - up of alternative fuel vehicles varies widely .
Ford has shifted 22,000 bioethanol cars in Sweden , and 100 in the UK .
What is here and now is the hybrid - cars like the Toyota Prius and the Honda Civic Hybrid , that have both electric motors and petrol engines .
The battery for the motor is powered by energy generated from braking .
HYBRIDS Toyota Prius Fuel economy : 65.7mpg Cost : £ 17,780 UK sales : 7,000 Honda Civic Hybrid Fuel economy : 61.4mpg Cost : £ 16,265 UK sales : 2,500
There are still going to be electric cars like the G - Wiz and the Mega City , and there are others being launched , Citroen and Peugeot among them , but for most of the " volume manufacturers " electric is not the future .
As Piers Ward , of Top Gear Magazine , notes , there are image problems for electric cars and a lack of incentive for people to move away from petrol - only cars .
" The problem electric cars face is how many people only make journeys in central London .
Cars that can only go 70 miles are not enough to make it a usable car .
There are tax breaks for hybrids in the states .
In this country you escape the congestion charge but you do n't get any tax breaks . "
And there is the rub .
The UK offers free road tax to cars with very low emissions and road tax of £ 30 - 40 for hybrids and alternative fuel vehicles .
But this saving of a mere £ 100 is hardly likely to wow anybody in a showroom .
Why not knock the VAT off to help reduce pollution ?
A Treasury spokesman patiently explains that European law would not allow this .
So the fight , for the electric and alternative fuel brigade , goes on .
You ask who killed the EV1 .
Have a look at the photograph ; it 's truly hideous !
As long as electric or hybrid cars look ghastly and are no cheaper to run than a decent diesel , they stand no chance .
Lindsay Tosh
What about the new car from Teslamotors , using Li-ion batterys ( from laptop technology ) .
Very nice looking two seat Roadster , designed with input from Lotus , 250 miles to the charge ( EPA highway ) .
On the expensive side at around $ 80 k , but not too bad a price for a low production car .
J D Baldwin , Giltbrook
Keen to reduce pollution ?
Ride a bicycle .
I just bought a Brompton folding bike and love whizzing past cars in jams , and folding it up to take on trains .
It is VERY convenient and I enjoy the freedom and sense of wellbeing I get from riding it .
Since most car journeys are short , a lot could be done on a bike and we would n't all be getting fatter and fatter as we are these days .
Tony Volpe , Newcastle upon Tyne - UK
" For the moment , at least , they [ hybrids ] are definitively city cars . "
This statement is completely untrue , hybrids ' power source is still a petrol engine , they merely use hybrid technonolgy to make more efficient use of the fuel .
They can therefore go anywhere that a conventional petrol engined car can , only they tend to do it cheaper and cleaner .
They can indeed only go short distances on battery only , but eventually they will need to utilise the petrol engine anyway because that is the only way to recharge the battery .
They are no more a city car than any similar sized conventional car , in fact with a dual power source they outperform many other cars for rapid acceleration when needed .
The best fuel economy on my Prius is obtained not on city journeys , but on long distance journeys on A roads where most of the driving is at 50 - 60 mph .
Even on sustained 70 mph running the hybrid technology gives a significant fuel saving compared to petrol only .
Brian Gooch , Sheffield , UK
Battery - powered cars were always going to fail .
They simply have too much down - side : expensive , heavy , short - lived batteries ; short range , low power .
Add to this the fact that charging them adds to pressure on electricity generation and they were doomed .
The long - term answer - which we should be gearing up for now - is cars powered by the hydrogen fuel cell .
The hydrogen can be produces in remote areas using wind generators .
There are parts of the country ideally suited for this , where such industry would provide otherwise unattainable jobs and investment .
We have an opportunity to make the UK a world leader in this technology - can we think big enough to do it ?
W Singleton , Bristol
So the EU wo n't allow the government to knock off VAT , why not subsidise back the cost of VAT ( perhaps from the congestion charge fund ) and call it a subsidy , not VAT back .
Beth , Somerset , UK
The pollution caused by cars is largely a red herring to divert public attention away from the main argument against them ; which is that they are incredibly dangerous and kill people .
Neil Hoskins , Aylesbury , UK
It 's disgusting that EU law is the obstacle to common sense and an abolition of VAT on all green products .
The law should be changed , because it is a bad law that is doing us all harm .
Julius , London
How can electric cars be seen as a pollution reducing measure ?
It stands to reason that the power has to come from somewhere , which in the UK at least would be predominantly from coal - fired powerstations .
Ultimately , there 's no ' one - size fits all ' solution .
Personally I believe that more effort should be put into exploring the possibilities of bio-ethanol , a fuel that can be used in most petrol internal combustion engines without radical modifications .
Andrew , Cambridge
When the Earth 's oil reserves finally run out ( predicted to happen in the 1980s incidentally ) , what price an electric car then ?
Alan , London UK
Hydrogen powered cars have to be the way ahead .
The universe is full of the stuff and the only emmission is water .
I remember back in the 70s the only problem was storing the hydrogen safely in the car .
I can't believe that this issue has remained unsolved for over 30 years .
Am I being cynical , or is it just that oil companies are in some way inhibiting developments ?
Let us hope not .
John Goodyear , Huddersfield , England
Electric is a total waste of time and an enviromental distraction .
Electricity does n't just appear by magic : its created ( expensively ) by burning oil , coal , gas or uranium .
Equally batteries are an enviromental nightmare - they contain hundreds of kilos of very toxic heavy metals ( lead , cadmium , nickel , lithium ) and concentrated sulphuric acid .
At least petrol ( with a catalytic convertor ) only produces CO2 and water .

Is the Endangered Species Act bad for endangered species ?
John
List thinks it might be .
My colleague and co-author John List is one of the most prolific and influential economists around .
He ’s got a new working paper with Michael Margolis and Daniel Osgood that makes the surprising claim that the Endangered Species Act — which is designed to help endangered species — may actually harm them .
Why ?
The key intuition is that after a species is designated as endangered , a decision has to be made about the geographic areas that will be considered critical habitats for that species .
An initial set of boundaries is made , after which there are public hearings , and eventually a final decision on what land will be protected .
In the meantime , while this debate is ongoing , there are strong incentives for private parties to try to develop land that they may in the future be prevented from developing by the endangered species status .
So destruction of habitat is likely to actually increase in the short run .
Based on their theory , they analyze the data for the Cactus Ferruginous Pygmy Owl near Tucson , AZ .
Indeed , they find that land development speeds up substantially in the areas that are going to be designated a critical habitats .
This result , combined with Sam Peltzman ’s observation that only 39 of the 1,300 species put on the endangered species list have ever been removed , do not paint a very optimistic picture of the efficacy of the Endangered Species Act .
How the Countries Stack Up
How much is inside a keg ?
Any college sophomore can tell you it is 15 ½ gallons , but how many servings is that , and how many gallons should you plan for each guest ?
On Saturday night , we decided to find out .
Besides the " half barrel " 15 ½ gallon domestic , the keg family also includes a 13.2 gallon import keg ( on the right ) , the 7.75 gallon " pony " or " quarter barrel " keg ( left ) , and the 5 - gallon " sixth barrel " keg ( center ) .
Unfortunately , they only sell kegs with beer in them , and that much beer was certain to have a deleterious effect on our study .
We decided to do the same thing that NASA does : Invite a hell of a lot more scientists to help out .
I printed off some fliers and handed them out at a nearby petrochemical engineering convention .
Buying beer in a keg is different than buying it in cans .
For one thing , you have to provide your own drinking vessels .
Regular folks use these red cups , sophisticated socialites use glass pint glasses , and movie stars and royalty prefer footwear .
Thanks to a generous contribution by Z. Birkenbuel , I was able to buy a fresh , cold keg of Michelob from my local Beverages , & More .
The keg was $ 87 , plus a deposit .
The two keys to serving a keg of beer are keep it cold , and do n't shake it up
These can both be tricky .
First of all , a keg wo n't fit into your refrigerator .
Well , it might , but you will have to tear out all the racks and the vegetable - drawers .
You are much better off putting the keg into an empty garbage can and packing the surrounding space with ice .
My thanks to Greg Ward and Coffeeworks for supplying a truckload of ice for this keg .
Shaking the keg creates unwanted foam .
This is most likely to happen when you are wrestling the keg out of your car and dragging it into the house .
One hundred and thirty - six pounds of beer can take you by surprise .
Do not roll the keg into the house .
Instead the old style pull - tab , the top of every modern keg is equipped with a theft - proof pressure - activated combination lock - style valve .
To circumvent this system , beer retailers will rent you a " black bag " of burglar - tools , including a tap , stethoscope and waterproof bib .
I , of course , had to try it the hard way and immediately set off the alarm .
Finally the beer was tapped and ready , so I went over some last minute party preparations :
Dusting off my collection of polka records , clearing all the opiates out of the medicine cabinet and vomit - proofing the furniture .
At around 9:40 pm , the first guests arrived : Jane , Rob Berry from RetroCRUSH and his friend Steve .
In order to keep track of the number of beers that the keg dispensed , I decided to take a photo of each cupful in its owner 's hand .
This scheme meant standing by the keg the whole night , but it turned out that the keg was an epicenter of party action , so I was never lonely .
Here is a photo of Summer filling her first beer .
Although beer was the star of the party , there were also the makings for some other beverages in the kitchen .
Not all people enjoy the bitter taste of beer , so it is a good idea to have some delicious vodka or bourbon as a taste alternative .
As more and more people arrived , an array of full red cups continued to flow from the keg .
I could hardly believe how THIRSTY everyone was !
At around 11 pm , the party was in full swing .
People started talking to strangers , non-smokers began smoking and lousy jokes were pronounced brilliant ... the beer was working perfectly !
Sometimes guests had to wait in line a few minutes for a new cupful of beer .
The maximum flow was about six ( red ) cups per minute .
I knew that the beer would come out faster if we could increase the internal pressure .
We tried heating the keg inside the oven , but we could n't get it to fit inside without removing the racks and the vegetable drawers .
The alcohol had different effects on different people .
Some people slowed down , some people became more animated .
For example : Cheryl tried on my boxing gloves and Tony challenged her to punch him in the stomach .
The first cup of beer was spilled at 11:30 pm .
At about this time , I had taken about 80 photos , and my battery died .
Thankfully , Intel engineer Christopher Loental had brought his own camera , and he graciously loaned me his battery .
At exactly 12:30 am , three hours after being opened , the keg ran dry .
Some guests silently made a switch to hard alcohol and others banded together , forming small but effective beer search parties .
Paradoxically , people who had the strongest desire for additional beer were least able to make the voyage .
Some of the search parties returned in triumph !
Others returned in jaguar .
Here , from left to right are Kizzy , Ambur , Uli and Ichiro , representing the crossover from keg cups to cocktails and beer bottles .
The active ingredient of Michelob is ethyl alcohol , or C 2 H 5 OH .
Michelob contains 4.9 % alcohol , so a keg contains 97 ounces of alcohol .
This is enough alcohol to bring 41 men over the legal driving limit in California .
A little more and you could probably get them to sing and dance .
In our experiment , two guests passed out and two guests threw up .
Whenever you are serving this much beer , it is a good idea to have either snack - foods on hand or paramedics on duty .
As 2 am turned to 4 am , guests filtered out and made their way home , lingering on the front porch .
The house was almost empty , except for the contest Mike , Wes and Summer were having in the kitchen .
The party was a big success , and the house had survived without anything getting broken .
It was n't until later that I found out about Leila 's car window .
Here are photos of the 141 beers filled by the keg , in order .
I asked people to indicate what number beer they were enjoying with a show of fingers .
Only 26 % of the beer was consumed by women , so they are underrepresented in this set of photos .
Some women avoid beer because of the calories , and at 25,810 calories per keg , who can blame them ?
Our keg had served 141 cups of beer at a cost of 62 ¢ each .
141 cups is enough for an awesome 7 - story byramid !
A similar quantity of beer in cans requires 6 ½ cases , or 165 cans of beer .
Beer sold in cans is about 50 % more expensive , but those cans are a hellovalot easier to sneak into traffic school .

New Horizons is set to lift off from Cape Canaveral , Florida , at 1824 GMT on Tuesday aboard an Atlas 5 rocket .
Despite being the fastest probe ever built , it will still take more than nine years to reach its distant target .
Anti-nuclear activists have staged small protests about the spacecraft 's 33 kg payload of plutonium fuel .
The $ 700 m ( £ 396 m ) New Horizons spacecraft will gather information on Pluto and its moons before - it is hoped - pressing on to explore the icy objects that reside in the region of space known as the Kuiper Belt .
We 'll get our first glimpse of what the surface looks like and see whether there are craters , or volcanoes or frost or cracks
Dr Fran Bagenal , University of Colorado
Some astronomers say Pluto is not a true planet at all , and should be classed instead alongside these icy relics from the formation of the Solar System .
" What we know about Pluto today could fit on the back of a postage stamp , " said Colleen Hartman , a deputy associate administrator at Nasa .
" The textbooks will be rewritten after this mission is completed . "
Gravity assist
Stephen Lowry , of Queen 's University in Belfast , commented that the mission could tell scientists much about Pluto and its moons .
" Dramatic differences on the surfaces may indicate that the system did n't form as a result of a single collision event .
Perhaps some of the smaller members are gravitationally captured objects , " he told the BBC News website .
If Nasa launches New Horizons before 3
February , the probe will be in position to swing by Jupiter , using the planet 's gravity to pick up speed in a slingshot manoeuvre .
That boost will allow New Horizons to reach Pluto in July 2015 .
Otherwise , the journey will take until 2018 at the earliest .
New Horizons will fly by Pluto and its largest moon Charon on the same day .
The spacecraft 's seven instruments will gather information on Pluto 's atmosphere and carry out detailed mapping of surface features on the planet and its biggest satellite .
Lots to learn
It will photograph the two small moons announced in November 2005 and check for rings around Pluto .
Some astronomers believe Pluto is not a true planet
" We 'll get our first glimpse of what the surface looks like and see whether there are craters , or volcanoes or frost or cracks , " said Dr Bagenal .
After the Pluto encounter , it is up to Nasa to decide whether to grant the spacecraft an extended mission .
Should this happen , mission scientists plan to send New Horizons to visit two Kuiper Belt Objects ( KBOs ) with diameters of 50 km ( 30 miles ) or more .
Scientists believe they can learn about the evolution of the Solar System by studying the Kuiper Belt since it possesses debris left over form its formation .
Window in time
" It provides for us a window 4.5 billion years back in time to observe the formation conditions of giant planets , " said the mission 's principal investigator , Alan Stern of the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder , Colorado .
Dr Lowry said studying these other Kuiper Belt Objects could shed light on how material interacted to form planetary objects in the early Solar System .
He added that scientists could also compare the surfaces of KBOs with those of comets photographed by previous space missions .
This might provide clues to how comets evolve as they journey from the outer Solar System towards the Sun , he said .
For onboard electric power , the probe will convert heat from the decay of radioactive plutonium pellets into electricity for the spacecraft 's systems and science instruments .
Operating so far from the Sun means New Horizons cannot use solar panels .
Nasa said there was a 1 in 350 chance of a mishap that released plutonium around the launch site .
Even so , it said , the chance of dangerous radiation exposure to workers and the public was low .
Pluto was discovered in 1930 by US astronomer Clyde Tombaugh while he was working at the Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff , Arizona .
You can watch the launch live on the BBC News website at 1824GMT
The elevators in the New York Hilton played CNN on a small screen you could not avoid watching .
Iraq was top of the news ; pronouncements about a " civil war " and " sectarian violence " were repeated incessantly .
It was as if the US invasion had never happened and the killing of tens of thousands of civilians by the Americans was a surreal fiction .
The Iraqis were mindless Arabs , haunted by religion , ethnic strife and the need to blow themselves up .
Unctuous puppet politicians were paraded with no hint that their exercise yard was inside an American fortress .
And when you left the lift , this followed you to your room , to the hotel gym , the airport , the next airport and the next country .
Such is the power of America ’s corporate propaganda , which , as Edward Said pointed out in Culture and Imperialism , " penetrates electronically " with its equivalent of a party line .
The party line changed the other day .
For almost three years it was that al - Qaeda was the driving force behind the " insurgency , " led by Abu Musab al - Zarqawi , a bloodthirsty Jordanian who was clearly being groomed for the kind of infamy Saddam Hussein enjoys .
It mattered not that al - Zarqawi had never been seen alive and that only a fraction of the " insurgents " followed al - Qaeda .
For the Americans , Zarqawi ’s role was to distract attention from the thing that almost all Iraqis oppose : the brutal Anglo - American occupation of their country .
Now that al - Zarqawi has been replaced by " sectarian violence " and " civil war , " the big news is the attacks by Sunnis on Shia mosques and bazaars .
The real news , which is not reported in the CNN " mainstream , " is that the Salvador Option has been invoked in Iraq .
This is the campaign of terror by death squads armed and trained by the US , which attack Sunnis and Shias alike .
The goal is the incitement of a real civil war and the breakup of Iraq , the original war aim of Bush ’s administration .
The ministry of the interior in Baghdad , which is run by the CIA , directs the principal death squads .
Their members are not exclusively Shia , as the myth goes .
The most brutal are the Sunni-led Special Police Commandos , headed by former senior officers in Saddam ’s Ba’ath Party .
This was formed and trained by CIA " counterinsurgency " experts , including veterans of the CIA ’s terror operations in central America in the 1980s , notably El Salvador .
In his new book , Empire ’s Workshop ( Metropolitan Books ) , the American historian Greg Grandin describes the Salvador Option thus : " Once in office , [ President ]
Reagan came down hard on central America , in effect letting his administration ’s most committed militarists set and execute policy .
In El Salvador , they provided more than a million dollars a day to fund a lethal counterinsurgency campaign . . .
All told , US allies in central America during Reagan ’s two terms killed over 300,000 people , tortured hundreds of thousands and drove millions into exile . "
Although the Reagan administration spawned the current Bushites , or " neo-cons , " the pattern was set earlier .
In Vietnam , death squads trained , armed and directed by the CIA murdered up to 50,000 people in Operation Phoenix .
In the mid-1960s , in Indonesia , CIA officers compiled " death lists " for General Suharto ’s killing spree during his seizure of power .
After the 2003 invasion , it was only a matter of time before this venerable " policy " was applied in Iraq .
According to the investigative writer Max Fuller ( National Review Online ) , the key CIA manager of the interior ministry death squads " cut his teeth in Vietnam before moving on to direct the US military mission in El Salvador . "
Professor Grandin names another central America veteran whose job now is to " train a ruthless counterinsurgent force made up of ex-Ba’athist thugs . "
Another , says Fuller , is well - known for his " production of death lists . "
A secret militia run by the Americans is the Facilities Protection Service , which has been responsible for bombings .
" The British and US Special Forces , " concludes Fuller , " in conjunction with the [ US - created ] intelligence services at the Iraqi defense ministry , are fabricating insurgent bombings of Shias . "
On 16 March , Reuters reported the arrest of an American " security contractor , " who was found with weapons and explosives in his car .
Last year , two Britons disguised as Arabs were caught with a car full of weapons and explosives ; British forces bulldozed the Basra prison to rescue them .
The Boston Globe recently reported : " The FBI ’s counter - terrorism unit has launched a broad investigation of US - based theft rings after discovering that some of the vehicles used in deadly car bombings in Iraq , including attacks that killed US troops and Iraqi civilians , were probably stolen in the United States , according to senior government officials . "
As I say , all this has been tried before — just as the preparation of the American public for an atrocious attack on Iran is similar to the WMD fabrications in Iraq .
If that attack comes , there will be no warning , no declaration of war , no truth .
Imprisoned in the Hilton elevator , staring at CNN , my fellow passengers could be excused for not making sense of the Middle East , or Latin America , or anywhere .
They are isolated .
Nothing is explained .
Congress is silent .
The Democrats are moribund .
And the freest media on earth insult the public every day .
As Voltaire put it : " Those who can make you believe absurdities can make you commit atrocities . "

Django tips : user registration
One of the most common and , generally , most successful models for letting people sign up for user accounts requires the user to go through some form of “ activation ” ; usually it looks something like this :
User fills out a form with a username , password and email address .
User gets an email with a “ confirmation link ” which must be clicked to activate the account .
User clicks the link and the account becomes active ; then they log in normally .
So let ’s look at how to do this with Django .
Also , before we dive in , let me note that this one ’s still a work in progress .
The question of how to do this has come up a lot , and it ’s something I ’ve been working on for a personal project , so this is basically what I ’m using right now — I have n’t tested it thoroughly , though , so if you spot a problem please leave a comment .
Update : if you ’re interested in the mechanics of how registration works , keep reading .
If you ’re looking for code , I ’ve cleaned this up considerably and released it under an open - source license ; check out the django - registration project on Google Code if you want to play around with it .
Set up a user profile
In order to do this effectively , we ’ll need to generate some sort of unique key which can be used to activate the account , and we ’ll need somewhere to store it .
The obvious place is in a model which is somehow tied to the User model , probably some sort of “ user profile ” and , as luck would have it , you ’ll probably want to be setting something like that up anyway — a customizable user profile is a nice feature to have regardless .
So here ’s a very simple “ user profile ” model ; you ’d probably want to add more fields to it , but this has the bare minimum we need to do user registration :
from django.db import models from django.contrib.auth.models import User class UserProfile ( models .
Model ) : user = models .
OneToOneField ( User ) activation_key = models .
CharField ( maxlength = 40 ) key_expires = models .
DateTimeField ()
Once that model is installed , we can open up our settings file and specify it as the value of the setting AUTH_PROFILE_MODULE , so that Django will set up some conveniences for us .
OK , now how do we register an account ?
Ordinarily when creating an instance of a model , it ’d be easiest just to use the create_object generic view , but in this particular case that wo n’t be sufficient for a couple of reasons :
It would create an active account , which we do n’t want — the User model lets us mark users active or inactive with a Boolean Field called is_active , but that field defaults to True .
It would require the user to input a salted hashed password , which is horribly unfriendly .
It would n’t give us any way to check the user ’s password for typos ( say , by having them enter it twice ) .
It would n’t offer us any way to email the user a confirmation link .
So we ’ll want to write our own view .
The password - related problems described above could be worked around by using UserCreationForm , a custom manipulator provided by the auth application which provides two password fields and checks that they match , then does the salting and hashing automatically before saving ( this is how the admin lets you easily create a new user , incidentally — it uses a special - case view that relies on UserCreation Form ) .
But UserCreationForm does n’t include a field for the email address , so we ’d have no way of asking for it or sending a confirmation email .
So let ’s write our own manipulator while we ’re at it .
We ’ll need that to be defined before we can call on it from a view , so we ’ll write it first .
Here ’s the code :
from django import forms from django. core import validators from django.contrib.auth.models import User class RegistrationForm ( forms .
Manipulator ) : def __init__ ( self ) : self .
fields = ( forms .
TextField ( field_name = ' username ' , length = 30 , maxlength = 30 , is_required = True , validator_list = [ validators .
isAlphaNumeric , self . isValidUsername ] ) , forms .
EmailField ( field_name = ' email ' , length = 30 , maxlength = 30 , is_required = True ) , forms .
PasswordField ( field_name = ' password1 ' , length = 30 , maxlength = 60 , is_required = True ) , forms .
PasswordField ( field_name = ' password2 ' , length = 30 , maxlength = 60 , is_required = True , validator_list = [ validators .
AlwaysMatchesOtherField ( ' password1 ' , ' Passwords must match . ' ) ] ) , ) def isValidUsername ( self , field_data , all_data ) : try : User .
objects .
get ( username = field_data ) except User .
DoesNotExist : return raise validators .
ValidationError ( ' The username " %s " is already taken . ' % field_data ) def save ( self , new_data ) : u = User . objects .
create_user ( new_data [ ' username ' ] , new_data [ ' email ' ] , new_data [ ' password1 ' ] ) u . is_active = False u . save ( ) return u
This may look somewhat complex , but it ’s not .
Most of it will make sense if you ’ve read through the documentation on manipulators , and it ’s really just a slightly modified version of UserCreation Form designed to suit the needs of web - based registration .
Here ’s how it breaks down :
The __init__ method sets up the fields we care about : one for username , one for email and two copies of the password .
We use the AlwaysMatchesOtherField validator on the second password field to tell Django to make sure the password is entered the same each time .
The isValidUsername method is a custom validator , designed to give us immediate notice if the username is already taken .
The save method calls User.objects .
create_user ; the User model has a custom manager which defines this method to easily handle creating the hashed password , and all we have to do is give it a username , email address and plain - text password — it will hand us back a valid User object .
Then we set is_active to False and save the new user .
OK , now we can sign up
Now that we ’ve got a manipulator that will do what we want , we can write a simple registration view that lets new users sign up .
First we import a few things we ’ll need :
import datetime , random , sha from django .
shortcuts import render_to_response , get_object_or_404 from django.core.mail import send_mail
We ’ll also need the UserProfile model and the Registration Form manipulator we just created , but since they ’ll live inside our application the exact import statements will depend on the name and layout of the app .
When you ’re defining custom manipulators , it ’s often a good idea to put them in a file named forms .
py inside your application ; assuming we ’ve done that here , the imports would look like this :
from myproject.myapp.models import UserProfile from myproject.myapp.forms import RegistrationForm
Now let ’s look at the view for registration :
def register ( request ) : if request .
user .
is_authenticated ( ) : #
They already have an account ; do n't let them register again return render_to_response ( ' register.html ' , { ' has_account ' : True }) manipulator = RegistrationForm ( ) if request .
POST : new_data = request .
POST . copy ( ) errors = manipulator .
get_validation_errors ( new_data ) if not errors : #
Save the user manipulator .
do_html2 python ( new_data ) new_user = manipulator .
save ( new_data ) #
Build the activation key for their account salt = sha .
new ( str ( random . random ( ) ) ) . hexdigest ( ) [ : 5 ] activation_key = sha .
new ( salt + new_user .
username ) . hexdigest ( ) key_expires = datetime .
datetime . today ( ) + datetime .
timedelta ( 2 ) # Create and save their profile new_profile = UserProfile ( user = new_user , activation_key = activation_key , key_expires = key_expires ) new_profile .
save () # Send an email with the confirmation link email_subject =
' Your new example .com account confirmation ' email_body =
" Hello , %s , and thanks for signing up for an \ example .
com account !
\ n \ nTo activate your account , click this link within 48 \ hours : \ n \ nhttp : // example .
com / accounts / confirm / % s " % ( new_user .
username , new_profile .
activation_key ) send_mail ( email_subject , email_body , 'accounts@example.com ' , [ new_user . email ] ) return render_to_response ( ' register.html ' , { ' created ' : True } ) else : errors = new_data = {} form = forms .
FormWrapper ( manipulator , new_data , errors ) return render_to_response ( ' register.html ' , { ' form ' : form } )
Here ’s what ’s going on in that view :
First we use is_authenticated to see if the user is logged in already — if they are , they have an account and should n’t sign up for a new one , so we immediately stop and return a response .
The template register . html should have some way of checking for the already_has_account context variable and show an appropriate message .
Otherwise we instantiate a RegistrationForm to use during the sign - up processing .
If the request was a POST , we feed it to the manipulator and check for validation errors .
If there were no validation errors , then we can go through with saving the new account and sending a confirmation email .
If there were errors , or if the request was n’t a POST , we hand off to the template with a form to display .
Now , most of the interesting stuff happens in step 4 , where we save the new account , so let ’s walk through that step by step :
We convert the submitted information to Python values , and save the new user account .
That hands us back a brand - new , but inactive , user .
Then we create a suitably random activation key ; this is why we imported the random and sha modules — we get a random number and create a SHA hash from it , grabbing the first few characters to use as a “ salt ” ; then we mash the new account ’s username onto the end of the “ salt ” and generate a SHA hash of that , which will be the final activation key .
We use timedelta to get a date value two days into the future — we ’ll use this to expire the activation key after 48 hours .
We create and save a new UserProfile , tied to the User we just created , and give it the activation key and expiration date we ’ve just generated .
We build up a subject and body for an email message , then send it off to the person who just signed up by using Django ’s built - in send_mail function ( note that to be truly portable , the email message should probably actually get information about the site ’s name and domain from django.
contrib.sites , and that send_mail takes a list of email addresses to send to ) .
That ’s a whole lot of stuff , without a whole lot of code :)
Confirmation time
Now the only thing left to write is a view which can activate the new account :
def confirm ( request , activation_key ) : if request .
user .
is_authenticated ( ) : return render_to_response ( ' confirm.html ' , { ' has_account ' : True } ) user_profile = get_object_or_404 ( UserProfile , activation_key = activation_key ) if user_profile .
key_expires < datetime .
datetime . today ( ) : return render_to_response ( ' confirm.html ' , { ' expired ' : True } ) user_account = user_profile .
user user_account .
is_active =
True user_account . save ( ) return render_to_response ( ' confirm.html ' , { ' success ' : True })
This view assumes that you ’ve set up your URLs to grab the part which contains the activation key and pass it as an argument .
Here ’s how it works from there :
Once again , we check to make sure the user ’s not already logged in — if they are , there ’s no point trying to activate a new account for them .
We use the shortcut get_object_or_404 to see if there ’s a UserProfile matching this activation key — if not , it ’ll automatically send a “ page not found ” response .
We check whether the activation key has expired ; if so , we jump straight to the response and let the template know it should display an appropriate message .
If the key is n’t expired , we grab the User object associated with this UserProfile , and flip its is_active field to True .
Finally , we return a response , telling the template that the activation was successful .
It ’d probably be a good idea for the template to show a link to a login page at this point ( or , alternatively , you could import and use the convenience function django.contrib.auth.login to automatically log the user in ) .
And we ’re done
Now we ’ve got a fully functional user - registration system , with confirmation emails .
We did have to write some code , but there ’s not a whole lot of it and it ’s all fairly straightforward .

Fold - up bikes are certainly not new though none to date have deserved the moniker “ portable ” .
Most use the same heavy chain sets and bulky 16 to 20 inch wheels and traditional materials and are at best luggable .
The A - Bike is a folding pushbike that is claimed to be small enough so that you can take it on public transport with a no-bicycles policy .
The US$ 300 A - bike utilises automotive grade , engineering polymers for its structural components , saddle and handlebars and has a level of stiffness , fatigue and impact resistance comparable with aero -grade aluminium .
By using these new materials , the A - bike ’s weight has been reduced to just 5.5 kg ( 12 lbs ) , which is manageable for even slightly - built individuals .
Whatsmore , it can be folded inside 10 seconds into a compact 26 ” x 12 ” x 6 ” ( 66 x 30 x 15 cm ) package and has pneumatic tyres , so riding it will not dislodge the fillings in your teeth .
In our opinion , the A - Bike looks to be the first viable foldable bike for those who wish to mix modes of transport and we see it as invaluable for yachts and motorhomes and campers where a simple vehicle for short - distances is a boon but storage space is limited .
The A - Bike offers many advantages over existing folding bicycles , the key being true portability .
With or without its carrier case , the A - Bike can be hand - carried anywhere – on public transport , taken into stores or stored in school lockers .
It is also easily stowed on boats and yachts , fits into standard luggage and takes up minimal room in a car trunk .
A glance will tell you it was designed inside a computer , and it truly is an innovative design that uses high strength engineering polymers fused with aero grade aluminium to achieve its weight goals without sacrificing strength and durability .
Accordingly , we rate the A - Bike a genuine breakthrough product .
Targeted at the urban consumer and weighing only 5.5 kg ( 12 lbs ) the A - Bike folds into a compact volume of less than 0.03 cubic meters ( 1.1 cubic feet ) and takes a mere ten seconds to unfold or fold .
Importantly , the design of the A - Bike is such that it adjusts to fits all riders .
There ’s even a compatible high capacity lighting system available that does n’t compromise the folding .
It also has a highly efficient , two - stage chain transmission that incorporates a high quality freewheel and is totally enclosed to protect clothing from grease .
It also has very small pneumatic tires which , based on recent valve developments , offer an extremely comfortable ride .
The tire 's inner tubes can be removed and repaired in the same way as a larger bicycle tire .
Jointly developed by legendary English inventor Sir Clive Sinclair ( Sinclair Research Ltd ) and Hong Kong - based Group Daka Designs , the A - bike is due for release in the UK and Japan in the next month .
Daka has been working together with Sinclair Research since 1999 , when it obtained a world - wide exclusive license for Sinclair patents relating to motor - drive technology .
Since then , the companies have jointly taken to market products like the wheelchair drive unit and the sea scooter .

Newsround interviewed vet Tricia Mundy from the Village Animal Hospital in Surrey , who gave us some top tips for avoiding dangerous dogs .
Here 's what you should do if you fear a dog might be about to attack you .
Stand still
Stay calm
Face the dog
Fold your arms
Walk away calmly , facing the dog , but without making eye contact
And remember , if a dog attacks a human , it 's usually not because it is trying to " hunt " .
Tricia said it 's often because the animal feels frightened , so dogs are usually more scared of us than we are of them .

Preface
The purpose of this document is to introduce you to the GNU build system , and show you how to use it to write good code .
It also discusses peripheral topics such as how to use GNU Emacs as a source code navigator , how to write good software , and the philosophical concerns behind the free software movement .
The intended reader should be a software developer who knows his programming languages , and wants to learn how to package his programs in a way that follows the GNU coding standards .
This manual introduces you to the GNU build system and shows you how to develop high - quality
This manual shows you how to develop high - quality software on GNU using the GNU build system that conforms to the GNU coding standards .
These techniques are also useful for software development on GNU / Linux and most variants of the Unix system .
In fact , one of the reasons for the elaborate GNU build system was to make software portable between GNU and other similar operating systems .
We also discuss peripheral topics such as how to use GNU Emacs as an IDE ( integrated development environment ) , and the various practical , legal and philosophical concerns behind software development .
When we speak of the GNU build system we refer primarily to the following four packages :
Autoconf produces a configuration shell script , named configure , which probes the installer platform for portability related information which is required to customize makefiles , configuration header files , and other application specific files .
Then it proceeds to generate customized versions of these files from generic templates .
This way , the user will not need to customize these files manually .

Then it proceeds to generate customized versions of these files from generic templates .
This way , the user will not need to customize these files manually .
Automake produces makefile templates , Makefile .in to be used by Autoconf , from a very high level specification stored in a file called Makefile.am .
Automake produces makefiles that conform to the GNU makefile standards , taking away the extraordinary effort required to produce them by hand .
Automake requires Autoconf in order to be used properly .

Automake requires Autoconf in order to be used properly .
Libtool makes it possible to compile position independent code and build shared libraries in a portable manner .
It does not require either Autoconf , or Automake and can be used independently .
Automake however supports libtool and interoperates with it in a seamless manner .

Autotoolset FIXME : Add content
The GNU build system has two goals .
The first is to simplify the development of portable programs .
The second is to simplify the building of programs that are distributed as source code .
The first goal is achieved by the automatic generation of a configure shell script .
The second goal is achieved by the automatic generation of Makefiles and other shell scripts that are typically used in the building process .
This way the developer can concentrate on debugging his source code , instead of his overly complex Makefiles .
And the installer can compile and install the program directly from the source code distribution by a simple and automatic procedure .
The GNU build system needs to be installed only when you are developing programs that are meant to be distributed .
To build a program from distributed source code , you only need a working make , a compiler , a shell , and sometimes standard Unix utilities like sed , awk , yacc , lex .
The objective is to make software installation as simple and as automatic as possible for the installer .
Also , by setting up the GNU build system such that it creates programs that do n't require the build system to be present during their installation , it becomes possible to use the build system to bootstrap itself .
Some tasks that are simplified by the GNU build system include :
Building multi directory software packages .
It is much more difficult to use raw make recursively .
Having simplified this step , the developer is encouraged to organize his source code in a deep directory tree rather than lump everything under the same directory .
Developers that use raw make often can't justify the inconvenience of recursive make and prefer to disorganize their source code .
With the GNU tools this is no longer necessary .

Developers that use raw often can't justify the inconvenience of recursive make and prefer to disorganize their source code .
With the GNU tools this is no longer necessary .
Automatic configuration .
You will never have to tell your users that they need to edit your Makefile .
You yourself will not have to edit your Makefiles as you move new versions of your code back and forth between different machines .
Automatic makefile generation .
Writing makefiles involves a lot of repetition , and in large projects it will get on your nerves .
The GNU build system instead requires you to write Makefile .am files that are much more terse and easy to maintain .
files that are much more terse and easy to maintain .
Support for test suites .
You can very easily write test suite code , and by adding one extra line in your Makefile .am make a check target available such that you can compile and run the entire test suite by running make check .
make a target available such that you can compile and run the entire test suite by running .
Automatic distribution building .
The GNU build tools are meant to be used in the development of free software , therefore if you have a working build system in place for your programs , you can create a source code distribution out of it by running make distcheck .
, therefore if you have a working build system in place for your programs , you can create a source code distribution out of it by running .
Shared libraries .
Building shared libraries becomes as easy as building static libraries .
The Autotoolset package complements the GNU build system by providing the following additional features :
Automatic generation of legal notices that are needed in order to apply the GNU GPL license .
Automatic generation of directory trees for new software packages , such that they conform to the GNITS standard ( more or less ) .
Some rudimentary portability framework for C++ programs .
There is a lot of room for improvement here , in the future .
Also a framework for embedding text into your executable and handling include files across multiple directories .
Support for writing portable software that uses both Fortran and C ++.
Additional support for writing software documentation in Texinfo , but also in LaTeX .
This effort began by my attempt to write a tutorial for Autoconf .
It involved into “ Learning Autoconf and Automake ” .
Along the way I developed Autotoolset to deal with things that annoyed me or to cover needs from my own work .
Ultimately I want this document to be both a unified introduction of the GNU build system as well as documentation for the Autotoolset package .
I believe that knowing these tools and having this know - how is very important , and should not be missed from engineering or science students who will one day go out and do software development for academic or industrial research .
Many students are incredibly undertrained in software engineering and write a lot of bad code .
This is very very sad because of all people , it is them that have the greatest need to write portable , robust and reliable code .
I found from my own experience that moving away from Fortran and C , and towards C++ is the first step in writing better code .
The second step is to use the sophisticated GNU build system and use it properly , as described in this document .
Ultimately , I am hoping that this document will help people get over the learning curve of the second step , so they can be productive and ready to study the reference manuals that are distributed with all these tools .
This manual of course is still under construction .
When I am done constructing it some paragraph somewhere will be inserted with the traditional run-down of summaries about each chapter .
I write this manual in a highly non-linear way , so while it is under construction you will find that some parts are better - developed than others .
If you wish to contribute sections of the manual that I have n't written or have n't yet developed fully , please contact me .
Chapters 1,2,3,4 are okay .
Chapter 5 is okay to , but needs a little more work .
I removed the other chapters to minimize confusion , but the sources for them are still being distributed as part of the Autotoolset package for those that found them useful .
The other chapters need a lot of rewriting and they would do more harm than good at this point to the unsuspecting reader .
Please contact me if you have any suggestions for improving this manual .
Remarks by Marcelo : I am currently updating this manual to the last release of the autoconf / automake tools .

1 Installing GNU software
Free software is distributed in source code distributions .
Many of these programs are difficult to install because they use system dependent features , and they require the user to edit makefiles and configuration headers .
By contrast , the software distributed by the GNU project is autoconfiguring ; it is possible to compile it from source code and install it automatically , without any tedious user intervention .
In this chapter we discuss how to compile and install autoconfiguring software written by others .
In the subsequent chapters we discuss how to use the development tools that allow you to make your software autoconfiguring as well .
1.1 Installing a GNU package
Autoconfiguring software is distributed with packaged source code distributions .
These are big files with filenames of the form :
package - version .tar.gz
For example , the file autoconf - 2.57.tar.gz contains version 2.57 of GNU Autoconf .
We often call these files source distributions ; sometimes we simply call them packages .
The steps for installing an autoconfiguring source code distribution are simple , and if the distribution is not buggy , can be carried out without substantial user intervention .
First , you have to unpack the package to a directory : % gunzip foo -1.0.tar.gz % tar xf foo -1.0.tar
This will create the directory foo - 1.0 which contains the package 's source code and documentation .
Look for the files README to see if there 's anything that you should do next .
The README file might suggest that you need to install other packages before installing this one , or it might suggest that you have to do unusual things to install this package .
If the source distribution conforms to the GNU coding standards , you will find many other documentation files like README .
See Maintaining the documentation files , for an explanation of what these files mean .
Configure the source code .
Once upon a time that used to mean that you have to edit makefiles and header files .
In the wonderful world of Autoconf , source distributions provide a configure script that will do that for you automatically .
To run the script type : % cd foo - 1.0 % ./ configure
Now you can compile the source code .
Type : % make and if the program is big , you can make some coffee .
After the program compiles , you can run its regression test - suite , if it has one , by typing % make check
If everything is okey , you can install the compiled distribution with : % su # make install
The make program launches the shell commands necessary for compiling , testing and installing the package from source code .
However , make has no knowledge of what it is really doing .
It takes its orders from makefiles , files called Makefile that have to be present in every subdirectory of your source code directory tree .
From the installer perspective , the makefiles define a set of targets that correspond to things that the installer wants to do .
The default target is always compiling the source code , which is what gets invoked when you simply run make .
Other targets , such as ‘ install ’ , ‘ check ’ need to be mentioned explicitly .
Because make takes its orders from the makefile in the current directory , it is important to run it from the correct directory .
See Compiling with Makefiles , for the full story behind make .
The configure program is a shell script that probes your system through a set of tests to determine things that it needs to know , and then uses the results to generate Makefile files from templates stored in files called Makefile .in .
In the early days of the GNU project , developers used to write configure scripts by hand .
Now , no - one ever does that any more .
Now , configure scripts are automatically generated by GNU Autoconf from an input file configure .
in .
GNU Autoconf is part of the GNU build system and we first introduce in in The GNU build system .
As it turns out , you do n't have to write the Makefile .
in templates by hand either .
Instead you can use another program , GNU Automake , to generate Makefile .
in templates from higher - level descriptions stored in files called Makefile.am .
In these files you describe what is being created by your source code , and Automake computes the makefile targets for compiling , installing and uninstalling it .
Automake also computes targets for compiling and running test suites , and targets for recursively calling make in subdirectories .
The details about Automake are first introduced in Using Automake and Autoconf .
1.2 The Makefile standards
The GNU coding standards are a document that describes the requirements that must be satisfied by all GNU programs .
These requirements are driven mainly by technical considerations , and they are excellent advice for writing good software .
The makefile standards , a part of the GNU coding standards , require that your makefiles do a lot more than simply compile and install the software .
One requirement is cleaning targets ; these targets remove the files that were generated while installing the package and restore the source distribution to a previous state .
There are three cleaning targets that corresponds to three levels of cleaning : clean , distclean , maintainer - clean .
clean Cleans up all the files that were generated by make and make check , but not the files that were generated by running configure .
This targets cleans the build , but does not undo the source configuration by the configure script .
distclean Cleans up all the files generated by make and make check , but also cleans the files that were generated by running configure .
As a result , you can not invoke any other make targets until you run the configure script again .
This target reverts your source directory tree back to the state in which it was when you first unpacked it .
maintainer - clean Cleans up all the files that distclean cleans .
However it also removes files that the developers have automatically generated with the GNU build system .
Because users should n't need the entire GNU build system to install a package , these files should not be removed in the final source distribution .
However , it is occasionally useful for the maintainer to remove and regenerate these files .
Another type of cleaning that is required is erasing the package itself from the installation directory ; uninstalling the package .
To uninstall the package , you must call
% make uninstall
from the top level directory of the source distribution .
This will work only if the source distribution is configured first .
It will work best only if you do it from the same source distribution , with the same configuration , that you 've used to install the package in the first place .
When you install GNU software , archive the source code to all the packages that you install in a directory like / usr / src or / usr / local / src .
To do that , first run make clean on the source distribution , and then use a recursive copy to copy it to /usr / src .
The presence of a source distribution in one of these directories should be a signal to you that the corresponding package is currently installed .
Francois Pinard came up with a cute rule for remembering what the cleaning targets do :
If configure or make did it , make distclean undoes it .
or did it , undoes it .
If make did it , make clean undoes it .
did it , undoes it .
If make install did it , make uninstall undoes it .
did it , undoes it .
If you did it , make maintainer - clean undoes it .
GNU standard compliant makefiles also have a target for generating tags .
Tags are files , called TAGS , that are used by GNU Emacs to allow you to navigate your source distribution more efficiently .
More specifically , Emacs uses tags to take you from a place where a C function is being used in a file , to the file and line number where the function is defined .
To generate the tags call :
% make tags
Tags are particularly useful when you are not the original author of the code you are working on , and you have n't yet memorized where everything is .
See Navigating source code , for all the details about navigating large source code trees with Emacs .
Finally , in the spirit of free redistributable code , there must be targets for cutting a source code distribution .
If you type
% make dist
it will rebuild the foo -1.0.tar.gz file that you started with .
If you modified the source , the modifications will be included in the distribution ( and you should probably change the version number ) .
Before putting a distribution up on FTP , you can test its integrity with :
% make distcheck
This makes the distribution , then unpacks it in a temporary subdirectory and tries to configure it , build it , run the test - suite , and check if the installation script works .
If everything is okey then you 're told that your distribution is ready .
Writing reliable makefiles that support all of these targets is a very difficult undertaking .
This is why we prefer to generate our makefiles instead with GNU Automake .
1.3 Configuration options
The ‘ configure ’ script accepts many command - line flags that modify its behaviour and the configuration of your source distribution .
To obtain a list of all the options that are available type
% ./ configure -- help
on the shell prompt .
The most useful parameter that the installer controls during configuration is the directory where they want the package to be installed .
During installation , the following files go to the following directories :
Executables == > /usr/local/bin Libraries == > /usr/local / lib
Header files ==> /usr/local / include Man pages == > /usr/local/man/man ?
Info files == > /usr/local/info
The /usr / local directory is called the prefix .
The default prefix is always / usr / local but you can set it to anything you like when you call ‘ configure ’ by adding a ‘ -- prefix ’ option .
For example , suppose that you are not a privileged user , so you can not install anything in /usr / local , but you would still like to install the package for your own use .
Then you can tell the ‘ configure ’ script to install the package in your home directory ‘ / home / username ’:
% ./ configure -- prefix= / home / username % make % make check % make install
The ‘ -- prefix ’ argument tells ‘ configure ’ where you want to install your package , and ‘ configure ’ will take that into account and build the proper makefile automatically .
If you are installing the package on a filesystem that is shared by computers that run variations of GNU or Unix , you need to install the files that are independent of the operating system in a shared directory , but separate the files that are dependent on the operating systems in different directories .
Header files and documentation can be shared .
However , libraries and executables must be installed separately .
Usually the scheme used to handle such situations is :
Executables == > /usr/local / system / bin Libraries ==> /usr/local / system / lib Header files ==> /usr/local / include Man pages ==> /usr / local / man/man n Info files == > /usr/local/info
The directory / var / local / system is called the executable prefix , and it is usually a subdirectory of the prefix .
In general , it can be any directory .
If you do n't specify the executable prefix , it defaults to being equal to the prefix .
To change that , use the ‘ -- exec - prefix ’ flag .
For example , to configure for a GNU / Linux system , you would run :
% configure -- exec - prefix= / usr / local / linux
To configure for GNU / Hurd , you would run :
% configure -- exec - prefix= / usr / local / hurd
In general , there are many directories where a package may want to install files .
Some of these directories are controlled by the prefix , where others are controlled by the executable prefix .
See Installation standard directories , for a complete discussion of what these directories are , and what they are for .
Some packages allow you to enable or disable certain features while you configure the source code .
They do that with flags of the form :
-- with - package -- enable - feature -- without - package -- disable - feature
The -- enable flags usually control whether to enable certain optional features of the package .
Support for international languages , debugging features , and shared libraries are features that are usually controlled by these options .
The -- with flags instead control whether to compile and install certain optional components of the package .
The specific flags that are available for a particular source distribution should be documented in the README file .
Finally , configure scripts can be passed parameters via environment variables .
One of the things that configure does is decide what compiler to use and what flags to pass to that compiler .
You can overrule the decisions that configure makes by setting the flags CC and CFLAGS .
For example , to specify that you want the package to compile with full optimization and without any debugging symbols ( which is a bad idea , yet people want to do it ) :
% export CFLAGS= " - O3 " % ./ configure
To tell configure to use the system 's native compiler instead of gcc , and compile without optimization and with debugging symbols :
% export CC= " cc " % export CFLAGS= " - g " % ./ configure
This assumes that you are using the bash shell as your default shell .
If you use the csh or tcsh shells , you need to assign environment variables with the setenv command instead .
For example :
% setenv CFLAGS " - O3 " % ./ configure
Similarly , the flags CXX , CXXFLAGS control the C++ compiler .
1.4 Doing a VPATH build
Autoconfiguring source distributions also support vpath builds .
In a vpath build , the source distribution is stored in a , possibly read - only , directory , and the actual building takes place in a different directory where all the generated files are being stored .
We call the first directory , the source tree , and the second directory the build tree .
The build tree may be a subdirectory of the source tree , but it is better if it is a completely separate directory .
If you , the developer , use the standard features of the GNU build system , you do n't need to do anything special to allow your packages to support vpath builds .
The only exception to this is when you define your own make rules ( see General Automake principles ) .
Then you have to follow certain conventions to allow vpath to work correctly .
You , the installer , however do need to do something special .
You need to install and use GNU make .
Most Unix make utilities do not support vpath builds , or their support does n't work .
GNU make is extremely portable , and if vpath is important to you , there is no excuse for not installing it .
Suppose that / sources / foo - 0.1 contains a source distribution , and you want to build it in the directory / build / foo - 0.1 .
Assuming that both directories exist , all you have to do is :
% cd / build / foo-0.1 % /sources/foo-0.1/configure ...options ... % make % make check % su # make install
The configure script and the generated makefiles will take care of the rest .
vpath builds are preferred by some people for the following reasons :
They prevent the build process form cluttering your source directory with all sorts of build files .
To remove a build , all you have to do is remove the build directory .
You can build the same source multiple times using different options .
This is very useful if you would like to write a script that will run the test suite for a package while the package is configured in many different ways ( e.g. different features , different compiler optimization , and so on ) .
It is also useful if you would like to do the same with releasing binary distributions of the source .
distcheck
1.5 Making a binary distribution
After compiling a source distribution , instead of installing it , you can make a snapshot of the files that it would install and package that snapshot in a tarball .
It is often convenient to the installers to install from such snapshots rather than compile from source , especially when the source is extremely large , or when the amount of packages that they need to install is large .
To create a binary distribution run the following commands as root :
# make install DESTDIR = / tmp / dist # tar - C / tmp / dist - cvf package - version . tar # gzip - 9 package - version .
tar
The variable DESTDIR specifies a directory , alternative to root , for installing the compiled package .
The directory tree under that directory is the exact same tree that would have normally been installed .
Why not just specify a different prefix ?
Because very often , the prefix that you use to install the software affects the contents of the files that actually get installed .
Please note that under the terms of the GNU General Public License , if you distribute your software as a binary distribution , you also need to provide the corresponding source distribution .
The simplest way to comply with this requirement is to distribute both distributions together .
2 Writing Good Programs
2.1
Why good code is important
When you work on a software project , one of your short - term goals is to solve a problem at hand .
If you are doing this because someone asked you to solve the problem , then all you need to do to look good in per eyes is to deliver a program that works .
Nevertheless , regardless of how little person may appreciate this , doing just that is not good enough .
Once you have code that gives the right answer to a specific set of problems , you will want to make improvements to it .
As you make these improvements , you would like to have proof that your code 's known reliability has n't regressed .
Also , tomorrow you will want to move on to a different set of related problems by repeating as little work as possible .
Finally , one day you may want to pass the project on to someone else or recruit another developer to help you out with certain parts .
You need to make it possible for the other person to get up to speed without reinventing your efforts .
To accomplish these equally important goals you need to write good code .
2.2 Choosing a good programming language
To write a good software , you must use the appropriate programming language and use it well .
To make your software free , it should be possible to compile it with free tools on a free operating system .
Therefore , you should avoid using programming languages that do not have a free compiler .
The C programming language is the native language of GNU , and the GNU coding standards encourage you to program in C .
The main advantages of C are that it can be compiled with the system 's native compiler , many people know C , and it is easy to learn .
Nevertheless , C has weaknesses : it forces you to manually manage memory allocation , and any mistakes you might make can lead to very difficult bugs .
Also C forces you to program at a low level .
Sometimes it is desirable to program at a low level , but there are also cases where you want to build on a higher level .
For projects where you would like a higher - level compiled language , the recommended choice is to use C++.
The GNU project distributes a free C++ compiler and nowadays most GNU systems that have a C compiler also have the free C++ compiler .
The main advantage of C++ is that it will automatically manage dynamic memory allocation for you .
C++ also has a lot of powerful features that allow you to program at a higher level than C , bringing you closer to the algorithms and the concepts involved , and making it easier to write robust programs .
At the same time , C++ does not hide low - level details from you and you have the freedom to do the same low - level hacks that you had in C , if you choose to .
In fact C++ is 99 % backwards compatible with C and it is very easy to mix C and C++ code .
Finally , C++ is an industry standard .
As a result , it has been used to solve a variety of real - world problems and its specification has evolved for many years to make it a powerful and mature language that can tackle such problems effectively .
The C++ specification was frozen and became an ANSI standard in 1998 .
One of the disadvantages of C++ is that C++ object files compiled by different C++ compilers can not be linked together .
In order to compile C++ to machine language , a lot of compilation issues need to be deferred to the linking stage .
Because object file formats are not traditionally sophisticated enough to handle these issues , C++ compilers do various ugly kludges .
The problem is that different compilers do these kludges differently , making object files across compilers incompatible .
This is not a terrible problem , since object files are incompatible across different platforms anyways .
It is only a problem when you want to use more than one compiler on the same platform .
Another disadvantage of C++ is that it is harder to interface a C++ library to another language , than it is to interface a C library .
Finally not as many people know C++ as well as they know C , and C++ is a very extensive and difficult language to master .
However these disadvantages must be weighted against the advantages .
There is a price to using C++ but the price comes with a reward .
If you need a higher - level interpreted language , then the recommended choice is to use Guile .
Guile is the GNU variant of Scheme , a LISP - like programming language .
Guile is an interpreted language , and you can write full programs in Guile , or use the Guile interpreter interactively .
Guile is compatible with the R4RS standard but provides a lot of GNU extensions .
The GNU extensions are so extensive that it is possible to write entire applications in Guile .
Most of the low - level facilities that are available in C , are also available in Guile .
What makes the Guile implementation of Scheme special is not the extensions themselves , but the fact that it it is very easy for any developer to add their own extensions to Guile , by implementing them in C .
By combining C and Guile you leverage the advantages of both compiled and interpreted languages .
Performance critical functionality can be implemented in C and higher - level software development can be done in Guile .
Also , because Guile is interpreted , when you make your C code available through an extended Guile interpreter , then the user can also use the functionality of that code interactively through the interpreter .
The idea of extensible interpreted languages is not new .
Other examples of extensible interpreted languages are Perl , Python and Tcl .
What sets Guile apart from these languages is the elegance of Scheme .
Scheme is the holy grail in the quest for a programming language that can be extended to support any programming paradigm by using the least amount of syntax .
Scheme has natural support for both arbitrary precision integer arithmetic and floating point arithmetic .
The simplicity of Scheme syntax , and the completeness of Guile , make it very easy to implement specialized scripting languages simply by translating them to Scheme .
In Scheme algorithms and data are interchangeable .
As a result , it is easy to write Scheme programs that manipulate Scheme source code .
This makes Scheme an ideal language for writing programs that manipulate algorithms instead of data , such as programs that do symbolic algebra .
Because Scheme can manipulate its own source code , a Scheme program can save its state by writing Scheme source code into a file , and by parsing it later to load it back up again .
This feature alone is one reason why engineers should use Guile to configure and drive numerical simulations .
Some people like to use Fortran 77 .
This is in many ways a good language for developing the computational core of scientific applications .
We do have free compilers for Fortran 77 , so using it does not restrict our freedom .
( see Using Fortran effectively )
Also , Fortran 77 is an aggressively optimized language , and this makes it very attractive to engineers that want to write code optimized for speed .
Unfortunately , Fortran 77 can not do well anything except array - oriented numerical computations .
Managing input / output is unnecessarily difficult with Fortran , and there 's even computational areas , such as infinite precision integer arithmetic and symbolic computation that are not supported .
There are many variants of Fortran like Fortran 90 , and HPF .
Fortran 90 attempts , quite miserably , to make Fortran 77 more like C++. HPF allows engineers to write numerical code that runs on parallel computers .
These variants should be avoided for two reasons :
There are no free compilers for Fortran 90 or HPF .
If you happen to use a proprietary operating system , you might as well make use of proprietary compilers if they generate highly optimized code and that is important to you .
Nevertheless , in order for your software to be freed , it should be possible to compile it with free tools on a free operating system .
Because it is possible to make parallel computers using GNU / Linux ( see the Beowulf project ) , parallelized software can also be free .
Therefore both Fortran 90 and HPF should be avoided .
Another problem with these variants is that they are ad hoc languages that have been invented to enable Fortran to do things that it can not do by design .
Eventually , when engineers will like to do things that Fortran 90 can't do either , it will be necessary to extend Fortran again , rewrite the compilers and produce yet another variant .
What engineers need is a programming language that has the ability to self extend itself by writing software in the same programming language .
The C++ programming language can do this without loss of performance .
The departmentalization of disciplines in academia has made it very difficult for such a project to take off .
Despite that , there is ongoing research in this area .
( for example , see the Blitz ++ project )
If you have written a program entirely in Fortran , please do not ask anyone else to maintain your code , unless person is like you and also knows only Fortran .
If Fortran is the only language that you know , then please learn at least C and C++ and use Fortran only when necessary .
Please do not hold the opinion that contributions in science and engineering are “ true ” contributions and software development is just a “ tool ” .
This bigoted attitude is behind the thousands of lines of ugly unmaintainable code that goes around in many places .
Good software development can be an important contribution in its own right , and regardless of what your goals are , please appreciate it and encourage it .
To maximize the benefits of good software , please make your software free .
( FIXME : Cross reference copyright section in this chapter )
2.3 Developing libraries
The key to better code is to focus away from developing monolithic throw - away hacks that do only one job , and focus on developing libraries ( FIXME : cross reference ) .
Break down the original problem to parts , and the parts to smaller parts , until you get down to simple subproblems that can be easily tested , and from which you can construct solutions for both the original problem and future variants .
Every library that you write is a legacy that you can share with other developers , that want to solve similar problems .
Each library will allow these other developers to focus on their problem and not have to reinvent the parts that are common with your work from scratch .
You should definitely make libraries out of subproblems that are likely to be broadly useful .
Please be very liberal in what you consider “ broadly useful ” .
Please program in a defensive way that renders reusable as much code as possible , regardless of whether or not you plan to reuse it in the near future .
The final application should merely have to assemble all the libraries together and make their functionality accessible to the user through a good interface .
It is very important for each of your libraries to have a complete test suite .
The purpose of the test suite is to detect bugs in the library and to prove to you or convince you , the developer , that the library works .
A test suite is composed of a collection of test programs that link with your libraries and experiment with the features provided by the library .
These test programs should return with
exit( 0 ) ;
if they do not detect anything wrong with the library and with
exit ( 1 ) ;
if they detect problems .
The test programs should not be installed with the rest of the package .
They are meant to be run after your software is compiled and before it is installed .
Therefore , they should be written so that they can run using the compiled but uninstalled files of the library .
Test programs should not output messages by default .
They should run completely quietly and communicate with the environment in a yes or no fashion using the exit code .
However , it is useful for test programs to output debugging information when they fail during development .
Statements that output such information should be surrounded by conditional directives like this :
#if INSPECT_ERRORS
printf ( " Division by zero : %d / %d
" , a , b ) ; #endif
This way it becomes easy to switch them on or off upon demand .
The preferred way to manipulate a macro like this INSPECT_ERRORS is by adding a switch to your configure script .
You can do this by adding the following lines to configure .
in :
AC_ARG_WITH ( inspect , [ -- with - inspect Inspect test suite errors ] , [ AC_DEFINE ( INSPECT_ERRORS , 1 , " Inspect test suite errors " ) ] , [ AC_DEFINE ( INSPECT_ERRORS , 0 , " Inspect test suite errors " ) ] )
After the library is debugged , the debug statements should not be removed .
If a future version of the library regresses and an old test begins to fail again , it will be useful to be able to reactivate the same error messages that were useful in debugging the test when it was first put together , and it may be necessary to add a few new ones .
The best time to write each test program is as soon as it is possible !.
You should not be lazy , and you should not just keep throwing in code after code after code .
The minute there is enough code in there to put together some kind of test program , just do it !
When you write new code , it is easy to think that you are producing work with every new line of code that is written .
The reality is that you know you have produced new work every time you write working a test program for new features , and not a minute before .
Another time when you should definitely write a test program is when you find a bug while ordinarily using the library .
Then , write a test program that triggers the bug , fix the bug , and keep the test in your test suite .
This way , if a future modification reintroduces the same bug it will be detected .
Please document your library as you go .
The best time to update your documentation is immediately after you get new test programs checking out new futures .
You might feel that you are too busy to write documentation , but the truth of the matter is that you will always be too busy .
In fact , if you are a busy person , you are likely to have many other obligations bugging you around for your attention .
There may be times that you have to stay away from a project for a large amount of time .
If you have consistently been maintaining documentation , it will help you refocus on your project even after many months of absence .
2.4 Developing applications
Applications are complete executable programs that can be run by the end -user .
With library - oriented development the actual functionality is developed by writing libraries and debugged by developing test - suites for each library .
With command - line oriented applications , the application source code parses the arguments that are passed to it by the user , and calls up the right functions in the library to carry out the user 's requests .
With GUI 1 applications , the application source code creates the widgets that compose the interface , binds them to actions , and then enters an event loop .
Each action is implemented in terms of the functionality provided by the appropriate library .
It should be possible to implement applications by using relatively few application - specific source files , since most of the functionality is actually done in libraries .
In some cases , the application is simple enough that it would be an overkill to package its functionality as a library .
Nevertheless , in such cases please separate the source code that handles actual functionality from the source code that handles the user interface .
Also , please always separate the code that handles input / output with the code that does actual computations .
If these aspects of your source code are sufficiently separated then you make it easier for other people to reuse parts of your code in their applications .
You also make it easier of yourself to switch to library - oriented development when your application grows and is no longer “ simple enough ” .
Library - oriented development allows you to write good and robust applications .
In return it requires discipline .
Sometimes you may need to add experimental functionality that is not available through your libraries .
The right thing to do is to extend the appropriate library .
The easy thing to do is to implement it as part of your application - specific source code .
If the feature is experimental and undergoing many changes , it may be best to go with the easy approach at first .
Still , when the feature matures , please migrate it to the appropriate library , document it , and take it out of the application source code .
What we mean by discipline is doing these migrations , when the time is right , despite pressures from “ real life ” , such as deadlines , pointy - haired bosses , and nuclear terrorism .
A rule of thumb for deciding when to migrate code to a library is when you find yourself cut -n - pasting chunks of code from application to application .
If you do not do the right thing , your code will become increasingly harder to debug , harder to maintain , and less reliable .
Applications should also be documented , especially the ones that are command - line oriented .
Application documentation should be thorough in explaining to the user all the things that he needs to know to use the application effectively and should be distributed separately from the application itself .
Nevertheless , applications should recognize the -- help switch and output a synopsis of how the application is used .
Applications should also recognize the -- version switch and state their version number .
The easiest way to make applications understand these two switches is to use the GNU Argp library ( FIXME : cross reference ) .
2.5 Free software is good software
One of the reasons why you should write good code is because it allows you to make your code robust , reliable and most useful to your needs .
Another reason is to make it useful to other people too , and make it easier for them to work with your code and reuse it for their own work .
In order for this to be possible , you need to give worry about a few obnoxious legal issues .
2.6 Invoking the ‘ gpl ’ utility
Maintaining these legalese notices can be quite painful after some time .
To ease the burden , Autotools distributes a utility called ‘ gpl ’.
This utility will conveniently generate for you all the legal wording you will ever want to use .
It is important to know that this application is not approved in any way by the Free Software Foundation .
By this I mean that I have n't asked their opinion of it yet .
To create the file COPYING type :
% gpl -l COPYING
If you want to include a copy of the GPL in your documentation , you can generate a copy in texinfo format like this :
% gpl -lt gpl.texi
Also , every time you want to create a new file , use the ‘ gpl ’ to generate the copyright notice .
If you want it covered by the GPL use the standard notice .
If you want to invoke the Guile - like permissions , then also use the library notice .
If you want to grant unlimited permissions , meaning no copyleft , use the special notice .
The ‘ gpl ’ utility takes many different flags to take into account the different commenting conventions .
For a C file , create the standard notice with % gpl -c file . c the library notice with % gpl - cL file .c and the special notice with % gpl - cS file . c
For a C++ file , create the standard notice with % gpl - cc file .cc the library notice with % gpl - ccL file.cc and the special notice with % gpl - ccS file.cc
For a shells script ( BASH , Perl ) that uses hash marks for commenting , create the standard notice with % gpl - sh foo.pl the library notice with % gpl - shL foo.tcl and the special notice with % gpl - shS foo .
pl
It does not make sense to use the library notice , if no executable is being formed from this file .
If however , you parse that file into C code that is then compiled into object code , then you may consider using the library notice on it instead of the special notice .
One of the features provided by Autotools allows you to embed text , such as Tcl scripts , into the executable .
In that case , you can use the library notice to license the original text .
For files that define autoconf macros : % gpl - m4 file .m4
In general , we exempt autoconf macro files from the GNU GPL because the terms of autoconf also exclude its output , the ‘ configure ’ script , from the GPL .
For Makefile.am , or files that describe targets : % gpl - am Makefile.am
For these we also exempt them from the GPL because they are so trivial that it makes no sense to add copyleft protection .
2.7 Inserting notices with Emacs
If you are using GNU Emacs , then you can insert these copyright notices on - demand while you 're editing your source code .
Autotools bundles two Emacs packages : gpl and gpl- copying which provide you with equivalents of the ‘ gpl ’ command that can be run under Emacs .
These packages will be byte - compiled and installed automatically for you while installing Autotools .
To use these packages , in your .emacs you must declare your identity by adding the following commands :
( setq user - mail - address " me@here.com " ) ( setq user - full - name " My Name " )
Then you must require the packages to be loaded :
( require ' gpl ) ( require ' gpl- copying )
These packages introduce a set of Emacs commands all of which are prefixed as gpl- .
To invoke any of these commands press M-x , type the name of the command and press enter .
The following commands will generate notices for your source code :
‘ gpl-c ’
Insert the standard GPL copyright notice using C commenting .
‘ gpl -cL ’ lnsert the standard GPL copyright notice using C commenting , followed by a Guile - like library exception .
This notice is used by the Guile library .
You may want to use it for libraries that you write that implement some type of a standard that you wish to encourage .
You will be prompted for the name of your package .
‘ gpl-cc ’
Insert the standard GPL copyright notice using C++ commenting .
‘ gpl-ccL ’ Insert the standard GPL copyright notice using C++ commenting , followed by a Guile - like library exception .
You will be prompted for the name of your package
‘ gpl-sh ’
Insert the standard GPL copyright notice using shell commenting ( i.e. has marks ) .
‘ gpl-shL ’ Insert the standard GPL copyright notice using shell commenting , followed by a Guile - like library exception .
This can be useful for source files , like Tcl files , which are executable code that gets linked in to form an executable , and which use hash marks for commenting .
‘ gpl-shS ’ Insert the standard GPL notice using shell commenting , followed by the special Autoconf exception .
This is useful for small shell scripts that are distributed as part of a build system .
‘ gpl -m4 ’ Insert the standard GPL copyright notice using m4 commenting ( i.e. dnl ) and the special Autoconf exception .
This is the preferred notice for new Autoconf macros .
‘ gpl-el ’ Insert the standard GPL copyright notice using Elisp commenting .
This is useful for writing Emacs extension files in Elisp .
‘ gpl-insert - copying - texinfo ’
Insert a set of paragraphs very similar to the ones appearing at the Copying section of this manual .
It is a good idea to include this notice in an unnumbered chapter titled “ Copying ” in the Texinfo documentation of your source code .
You will be prompted for the title of your package .
That title will substitute the word Autotools as it appears in the corresponding section in this manual .
‘ gpl-insert - license - texinfo ’ Insert the full text of the GNU General Public License in Texinfo format .
If your documentation is very extensive , it may be a good idea to include this notice either at the very beginning of your manual , or at the end .
You should include the full license , if you plan to distribute the manual separately from the package as a printed book .
3 Using GNU Emacs
Emacs is an environment for running Lisp programs that manipulate text interactively .
To call Emacs merely an editor does not do it justice , unless you redefine the word “ editor ” to the broadest meaning possible .
Emacs is so extensive , powerful and flexible , that you can almost think of it as a self - contained “ operating system ” in its own right .
Emacs is a very important part of the GNU development tools because it provides an integrated environment for software development .
The simplest thing you can do with Emacs is edit your source code .
However , you can do a lot more than that .
You can run a debugger , and step through your program while Emacs shows you the corresponding sources that you are stepping through .
You can browse on - line Info documentation and man pages , download and read your email off - line , and follow discussions on newsgroups .
Emacs is particularly helpful with writing documentation with the Texinfo documentation system .
You will find it harder to use Texinfo , if you do n't use Emacs .
It is also very helpful with editing files on remote machines over FTP , especially when your connection to the internet is over a slow modem .
Finally , and most importantly , Emacs is programmable .
You can write Emacs functions in Emacs Lisp to automate any chore that you find particularly useful in your own work .
Because Emacs Lisp is a full programming language , there is no practical limit to what you can do with it .
If you already know a lot about Emacs , you can skip this chapter and move on .
If you are a “ vi ” user , then we will assimilate you : See Using vi emulation , for details .

This chapter will be most useful to the novice user who would like to set per Emacs up and running for software development , however it is not by any means comprehensive .
See Further reading on Emacs , for references to more comprehensive Emacs documentation .
3.1 Introduction to Emacs
Emacs is an environment for running Lisp programs that manipulate text interactively .
Because Emacs is completely programmable , it can be used to implement not only editors , but a full integrated development environment for software development .
Emacs can also browse info documentation , run email clients , a newsgroup reader , a sophisticated xterm , and an understanding psychotherapist .
Under the X window system , Emacs controls multiple x-windows called frames .
Each frame has a menu bar and the main editing area .
The editing area is divided into windows with horizontal bars .
You can grab these bars and move them around with the first mouse button .
3
Each window is bound to a buffer .
A buffer is an Emacs data structure that contains text .
Most editing commands operate on buffers , modifying their contents .
When a buffer is bound to a window , then you can see its contents as they are being changed .
It is possible for a buffer to be bound to two windows , on different frames or on the same frame .
Then whenever a change is made to the buffer , it is reflected on both windows .
It is not necessary for a buffer to be bound to a window , in order to operate on it .
In a typical Emacs session you may be manipulating more buffers than the windows that you have on your screen .
A buffer can be visiting files .
In that case , the contents of the buffer reflect the contents of a file that is being edited .
But buffers can be associated with anything you like , so long as you program it up .
For example , under the Dired directory editor , a buffer is bound to a directory , showing you the contents of the directory .
When you press < Enter > while the cursor is over a file name , Emacs creates a new buffer , visits the file , and rebinds the window with that buffer .
From the user 's perspective , by pressing < Enter > he “ opened ” the file for editing .
If the file has already been “ opened ” then Emacs simply rebinds the existing buffer for that file .
Emacs uses a variant of LISP , called Emacs LISP , as its programming language .
Every time you press a key , click the mouse , or select an entry from the menu bar , an Emacs LISP function is evaluated .
The mode of the buffer determines , among many other things , what function to evaluate .
This way , every buffer can be associated with functionality that defines what you do in that buffer .
For example you can program your buffer to edit text , to edit source code , to read news , and so on .
You can also run LISP functions directly on the current buffer by typing M-x and the name of the function that you want to run .
4
What is known as the “ Emacs editor ” is the default implementation of an editor under the Emacs system .
If you prefer the vi editor , then you can instead run a vi clone , Viper ( see Using vi emulation ) .
The main reason why you should use Emacs , is not the particular editor , but the way Emacs integrates editing with all the other functions that you like to do as a software developer .
For example :
You can edit multiple files under one program .
From the user perspective , you can edit two different parts of a file under two different x-windows .
And when you revisit a file , the cursor is placed where it was the last time you were editing the file .
You can quickly browse a directory and navigate from file to file .
You can also do simple operations on files , without needing to go to a shell .
You can transparently edit files over FTP .
This is extremely valuable if you are editing source code on a remote computer and you are connected through a modem link .
You can have a running shell for typing unix commands , and access the same shell from any Emacs frame .
You can use that shell to run ‘ reconf ’ , ‘ configure ’ and ‘ make ’.
You can also save the contents of your session to a file .
’ , ‘ ’ and ‘ ’.
You can also save the contents of your session to a file .
Color is used to highlight syntactic information about the text .
This makes browsing more pleasing to the eye , and it can also help you catch syntactic mistakes .
Emacs understands the syntax of most types of files you are likely to edit and will color them up for you accordingly .
When you edit source code under Emacs , it will automatically be formatted for you to conform to the GNU coding standards .
At your request , appropriate copyright notices can be inserted .
( see Inserting notices with Emacs )
When you make changes to a file , Emacs can automatically warp you to the appropriate ChangeLog file to record your changes .
It will handle formatting details for you allowing you to focus on content .
( see Maintaining the documentation files )
file to record your changes .
It will handle formatting details for you allowing you to focus on content .
( see Maintaining the documentation files ) Emacs is invaluably helpful for writing Texinfo documentation .
In fact , it is excruciatingly painful to maintain Texinfo documentation without using Emacs .
( see GNU Emacs support for Texinfo )
You can run the gdb debugger under Emacs and use it to step through your code .
As you do that , Emacs will show you on a separate buffer the code that is currently being stepped through .
debugger under Emacs and use it to step through your code .
As you do that , Emacs will show you on a separate buffer the code that is currently being stepped through .
You can read email and newsgroups .
If you are connected over a modem , all your editing is done locally , so you do not get bogged down by the speed of your connection .
You can apply patches that you get through email or news to your source code directly , without needing to save the message to a file .
Emacs currently supports almost every international language , even languages that do not use the Roman alphabet , like Greek , Chinese , Hebrew , Tibetan , etc .
All of these features make Emacs a very powerful , albeit unusual , integrated development environment .
Many users of proprietary operating systems , like Lose95 5 , complain that GNU ( and Unix ) does not have an integrated development environment .
As a matter of fact it does .
All of the above features make Emacs a very powerful IDE .
Emacs has its own very extensive documentation ( see Further reading on Emacs ) .
In this manual we will only go over the fundamentals for using Emacs effectively as an integrated development environment .
3.2 Installing GNU Emacs
If Emacs is not installed on your system , you will need to get a source code distribution and compile it yourself .
Installing Emacs is not difficult .
If Emacs is already installed on your GNU / Linux system , you might still need to reinstall it : you might not have the most recent version , you might have XEmacs instead , you might not have support for internationalization , or your Emacs might not have compiled support for reading mail over POP ( a feature very useful to developers that hook up over modem ) .
If any of these is the case , then uninstall that version of Emacs , and reinstall Emacs from a source code distribution .
The entire Emacs source code is distributed in three separate files :
emacs-21.2.tar.gz
This is the main Emacs distribution .
If you do not care about international language support , you can install this by itself .
leim -21.2.tar.gz
This supplements the Emacs distribution with support for multiple languages .
If you develop internationalized software , it is likely that you will need this .
intlfonts -1.1.tar.gz
This file contains the fonts that Emacs uses to support international languages .
If you want international language support , you will definitely need this .
% gunzip emacs -21.2.tar.gz % tar xf emacs - 21.2.tar % gunzip leim - 21.2.tar.gz % tar xf leim - 21.2.tar
Both tarballs will unpack under the emacs - 21.2 directory .
When this is finished , configure the source code with the following commands :
% cd emacs - 21.2 % ./ configure --with-pop -- with- gssapi % make
The ‘ -- with - pop ’ flag is almost always a good idea , especially if you are running Emacs from a home computer that is connected to the internet over modem .
It will let you use Emacs to download your email from your internet provider and read it off - line ( see Using Emacs as an email client ) .
Most internet providers use GSSAPI - authenticated POP .
If you need to support other authentication protocols however , you may also want to add one of the following flags :
-- with - kerberos support Kerberos - authenticated POP
-- with-kerberos5 support Kerberos version 5 authenticated POP
-- with - hesiod support Hesiod to get the POP server host
$ make # make install
Emacs is a very large program , so this will take a while .
To install intlfonts - 1.1.tar.gz unpack it , and follow the instructions in the README file .
Alternatively , you may find it more straightforward to install it from a Debian package .
Packages for intlfonts exist as of Debian 2.1 .
3.3 Basic Emacs concepts
In this section we describe what Emacs is and what it does .
We will not yet discuss how to make Emacs work .
That discussion is taken up in the subsequent sections , starting with Configuring GNU Emacs .
This section instead covers the fundamental ideas that you need to understand in order to make sense out of Emacs .
You can run Emacs from a text terminal , such as a vt100 terminal , but it is usually nicer to run Emacs under the X - windows system .
To start Emacs type
% emacs &
on your shell prompt .
The seasoned GNU developer usually sets up per X configuration such that it starts Emacs when person logs in .
Then , person uses that Emacs process for all of per work until person logs out .
To quit Emacs press C-x C-c , or select
Files ==> Exit Emacs
from the menu .
The notation C - c means < CTRL >-c .
The separating dash ‘ - ’ means that you press the key after the dash while holding down the key before the dash .
Be sure to quit Emacs before logging out , to ensure that your work is properly saved .
If there are any files that you have n't yet saved , Emacs will prompt you and ask you if you want to save them , before quiting .
If at any time you want Emacs to stop doing what it 's doing , press C - g .
Under the X window system , Emacs controls multiple x-windows which are called frames .
Each frame has a menu bar and the main editing area .
The editing area is divided into windows 6 by horizontal bars , called status bars .
Every status bar contains concise information about the status of the window above the status bar .
The minimal editing area has at least one big window , where editing takes place , and a small one - line window called the minibuffer .
Emacs uses the minibuffer to display brief messages and to prompt the user to enter commands or other input .
The minibuffer has no status bar of its own .
Each window is bound to a buffer .
A buffer is an Emacs data structure that contains text .
Most editing commands operate on buffers , modifying their contents .
When a buffer is bound to a window , then you can see its contents as they are being changed .
It is possible for a buffer to be bound to two windows , on different frames or on the same frame .
Then whenever a change is made to the buffer , it is reflected on both windows .
It is not necessary for a buffer to be bound to a window , in order to operate on it .
In a typical Emacs session you may be manipulating more buffers than the windows that you actually have on your screen .
A buffer can be visiting files .
In that case , the contents of the buffer reflect the contents of a file that is being edited .
But buffers can be associated with anything you like , so long as you program it up .
For example , under the Dired directory editor , a buffer is bound to a directory , showing you the contents of the directory .
When you press < RET > while the cursor is over a file name , Emacs creates a new buffer , visits the file , and rebinds the window with that buffer .
From the user 's perspective , by pressing < RET > person “ opened ” the file for editing .
If the file has already been “ opened ” then Emacs simply rebinds the existing buffer for that file .
Sometimes Emacs will divide a frame to two or more windows .
You can switch from one window to another by clicking the 1st mouse button , while the mouse is inside the destination window .
To resize these windows , grab the status bar with the 1st mouse button and move it up or down .
Pressing the 2nd mouse button , while the mouse is on a status bar , will bury the window bellow the status bar .
Pressing the 3rd mouse button will bury the window above the status bar , instead .
Buried windows are not killed ; they still exist and you can get back to them by selecting them from the menu bar , under :
Buffers == > name - of - buffer
Buffers , with some exceptions , are usually named after the filenames of the files that they correspond to .
Once you visit a file for editing , then all you need to do is to edit it !
The best way to learn how to edit files using the standard Emacs editor is by working through the on-line Emacs tutorial .
To start the on - line tutorial type C-h t or select :
Help == > Emacs Tutorial
If you are a vi user , or you simply prefer to use `vi ' key bindings , then read Using vi emulation .
In Emacs , every event causes a Lisp function to be executed .
An event can be any keystroke , mouse movement , mouse clicking or dragging , or a menu bar selection .
The function implements the appropriate response to the event .
Almost all of these functions are written in a variant of Lisp called Emacs Lisp .
The actual Emacs program , the executable , is an Emacs Lisp interpreter with the implementation of frames , buffers , and so on .
However , the actual functionality that makes Emacs usable is implemented in Emacs Lisp .
Sometimes , Emacs will bind a few words of text to an Emacs function .
For example , when you use Emacs to browse
Info documentation , certain words that corresponds to hyperlinks to other nodes are bound to a function that makes Emacs follow the hyperlink .
When such a binding is actually installed , moving the mouse over the bound text highlights it momentarily .
While the text is highlighted , you can invoke the binding by clicking the 2nd mouse button .
Sometimes , an Emacs function might go into an infinite loop , or it might start doing something that you want to stop .
You can always make Emacs abort 7 the function it is currently running by pressing C - g .
Emacs functions are usually spawned by Emacs itself in response to an event .
However , the user can also spawn an Emacs function by typing :
< ALT >-x function - name < RET >
These functions can also be aborted with C - g .
It is standard in Emacs documentation to refer to the < ALT > key with the letter ‘ M ’.
So , in the future , we will be referring to function invocations as :
M-x function - name
Because Emacs functionality is implemented in an event - driven fashion , the Emacs developer has to write Lisp functions that implement functionality , and then bind these functions to events .
Tables of such bindings are called keymaps .
Emacs has a global keymap , which is in effect at all times , and then it has specialized keymaps depending on what editing mode you use .
Editing modes are selected when you visit a file depending on the name of the file .
So , for example , if you visit a C file , Emacs goes into the C mode .
If you visit Makefile , Emacs goes into makefile mode .
The reason for associating different modes with different types of files is that the user 's editing needs depend on the type of file that person is editing .
You can also enter a mode by running the Emacs function that initializes the mode .
Here are the most commonly used modes :
M-x c-mode Mode for editing C programs according to the GNU coding standards .
M-x c++-mode Mode for editing C++ programs
M-x sh-mode Mode for editing shell scripts .
M-x m4 - mode Mode for editing Autoconf macros .
M-x texinfo - mode Mode for editing documentation written in the Texinfo formatting language .
See Introduction to Texinfo .
M-x makefile - mode Mode for editing makefiles .
3.4 Configuring GNU Emacs
To use Emacs effectively for software development you need to configure it .
Part of the configuration needs to be done in your X - resources file .
On a Debian GNU / Linux system , the X - resources can be configured by editing
/etc/X11/Xresources
In many systems , you can configure X - resources by editing a file called .
Xresources or .
Xdefaults on your home directory , but that is system - dependent .
The configuration that I use on my system is :
! Emacs defaults emacs * Background : Black emacs * Foreground : White emacs*pointerColor : White emacs*cursorColor :
White emacs * bitmapIcon : on emacs * font : fixed emacs * geometry : 80x40
In general I favor dark backgrounds and ‘ fixed ’ fonts .
Dark backgrounds make it easier to sit in front of the monitor for a prolonged period of time .
‘ fixed ’ fonts looks nice and it's small enough to make efficient use of your screen space .
Some people might prefer larger fonts however .
When Emacs starts up , it looks for a file called .emacs at the user 's home directory , and evaluates its contents through the Emacs Lisp interpreter .
You can customize and modify Emacs ' behaviour by adding commands , written in Emacs Lisp , to this file .
Here 's a brief outline of the ways in which you can customize Emacs :
A common change to the standard configuration is assigning global variables to non-default values .
Many Emacs features and behaviours can be controlled and customized this way .
This is done with the ‘ setq ’ command , which accepts the following syntax : ( setq variable value )
For example : ( setq viper - mode t) You can access on - line documentation for global variables by running : M-x describe - variable
In some cases , Emacs depends on the values of shell environment variables .
These can be manipulated with ‘ setenv ’ : ( setenv " variable " " value " )
For example : ( setenv " INFOPATH " " /usr/info:/usr/local / info " ) ‘ setenv ’ does not affect the shell that invoked Emacs , but it does affect Emacs itself , and shells that are run under Emacs .
Another way to enhance your Emacs configuration is by modifying the global keymap .
This can be done with the ‘ global - set - key ’ command , which follows the following syntax : ( global - set - key [ key sequence ] ' function )
For example , adding : ( global - set - key [ F12 d ] ' doctor ) to .emacs makes the key sequence F12 d equivalent to running ‘ M-x doctor ’.
Emacs has many functions that provide all sorts of features .
To find out about specific functions , consult the Emacs user manual .
Once you know that a function exists , you can also get on - line documentation for it by running : M-x describe - function
You can also write your own functions in Emacs Lisp .
It is not always good to introduce bindings to the global map .
Any bindings that are useful only within a certain mode should be added only to the local keymap of that mode .
Consider for example the following Emacs Lisp function : ( defun texi- insert - @example () " Insert an @example @end example block " ( interactive ) ( beginning - of - line ) ( insert "
@example
" ) ( save - excursion ( insert "
" ) ( insert " @end example
" ) ( insert "
@noindent
" ) ) )
We would like to bind this function to the key ‘ F9 ’ , however we would like this binding to be in effect only when we are within ‘ texinfo - mode ’.
To do that , first we must define a hook function that establishes the local bindings using ‘ define - key ’ : ( defun texinfo - elef - hook ( ) ( define - key texinfo - mode - map [ F9 ] ' texi- insert - @example ) )
The syntax of ‘ define - key ’ is similar to ‘ global - set - key ’ except it takes the name of the local keymap as an additional argument .
The local keymap of any ‘ name - mode ’ is ‘ name - mode - map ’.
Finally , we must ask ‘ texinfo - mode ’ to call the function ‘ texinfo - elef - hook ’.
To do that use the ‘ add - hook ’ command : ( add - hook ' t exinfo - mode - hook ' t exinfo - elef - hook )
In some cases , Emacs itself will provide you with a few optional hooks that you can attach to your modes .
You can write your own modes !
If you write a program whose use involves editing some type of input files , it is very much appreciated by the community if you also write an Emacs mode for that file and distribute it with your program .
With the exception of simple customizations , most of the more complicated ones require that you write new Emacs Lisp functions , distribute them with your software and somehow make them visible to the installer 's Emacs when person installs your software .
See Emacs Lisp with Automake , for more details on how to include Emacs Lisp packages to your software .
Here are some simple customizations that you might want to add to your .emacs file :
Set your default background and foreground color for all your Emacs frames : ( set - background - color " black " ) ( set - foreground - color " white " )
You can change the colors to your liking .
Tell Emacs your name and your email address .
This is particularly useful when you work on an off - line home system but you want Emacs to use the email address of your internet provider , and your real name .
Specifying your real name is necessary if you call yourself “ Skeletor ” or “ Dude ” on your home computer .
( setq user - mail - address " karl@whitehouse.com " ) ( setq user - full - name " President Karl Marx " )
Make sure the name is your real name , and the email address that you include can receive email 24 hours per day .
Add a few toys to the status bar .
These commands tell Emacs to display a clock , and the line and column number of your cursor 's position at all times .
( display - time ) ( line - number - mode 1 ) ( column - number - mode 1 )
When you use the mouse to cut and paste text with Emacs , mouse button 1 will select text and mouse button 2 will paste it .
Unfortunately , when you click mouse button 2 , emacs will first move the cursor at the location of the mouse , and then insert the text in that location .
If you are used to editing with vi under xterm , you will instead prefer to position the cursor yourself , and use mouse button 2 to simply cause the text to be pasted without changing the position of the cursor .
If you prefer this behaviour , then add the following line to your .emacs : ( global - set - key [ mouse - 2 ] ' yank )
By default , selected text in Emacs buffers is highlighted with blue color .
However , you can also select and paste into an Emacs buffer text that you select from other applications , like your web browser , or your xterm .
: Use font - lock .
Font - lock decorates your edited text with colors that make it easier to read text with complicated syntax , such as software source codes .
This is one of the coolest features of Emacs .
To use it , add the following lines to your .emacs : ( global - font - lock - mode t ) ( setq font - lock - maximum - size nil )

To use it , add the following lines to your :
To get rid of the scrollbar at the left of your Emacs window , type ( setq scroll - bar - mode nil )
The only reason that the scrollbar is default is to make Emacs more similar to what lusers are used to .
It is assumed that seasoned hacker , who will be glad to see the scrollbar bite it , will figure out how to make it go away .
With most versions of Emacs , you should add the following to your .emacs to make sure that editing configure .
in takes you to m4 - mode and editing Makefile .am takes you to makefile - mode .
( setq auto - mode - alist ( append '( ( " configure.in " . m 4 - mode ) ( " \\.m4\\ ' " . m 4 - mode ) ( " \\.am\\ ' " . makefile - mode ) ) auto - mode - alist ) )

3.5 Using vi emulation
Many hackers prefer to use the ‘ vi ’ editor .
The ‘ vi ’ editor is the standard editor on Unix .
It is also always available on GNU / Linux .
Many system administrators find it necessary to use vi , especially when they are in the middle of setting up a system in which Emacs has not been installed yet .
Besides that , there are many compelling reasons why people like vi .
Vi requires only two special keys : the < SHIFT > key and the < ESC > key .
All the other keys that you need are standard on all keyboards .
You do not need < CTRL > ,< ALT > , the cursor keys or any of the function keys .
Some terminals that miss the escape key , usually have the control key and you can get escape with : < CTRL >-[
Vi was designed to deal with terminals that connect to mainframes over a very slow line .
So it has been optimized to allow you to do the most editing possible with the fewest keystrokes .
This allows users to edit text very efficiently .
Vi allows your fingers to stay at the center of the keyboard , with the occasional hop to the escape key .
It does not require you to stretch your fingers in funny control combinations , which makes typing less tiring and more comfortable .
The vi emulation package for the Emacs system is called Viper .
To use Viper , add the following lines in your .emacs :
( setq viper - mode t ) ( setq viper - inhibit - startup - message 't ) ( setq viper - expert - level ' 3 ) ( require ' viper )
We recommend expert level 3 , as the most balanced blend of the vi editor with the Emacs system .
Most editing modes are aware of Viper , and when you begin editing the text you are immediately thrown into Viper .
Some modes however do not do that .
In some modes , like the Dired mode , this is very appropriate .
In other modes however , especially custom modes that you have added to your system , Viper does not know about them , so it does not configure them to enter Viper mode by default .
To tell a mode to enter Viper by default , add a line like the following to your .emacs file :
( add - hook ' m4 - mode - hook ' viper- mode )
The modes that you are most likely to use during software development are
c-mode , c++- mode , texinfo - mode sh- mode , m4 - mode , makefile - mode
Sometimes , Emacs will enter Viper mode by default in modes where you prefer to get Emacs modes .
In some versions of Emacs , the compilation - mode is such a mode .
To tell a mode not to enter Viper by default , add a line like the following to your .emacs file :
( add - hook ' compilation - mode-hook ' viper-change-state-to-emacs )
The Emacs distribution has a Viper manual .
For more details on setting Viper up , you should read that manual .
The vi editor has these things called editing modes .
An editing mode defines how the editor responds to your keystrokes .
Vi has three editing modes : insert mode , replace mode and command mode .
If you run Viper , there is also the Emacs mode .
Emacs indicates which mode you are in by showing one of ‘ < I > ’ , ‘ < R > ’ , ‘ < V > ’ , ‘ < E > ’ on the statusbar correspondingly for the Insert , Replace , Command and Emacs modes .
Emacs also shows you the mode by the color of the cursor .
This makes it easy for you to keep track of which mode you are in .
Insert mode :
When you are in insert mode , the editor simply inserts the things that you type into the text that is being edited .
If there are any characters in front of your cursor , these characters are pushed ahead and they are not overwritten .
Under Viper , when you are in insert mode , the color of your cursor is green .
The only key that has special meaning , while you are in insert mode is < ESC > .
If you press the escape key , you are taken to command mode .
: When you are in insert mode , the editor simply the things that you type into the text that is being edited .

The only key that has special meaning , while you are in insert mode is < ESC > .
If you press the escape key , you are taken to .
Replace mode :
When you are in replace mode , the editor replaces the text under the cursor with the text that is being typed .
So , you want insert mode when you want to write over what 's already written .
Under Viper , when you are in replace mode , the color of your cursor is red .
The < ESC > will take you to command mode .
: When you are in replace mode , the editor replaces the text under the cursor with the text that is being typed .
So , you want insert mode when you want to write over what 's already written .
Under Viper , when you are in replace mode , the color of your cursor is red .
The < ESC > will take you to Command mode :
When you are in command mode , every letter key that you press is a command and has a special meaning .
Some of these keys allow you to navigate the text .
Other keys allow you to enter either insert or replace mode .
And other keys do various special things .
Under Viper , when you are in command mode , the color of your cursor is white .
: When you are in command mode , every letter key that you press is a command and has a special meaning .
Some of these keys allow you to navigate the text .
Other keys allow you to enter either insert or replace mode .
And other keys do various special things .
Under Viper , when you are in command mode , the color of your cursor is white .
Emacs mode :
When you are in Emacs mode , then Viper is turned off on the specific buffer , and Emacs behaves as the default Emacs editor .
You can switch between Emacs mode and Command mode by pressing < CTRL >-z .
So to go to Emacs mode , from Insert of Replace mode , you need to go through Command mode .
When you are dealing with a buffer that runs a special editing mode , like Dired , Emacs defines a specialized “ command mode ” for manipulating that buffer , that can be completely different from the canonical Viper command mode .
You want to be in that mode to access the intended functionality .
Occasionally however , you may like to hop to viper 's command mode to navigate the buffer , do a search or save the buffer 's contents .
When you hop to one of the other three modes , the buffer will suddenly be just text to your editor .
The following keystrokes allow you to navigate the cursor around your text without making any changes on the text itself h moves one character to the left
j moves down one line
k moves up one line
l moves one character to the left
w moves forward one word
5w moves forward five words ( get the idea ? )
b moves back one word
0 moves to the beginning of the current line
$ moves to the end of the current line
G moves to the last line in the file
1G moves to the first line in the file
:10 moves to line 10 in the file ( get the idea ? )
{ moves up one paragraph
} moves down one paragraph
The following keystrokes allow you to delete text x
Deletes the character under the cursor
dd Deletes the current line
4dd Deletes four lines
dw Deletes the current word
8dw Deletes the next eight words
The following keystrokes allow you to enter Insert mode a Append text after the cursor position
i Insert text at the current cursor position
o Insert text on a new line bellow the current line
O Insert text on a new line above the current line
The following keystrokes allow you to enter Replace mode .
R Replace text at the cursor position and stay in Replace mode .
s Replace ( substitute ) only the character at the cursor position , and enter Insert mode for all subsequent characters .
The following commands handle file input / output .
All of these commands are prepended by the : character .
The : character is used for commands that require many characters to be properly expressed .
The full text of these commands is entered in the minibuffer .
Under viper , the minibuffer itself can run under insert , replace and command mode .
By default you get insert mode , but you can switch to command mode by pressing < ESC >. :w
Save the file to the disk
:w!
Force the file to be saved to disk even when file permissions do not allow it but you have the power to overrule the permissions .
:w filename < RET >
Save the file to the disk under a specific filename .
When you press < SPACE >
Emacs inserts the full pathname of the current directory for you , which you can edit if you like .
:w! filename < RET >
Force the file to be saved to the disk under a specific filename .
:r filename < RET >
Paste a file from the disk at the cursor 's current position .
: W Save all the files on all the Emacs buffers that correspond to open files .
:q Kill the buffer .
This does not quite the editor at expert level 3 .
:q!
Kill the buffer even if the contents are not saved .
Use with caution !

3.6 Navigating source code
When you develop software , you need to edit many files at the same time , and you need an efficient way to switch from one file to another .
The most general solution in Emacs is by going through Dired , the Emacs Directory Editor .
To use Dired effectively , we recommend that you add the following customizations to your .emacs file : First , add
( add - hook ' dired - load - hook ( function ( lambda ( ) ( load " dired - x " ) ) ) ) ( setq dired - omit - files - p t )
to activate the extended features of Dired .
Then add the following key - bindings to the global keymap :
( global - set - key [ f1 ] ' dired ) ( global - set - key [ f2 ] ' dired - omit - toggle ) ( global - set - key [ f3 ] ' shell ) ( global - set - key [ f4 ] ' find - file ) ( global - set - key [ f5 ] ' compile ) ( global - set - key [ f6 ] ' visit - tags - table ) ( global - set - key [ f8 ] ' add - change - log-entry - other - window ) ( global - set - key [ f12 ] ' make - frame )
If you use viper ( see Using vi emulation ) , you should also add the following customization to your .emacs :
( add - hook ' compilation - mode-hook ' viper-change-state-to-emacs )
With these bindings , you can navigate from file to file or switch between editing and the shell simply by pressing the right function keys .
Here 's what these key bindings do :
f1 Enter the directory editor .
f2 Toggle the omission of boring files .
f3 Get a shell at the current Emacs window .
f4 Jump to a file , by filename .
f5 Run a compilation job .
f6 Load a TAGS file .
f8 Update the ChangeLog file .
f 12 Make a new frame .
f12
f1
f4
To go down a directory , move the cursor over the directory filename and press RET .
To go up a few directories , press f1 and when you are prompted for the new directory , with the current directory as the default choice , erase your way up the hierarchy and press < RET > .
To jump to a substantially different directory that you have visited recently , press f1 and then when prompted for the destination directory name , use the cursor keys to select the directory that you want among the list of directories that you have recently visited .
While in the directory navigator , you can use the cursor keys to move to another file .
Pressing << RET >> will bring that file up for editing .
However there are many other things that Dired will let you do instead :
Z Compress the file .
If already compressed , uncompress it .
L Parse the file through the Emacs Lisp interpreter .
Use this only on files that contain Emacs Lisp code .
I , N Visit the current file as an Info file , or as a man page .
See Browsing documentation .
d Mark the file for deletion
u Remove a mark on the file for deletion
x Delete all the files marked for deletion
C destination < RET >
Copy the file to destination .
R filename < RET >
Rename the file to filename .
+ directoryname < RET >
Create a directory with name directoryname .
GNU Emacs User Manual
Emacs provides another method for jumping from file to file : tags .
Suppose that you are editing a C program whose source code is distributed in many files , and while editing the source for the function foo , you note that it is calling another function gleep .
If you move your cursor on gleep , then Emacs will let you jump to the file where gleep is defined by pressing M-. .
You can also jump to other occurences in your code where gleep is invoked by pressing M- , .
In order for this to work , you need to do two things : you need to generate a tags file , and you need to tell emacs to load the file .
If your source code is maintained with the GNU build system , you can create that tags files by typing :
% make tags
from the top - level directory of your source tree .
Then load the tags file in Emacs by navigating Dired to the top - level directory of your source code , and pressing f6 .
While editing a file , you may want to hop to the shell prompt to run a program .
You can do that at any time , on any frame , by pressing f3 .
To get out of the shell , and back into the file that you were editing , enter the directory editor by pressing f1 , and then press < RET > repeatedly .
The default selections will take you back to the file that you were most recently editing on that frame .
One very nice feature of Emacs is that it understands tar files .
If you have a tar file foo. tar and you select it under Dired , then Emacs will load the entire file , parse it , and let you edit the individual files that it includes directly .
This only works , however , when the tar file is not compressed .
Usually tar files are distributed compressed , so you should uncompress them first with Z before entering them .
Also , be careful not to load an extremely huge tar file .
Emacs may mean “ eating memory and constantly swapping ” to some people , but do n't push it !
Another very powerful feature of Emacs is the Ange - FTP package : it allows you to edit files on other computers , remotely , over an FTP connection .
From a user perspective , remote files behave just like local files .
All you have to do is press f1 or f4 and request a directory or file with filename following this form :
/ username @ host :/ pathname
Then Emacs will access for you the file / pathname on the remote machine host by logging in over FTP as username .
You will be prompted for a password , but that will happen only once per host .
Emacs will then download the file that you want to edit and let you make your changes locally .
When you save your changes , Emacs will use an FTP connection again to upload the new version back to the remote machine , replacing the older version of the file there .
When you develop software on a remote computer , this feature can be very useful , especially if your connection to the Net is over a slow modem line .
This way you can edit remote files just like you do with local files .
You will still have to telnet to the remote computer to get a shell prompt .
In Emacs , you can do this with M-x telnet .
An advantage to telneting under Emacs is that it records your session , and you can save it to a file to browse it later .
While you are making changes to your files , you should also be keeping a diary of these changes in a ChangeLog file ( see Maintaining the documentation files ) .
Whenever you are done with a modification that you would like to log , press f8 , while the cursor is still at the same file , and preferably near the modification ( for example , if you are editing a C program , be inside the same C function ) .
Emacs will split the frame to two windows .
The new window brings up your ChangeLog file .
Record your changes and click on the status bar that separates the two windows with the 2nd mouse button to get rid of the ChangeLog file .
Because updating the log is a frequent chore , this Emacs help is invaluable .
If you would like to compile your program , you can use the shell prompt to run ‘ make ’.
However , the Emacs way is to use the M-x compile command .
Press f5 .
Emacs will prompt you for the command that you would like to run .
You can enter something like : ‘ configure ’ , ‘ make ’ , ‘ make dvi ’ , and so on ( see Installing a GNU package ) .
The directory on which this command will run is the current directory of the current buffer .
If your current buffer is visiting a file , then your command will run on the same directory as the file .
If your current buffer is the directory editor , then your command will run on that directory .
When you press < RET > , Emacs will split the frame into another window , and it will show you the command 's output on that window .
If there are error messages , then Emacs converts these messages to hyperlinks and you can follow them by pressing < RET > while the cursor is on them , or by clicking on them with the 2nd mouse button .
When you are done , click on the status bar with the 2nd mouse button to get the compilation window off your screen .
3.7 Using Emacs as an email client
You can use Emacs to read your email .
If you maintain free software , or in general maintain a very active internet life , you will get a lot of email .
The Emacs mail readers have been designed to address the needs of software developers who get endless tons of email every day .
Emacs has two email programs : Rmail and Gnus .
Rmail is simpler to learn , and it is similar to many other mail readers .
The philosophy behind Rmail is that instead of separating messages to different folders , you attach labels to each message but leave the messages on the same folder .
Then you can tell Rmail to browse only messages that have specific labels .
Gnus , on the other hand , has a rather eccentric approach to email .
It is a news - reader , so it makes your email look like another newsgroup !
This is actually very nice if you are subscribed to many mailing lists and want to sort your email messages automatically .
To learn more about Gnus , read the excellent Gnus manual .
In this manual , we will only describe Rmail .
When you start Rmail , it moves any new mail from your mailboxes to the file ~/ RMAIL in your home directory .
So , the first thing you need to tell Rmail is where your mailboxes are .
To do that , add the following to your .emacs :
( require ' rmail ) ( setq rmail - primary - inbox - list ( list " mailbox1 " " mailbox2 " ... ) )
If your mailboxes are on a filesystem that is mounted to your computer , then you just have to list the corresponding filenames .
If your mailbox is on a remote computer , then you have to use the POP protocol to download it to your own computer .
In order for this to work , the
Mr. Crandall said the jury was still out on the Eclipse plane and he has yet to order any .
Nevertheless , Eclipse , which has received more than $ 500 million in investment , including an undisclosed sum from Microsoft ’s founder , Bill Gates , has received contracts to build 2,500 aircraft for a total of $ 3.5 billion in sales , an order book big enough to keep the company busy through late 2008 , said Vern Raburn , Eclipse ’s chief executive .
Mr. Raburn , an early employee at Microsoft , is a friend of Mr. Gates .
Among the first to put the Eclipse into service will be Linear Air , founded in 2004 by Mr. Herp , an entrepreneur .
His airline started as a charter service , flying wealthy travelers to Martha ’s Vineyard from Boston and New York in Cessna turboprop planes .
The company now also markets its services to small teams from consulting firms and other businesses who need to travel together to see clients or visit remote offices or factories .
Because of the Eclipse ’s faster speed , Mr. Herp said it made sense for him to expand his airline to Washington , Los Angeles and San Francisco .
“ Eclipse is the game in town right now , ” said Mr. Herp , speaking from the Albuquerque airport last week after visiting Eclipse ’s production plant , where the company is assembling the first 10 Eclipse 500’s .
Mr. Herp was enthusiastic about how Eclipse ’s production was automated , unlike the more time - consuming construction methods used to make other private jets , and about how Eclipse , for the moment , had three production shifts running around the clock , seven days a week .
Other makers are rolling out planes that could also compete for a slice of the air taxi market .
Adam Aircraft , based in Englewood , Colo. , is awaiting federal certification for its A700 , a six - passenger light jet ( or five with a bathroom ) that costs $ 2.25 million .
Embraer Air ’s four - passenger Phenom , which costs $ 2.85 million , is expected in 2008 .
And on Tuesday Honda , after years of study , announced that it would build a six - seat jet with a top speed rivaling that of the Eclipse .
But not everyone believes that the Eclipse and other very light jets awaiting government approval will be able to establish a new aviation niche .
And some analysts are skeptical about whether there is enough demand to justify hundreds , if not thousands , of new flying limousines .

“ This is one of the most promising aviation markets in years , ” said Richard Aboulafia , an analyst at the Teal Group .
“ But are the economics of these new planes revolutionary compared to what is out there ?
Absolutely not . ”
Evolution is on the way out - more than 30 % of students in the UK say they believe in creationism and intelligent design .
Harriet Swain reports on a surprising new survey
Chris Parker , a final - year English student at Hertford College , Oxford , believes God made the world .
Ask him why , and he talks cogently about the gaps in evolutionary theory and how explanations involving intelligent design are unsatisfactory .
But , ultimately , it is because : " As a Christian , I have believed in it for a long time and I have no reason to doubt it . "
Kim Nicholas , who is studying to be a primary school teacher at the University of Hertfordshire , agrees .
" I have grown up in a family that goes to church and I have become a Christian , " she says .
" When I look at things in the world I think it is amazing that God has created it for us .
If you have faith in God you can believe he has done it , whether there is evidence or not . "
Annie Nawaz , a second - year law student at Hertfordshire , distinguishes between scientific and " natural " evidence written in stone in the holy books .
" As a practising Muslim , the holy Qur'an - that 's our proper evidence , " she says .
It does bother her when this conflicts with other kinds of evidence , but " it just comes down to the way you have been brought up and your beliefs and values and how strong they are " .
Such views are less unusual among UK students than you might think .
In a survey last month , more than 12 % questioned preferred creationism - the idea God created us within the past 10,000 years - to any other explanation of how we got here .
Another 19 % favoured the theory of intelligent design - that some features of living things are due to a supernatural being such as God .
This means more than 30 % believe our origins have more to do with God than with Darwin - evolution theory rang true for only 56 % .
Opinionpanel Research 's survey of more than 1,000 students found a third of those who said they were Muslims and more than a quarter of those who said they were Christians supported creationism .
Nearly a third of Christians and 10 % of those with no particular religion favoured intelligent design .
Women were more likely to choose spiritual explanations : less than half chose evolution , with 14 % preferring creationism and 22 % intelligent design .
While three years of learning how to weigh evidence appears to make students slightly more inclined towards evolution , with 57 % of third - years choosing it compared with 54 % of first - years , it does not appear to put them off belief in God .
As many third - years as first - years believed in creationism , although slightly fewer supported intelligent design .
The findings come as little surprise to Roger Downie , professor of zoological education at Glasgow University .
Two years ago he surveyed the views on evolution of biology and medical students there .
" What was extremely worrying for students embarking on evidence - and science - based disciplines was that they were perfectly prepared to say they had rejected it not on the basis of evidence but on the basis of their religious beliefs , " he says .
He says schools and universities need to be clearer about how science differs from other evidence , such as that provided by religion .
" The impression people get is that science is about accumulating a lot of facts in your head rather than testing of evidence and fine - tuning what you find . "
Scientists have recently expressed growing concern about creationism being taught alongside evolution in schools , particularly at the new academies run by the Christian Vardy Foundation .
In April , a Royal Society statement opposed the misrepresentation of evolution in schools to promote particular religious beliefs .
Steve Jones , professor of genetics at University College London , who gave a public lecture on " Why evolution is right and creationism is wrong " at the time , has been talking about evolutionary biology in schools for 20 years .
For the first 10 of those he was lucky to find one student in 1,000 expressing creationist beliefs .
" Now in any school I go to I meet a student who says they are a creationist or delude themselves that they are . "
He blames the influence of Christian fundamentalists in America and political correctness among teachers here who , he says , feel they have to give a reasonable hearing to beliefs held by people from other cultures , particularly Muslims .
In the Opinionpanel survey , nearly 20 % said they had been taught creationism as fact by their main school .
Most thought it would be best to teach a range of theories , but nearly 30 % of those who supported creationism felt that pupils should learn about creationism alone .
According to Linda Woodhead , professor in the sociology of religion at Lancaster University , religious studies is now the biggest growth subject in schools .
She suggests that this reflects pupils ' interest in philosophical and moral questions - questions that are likely to persist into their undergraduate years .
" I do n't think there is anywhere in the curriculum where most university students get these sorts of questions addressed , " she says .
Some universities are beginning to recognise this .
Jeremy Rayner , professor of zoology at Leeds University , which is to incorporate lectures on creationism and intelligent design into its second - year course for zoology and genetics next year , says the idea is to teach students about the creationism hypothesis " so they are in a position to make their own rational judgment and counter it " .
While he has seen no evidence that students are more inclined to believe in creationism , he perceives a growing willingness within the creation movement to be prepared to cause disruption by promoting its views .
" The best thing we can do , " he says , " is what universities should be doing anyway - producing bright , intelligent young minds with the confidence to be advocates for science . "

… ” She asked us to identify boys only , which we have done after visiting four orphanages in Lilongwe , ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€ šÂ¬Ã‚ ?
government spokeswoman Adrina Michiela said .
Michiela said Madonna had wanted to adopt a girl but changed her mind two weeks ago .
Madonna specifically asked for a boy so she would n’t seem so trendy after Angelina Jolie already adopted a girl .
It ’s unclear if this child has AIDS , but you could assume he does n’t .
That ’s what the center is for .
I hope Madonna ’s black baby will be very happy playing with Madonna ’s white children .
They ’ll be pretty pissed to find out he ’ll run faster than them and have a vertical leap matching their height .
Stereotype ?
What does that mean ?
Update : Madonna ’s rep has denied any adoption took place .
Today I took the Squeak 3.9 development image for a spin and decided make the switch from Squeak 3.7 .
This made me wonder : how do I switch images ?
I 've made customizations to my old Squeak world and naturally I want to bring all of that with me .
( I 'm not a standard - environment kind of guy by any means . )
My overall experience with Smalltalk has been that things have to be done differently in an image - based environment .
To my surprise most things I 've expected to be awkward and difficult have turned out to be comfortable and easy .
SqueakMap and its package loader , Monticello , and SqueakSource have all been breaths of fresh air .
Unfortunately , I have n't found enough nice techniques for transporting customizations between images so in this case I 've had to improvise .
Transporting my own code ( SawfishCompat and PacketStudio ) was a snap : I just used Monticello to checkout the latest versions from SqueakSource .
Transporting my data is proving much more difficult : I have n't found a nice way to transport small things like my background colour and font choices or big things like my keyboard layout .
Keyboard layout is a " big thing " because it took me a maddeningly time long to click everything into the KeyBinder application that I downloaded from SqueakMap .
And so today 's adventure with Squeak is all about configuring global key bindings .
As an Emacs user I expect defining a global key binding to be roughly as simple as typing :
( global - set - key " \C-cs " ' show - outline - structure )
whereas with KeyBinder I actually click around and fill in a form like this each time :
When I submit this form the code is then squirreled away in one of KeyBinder 's data structures and out of my reach .
So how can I transport this ?
First I clicked around in the halo menu and found the command save morph in file which actually did produce a KeyBinder . morph on disk .
I crossed my fingers and loaded this into the new image via the file browser and eureka !
There 's the comforting little keyboard icon of the KeyBinder morph .
But alas , the morph did n't respond to mouse clicks as it had in the old image .
Somehow it seemed to have lost its essense in transportation .
Drat !
So next I dug into the KeyBinder application and found it pretty incomprehensible .
The program is nearly a thousand lines of code in five classes ( KeyBinder , KeyBinderInstaller , KeyBinding , KeyBindingConfigMorph , WindowSwitcherMorph ) made up of lots of itty - bitty methods that feel like decoys to prevent me from finding how it actually works .
The only useful thing I learned from this escapade was how to count the lines in a Squeak program :
(( PackageInfo named : ' KeyBinder ' ) classes collect : # linesOfCode ) sum => 819
So now it 's sunday night and I want a hack to blog about so I decide to write my own KeyBinder .
Mine has the simple anatomy that an Emacs guy would expect ( a key -> function dictionary and a keypress hook ) , includes my bindings in the source ( so I can easily transport them between images ) , and inherits from SimpleSwitchMorph so that I can toggle it off using the mouse if it breaks keyboard input somehow :-) .
Hm .. how to present a Squeak program on a blog ?
This should be easy , since the volume of code can fit comfortably on the screen , but I 've not managed to make a screenshot - worthy setup .
There 's a copy html menu item that will HTML 'ize individual methods but that does n't seem to play nicely with my stylesheet .
I 'll file this away as a problem for later and just post a tidied up change set :
SimpleSwitchMorph subclass : # SimpleKeyBinder instanceVariableNames : ' bindings ' classVariableNames : '' poolDictionaries : '' category : ' SimpleKeyBinder '
" Simple morph for adding global keybindings .
The bindings are defined in initializeBindings and clicking the morph toggles active / inactive . " initialize super initializeWithLabel : ' SimpleKeyBinder '. self activeHand addAdditionalKeyboardFocus : self . self initializeBindings .
initializeBindings bindings := Dictionary newFrom : { '< Opt-m > ' -> [ SystemWindow topWindowDo : [ :w | w expandBoxHit ] ] . '< Opt-p >' -> [ SystemWindow moveViewport : #up ] . '< Opt-n >' -> [ SystemWindow moveViewport : # down ] . '< Opt-b >' -> [ SystemWindow moveViewport : # left ] . '< Opt-f >' -> [ SystemWindow moveViewport : #right ].
} handlesKeyboard : event ^self isOn and : [ event isKeystroke and : [ bindings includesKey : event keyString ] ] .
key Stroke : event ( bindings at : event keyString ) value
So in the end I 'm happy that I solved my key bindings problem .
I 'm curious to know if there actually is a good way to transport objects between images , because it would be a bummer if direct manipulation is a dead - end and immortality belongs only to code .
For now I 'm mystified but optimistic .
( This post can reasonably be seen as a cry for help to real Smalltalk hackers . )

RubyScript2
Exe transforms your Ruby application into a standalone , compressed Windows , Linux or Mac OS X ( Darwin ) executable .
You can look at it as a " compiler " .
Not in the sense of a source - code - to - byte - code compiler , but as a " collector " , for it collects all necessary files to run your application on an other machine : the Ruby application , the Ruby interpreter and the Ruby runtime library ( stripped down for your application ) .
Anyway , the result is the same : a standalone executable ( application .exe ) .
And that 's what we want !
Because of the gathering of files from your own Ruby installation , RubyScript2 Exe creates an executable for the platform it 's being run on .
No cross compile .
And when I say Windows , I mean both Windows ( RubyInstaller , MinGW and MSWin32 ) and Cygwin .
But the generated exe under Cygwin is very , very big , because its exe 's are very big ( static ? ) and it includes cygwin1.dll , so it can run on machines without Cygwin .
There is one more advantage :
Because there might be some incompatibilities between the different Ruby versions , you have to test your application with every single version .
Unless you distribute your version of Ruby with your application ...
RubyScript2
Exe can handle simple scripts , but it can handle complete directories as well .
Usually , an application is more than just a program or a script .
It consists of libraries , documentation , help files , configuration files , images , licenses , readmes , and so on .
You can embed all of them in one single executable .
What 's the difference between RubyScript2 Exe and AllInOneRuby ?
Well , RubyScript2
Exe includes an application ( your script ) , the Ruby VM and only parts of the ruby_lib tree ( it 's stripped specifically for your application ) .
AllInOneRuby contains a complete Ruby installation : it includes no application , but it does include the Ruby VM and the complete ruby_lib tree .
You can use allinoneruby .
exe like ruby .exe ( Windows ) and allinoneruby _ * like ruby ( Linux , Darwin ) that 's already installed on your system .
In other words : the executable , generated with RubyScript2 Exe , is an application ; the one generated with AllInOneRuby " is " Ruby .
If you like RubyScript2 Exe , you might want to read Distributing Ruby Applications .
It 's about how I build , pack and distribute my Ruby applications .
Theory and practice .
( I 'm working on full support of RubyGems .
The handling of require_gem and the mangling of $ : are implemented and all files of a gem are embedded .
I 've tested just a couple of gems , not all of them .
If you 've troubles with a specific gem , please let me know . )
RubyScript2
Exe monitors the execution of your application .
This is done by running your application with a special library .
After your application has finished , this special library returns all information about your application to RubyScript2Exe .
RubyScript2
Exe then gathers all program files and requirements ( ruby .exe , rubyw.exe or ruby ( and their so 's , o 's and dll 's , determined recursively ) , *.rb , *. so , *.o and *.dll ( and their so 's , o 's and dll 's , determined recursively ) ) from your own Ruby installation .
All these files , your application and an extracting program are combined into one single , compressed executable .
This executable can run on a bare Windows installation , a Linux installation with a libc version >= yours or a Darwin installation .
Call it a " just - in - time and temporary installation of Ruby " ...
EEE stands for " Environment Embedding Executable " .
Well , I just had to give it a name ...
EEE is the little Pascal program that packs and compresses all necessary files .
It had to be written in a language that could be compiled and linked into an exe - file .
Ruby was n't an option .
I use FreePascal ( 1.9.8 on Windows , 1.9.8 on Linux and 1.9.8 on Darwin ) .
EEE has two modes : packing and unpacking .
When it detects an attached archive , it jumps into unpacking mode ; into packing mode otherwise .
After creating the temporary directory and unpacking all files , EEE spawns the Ruby interpreter for your application .rb .
At that point , EEE releases control to Ruby itself .
After Ruby has finished , EEE regains control and starts cleaning up .
The difference between eee.exe and eeew .exe is the same as the difference between ruby .exe and rubyw.exe :
With or without a DOS - box .
I 've given EEE a page of its own , with more information then this section provides .
If you use the original rubyscript2exe.rb :
c:\home\erik > ruby rubyscript2exe.rb application.rb[w ] [ parameters ] or c:\home\erik > ruby rubyscript2exe.rb application [ /] [ parameters ]
If you installed the gem , it's :
c:\home\erik > rubyscript2exe application.rb[w ] [ parameters ] or c:\home\erik > rubyscript2exe application [/] [ parameters ]
Parameter Description --rubyscript2exe-rubyw
Avoid the popping up of a DOS box .
( It 's annoying in the test period ...
No puts and p anymore ...
Only use it for distributing your application .
See Logging . ) --rubyscript2exe-ruby
Force the popping up of a DOS box ( default ) .
--rubyscript2exe-nostrip Avoid stripping .
The binaries ( ruby and *.so ) on Linux and Darwin are stripped by default to reduce the size of the resulting executable .
--rubyscript2exe-strace
Start the embedded application with strace ( Linux only , for debugging only ) .
-- rubyscript2exe-tk ( experimental )
Embed not only the Ruby bindings for TK , but TK itself as well .
-- rubyscript2exe-verbose Verbose mode .
--rubyscript2exe-quiet Quiet mode .
In case you want to compile a complete directory , the entry point of you application has to be init.rb .
RubyScript2
Exe complains if it can't find application / init.rb .
All parameters starting with -- rubyscript2exe - will be deleted before the execution of application.rb .
If the extension is " rb " , a DOS box will pop up .
If the extension is " rbw " , no DOS box will pop up .
Unless it is overwritten by a parameter .
On Linux and Darwin , there 's no difference between ruby and rubyw .
When using -- ruby script2exe - tk , it 's probably a good idea to add exit if RUBYSCRIPT2EXE.is_compiling ?
( see is_compiling ? ) just before Tk.mainloop :
require " rubyscript2exe " exit if RUBYSCRIPT2EXE.is_compiling ?
Tk.mainloop
It is possible to change the icon of the generated executable manually , with a resource editor like Resource Hacker .
If Resource Hacker is installed , in your %PATH % and therefor available from the current directory , and an icon file with the name application .ico exists in the current directory , the default icon will automatically be replaced by yours .
I used Resource Hacker 3.4.0 for my tests .
c:\home\erik > application.exe [ parameters ]
Parameter Description -- eee - list Just list the contents of the executable .
( Does n't work in combination with rubyw . ) -- eee - info Just show the information stored in the executable .
( Does n't work in combination with rubyw . )
-- eee - justextract
Just extract the original files from the executable into the current directory ( no subdirectory ! ) .
If one of these parameters is used , RubyScript2 Exe does just that .
It does n't execute the application .
If none of these parameters is used , RubyScript2 Exe executes the application with the given parameters .
To be forward compatible , all parameters starting with -- eee- will be deleted before the execution of the application .
The exit code of the executable is the same as the exit code of your application .
Module RUBYSCRIPT2EXE
is available after doing a require " rubyscript2exe " .
This module is used in this section .
Yep , we 've two files with the same name : the application rubyscript2exe.rb ( big ) and the library rubyscript2exe.rb ( small ) .
They 're not the same .
But , since the big application rubyscript2exe.rb is an RBA and includes the small library rubyscript2exe.rb , you can always do require " rubyscript2exe " .
It does n't matter whether Ruby finds the big one or the small one .
It should work either way .
Funny stuff , those RBA's ... ;]
This is an overview of the methods ( or module variables ) RUBYSCRIPT2EXE provides .
They 're explained in detail in the next sections .
Method Useful at Compile - Time Useful at Run-Time Default RUBYSCRIPT2EXE.dlls= x [ ]
RUBYSCRIPT2EXE.bin= x [ ]
RUBYSCRIPT2EXE.lib= x [ ]
RUBYSCRIPT2EXE.tempdir= x nil RUBYSCRIPT2EXE.tk= x false RUBYSCRIPT2EXE.rubyw= x false RUBYSCRIPT2EXE.strip= x true RUBYSCRIPT2EXE.is_compiling ?
x RUBYSCRIPT2EXE.is_compiled ?
x RUBYSCRIPT2EXE.appdir x RUBYSCRIPT2EXE.userdir x RUBYSCRIPT2EXE.exedir x RUBYSCRIPT2EXE.executable x
The application itself ( application .rb ) usually does n't need to know that it 's wrapped by RubyScript2 Exe .
But sometimes RubyScript2
Exe needs to know something about the application .
Instead of introducing separate configuration files , I simply abuse application .rb as a configuration file ...
Sometimes , you want to embed an additional DLL in the executable .
That 's easily done by using RUBYSCRIPT2EXE. dlls= in your application :
require " rubyscript2exe " RUBYSCRIPT2EXE.dlls = [ " a.dll " , " b.dll " , " c.dll " ]
( You can also do this : RUBYSCRIPT2EXE.dlls << " a.dll " )
At the end of the tracing of your application , the mentioned DLL's are copied from the directory in which the application was started , if they exist .
The DLL's on which these DLL 's depend are not copied , in contrast to the dependencies of ruby .
exe and its libraries , which are resolved recursively .
( Although RubyScript2 Exe knows how to handle application directories , you still have to mention your personal DLL's by hand .
Yes , the DLL's are embedded twice ...
I want to change this in the future . )
On one location , I was not supposed to change the application for this kind of things .
So I did the following trick :
c:\home\erik > type dlls.rb require " rubyscript2exe " RUBYSCRIPT2EXE.dlls = [ " some.dll " , " another.dll " ] c:\home\erik > ruby -r dlls rubyscript2exe.rb application.rb
Like RUBYSCRIPT2EXE.dlls= , you can use RUBYSCRIPT2EXE . bin= as well for EXE's and ( non-library ) DLL's and SO's .
In fact , RUBYSCRIPT2EXE.dlls= and RUBYSCRIPT2EXE . bin= are handled exactly the same .
For library files ( RB's , SO 's and DLL's ) , you can use RUBYSCRIPT2EXE.lib= .
Some firewalls block outbound connections to prevent viruses and other bad programs to connect to their friends , unless the program initiating the connection is " white - listed " manually .
This " white - list " is based upon the full path to the executable .
RubyScript2
Exe installs Ruby and the application in a temporary directory in % TEMP % , before starting it .
This directory is something like $ HOME /. eee / eee.
application .243 or %HOME % \eee\eee .
application .342 .
The number part changes every time you start the application .
This is not good if you want to " white - list " the program , because ruby .
exe is started from another directory every time .
To prevent this , you can set RUBYSCRIPT2EXE .
tempdir= to the directory name that will be created in % TEMP % :
require " rubyscript2exe " RUBYSCRIPT2EXE.tempdir = " myapplication "
Now RubyScript2
Exe will use $ HOME / .eee / myapplication or %HOME % \eee \myapplication every time the program is started .
This has a drawback : A second instance of the program tries to install itself in the same directory .
It fails to do so , because the directory already exists .
It gets even worse when the first instance of the application dies unexpectedly and fails to cleanup its own temporary directory :
You wo n't be able to start the application anymore , unless you remove the temporary directory manually or wait for the OS to do so .
( Use RUBYSCRIPT2EXE .
tempdir= only when necessary !
It 's just a hack .
Its behavior might be changed in the future .
I do n't know yet ...)
Embed not only the Ruby bindings for TK , but TK itself as well .
( This is considered experimental . )
It 's the same as compiling with -- rubyscript2exe - rubyw .
It 's the same as compiling with -- rubyscript2exe - nostrip ( but reversed ... ) .
The application is run by RubyScript2 Exe on two different moments in time :
The moment the developer creates the executable .
This can be detected with RUBYSCRIPT2EXE.is_compiling ? .
.
The moment the customer runs the executable .
This can be detected with RUBYSCRIPT2EXE.is_compiled ? .
If you want to know the full path to the directory of your ( embedded ) application , use RUBYSCRIPT2EXE.appdir .
You can do this when the application is compiled , but even when it is n't yet compiled .
For example ( not compiled ) :
require " rubyscript2exe " RUBYSCRIPT2EXE.appdir === > C:/bin RUBYSCRIPT2EXE.appdir( " README " ) === > C:/bin/README
RUBYSCRIPT2EXE.appdir{Dir.pwd} === > C:/bin
For example ( compiled ) :
require " rubyscript2exe " RUBYSCRIPT2EXE.appdir ===> C:/home/eee/eee.troep.exe.2/app RUBYSCRIPT2EXE.appdir( " README " ) === > C:/home/eee/eee.troep.exe.2/app/README
RUBYSCRIPT2EXE.appdir{Dir.pwd} ===> C:/home/eee/eee.troep.exe.2/app
RUBYSCRIPT2EXE.appdir and RUBYSCRIPT2EXE.appdir( " bin " ) are added to ENV [ " PATH " ] .
RUBYSCRIPT2EXE.appdir and RUBYSCRIPT2EXE.appdir ( " lib " ) are added to $ : .
If you want to know the full path to the directory in which the user started the application , use RUBYSCRIPT2EXE.userdir .
You can do this when the application is compiled , but even when it is n't yet compiled .
For example ( not compiled or compiled ) :
require " rubyscript2exe " RUBYSCRIPT2EXE.userdir === > C:/work RUBYSCRIPT2EXE.userdir( " app.cfg " ) === > C:/work/app.cfg RUBYSCRIPT2EXE.userdir{Dir.pwd} ===> C:/ work
( Actually , when running the application uncompiled , this is the directory ( Dir.pwd ) in which the applications requires rubyscript2exe.rb , which is n't necessarily the directory in which the user started the application . )
If you want to know the full path to the directory in which your executable resides , use RUBYSCRIPT2EXE.exedir .
You can do this when the application is compiled , but even when it is n't yet compiled .
For example ( not compiled or compiled ) :
require " rubyscript2exe " RUBYSCRIPT2EXE.exedir === > C:/bin RUBYSCRIPT2EXE.exedir( " app.cfg " ) === > C:/bin/app.cfg RUBYSCRIPT2EXE.exedir{Dir.pwd} ===> C:/bin
( Actually , when running the application uncompiled , this is the directory of the main script .
Literally : File.dirname(File.expand_path($0 ) ) . )
If you want to know the full path to the executable , use RUBYSCRIPT2EXE .
executable .
You can do this when the application is compiled , but even when it is n't yet compiled .
For example ( not compiled ) :
require " rubyscript2exe " RUBYSCRIPT2EXE.executable === > C:/bin/app.rb
For example ( compiled ) :
require " rubyscript2exe " RUBYSCRIPT2EXE.executable === > C:/bin/app.exe
( Actually , when running the application uncompiled , this is the main script .
Literally : File.expand_path ( $0 ) . )
In your application , you can access some information about the environment EEE sets up before spawning your application :
Constant Set to Replaced by RUBYSCRIPT2EXE ::APPEXE
Filename of the generated executable .
RUBYSCRIPT2EXE .executable and RUBYSCRIPT2EXE.exedir RUBYSCRIPT2EXE::EEEEXE
eee.exe or eeew.exe or eee_linux or eee_darwin .
RUBYSCRIPT2EXE ::TEMPDIR
Temporary directory in which the application resides .
RUBYSCRIPT2EXE.appdir RUBYSCRIPT2EXE::PARMS
Parameters from the command line .
RUBYSCRIPT2EXE ::QUOTEDPARMS
Quoted parameters from the command line .
( Use these constants only when necessary .
Do n't consider them " stable " ... )
RubyScript2
Exe runs the application ( in a child process ) and gathers the require -d files .
It 's not necessary to run the complete application when all require -s are done in the first couple of statements .
You might as well exit right after the require statements :
require " rubyscript2exe " exit if RUBYSCRIPT2EXE.is_compiling ?
Sometimes , one or more require -s are done later on , deep down in a library ( e.g. when connecting to a database in DBI ) .
It 's not a good idea to do the above trick under this kind of circumstances .
You 'll miss some libraries ...
When using -- rubyscript2exe - rubyw , the application runs without a console .
This is nice for an application with a GUI .
But , although you 're a good programmer , sometimes the applications simply dies .
If there 's no console , there 's no back - trace as well .
I usually add one of the following lines to the top of my application , even before the require statements :
$ stdout = $ stderr = File.new ( " / path/to/temp/application.log " , " w " ) or $ stdout = $ stderr = File.new ( " / path/to/temp/application.#{Process.pid}.log " , " w " )
You can extract , modify and " compile " on location , if you want to .
First , extract the executable :
c:\home\erik > application.exe -- eee- justextract
This creates the directory bin ( with the files ruby .
exe , rubyw.exe and * .dll ) , the directory lib ( with the dependencies *.rb and *.so ) , the directory app ( with the file application .rb ( your script ) or the application directory ) and the files app .eee and eee.exe ( or eeew.exe ) in the current directory .
It 's possible to run your application again with :
c:\home\erik > bin\ruby.exe -r .\bootstrap.rb -T1 empty.rb .\app\application.rb
If the application does a Dir.chdir , try this :
c:\home\erik > bin\ruby.exe -r .\bootstrap.rb -T1 empty.rb c:\full\path\to\app\application.rb
After hacking app .eee , if necessary , you can " compile " your application again with :
c:\home\erik > eee.exe app.eee newapplication.exe or c:\home\erik > eeew.exe app.eee newapplication.exe
On Linux , it 's pretty much the same .
$ ./application_linux --eee- justextract $ export PATH=./bin:$ PATH
$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=./bin:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
$ chmod +x ./ bin/* $ ./bin/ruby -r ./bootstrap.rb -T1 empty.rb ./app/application.rb $ ./ eee_linux app.eee newapplication_linux
I ran RubyScript2
Exe with four different Ruby distributions ( Ruby 1.8.1 ) on Windows and two versions of Ruby ( 1.6.7 and 1.8.2 ) on Linux :
Distribution Size ( bytes ) Cygwin 1287227 RubyInstaller 641840 MinGW 428898 MSWin32 467110 Linux , Ruby 1.6.7 551858 Linux , Ruby 1.8.2 574015
The details can be found here .
The test script was nothing more than a little Hello World thing ( And the require " rbconfig was just an extra test item ... ) :
require " rbconfig " puts " Hello World ! "

You only need rubyscript2exe.rb .
It 's the current version , packed as an RBA ( Ruby Archive , built by Tar2RubyScript ) and works on both Windows and Linux .
You can download rubyscript2exe.tar.gz if you want to play with the internals of RubyScript2Exe .
RubyScript2
Exe is available as rubyscript2exe.gem as well .
Send me reports of all bugs and glitches you find .
Propositions for enhancements are welcome , too .
This helps us to make our software better .
A change log and older versions can be found here .
A generated log file can be found here .
RubyScript2
Exe is available on SourceForge.net and on RubyForge .
I included ( experimental ) support for Darwin .
The Ruby code in the above mentioned packages is able to handle Darwin , but the packages do n't include EEE for Darwin .
( They would be too big ...)
For now , you have to compile it yourself :
Get eee.pas from the archive .
Download the compiler .
Compile ( fpc - Xs - B eee.pas ) .
Rename eee to eee_darwin .
( I 've put a precompiled eee_darwin on my site , but it may be newer than ( and therefor incompatible with ) the released Ruby code . )
RubyScript2
Exe searches for eee_darwin ( or eee_linux or eee.exe or eeew.exe ) in 3 locations :
In rubyscript2exe.rb ( or rubyscript2exe / when using rubyscript2exe.tar.gz ) .
In the directory in which rubyscript2exe.rb is located .
In the current directory .
This means that you can simply put eee_darwin in the same directory as rubyscript2exe.rb ( location 2 ) or in the current directory ( location 3 ) .
If you want to repackage RubyScript2 Exe ( location 1 ) with an embedded eee_darwin , do this :
Extract rubyscript2exe.tar.gz , or extract rubyscript2exe.rb ( ruby rubyscript2exe.rb --tar2rubyscript-justextract )
Copy eee_darwin to rubyscript2exe / .
Recreate rubyscript2exe.rb ( ruby tar2rubyscript.rb rubyscript2exe/ ) ( optional )
Do n't use long application names ( as in thisisalongnameofanapplication .rb ) .
Long application names result in non-working executables .
Somehow gzread , used to read a block from the archive , returns - 2 if " #{eeedir}\\eee.#{application}.exe.2\\eee.gz" .length >= 80 .
) .
Long application names result in non-working executables .
Somehow , used to read a block from the archive , returns - 2 if .
RubyScript2
Exe is tested with RubyGems 0.9.0 .
It might be necessary to add include " fileutils " in your application .
in your application .
If you someday run into trouble when trying to generate RDOC documentation from within the generated executable , have a look at Zoran Lazarevic 's page .
Because of the way Ruby is started from within RubyScript2 Exe on Linux , $ stdin does n't work anymore .
On Windows , it works .
FIXED IN 0.3.4 !
does n't work anymore .
On Windows , it works .
My latest change in RubyScript2
Exe was to ignore RUBYOPT when running the generated executable .
This means that I do generate the fake rubygems.rb and do embed it into the executable , but it is n't necessarily required by anything in the application or in the environment .
So , you have to do a require " rubygems " explicitly in your application , when using one or more gems .
FIXED IN 0.3.3 !
in your application , when using one or more gems .
Running the generated executable from within a non-SH - compatible shell ( e.g. TCSH ) , is currently not possible .
FIXED IN 0.3.3 !
There is a problem when running the generated executable in an environment in which the environment variable RUBYOPT is set .
( The One - Click Ruby Installer ( ruby 182- 14.exe ) does this . )
The embedded ruby .exe encounters RUBYOPT and tries to load the mentioned libraries ( e.g. ubygems ) which it obviously can't find , because the search paths are pointing to the embedded environment and not to the original environment .
So , creating an executable in an environment in which RUBYOPT is set is not a problem , whereas running the generated executable in such an environment is a problem .
The workaround is to open a DOS - box , do a set RUBYOPT= and run the executable from within the DOS - box .
FIXED IN 0.3.2 !
When George W. Bush became president , as best the on-site monitors of the International Atomic Energy Agency could determine , the North Koreans were in total compliance with The Agreed Framework Between the United States of America and the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea [ .pdf ] .
In 1992 , at the insistence of the Russians , the DPRK had begun negotiations with the IAEA on a Safeguards Agreement , as required of them by the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons , but soon got into a dispute with the IAEA as to whether they were accurately characterizing the NPT proscribed materials they were declaring .
The IAEA asked to do chemical assays and the Koreans refused .
IAEA Director - General Hans Blix brought the dispute to the IAEA Board of Governors who , in turn , reported it to the UN Security Council for possible action , as the IAEA Statute requires .
The DPRK immediately gave notice ( as the NPT provides for ) of its intention to withdraw from the NPT .
Well , that would never do .
President Clinton was hell - bent on getting every country to not only become an NPT signatory but to sign and ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty .
So in 1994 , after lengthy negotiations , President Clinton persuaded North Korea to sign the Agreed Framework , under which North Korea agreed ( a ) to remain a signatory to the Treaty on Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons , ( b ) to shut down its 5 MW Plutonium - 239 producing reactor , ( c ) to shut down its spent - fuel Plutonium - 239 recovery facilities , ( d ) to abandon construction of its 50 MW and 200 MW Plutonium - 239 producing reactors , and ( e ) to place all its existing nuclear materials  including the Plutonium - 239 contained in spent fuel elements  under lock and seal of the International Atomic Energy Agency .
But , according to a January 20 , 2003 article by Pulitzer Prize - winning journalist Seymour Hersh in the New Yorker magazine , in January of 2002 ,
“ John Bolton , the Under - Secretary of State for Arms Control , declared that North Korea had a covert nuclear - weapons program and was in violation of the nonproliferation treaty .
“ In February , the President was urged by three members of Congress to withhold support for the two reactors promised to North Korea , on the ground that the Pyongyang government was said to be operating a secret processing site ‘ for the enrichment of uranium . ’
“ In May , Bolton again accused North Korea of failing to cooperate with the International Atomic Energy Agency , the group responsible for monitoring treaty compliance .
Hersh further reported that in June , 2002 , Director of Central Intelligence George Tenet delivered to President Bush a highly classified National Intelligence Estimate , containing “ Sensitive Compartmented Information ” which “ assessed ” that  surprise , surprise  North Korea had been violating both the NPT and the Agreed Framework .
The NIE alleged that Koreans had been attempting for several years  with Pakistani assistance  to acquire a Uranium - 235 nuke production capability .
“ In 1997 , according to the C.I.A. report , Pakistan began paying for missile systems from North Korea in part by sharing its nuclear - weapons secrets .
“ According to the report , Pakistan sent prototypes of high - speed centrifuge machines to North Korea .
And sometime in 2001 North Korean scientists began to enrich uranium in significant quantities .
“ Pakistan also provided data on how to build and test a uranium - triggered nuclear weapon , the C.I.A. report said .
“ Pakistan helped North Korea conduct a series of “ cold tests , ” simulated nuclear explosions , using natural uranium , which are necessary to determine whether a nuclear device will detonate properly .
So , what did Bush do with this “ Special Compartmented Information ” ?
Nothing , unless you count a Bolton munchkin not being fired after confronting a DPRK mid-level weenie with it at a cocktail party in September .
Boltons munchkin reported back that the DPRK weenie “ admitted ” that they did , indeed , have a secret Uranium - 235 nuke weapon program .
When this “ admission ” was leaked to  and published by  neocrazy media sycophants , the DPRK immediately officially denied it .
And continue to deny it .
So did the Pakistanis , although in his recently published autobiography Pakistani General - President - Dictator Pervez Musharraf did acknowledge that
“ Dr. A.Q. Khan transferred nearly two dozen P - I and P - II centrifuges to North Korea .
He also provided North Korea with a flow meter , some special oils for centrifuges and coaching on centrifuge technology , including visits to top - secret centrifuge plants . ” ( p. 294 ) .
Now , neither the acceptance of Pakistani centrifuges nor visits to Pakistani centrifuge plants were violations of the NPT nor the Agreed Framework .
In fact , as of this writing , there is no evidence whatsoever that the North Koreans violated the Agreed Framework  which Bush unilaterally abrogated in November , 2002  or the NPT , from which North Korea withdrew in January 2003 as a direct result of Bushs abrogation .
Nevertheless , Neocrazy Media Sycophant David Sanger reported on the back pages of the New York Times the test of the DPRK Plutonium - 239 nuke test thusly ;
“ The intelligence agencies  finding that the weapon was based on plutonium strongly suggested that the countrys second path to a nuclear bomb  one using uranium  was not yet ready .
The uranium program is based on enrichment equipment and know - how purchased from Pakistans former nuclear chief .
What it ought to strongly suggest is that Bolton and the 2002 SCI NIE on North Koreas Uranium - 235 program were both wrong .
The most probable reason for the IAEA and our intelligence agencies being unable to find any evidence of North Koreas Uranium - 235 nuke program is that it doesnt exist .
Now , bear in the mind that the principal benefit North Korea sought  and got  under the Agreed Framework was the promise that an American president would never attack or threaten to attack them with nuclear weapons .
And recall that Bush unilaterally abrogated the Agreed Framework .
Now read this totally outrageous assertion by Neocrazy Media Sycophant Sanger ;
“ Unlike the Clinton administration in 1994 , the current Bush administration chose not to threaten to destroy North Koreas fuel and nuclear reprocessing facilities if they tried to make weapons . ”
Say What ?
South Africa is considering forcibly detaining people who carry a deadly strain of tuberculosis that has already claimed hundreds of lives .
The strain threatens to cause a global pandemic , but the planned move pits public protection against human rights .
The country 's health department says it has discussed with the World Health Organisation and South Africa 's leading medical organisations the possibility of placing carriers of extreme drug resistant TB or XDR - TB under guard in isolation wards until they die , but has yet to reach a decision .
Pressure to take action has been growing since a woman diagnosed with the disease discharged herself from a hospital last September and probably spread the infection before she was finally coaxed back when she was threatened with a court order .
More than 300 cases of the highly infectious disease , which is spread by airborne droplets and kills 98 % of those infected within about two weeks , have been identified in South Africa .
But doctors believe there have been hundreds , possibly thousands , more and the numbers are growing among the millions of people with HIV , who are particularly vulnerable to the disease .
Their fear is that patients with XDR - TB , told that there is little that can be done for them , will leave the isolation wards and go home to die .
But while they are still walking around they risk spreading the infection .
Now a group of doctors has warned in a medical journal that if enforced isolation is not introduced XDR - TB could swamp South Africa and spread far beyond its borders .
Regular TB is already the single largest killer of people with Aids in South Africa .
Pandemic
Jerome Amir Singh of the Centre for Aids Programme of Research in South Africa and two colleagues wrote in the peer - reviewed journal Public Library of Science Medicine that the government must overcome its understandable qualms over human rights in the interests of the majority .
Without exceptional control measures , including enforced isolation , XDR - TB " could become a lethal global pandemic " , they say .
" The containment of infectious patients with XDR - TB may arguably take precedence over any other patients not infected with highly infectious and deadly airborne diseases , including those with full - blown Aids .
This is an issue requiring urgent attention from the global community , " they wrote .
" The South African government 's initial lethargic response to the crisis and uncertainty amongst South African health professionals concerning the ethical , social and human rights implications of effectively tackling this outbreak highlight the urgent need to address these issues lest doubt and inaction spawn a full - blown XDR - TB epidemic in South Africa and beyond . "
Mary Edginton of the Witwatersrand university 's medical school endorses enforced quarantining .
" You can look at it from two points of view .
From the patient 's point of view , you are expected to stay in some awful place , you can't work and you can't see your family .
You will probably die there .
From the community 's point of view such a person is infectious .
If they go to the shops or wander around their friends they can spread it , potentially to a large group of people , " she said .
Karin Weyer of the Medical Research Council has called for enforced hospitalisation of high - risk TB patients on the grounds that the risks to society outweigh individual rights .
But she opposes forcible treatment because of the dangers associated with the drugs .
Professor Edginton said that medical authorities in the US and other countries can obtain a court order to detain a person with infectious TB or someone who is non-infectious but has failed to adhere to treatment .
" The Americans are much better at enforcing their laws on this , " she said .
South African law also permits enforced isolation but some lawyers say it comes into conflict with the constitutional guarantees on individual rights .
However , the constitution also guarantees communal rights , including protection from infection and the right to a safe environment .
South Africa 's health department yesterday said it has discussed the possibility of enforced isolation with the country 's Medical Research Council and the World Health Organisation but has not reached a conclusion .
Poor housing
Ronnie Green - Thompson , a special adviser to the health department , said the issue at stake is the human rights of the individual weighed against the rights of the wider public .
" The issue of holding the patient against their will is not ideal but may have to be considered in the interest of the public .
Legal opinion and comment as well as sourcing the opinion of human rights groups is important , " he said .
" Also of importance is preventing those factors that lead to infectious TB and these are poverty , poor housing , overcrowding and poor nutrition and any other factors that weakens patients ' resistance to acquiring infections . "
Umesh Lalloo , of Durban 's Nelson Mandela School of Medicine and head of the research team into the first XDR - TB outbreak , said he is not persuaded that detention is necessary .
" It 's a very difficult call .
Given our recent past with human rights violations we need to be careful .
I 'm not dismissing such a move but it's a very radical step .
What we should be pushing for is a reinforcement of the TB control programme which would contain the spread , " he said .
Professor Lalloo said one consideration is that almost all infections appear to have spread to patients in hospital .
The doctors and co-authors said that it is essential that patients were detained in " humane and decent living conditions " and they urged the government to change the rules so that those in hospital with TB continue to receive welfare payments which are cut off if they are treated at the state 's expense .
Although cases of XDR - TB were discovered in South Africa a decade ago , the disease started claiming dozens of lives at the small Tugela Ferry hospital in rural KwaZulu - Natal two years ago .
XDR - TB 's origins are uncertain but the WHO says the misuse of anti-tuberculosis drugs is the most likely cause .
The location of today ’s announcement , at the Institute for High Energy Physics in Beijing , underscores the growing role and ambition of Asia , particularly Japan and China , to become major players in high - energy physics , a field that has been dominated by the United States and Europe in the last century .
Image The International Linear Collider will use 16,000 superconducting cavities to accelerate electrons and positrons to extremely high energies .
Credit ... International Committee for Future Accelerators
In its initial phase the collider would be 31 kilometers ( 20 miles ) long and hurl electrons and their antimatter opposites , positrons , together with energies of 500 billion electron volts .
Later the collider could be extended to 50 kilometers ( 31 miles ) and a trillion electron volts .
The proposed machine , physicists say , is needed to complement to the Large Hadron Collider now under construction at the European Center for Nuclear Research , CERN , outside Geneva .
That machine will be the world ’s most powerful when it goes into operation this fall , eventually colliding beams of protons with 7 trillion electron volts of energy apiece .
Physicists hope that using it they will detect a long - sought particle known as the Higgs boson , which is thought to endow all the other constituents of nature with mass .
They hope , too , to discover new laws and forms of matter and even perhaps new dimensions of spacetime .
But protons are bags of smaller particles called quarks and gluons , and their collisions tend to be messy and wasteful .
Because electrons and positrons have no innards , their collisions are cleaner , so they can be used to create and study with precision whatever new particles are found at Cern .
The hitch is that until the hadron collider proves its worth by actually finding something new , the governments of the world are unlikely to sign on to contribute a share of the billions .
12/11/2006
As 2006 draws to a close , a review of ConsumerAffairs.com 's Scam Alerts archive shows that scammers have had a busy and -- we suspect -- lucrative year .
Targeting the most vulnerable citizens and using increasingly sophisticated tools , most have been able to easily elude law enforcement as they pick their victims ' pockets , sometimes even making off with their life savings .
Scammers scored at will , generating instant cash using lottery and fake check scams .
They capitalized on news events and pop culture to catch consumers off guard , and enlisted all kinds of emerging technology to perfect identity theft .
Story continues below video
Here then , chosen from the roughly 50,000 consumer complaints we 've processed in the past year , are the ConsumerAffairs.com Top Ten Scams of 2006 .
1. Fake Lottery Scam
Topping our list for 2006 , the fake lottery or sweepstakes scam only seems to get bigger and more dangerous .
Promising victims they have won thousands of dollars in a Canadian or European lottery , they target the elderly , who seem to be particular susceptible to these schemes .
ConsumerAffairs.com reported on one case in which an lost over $ 300,000 .
More than 400 New Yorkers fell victim to sweepstakes and lottery scams in the first seven months of 2006 , with losses ranging from a few hundred dollars to more than $ 35,000 , according to an analysis by the New York State Consumer Protection Board .
While elderly people lost the most money , lottery scams also tricked younger people into believing they had won a large cash prize from a foreign lottery or sweepstakes .
In each case , the victims sent money , usually to Canada , thinking they had to pay insurance or taxes before they could collect these bogus prizes .
" No legitimate contest makes you pay a fee to collect a prize , " said CPB Chairperson and Executive Director Teresa A. Santiago .
" For many of the elderly victims , the scam artists made multiple demands for cash , falsely claiming that more money was needed in order to pay for ' taxes ' or insurance . "
Sons and daughters have filed complaints after failing to convince their elderly parent that there was no prize .
" You can't win a contest that you did n't enter .
But it 's hard to convince someone that they are the victim of a scam , especially when the con artists have made numerous phone calls and formed a bond with the victim , " Santiago said .
2. Phishing - Vishing Scams
This scam , in which identity thieves " phish " for a consumer 's personal information , are getting more and prevalent , due in large part to technological advances .
The use of email now makes to increasingly easy for criminals to trick people into revealing account numbers , passwords and social security numbers .
Cleverly designed emails appear to be from a bank , credit union , or online payment service like PayPal , requesting account verification .
If the consumer clicks on a link in the email , they are taken to a site designed to look like the bank 's actual site , where they are instructed to enter the sensitive information , which is captured and used for identity theft purposes .
In 2006 , " vishing " arrived on the scene .
Instead of asking the spam recipient to click on a link , they are instructed to call a toll - free customer service number , which seems more the way a financial institution might do business .
When they call , an automated system instructs the caller to enter account numbers or passwords , which are then recorded by the scammer .
Secure Computing , which specializes in secure connections over networks , sent up the red flag over this new method in 2005 , though the first recorded incident did n't take place until May 2006 , involving a Santa Barbara , California , bank .
Secure Computing engineers have been tracking news group sites and open disclosure discussion groups discussing vishing .
" This is just a natural evolution of phishing itself , " said Paul Henry , vice president of strategic accounts for Secure Computing .
" Simply put , people are becoming more aware of the fact that an e-mail containing a URL could be malicious in nature .
So hackers are moving away from the URL and using something victims are more familiar with like calling a number . "
This " advancement " has forced some financial institutions to consider additional changes to the way in which they communicate with customers .
3. Phony Job Scam
Scammers are increasingly responding to job seekers posting their resumes at online employment sites , such as Careerbuilder.com .
The job offer usually has nothing to do with the job seeker 's experience or qualification .
Even so , they are offered a job on the spot , serving as a " courier . "
They are instructed to receive large checks and deposit them in their personal accounts .
They are then instructed to wire the money to an account out of the country .
The checks , of course , are counterfeit , but they are n't exposed until after they have been deposited and after the victim has wired the money -- their own money , it turns out -- to the scammer .
" Any employment offered online without a formal interview , no matter where it originates , should be treated with skepticism , " said Arkansas Attorney General Mike Beebe , who investigated one of these scams in 2006 .
" Terms that seem too good to be true will prove to be just that and may cost you in stolen personal information or money lost . "
4. Negative Option Scams
Unlike the 419 scams , which are perpetrated by out - and - out criminals , negative option schemes are run by otherwise legitimate businesses .
Using pop-up ads on the Internet and extremely fine print on the back of sales tickets , consumers completing a transaction with their credit card are offered some free gift or enticement , not realizing their acceptance enrolls them in a travel discount club or affinity group of some kind , or commits them to a year 's subscription of a magazine they most likely do n't want .
The consumer may think there is no harm in accepting the " free offer , " because they do n't realize there strings are attached .
While laws generally require consumers to make an " informed consent " to purchase , negative option turns the transaction around .
It assumes the consumer has made the purchase , unless the consumer " opts out " or takes the " negative option . "
The volume of complaints to ConsumerAffairs.com on this subject suggests consumers are completely unaware of the transaction .
5. Nigerian 419 Scams
These scams continue to make our list , year after year , because they continue to ensnare thousands of victims .
This is the scam in which the victim receives an email , allegedly from a wealthy , dying person in another country who is desperately trying to get their fortune out of the country .
They promise the victim a sizable percentage if they will help .
The victim either has to send money to cover fees or provide their bank account information , or both .
The scams are mostly run from Nigeria and get their name because they are covered in section 419 in the Nigerian penal code .
Most people find these emails a big joke , but seemingly sophisticated people have fallen hard for them , losing hundreds of thousands of dollars .
While the crime mostly goes unpunished , ConsumerAffairs.com reported on British prankster Michael Berry 's humorous war on these scams , which actually show as much promise as any countervailing measure .
Called " scambaiting , " Berry actively engages these scammers , pretending to be a gullible victim , wasting their time and forcing them to perform all types of ridiculous and time consuming tasks .
6. Pump & Dump Scam
As the stock market finally rebounded in 2006 after years of near dormancy , scammers stepped up their stock - touting schemes .
Sending out millions of spam emails , they would offer a " hot tip " about an obscure company whose stock was selling for a few cents a share .
Before sending the email they would buy up millions of shares .
For example , Texhoma Energy was touted in an October spam email , resulting in a significant increase in the stock 's value .
According to the Chicago Tribune , 53,000 shares of Texhoma stock were traded on October 16 .
The next day the volume jumped to more than one million .
Two days later it jumped to more than five million , as the spam emails began to hit inboxes and prompt victims to place orders .
The scammers , of course , sell at the stock 's high point and other investors soon join them as the price begins to fall .
Pretty soon the stock is back to selling at a nickel a share and those who jumped on the bandwagon have lost significant amounts of money .
At year 's end the National Association of Securities Dealers issued an alert to investors to avoid taking any unsolicited investment advice .
A survey of the huge increase in spam email revealed most of it to be touting these near - worthless stocks .
7. Bogus Fuel Saving Devices
When gasoline prices surged this year , scammers were quick to try and cash in .
One company claimed its " special pellets , " dropped into the fuel tank , would improve efficiency .
The Federal Trade Commission went after one company that claimed its " magnetic device " would increase gas mileage .
" Consumers are looking for ways to increase fuel efficiency and save money at the pump , " said Lydia Parnes , Director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection .
" There are some practical ways to do that , like following the maintenance schedule in your owner 's manual , combining errands , and avoiding jack - rabbit starts .
The fact is that many products that claim to save fuel do n't work , and worse yet , may damage your car and end up costing you more . "
8. Grandparents Scam
This is a particularly vile scam aimed at senior citizens , perhaps the most vulnerable scam victims .
An elderly person is targeted by the scammer who calls and says something like , " It 's me , grandpa . "
The elderly person will respond , thinking it's one of their grandchildren .
The scammer then tells a tale of woe , saying they are in trouble and need some money , " and please do n't tell mom . "
The grandparent obligingly sends a few hundred dollars , thinking they 're helping a grandchild .
Investigators say it works more than you might think .
9. Oprah Ticket Scam
Again , this scam makes our list this year because of its potential to become much more widespread and to victimize vulnerable people .
Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan recently warned consumers about this scam , alerting them to emails or letters that told them they had won tickets to a taping of the talk diva's show in Chicago , or had been offered a tour package that included a taping of the show .
The communication asked for sensitive personal information , which , if provided , could allow their identities to be stolen .
In this case , e-mail recipients are asked to submit personal information and told they will receive tickets to The Oprah Winfrey Show after verification of certain financial information and / or the wiring of money to an unknown third party .
However , according to Harpo Productions , Inc. , The Oprah Winfrey Show does not sell tickets or ticket travel packages to fans .
10 . craigslist Scam
Though not terribly widespread at the end of 2006 , the craigslist scam makes our top ten list because of its potential to wreak harm in the years ahead .
Starting this year scammers began taking advantage of the growing popularity of craigslist to victimize people trying to rent their homes or apartments .
The scheme is basically the fake check scam , with a twist .
Darryl , of San Diego , told ConsumerAffairs.com that he received almost identical replies when he listed a room for rent on both craigslist and Roommate.com .
The replies claimed to be from " Marie , " who called herself " a young humanitarian officer . "
" Marie " said her employer would be sending Darryl her expense check , which would be for several thousand dollars .
Darryl was to deposit it in his account , deduct the rent and deposit , and send the balance back to her .
Fortunately , Darryl saw through the scam .
If he had cashed the phony check , it would not have been discovered for a few days .
By then he would have sent the scammer a very real check for a $ 3,000 or more .
" Most people who use craigslist have great stories to tell about their experiences with buyers , sellers , tenants , landlords and such , but we also receive occasional reports of scams and fraud , " craigslist warned on its Web site .
" We 've found that one of the best ways to avoid this problem is to keep all transactions local -- whenever possible , do n't do business with anyone who is not in your local area . "
If It Sounds Too Good ...
Scams continued to be big business for criminals in 2006 and relatively risk - free as law enforcement appeared unable to keep up .
As a result , consumers increasingly were at the mercy of scammers who use cunning , audacity and emerging technology to stay one step ahead of both their victims and the law .
The solution ?
Keep your wits about you , be skeptical and remember -- trite though it may be -- if it sounds too good to be true , it probably is .
Ein Netz für Saubermänner
Nicht nur in China lassen Suchmaschinen Links verschwinden .
Auch in Deutschland zeigen Google , Yahoo und andere Indiziertes nicht mehr in den Trefferlisten an .
Ist jetzt die Zensur eingeführt ?
VON DIETER GRÖNLING
Gerade erst gab es weltweit heftige Proteste gegen Google und andere Suchdienste , weil diese eine von der chinesischen Internetzensur vorgegebene Rote Liste akzeptiert hatten .
Dies war die Voraussetzung dafür , überhaupt auf den lukrativen chinesischen Markt zu gelangen .
Seitdem werden regimekritische Webseiten in China nicht gefunden ( die taz berichtete ) .
Google schließt Links aus
Nun konnten die unter dem deutschen Dach der Freiwilligen Selbstkontrolle Multimedia - Dienste - Anbieter ( FSM ) zusammengeschlossenen Anbieter in enger Zusammenarbeit mit der Bundesprüfstelle für jugendgefährdende Medien ( BPjM ) einige der auch hierzulande stark frequentierten und bislang unzensierten Suchmaschinen dazu bewegen , in ihren Ergebnislisten zukünftig keine Links mehr zu Internetangeboten zu zeigen , die von der von der BPjM indiziert wurden .
Damit leisten die beteiligten Anbieter einen wichtigen Beitrag zur Verbesserung des Verbraucher - und Jugendmedienschutzes in Deutschland , hieß es .
Ausgeblendet werden sollen Angebote , die außerhalb geschlossener Benutzergruppen nicht unter die Leute gebracht werden dürfen , wie zum Beispiel Pornografie .
Auch Webseiten , deren Verbreitung ohnehin gesetzlich unzulässig ist , sollen nun von den Suchmaschinen nicht mehr zum Anklicken aufgelistet werden .
Dazu zählen u. a .
Kriegsverherrlichung , Verstöße gegen die Menschenwürde und die Darstellung von Minderjährigen in unnatürlich geschlechtsbetonter Körperhaltung .
Neonazis zensiert
Anders als im Kino , wo einem Zwölfjährigen der Zutritt verwehrt werden muss , wenn der Film von der FSK erst ab 16 freigegeben ist , gibt es hier keine Altersgrenzen .
Die Sperre gilt generell für alle Benutzer .
Damit wird es zum Beispiel für einen Studenten unerträglich schwer , für eine Hausarbeit über Neonazis zu recherchieren .
Mit Zensur habe das dennoch nichts zu tun , betonte FSM - Sprecherin Sabine Frank auf Anfrage , dies sei ein rechtsstaatliches Verfahren .
Gesetzlich geregelt ist die Zensur in China ebenfalls .
Auch dort seien nur „ sehr wenige “ Webseiten blockiert , deren Inhalte zudem mit „ Pornografie oder Terrorismus “ zu tun hätten , verteidigte der Vizechef des chinesischen Internetbüros die Zensur .
Trotzdem gibt es einen Unterschied :
In China zensierte Webseiten werden von Google , Yahoo und MSN ausgeblendet , zudem sind die Seiten auch mit direkter URL - Eingabe nicht erreichbar .
Von der Bundesprüfstelle als jugendgefährdend eingestufte Seiten tauchen ebenfalls bei Google , Yahoo und MSN nicht auf .
Hinzu kommen Lycos , Fireball , Hot Bot und t- info .
Wer jedoch die Adresse hat , kann die Seiten nach wie vor direkt aufrufen .
Noch .
Endlich ein Netz für die ganze Familie Saubermann , ein Netz in dem auch Oma klicken darf ?
Nein – der Traum der Jugendschützer wird unerfüllt bleiben .
Wer illegales oder versautes Zeug sucht , findet das auch ohne Google & Co. Nach Kinderpornos konnte noch nie gegoogelt werden , das klingt ganz nach einem vorgeschobenen Vorwand .
Beim Rest müssen erwachsene Menschen selbst entscheiden können , was sie sehen wollen und was nicht .
Alles andere ist Zensur .
Beispiel Nazis : Legal oder illegal – die muss man einfach gelesen haben .
Nur so ist zu kapieren , wie dumm und gefährlich sie wirklich sind .

For arguments sake , let us define the " Position " , P , as your standard 20 something " hot chick " on her knees , top off , mouth wide open ready to recieve a standard male member .
The rate at which said 20 something reaches the " Position " is a function of the man 's physical attractiveness ( A ) , wealth ( W ) , and percieved power / influence ( I ) ( CEO / politican / or outlaw biker factor ) and has pratically nothing to do with intelligence , morals , values how nice he is .
This relationship can be derived via classical ladder theory and is expressed as : dP / dt = aA+bW+cIWhere a , b and c are weighting factors .
Emperical studies show that in general for all women c>b>a , so power and wealth more strongly influence dP / dt.
Escorts , who assume the Position for any guy regardless of age or looks for an agreed upon fee can be fit into this theory if we generalize that the wealth term W , is really an expectation of wealth transfer over a given time frame , delta t .
Then we see that there is an equivlence to a wealthy man that will transfer money and gifts over a long time period in return for many servicings and an ordinary man who pays the fee for one hour of servicing , implying : W = ( Money Transfered ) / t orW = ( MT / t ) So the theory holds .
The formula can be generalized to all women by adding a term that tends to decrease dP / dt with age for the woman , but for now we can keep it simple by assuming that all women under the age of , say , 32 can be described as essentially escorts , trading sex for status and stuff .
Now , if we assume that the definition of creepy is dP / dt =>
O , or infinite time for her to achieve position P , then0 =
aA+bW+cIA = -( bW+cI ) / aA = ( - b / a ) W + ( - c/a ) IThis implies that if the guy has even a modicum of wealth or percieved power ( either outlaw or legitimate ) then for him to be considered creepy he would have to lack teeth and muscle tone , weigh 400 lbs , and smell like a diseased farm hog .
This then explains the origional poster .
She is on a bart train , where she has no way of acertaing either W or I from simply looking at the guy that is looking at her , so she assumes worst case low values .
Since she assumes W and I to be low to non existant ( where any guy making a middle class living is considered to be at 0 for both W and I ) , A would have to be very large ( male Calvin Klein Model type ) to get dP / dt positive .
Hence , the guy is considered " creepy " .
However , if the same guy were met , let 's say , at a reception at an art gallery and was introduced as a very successful corporate sales executive driving a late model imported sports car , he might find it a tad embarrising explaing why there was a half naked young woman on the floor in front of him tugging on his fly .
It also explains the guy on the bart train .
He knows he has money and or influence , and from experience knows that girls just like her are avaialable to him almost at a whim .
But he has no way to communicate his W or I accurately , and since his A is never usually a problem , he does not understand the impact of its low intrinsic value .
So we can see , the definition " creepy " is really a non existant concept , instead simply the result of an inability to communicate proper W and I values in a public setting , or the unfortunate consequence of the rare man who has low A , I and W values , in which case the original poster just likes bashing the unfortunate .
Faucets
Order
Surely You 're Joking , Mr. Feynman
from Powell 's
When I was in high school , I 'd see water running out of a faucet growing narrower , and wonder if I could figure out what determines that curve .
I found it was rather easy to do .
I puzzled over that one for years ; I did n't know how to start .
I kept supposing that it had something to do with surface tension and the tendency of the water surface to seek a minimal configuration , and I could n't understand how it could be " rather easy to do " .
That stuff all sounded really hard !
But one day I realized in a flash that it really is easy .
The water accelerates as it falls .
It 's moving faster farther down , so the stream must be narrower , because the rate at which the water is passing a given point must be constant over the entire stream .
( If water is passing a higher - up point faster than it passes a low point , then the water is piling up in between — which we know it does n't do .
And vice versa . )
It 's easy to calculate the speed of the water at each point in the stream .
Conservation of mass gets us the rest .
So here 's the calculation .
Let 's adopt a coordinate system that puts position 0 at the faucet , with increasing position as we move downward .
Let R( p ) be the radius of the stream at distance p meters below the faucet .
We assume that the water is falling smoothly , so that its horizontal cross-section is a circle .
Let 's suppose that the initial velocity of the water leaving the faucet is 0 .
Anything that falls accelerates at a rate g , which happens to be !!9.8 m/s^2 !! , but we 'll just call it !!g!!
and leave it at that .
The velocity of the water , after it has fallen for time !!t!! , is !!v = gt !!.
Its position !!p!! is !!\ frac12 gt^2 !!.
Thus !!v = ( 2gp ) ^{1/2} !!.
Here 's the key step : imagine a very thin horizontal disk of water , at distance p below the faucet .
Say the disk has height h .
The water in this disk is falling at a velocity of !!( 2gp ) ^{1/2} !! , and the disk itself contains volume !!\pi ( R( p ) ) ^2h !! of water .
The rate at which water is passing position !!p!!
is therefore !!\pi ( R( p ) ) ^2h \cdot ( 2gp ) ^ {1/2} !!
gallons per minute , or liters per fortnight , or whatever you prefer .
Because of the law of conservation of water , this quantity must be independent of !!p!! , so we have : $ $ \pi( R( p ) ) ^2h\cdot ( 2gp ) ^ { 1/2} = A$ $ Where !!A !! is the rate of flow from the faucet .
Solving for !!R( p ) !! , which is what we really want : $ $ R ( p ) = \ left [ \frac A{\pi h( 2gp ) ^{1/2}}\right ]
^{ 1/2} $ $
Or , collecting all the constants ( !!A , \pi , h , !! and !!g!! ) into one big constant !!k!!: $ $ R ( p ) = kp^{ - 1/4} $ $
There 's a picture of that over there on the left side of the blog .
Looks just about right , does n't it ?
Amazing .
So here 's the weird thing about the flash of insight .
I am not a brilliant - flash - of - insight kind of guy .
I 'm more of a slow - gradual - dawning - of - comprehension kind of guy .
This was one of maybe half a dozen brilliant flashes of insight in my entire life .
I got this one at a funny time .
It was fairly late at night , and I was in a bar on Ninth Avenue in New York , and I was really , really drunk .
I had four straight bourbons that night , which may not sound like much to you , but is a lot for me .
I was drunker than I have been at any other time in the past ten years .
I was so drunk that night that on the way back to where I was staying , I stopped in the middle of Broadway and puked on my shoes , and then later that night I wet the bed .
But on the way to puking on my shoes and pissing in the bed , I got this inspiration about what shape a stream of water is , and I grabbed a bunch of bar napkins and figured out that the width is proportional to !!
p^{-1/4} !!
as you see there to the left .
This is n't only time this has happened .
I can remember at least one other occasion .
When I was in college , I was freelancing some piece of software for someone .
I alternated between writing a bit of code and drinking a bit of whisky .
( At that time , I had n't yet switched from Irish whisky to bourbon . )
Write write , drink , write write , drink ... then I encountered some rather tricky design problem , and , after another timely pull at the bottle , a brilliant flash of inspiration for how to solve it .
" Oho ! " I said to myself , taking another swig out of the bottle .
" This is a really clever idea !
I am so clever !
Ho ho ho !
Oh , boy , is this clever ! "
And then I implemented the clever idea , took one last drink , and crawled off to bed .
The next morning I remembered nothing but that I had had a " clever " inspiration while guzzling whisky from the bottle .
" Oh , no , " I muttered , " What did I do ? "
And I went to the computer to see what damage I had wrought .
I called up the problematic part of the program , and regarded my alcohol - inspired solution .
There was a clear and detailed comment explaining the solution , and as I read the code , my surprise grew .
" Hey , " I said , astonished , " it really was clever . "
And then I saw the comment at the very end of the clever section : " Told you so . "
I do n't know what to conclude from this , except perhaps that I should have spent more of my life drinking whiskey .
I did try bringing a flask with me to work every day for a while , about fifteen years ago , but I do n't remember any noteworthy outcome .
But it certainly was n't a disaster .
Still , a lot of people report major problems with this strategy , so it 's hard to know what to make of my experience .

In a rebuke of a surveillance practice greatly expanded by the New York Police Department after the Sept. 11 attacks , a federal judge ruled yesterday that the police must stop the routine videotaping of people at public gatherings unless there is an indication that unlawful activity may occur .
Four years ago , at the request of the city , the same judge , Charles S. Haight Jr. , gave the police greater authority to investigate political , social and religious groups .
In yesterday ’s ruling , Judge Haight , of United States District Court in Manhattan , found that by videotaping people who were exercising their right to free speech and breaking no laws , the Police Department had ignored the milder limits he had imposed on it in 2003 .
Citing two events in 2005 — a march in Harlem and a demonstration by homeless people in front of the home of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg — the judge said the city had offered scant justification for videotaping the people involved .
THE PHARMACEUTICAL industry is getting bad press .
Recent books by Marcia Angell , the former editor of the New England Journal of Medicine , and Jerome Kassirer , another former editor of the journal , have harshly condemned the industry for recklessness , insensitivity and all - consuming greed .
They gain sales by spicing up their titles with inflammatory phrases about “ deception , ” “ complicity ” and how drug companies “ endanger your health . ”
I take a different approach .
I do n’t defend every business decision made by the great pharmaceutical research houses .
To the contrary , much recent commentary suggests that many such companies have committed themselves to a blockbuster - drug model -- in which a company ’s success or failure depends on a few vital , high - selling drugs -- that may prove unsustainable over the long haul .
If so , I believe that those firms should suffer the financial consequences of their mistaken business choices .
Government bailouts are no more appropriate for Merck and Pfizer than they are for Chrysler or Ford .
Nonetheless , critics like Angell and Kassirer are absolutely wrong to portray the nation ’s big drug companies as heartless , avaricious behemoths that act in whatever manner they choose and always get their way .
The truth is , the pharmaceutical industry is too heavily regulated .
Its big problem today is not that it ’s free to run roughshod over the needs of consumers , but that it operates in a hostile and excessive regulatory environment that frustrates sound business decision - making and keeps down pharmaceutical company share prices in the stock market .
Consider the following : Ever - tougher conflict - of - interest rules in the National Institutes of Health and such academic medical centers as the University of Pennsylvania , Stanford and Yale have reduced opportunities for fruitful collaboration between industry , government and universities .
More stringent requirements for clinical drug trials -- including rules that demand larger test populations and more extensive documentation -- have reduced the flow of new drugs to market .
( Between 1996 and 2000 , the FDA averaged about 153 new drug approvals .
Between 2001 and 2005 , the number was down to 55 , with only 15 in 2005 and 29 in 2004 . )

In addition , the industry faces major liability risks .
Consumer fraud legislation adopted in many states has generated massive , often eye - popping claims for refunds of the original purchase price -- in some cases even for drugs that have worked as promised or on the part of people who have not taken the drugs at all .
All these developments spell higher costs for the companies .
Simultaneously , regulatory attacks on the industry ’s pricing model , including recent proposals to have the government negotiate rates for all senior citizens covered under Medicare Part D , threaten its revenue stream .
The pharmaceutical industry operates in a high - fixed - cost and low - margin environment .
It costs , on average , more than a billion dollars to get the first pill to market .
All subsequent pills , however , can be made and marketed for only a few additional dollars or cents .
Of course , no user ever wants to pay the big bill for that first pill .
Instead , each fervently hopes to pay as close to marginal cost for the subsequent pills .
The problem with that is that unless someone pays for developing that first pill , there ’s no second pill to take .
The central challenge to drug pricing is to figure out , quite literally , who swallows ( and in what proportions ) that huge front - end cost .
Unfortunately , no company has a precise method to fairly , reasonably and palatably allocate the cost of drug development among the varied classes of subsequent consumers -- large HMOs , hospitals , full - service pharmacies and Medicaid for starters .
Each buyer has a strong incentive to push as many of those costs as possible onto someone else .
The upshot is a rough - and - tumble bargaining game in which drug prices vary substantially across different market segments .
But the corner drugstore does n’t have the same leverage to play one drug manufacturer off against another , so it usually pays higher prices for its wares than a large HMO .
The resulting confusion leads to loud calls for equitable , industrywide price controls .
But price controls would have the same dire consequences as they would in any other industry .
Investment dollars will quickly move elsewhere if the regulatory system does not allow manufacturers to maximize their revenues over the useful life of the drug ( which , incidentally , never exceeds the 11 or so years of patent protection ) .
Advertisement
Repeated studies , both domestic and foreign , have shown that price controls dull the incentives of pharmaceutical companies to develop new drugs .
Even talk of price controls depresses investment .
Because of its high - fixed , low - variable cost structure , the drug industry will never reach perfect competitive equilibrium .
But in our second - best world , ponder carefully the different consequences of two strategies .
The first seeks to expand supply by avoiding regulation and encouraging the entry of new companies into the business .
The second seeks to hold down prices by direct controls .
The second approach leads to low prices today but systematic shortages tomorrow , while the first leads to greater innovation today and greater choice tomorrow .
We must be careful not to mistake price controls for a cure when they are in fact a disease .
Let our new reformist Congress beware .
RFID keeps getting smaller .
On February 13 , Hitachi unveiled a tiny , new " powder " type RFID chip measuring 0.05 x 0.05 mm -- the smallest yet -- which they aim to begin marketing in 2 to 3 years .
Hitachi's new RFID chips ( left , next to a human hair ) are 64 x smaller than their mu-chips ( right )
By relying on semiconductor miniaturization technology and using electron beams to write data on the chip substrates , Hitachi was able to create RFID chips 64 times smaller than their currently available 0.4 x 0.4 mm mu-chips .
Like mu-chips , which have been used as an anti-counterfeit measure in admission tickets , the new chips have a 128 - bit ROM for storing a unique 38 - digit ID number .
The new chips are also 9 times smaller than the prototype chips Hitachi unveiled last year , which measure 0.15 x 0.15 mm .
At 5 microns thick , the RFID chips can more easily be embedded in sheets of paper , meaning they can be used in paper currency , gift certificates and identification .
But since existing tags are already small enough to embed in paper , it leads one to wonder what new applications the developers have in mind .

David Lynch and Vedic “ Science ”
I was recently offered a free ticket to see David Lynch give a talk at Emerson College .
The talk was titled “ Consciousness , Creativity , and the Brain ” .
I did n’t know why a movie director would have any particular insights on these subjects but I decided that at the least it would be amusing .
The talk was held in a huge and beautiful theater in downtown Boston , ornate with two large balconies and , from where I was sitting at least , largely full .
We were all handed free DVDs on the way in as well as “ more information ” forms with beautiful typography .
The form were headed “ The David Lynch Educational Foundation For Consciousness - Raising Education And World Peace ” .
( The “ And World Peace ” seems like it should be a joke . )
The dean of the college introduced the event by droning on about how great Emerson College was .
I tuned out but the people I went with told me he gave the standard distancing - himself - from - the - event speech , something about how they provided a range of voices to encourage the students ( profound voice : ) “ to quest , and to question ” .
Then the president of the David Lynch Foundation came up and introduced David Lynch , who apparently did n’t have a talk prepared and just took some questions from the audience .
I suspect some of the questions were plants , because they sounded so suspiciously knowledgeable about meditation , but maybe all the local meditators were attracted to the event .
In photographs , Lynch looks like an old British dude who would have a deep and thoughtful voice .
Instead , his voice is high and squeaky and sort of gimmicky - sounding , which also made it hard to take him seriously .
He finished up and the Foundation president came back to introduce Dr. John Haeglin , who he presented as one of the leading physicists of our day .
And where does this great mind work ?
The Maharishi University of Management , although the announcer cleverly pronounced this so it sounded like “ Murshy University ” , which is more plausible as an actual school .
The Maharishi University of Management ( MUM ) , however , is a phony organization set up the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi , who claims that he can fly .
( The Maharishi , you may recall , also seduced The Beatles .
Their later disappointment was the source of the song “ Sexy Sadie ” , which was originally titled “ Maharishi ” . )
Haeglin is the Maharishi ’s main man in the US , running for president on the Maharishi ’s political party ( the Natural Law Party ) , which almost received federal funds from Perot ’s Reform Party , although it narrowly lost to Pat Buchanan .
( I had my Sidekick with me , so I looked all this up on the Web while I was listening . )
Haeglin had a tricky job ahead of him .
He had to explain to the audience that practicing the Maharishi ’s Transcendental Meditation ( TM ) would send out a magical field that would make everybody nearby happy and peaceful .
But he also had to do so in such a way that this audience of college kids , did n’t just break out laughing .
The answer : science .
Haeglin gave some reasonably - accurate descriptions of recent innovations in Physics , noting that reductionism had caused us to realize that the superficial diversity asked an underlying uniformity of , he claimed , vibrating strings ( string theory ) that connect all of us together .
Now Haeglin thinks that TM will cause happy feelings to be transmitted through the strings into nearby people .
But even this seems too absurd , so he changes tacks and tries to explain it in a common sense way .
‘ If everybody is fearful and scared , ’ he says , ‘ you can sort of feel it in the air and you start to be scared .
But if everyone is happy , then it ’s just the opposite .
TM works in the same way — it puts happiness in the air . ’
He never directly connected this to his comments about string theory and I did n’t really see it until I reflected on it later .
Haeglin has done several “ scientific ” tests , claiming that a group of meditators can lower the crime rate , although when actual scientists checked some of his numbers , they found he had fabricated the crime rate statistics .
And David Lynch explained that the goal of his foundation is to raise $ 7 billion so they can provide Transcendental Meditation in every school .
( The David Lynch Foundation ’s website claims that TM can cure classroom stress , clinical depression , learning disorders , high blood pressure , and academic underachievement — oh , right , and cause world peace .
Then he introduced a Dr. Fred Travis , also from MUM , who proceeded to do an EEG of some kid ’s brain right on stage .
He showed some diagrams of the brain , insisting it had a “ CEO ” which told the rest of it what to do .
Normally , he said , the brain ’s pieces all scurry about doing whatever they feel like .
But Transcendental Meditation strengthens your CEO so he can get all the pieces of the brain working together , doing whatever the CEO wants them to do .
He demonstrated this by showing the boy ’s brainwaves normally : all over the place , doing different things .
Then he asked the boy to meditate and zoomed in on two brain waves , which started moving in tandem .
What this has to do with anything remains a mystery to me .
Then Lynch came out and took some more questions .
Nobody called him on this nonsense ( I was tempted to , but did n’t ) .
But you can —
Lynch is going on a 20 city tour of universities to spread this nonsense .
The entire event was taped so it could be webcast from his website .
You should follow me on twitter here .

VIEWPOINT
Environment ministers David Miliband , Cristina Narbona and Janez Podobnik
It is now up to governments acting as a European , and environmental , union to stand up and commit to serious climate action
Climate action : ' Now or never '
We can all justifiably be proud that last week saw the second anniversary of the start of the Kyoto Protocol ; the first ever international treaty with legally binding targets to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases .
But we all know that the current Kyoto deal does not go far enough .
If we are going to avoid the dangerous impacts of climate change - both here in Europe , but also on those countries least able to cope with its devastating consequences - then the EU must stand up and lead the debate on committing to further action to tackle climate change .
As EU ministers , we can rightly welcome the advancement brought about by Kyoto - real action to tackle greenhouse gas emissions and the establishment of a flourishing global market in carbon , worth over 7.6bn euros ( £ 5.1 bn ) in 2005 .
The EU 's emissions trading scheme is already well underway , with the UK and Spain already key players in the scheme .
Slovenia 's National Allocation Plan for Phase II was one of the first to be endorsed by the commission .
' More to be done '
We are keen to work with colleagues to support the development of a truly global carbon market with the full participation of major emitters .
The recent report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) is yet further evidence of the reality of climate change and makes clear that urgent action is necessary to halt emissions .
It is also clear to us that climate action must start here at home .
In our own homes , we can reduce the amount of energy we use to save money and the environment , and in our countries businesses are now trading carbon and accounting for their emissions .
So it is now up to governments acting as a European , and environmental , union to stand up and commit to serious climate action .
The EU is the world 's second largest consumer of energy
Of course , the climate change challenge will not be solved solely by the actions of the European Union .
But we are 27 countries and over 490 million people .
And in 2004 , these 27 countries emitted over 6,000 million tonnes of greenhouse gases .
We do therefore have a responsibility to cut our own emissions .
That 's why the EU should not back away from committing unilaterally to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by at least 20 % by 2020 - to demonstrate the seriousness with which we view this threat and to put us on a path towards a low - carbon economy .
In fact , we want and need to go further .
As part of an international agreement , the EU should agree to reduce its emissions by a further 10 % - so a 30 % cut in emissions by 2020 if others follow us .
In order to ensure fairness , a differentiated approach to the contributions of member states is needed , taking into account criteria including relevant socio-economic parameters such as emissions per capita , emissions per GDP , economic structures , mitigation potential of important sectors and competitiveness of industries .
' Ambitious target '
The analysis is clear that such a target is feasible and possible .
Indeed , the recent Stern Review on the economics of climate change concludes that tackling climate change is both achievable and affordable , yet the costs of inaction are greater than those of action .
The fact that the EU 's proposed energy strategy so closely interlinks climate change and energy security shows that they are two sides of the same coin .
A bold energy and climate strategy should be underpinned by an ambitious target on greenhouse gases , and supported by challenging goals for increasing the development and deployment of renewables and other forms of low - carbon generation and energy efficiency .
Global carbon markets will play a key role in stimulating investment in these technologies , in particular in the developing world through mechanisms such as the Clean Development Mechanism .
Carbon Capture and Storage will also be an important technology in helping us to meet our climate change objectives and we share the commission 's ambition to see all new fossil fuel power stations fitted with CCS by 2020 and therefore urge the Commission to press ahead quickly with the work assessing the practicality of this .
The window of opportunity is closing rapidly and a strong EU voice is necessary
Spain , for example , is making a big effort in working with Latin America through the Iberamerican Climate Change Network - which is addressing climate change at a political level across the continent .
' Window of opportunity '
In this context , the EU has a responsibility to demonstrate its leadership and commitment .
Without such commitment , the global agreement we all need will slide further away from our grasp .
And now is the time for stepping forward .
This year could potentially be a tipping point in the fight against climate change .
The window of opportunity is closing rapidly and a strong EU voice is necessary to provide the catalyst for UN discussions on taking effective action to cut emissions .
This is a test case for the EU 's appetite for tackling climate change .
Failing to grasp this opportunity would have serious implications for further urgent progress - as well as for the credibility of the European Union as a strong and leading international environmental player .
It is not a question of feasibility ; we have both the instruments and the policies to put the EU on track to a competitive low carbon economy .
The question that remains is whether we have the political will .
David Miliband is the UK's environment secretary ; Cristina Narbona is Spain 's environment minister and Janez Podobnik is Slovenia 's environment minister

LANGUAGES divide the spectrum up in different ways .
Welsh speakers use “ gwyrdd ” ( pronounced “ goo-irrrth ” ) as a general word for green .
Yet “ grass ” literally translates as “ blue straw ” .
That is because the Welsh word for blue ( “ glas ” ) can accommodate all shades of green .
English - speaking anthropologists affectionately squish “ green ” and “ blue ” together to call Welsh an example of a “ grue ” language .
A few of them think grue languages are spoken by societies that live up mountains or near the equator because ultraviolet radiation , which is stronger in such places , causes a progressive yellowing of the lens .
This , the theory goes , makes the eye less sensitive to short wavelengths ( those that correspond to the green and blue parts of the spectrum ) .
Unfortunately , though the Welsh do live in a hilly country , it is hardly mountainous enough — let alone sunny enough — to qualify .
The ultraviolet theory , however , is just one idea among many in the debate about the psychology of colour .
Like many debates in psychology , this one pits congenital , fundamentally genetic , explanations against explanations that rely on environmental determinism .
Psychologists in the former camp think people are born with ingrained ideas about how hues are grouped .
They believe the brain is preconditioned to pick out the six colours on a Rubik 's cube whatever tongue it is taught to think in .
The other camp , by contrast , thinks that the spectrum can be chopped into categories anywhere along its length .
Moreover , they suspect that the language an individual learns from his parents is the main explanation for where that chopping takes place .
As with most nature - versus - nurture debates , compromise seems in order .
Two papers published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences suggest where the middle ground lies .
Colourful thoughts
In the more recent of the two , which appeared this week , Terry Regier , of the University of Chicago , and his colleagues , picked at the question of preconditioned language categories .
They used a grid displaying all possible hues rolled into a globe , with black at the north pole and white at the south .
In this model , colours stick out from the sphere according to how sensitive the visual system is to them .
Bright yellow , for instance , is easily noticed against a background of other colours , so the yellow part of the sphere bulges .
Overall , the knobbly globe has exaggerated , smooth mountains with valleys in between .
If humans really are hardwired to home in on six focal colours , then all languages should assign words around those six .
Dr Regier , however , tests a subtler concept .
He thinks that useful languages should allot words in order to minimise the perceptual difference between colours of the same category , and maximise it between colours in different categories .
Unlike national boundaries , linguistic boundaries should form only in the valleys of his colour globe , never over the hills .
Dr Regier therefore programmed his computer to find the best valley borders according to whether he told it to create three , four , five or six “ countries ” on the globe .
Then , to judge whether people build languages around what their brains are best attuned to , he compared these theoretically best divisions with real - world dividing lines .
Since 1976 , Paul Kay of the University of California , Berkeley , another of the paper 's authors , has compiled a database of information about how 110 different languages assign colour adjectives to 330 different hues .
When this database was compared with the theoretical optima , nature appeared important .
The model closely fits some languages and points correctly to some details .
For instance , three - colour language systems , which lump red and yellow together , generally exclude whitish yellow from that category — as does the model .
But the results also explain where nurture gets its wiggle room .
Real lexical boundaries tend to vary where Dr Regier 's algorithm produced several options that were almost as good as each other .
In the second paper , published last week , Dr Regier and Dr Kay joined forces with Vicky Drivonikou , of the University of Surrey , in England , to address another way of investigating the question .
This relies on the fact that brains have two hemispheres , but most language - processing is done in only one of them .
For reasons that lie deep in the evolutionary history of the vertebrates , the right hemisphere deals with sensory input from the left - hand side of the body , and vice versa .
It is the left hemisphere , though , that deals with language — at least , it does in right - handed people .
If language does affect colour - perception , then it is more likely to affect perceptions from the right visual field than the left .
In the first phase of the study , the researchers showed that their volunteers ( Surrey university students ) were slower to notice a target shade of blue when it flashed up against a blue background of a different hue than when it flashed up against a green background .
Either nature or nurture ( in a non-grue language ) might explain that observation .
But the researchers went further by presenting the test separately to the left and right visual fields of their volunteers .
They found that they got the effect whichever visual field they presented the test to , but it was stronger when the presentation was to the right one ( ie , to the left - hand , language - processing side of the brain ) , than to the left one .
That suggests both sides are correct .
There is a fundamental — presumably congenital — distinction , as shown by the fact that the non-linguistic side of the brain distinguishes between blue and green .
But there is also a language - mediated one , as shown by the linguistic side 's greater response .
The true test would be to do the experiment again — in Aberystwyth .

It is something one half of the population has long suspected - and the other half always vocally denied .
Women really do talk more than men .
In fact , women talk almost three times as much as men , with the average woman chalking up 20,000 words in a day - 13,000 more than the average man .

Women also speak more quickly , devote more brainpower to chit - chat - and actually get a buzz out of hearing their own voices , a new book suggests .
The book - written by a female psychiatrist - says that inherent differences between the male and female brain explain why women are naturally more talkative than men .
In The Female Mind , Dr Luan Brizendine says women devote more brain cells to talking than men .
And , if that was n't enough , the simple act of talking triggers a flood of brain chemicals which give women a rush similar to that felt by heroin addicts when they get a high .
Dr Brizendine , a self - proclaimed feminist , says the differences can be traced back to the womb , where the sex hormone testosterone moulds the developing male brain .
The areas responsible for communication , emotion and memory are all pared back the unborn baby boy .
The result is that boys - and men - chat less than their female counterparts and struggle to express their emotions to the same extent .
" Women have an eight - lane superhighway for processing emotion , while men have a small country road , " said Dr Brizendine , who runs a female " mood and hormone " clinic in San Francisco .
There are , however , advantages to being the strong , silent type .
Dr Brizendine explains that testosterone also reduces the size of the section of the brain involved in hearing - allowing men to become " deaf " to the most logical of arguments put forward by their wives and girlfriends .
But what the male brain may lack in converstation and emotion , they more than make up with in their ability to think about sex .
Dr Brizendine says the brain 's " sex processor " - the areas responsible for sexual thoughts - is twice as big as in men than in women , perhaps explaining why men are stereotyped as having sex on the mind .
Or , to put it another way , men have an international airport for dealing with thoughts about sex , " where women have an airfield nearby that lands small and private planes " .
Studies have shown that while a man will think about sex every 52 seconds , the subject tends to cross women 's minds just once a day , the University of California psychiatrist says .
Dr Brizendine , whose book is based on her own clinical work and analyses of more than 1,000 scientific studies , added : " There is no unisex brain .
" Girls arrive already wired as girls , and boys arrive already wired as boys .
Their brains are different by the time they 're born , and their brains are what drive their impulses , values and their very reality .
" I know it is not politically correct to say this but I 've been torn for years between my politics and what science is telling us .
" I believe women actually perceive the world differently from men .
" If women attend to those differences they can make better decisions about how to manage their lives . "
Other scientists , however , are sceptical about the effects of testosterone on the brain and say many of the differences between the male and female personality can be explained by social conditioning , with a child 's upbringing greatly influencing their character .
Deborah Cameron , an Oxford University linguistics professor with a special interest in language and gender , said the amount we talk is influenced by who we are with and what we are doing .
She added : " If you aggregate a large number of studies you will find there is little difference between the amount men and women talk . "

Scripps is seeing high growth profits in its new media properties while its traditional profit market , its newspaper division is sluggish .
New media growth is on the rise at record paces as more and more advertisers are heading online instead of towards traditional print .
The profit margins for producing content online are much higher than having a traditional print division .
More and more I think traditional print companies will be shedding there print divisions this year and heading more towards an online approach .
Media company E.W. Scripps Co. , increasingly focusing on its growing cable television and Internet - based businesses , is taking a hard look at the future of its sluggish newspaper operations .
Scripps management told analysts at a conference in Las Vegas this week that the company is considering options for its newspaper division and did n’t rule out a sale or spinoff .
That news drove Scripps ’ stock to a new 52 - week high with analysts saying investors would respond well to some type of separation of the newspaper division from the company ’s higher - growth assets .
Scripps owns daily and community newspapers in 18 markets , but its highest growth is in Scripps Networks – including HGTV , Food Network , DIY Network , Fine Living and Great American Country – and Scripps Interactive Media – including online search and comparison shopping services Shopzilla and uSwitch .
Some time ago the Chinese emperor had in his service a man to serve him breakfast .
Every morning this man would come in , smiling and happy , and serve the food .
Every day the emperor woke up , grumpy and exhausted , and would see this poor man smile .
One day he decided to ask him : “ You are poor and have barely enough for you and your family to survive .
How can you be happy each morning ? ”
The man replied : ” Well , your highness , I am a lucky man .
I have a wife that loves me , and I get to serve the emperor his breakfast every day .
What more could a man ask for ? ” , and with a smile , he walked off .
The emperor was not satisfied by this answer .
So , he called in his adviser and asked him about his servant .
The adviser said : ” Your highness , it is the paradox of the 99 pieces of gold ” .
The emperor did not understand , and wanted his adviser to explain .
“ If I tell you , you would not believe it .
So the only way to find out , is to do an experiment .
Yet , with this experiment you would ruin this man ’s life forever .
Are you willing to do this ? ”
The emperor thought about it , and said he wanted to learn , so they proceeded .
The adviser placed a bag of 99 gold pieces outside the door of the servant and waited for him to find them .
Once the servant found them , the emperor and his adviser snuck up to the window to watch what happened .
They saw the servant happily pouring the gold on the table , forming piles .
As he was forming these piles , he noticed that one piece of gold was missing in order to make another pile of ten .
He started looking for it , thinking he might have dropped it , yet there was nothing .
So he started forming a plan to get that one missing piece of gold .
Since he did not receive more pay than a nickel a day , he would have to work for 3 years to get that piece of gold , yet that was what he wanted , just this final piece so he would never have to work again .
Over the coming weeks the servant would still serve the breakfast to the king , yet slowly his smile disappeared .
He also did not entertain the emperor anymore during his breakfast .
Confronting him , the emperor asked what was wrong .
The only thing the servant had to say was that his pay was too low , and he demanded more .
After this the emperor dismissed him from his service .
At the same time , the servant ’s wife left him , and a few weeks later the servant was found dead in his room , next to a pile of 99 gold coins .
SEVEN WEEKS AGO , I published my case against the Iraq war .
I wrote that although I had originally advocated military intervention in Iraq , and had even signed a letter to that effect shortly after the 9/11 attacks , I had since changed my mind .
But apparently this kind of honest acknowledgment is verboten .
In the weeks since my book came out , I ’ve been challenged , attacked and vilified from both ends of the ideological spectrum .
From the right , columnist Charles Krauthammer has accused me of being an opportunistic traitor to the neoconservative cause -- and a coward to boot .
From the left , I ’ve been told that I have “ blood on my hands ” for having initially favored toppling Saddam Hussein and that my “ apology ” wo n’t be accepted .
In our ever - more - polarized political debate , it appears that it is now wrong to ever change your mind , even if empirical evidence from the real world suggests you ought to .
I find this a strange and disturbing conclusion .
For the record , I did change my mind , but in the year preceding the war -- not after the invasion .
In 2002 , I told the London Times that “ the use of military power to push [ Iraqi democracy ] forward is a big roll of the dice .
We may not win on this one . ”
On the first anniversary of 9/11 , I argued in the Washington Post that we should invade Iraq only with approval from the U.N. Security Council , and in December of that year , I wrote a piece for the Wall Street Journal warning that the project of democratizing Iraq and the Mideast might come to look like empire and that it violated the conservative principle of prudence .

But when my political shift occurred is not important :
Even if it had come a year or two later , it would still not have represented a cowardly retreat or an apologia , but a realistic , intellectually honest willingness to face the new facts of the situation .
In my view , no one should be required to apologize for having supported intervention in Iraq before the war .
There were important competing moral goods on both sides of the argument , something that many on the left still refuse to recognize .
The U.N. in 1999 declared that all nations have a positive “ duty to protect , promote and implement ” human rights , arguing in effect that the world ’s powerful countries are complicit in human rights abuses if they do n’t use their power to correct injustices .
The debate over the war should n’t have been whether it was morally right to topple Hussein ( which it clearly was ) , but whether it was prudent to do so given the possible costs and potential consequences of intervention and whether it was legitimate for the U.S. to invade in the unilateral way that it did .
It was perfectly honorable to agonize over the wisdom of the war , and in many ways admirable that people on the left , such as Christopher Hitchens , George Packer , Michael Ignatieff and Jacob Weisberg , supported intervention .
That position was much easier to defend in early 2003 , however , before we found absolutely no stocks of chemical or biological weapons and no evidence of an ongoing nuclear weapons program .
( I know that many on the left believe that the prewar estimates about Hussein ’s weapons of mass destruction were all a deliberate fraud by the Bush administration , but if so , it was one in which the U.N. weapons inspectors and French intelligence were also complicit . )
It was also easier to support the war before we knew the full dimensions of the vicious insurgency that would emerge and the ease with which the insurgents could disrupt the building of a democratic state .
But in the years since then , it is the right that has failed to come to terms with these uncomfortable facts .
The failure to find WMD and to make a quick transition to a stable democracy -- as well as the prisoner abuse and the inevitable bad press that emerges from any prolonged occupation -- have done enormous damage to America ’s credibility and standing in the world .
These intangible costs have to be added to the balance sheet together with the huge direct human and monetary costs of the war .

Secretary of State Condoleezza
Rice recently admitted that the United States made numerous tactical errors in Iraq , but she insisted that the basic strategic decision to go to war was still as valid as ever because we foreclosed once and for all the possibility that Iraq would break out of sanctions and restart its WMD programs .
But we now know a lot that throws that fundamental strategic rationale into question .
The Iraq Survey Group and the U.S. military have released hundreds of pages of documents on Iraq ’s prewar WMD programs showing that , at times , Hussein believed he possessed biological weapons that did n’t exist and that , at other times , he led his most senior commanders to believe he had WMD capabilities that he knew were entirely fictitious .
His government was so corrupt , incompetent and compartmentalized that it is far from certain that he would have succeeded in building a a nuclear program even if sanctions had been lifted .
Nor is it clear that a breakdown of the sanctions regime was inevitable , given an energized United States and the very different political climate that existed after 9/11 .
The logic of my prewar shift on invading Iraq has now been doubly confirmed .
I believe that the neoconservative movement , with which I was associated , has become indelibly associated with a failed policy , and that unilateralism and coercive regime change cannot be the basis for an effective American foreign policy .
I changed my mind as part of a necessary adjustment to reality .

What has infuriated many people is President Bush ’s unwillingness to admit that he made any mistakes whatsoever in the whole Iraq adventure .
On the other hand , critics who assert that they knew with certainty before the war that it would be a disaster are , for the most part , speaking with a retrospective wisdom to which they are not entitled .
Many people have noted the ever - increasing polarization of American politics , reflected in news channels and talk shows that cater to narrowly ideological audiences , and in a House of Representatives that has redistricted itself into homogeneous constituencies in which few members have to appeal to voters with diverse opinions .
This polarization has been vastly amplified by Iraq : Much of the left now considers the war not a tragic policy mistake but a deliberate criminal conspiracy , and the right attacks the patriotism of those who question the war .
This kind of polarization affects a range of other complex issues as well :
You ca n’t be a good Republican if you think there may be something to global warming , or a good Democrat if you support school choice or private Social Security accounts .
Political debate has become a spectator sport in which people root for their team and cheer when it scores points , without asking whether they chose the right side .
Instead of trying to defend sharply polarized positions taken more than three years ago , it would be far better if people could actually take aboard new information and think about how their earlier commitments , honestly undertaken , actually jibe with reality -- even if this does on occasion require changing your mind .
FRANKFURT , June 27 — Are Americans finally ready to get Smart ?
DaimlerChrysler , which shelved an earlier plan to bring its Smart mini-car brand to the United States , plans to announce on Wednesday that it will introduce the tiny , two - seat vehicle to the American market early in 2008 , according to several executives at the company .
The German - American carmaker is calculating that with stubbornly high gasoline prices , mounting concerns about global warming , and waning interest in sport- utility vehicles , consumers in the United States will welcome a car that is no larger than a good - sized riding mower .
" Now is the right time to go to the U.S. , " said a senior executive at DaimlerChrysler , who spoke on condition of anonymity because the plans were not yet public .
" The world , and the U.S. , has changed in the last two years . "
The Smart car has won a hip image in European cities like Rome and Paris , with their serpentine streets and snug parking spaces .
It was recently featured in the film " The Da Vinci Code , " as well as in the remake of " The Pink Panther , " in which it served as the ride of choice for Inspector Jacques Clouseau .
Programming ATMs to Believe $ 20 Bills Are $ 5 Bills
Clever attack :
Last month , a man reprogrammed an automated teller machine at a gas station on Lynnhaven Parkway to spit out four times as much money as it should .
He then made off with an undisclosed amount of cash .
No one noticed until nine days later , when a customer told the clerk at a Crown gas station that the machine was disbursing more money than it should .
Police are now investigating the incident as fraud .
Police spokeswoman Rene Ball said the first withdrawal occurred at 6:17 p.m. Aug. 19 .
Surveillance footage documented a man about 5 - foot - 8 with a thin build walking into the gas station on the 2400 block of Lynnhaven Parkway and swiping an ATM card .
The man then punched a series of numbers on the machine ’s keypad , breaking the security code .
The ATM was programmed to disburse $ 20 bills .
The man reprogrammed the machine so it recorded each $ 20 bill as a $ 5 debit to his account .
The suspect returned to the gas station a short time later and took more money , but authorities did not say how much .
Because the account was pre-paid and the card could be purchased at several places , police are not sure who is behind the theft .
What ’s weird is that it seems that this is easy .
The ATM is a Tranax Mini Bank 1500 .
And you can buy the manuals from the Tranax website .
And they ’re useful for this sort of thing :
I am holding in my hands a legitimately obtained copy of the manual .
There are a lot of security sensitive things inside of this manual .
As promised , I am not going to reveal them , but there are : Instructions on how to enter the diagnostic mode
Default passwords Default Combinations For the Safe Do not ask me for them .
If you maintain one of these devices , make sure that you are not using the default password .
If you are , change it immediately .
This is from an eWeek article :
“ If you get your hand on this manual , you can basically reconfigure the ATM if the default password was not changed .
My guess is that most of these mini - bank terminals are sitting around with default passwords untouched , ” Goldsmith said .
Officials at Tranax did not respond to eWEEK requests for comment .
According to a note on the company ’s Web site , Tranax has shipped 70,000 ATMs , self - service terminals and transactional kiosks around the country .
The majority of those shipments are of the flagship Mini -Bank 1500 machine that was rigged in the Virginia Beach heist .
So , as long as you can use an account that ’s not traceable back to you , and you disguise yourself for the ATM cameras , this is a pretty easy crime .
e Week claims you can get a copy of the manual simply by Googling for it .
( Here ’s one on eBay .
And Tranax is promising a fix that will force operators to change the default passwords .
But honestly , what ’s the liklihood that someone who ca n’t be bothered to change the default password will take the time to install a software patch ?
EDITED TO ADD ( 9/22 ) : Here ’s the manual .

On a quick break from his job as a trash hauler , Rob Chapman was in the mood for some coffee .
So he pulled his truck into the Sweet Spot Cafe , a drive - through espresso stand on busy Aurora Avenue here in the Seattle suburbs .
“ Do you want a Wet Dream or the Sexual Mix today , honey ? ” asked barista Edie Smith , dressed in a tight - fitting yellow blouse that did a less than fully effective job of covering her cleavage .
She leaned down in the window , perhaps all the closer to hear his order .
He chose the first option : a coffee with white chocolate , milk and caramel sauce .
It is possible , of course , that Chapman and the dozens of other drive - by customers at the parking lot stand one recent morning stopped by only for the coffee .
But , as Chapman dryly observed , “ I do enjoy coming here more than Starbucks . ”

In a way , it is perhaps stunning that it took so long for entrepreneurs here to figure out that coffee , the fabled Seattle obsession , mixes very well with sex , the fabled human obsession .
But apparently it does , to judge from the growing number of steamy espresso stands that have popped up around the region in the last year or so .
At the Sweet Spot here in Shoreline , the Natte Latte in Port Orchard and the Bikini Espresso in Renton , not to mention the multi-stand Cowgirls Espresso , the term “ hot coffee ” has clearly taken on a whole new meaning .
Some of the “ sexpresso ” stands , as they are called , have proved so popular that neighbors , including adjacent businesses , have started to complain .
Not that it ’s done much good .

“ Really , there is no ordinance against scantily clad baristas , ” said John Urquhart , a spokesman for the Sheriff ’s Department in King County , which includes Seattle and most suburbs .
As long as breasts and buttocks are more or less covered , it ’s legal to serve coffee in a baby - doll negligee and chaps , as a barista was doing at a Cowgirls Espresso stand the other day .
“ It ’s sort of like a Hooters for coffee , ” Urquhart explained .
“ It ’s not against the law .
And the truth is , a lot of them are doing a land - office business . ”
The Sweet Spot ’s owner , Sarah Araujo , claims to have started the trend two years ago , after brainstorming ways to set her business apart .
( A shortage of coffee places is not a problem in Seattle , so the competition is ferocious . )

Soon , the Sweet Spot was doing “ theme days ” : Tube Top Tuesdays , Wet T - Shirt Wednesdays and Fantasy Fridays .
Drinks were given new names : The Sexual Mix , for instance , is a caramel macchiato with vanilla and milk .
The inevitable job titles cropped up as well -- many of the women who sell the coffee describe themselves as “ bodacious baristas ” or “ bikini baristas . ”
Although the stands seem to attract plenty of female customers , there do n’t appear to be very many male “ buff baristas . ”

“ We do n’t have any male baristas , no , ” said Smith , 38 .
“ There is a husband who works here , but he basically does our slave work ” -- removing the grounds from the coffee machines , washing the dishes , taking out the trash , that sort of thing .
At Cowgirls Espresso , all 26 employees are women .
Most of the baristas say that they are paid at or just above minimum wage -- but that they can also make as much as $ 200 in tips during a seven - hour shift .

At Tully ’s , a decidedly more mainstream chain of coffee shops in Seattle , barista Alex Torres , 17 , said he was lucky if he got a $ 10 share on his shift from the plastic tips box .
Still , Torres said , he was glad not to work at a sexpresso stand .
“ It just does n’t seem right , selling coffee in a bikini , ” said Torres , a sophomore at Seattle ’s Ballard High School .
“ It seems degrading to the women . ”
And while the money is good for the racy - themed baristas , plenty of other people agree with Torres that it is exploitative and demeaning .

When the Seattle Times recently ran a feature article with photographs on the “ sexpresso ” stands , several readers wrote in to complain .
“ Is this a NEWSpaper , or a porn magazine ? ” one Seattle woman wrote .
Other readers accused the paper of using sex to boost sales , just as the coffee stands were doing .
In any event , the article was “ far and away the most - read story on our Web site for days , ” wrote Michael R. Fancher , the paper ’s editor at large , in a subsequent column .
“ You can decide whether that suggests salacious interest , natural curiosity or both . ”

Part I : Making a Basic Rope Harness
In shibari , a rope harness that wraps around the torso is called a " karada . "
While some forms of shibari are highly ritualized , with specific names given to different styles of knot and different parts of the harness , a more relaxed and informal style of rope bondage is a lot of fun .
The simple karada shown here is very easy to make .
A basic karada can be made with a length of rope about 25 ' long .
The rope I 'm using here is 40 ' long , because that leaves a lot of extra rope for doing interesting things once the karada is made , which we 'll explore in Part 2 .
Ready ?
Here we go !
Most forms of rope harness begin by locating the center of the rope you 're using .
To make this easier , once you 've found the midpoint of your rope , tie a small piece of thread or string around it ; that way , you never have to search for it again .
First , find the center point of the rope .
The center of the rope drapes around the back of the person 's neck .
Bring the ends of the rope around one another three times ; these three twists will become the three diamonds you see in the front of the finished rope harness .
Bring the two ends of the rope between the person 's legs ...
... then up and apart on the other side .
From this point , each end of the rope will wrap around the person 's hips and then through the lowest twist in front , which sounds complicated but is actually quite easy :
See ?
Nothing to it .
Do n't pull the rope tight ; as you continue this process , bringing the ends of the rope around to the front , passing them through the twists , and then bringing them back again , the rope will need to slide to let the diamonds open up in the front .
It 's okay if the rope is loose at this point ; it will become tighter as you work your way up .
You 'll do the same thing again -- pass the ends of the rope around the person 's back , then around the front and through the twist , like so :
As you might imagine , you 'll do this same thing one more time .
Bring the ends of the rope around the person 's body and behind the person , then back around the front and through the topmost twist .
After you do this , you can bring the ends of the rope over the top of the person 's shoulders , or back around beneath the persons arms like I show here .
( I 'll demonstrate going over the top of the person 's shoulders in the section about making a simple karada using chain instead of rope . )
So the rope goes around to the front of the person 's body , through the topmost twist , then back around behind the person again ; from there , you bring the ends up underneath the rope where it passes around the person 's neck , and down beneath the rope wrapping around the person 's back .
( It 's easier than it sounds , I promise . )
If you 're using a 25 ' length of rope , you will probably find that there 's not enough rope left at this point to run down the persons back .
No problem ; at this point , you just wrap or tie off the ends of the rope wherever you like -- around the part where it loops around the back of the person 's neck , or around the part where it crosses behind the person 's back , or whatever .
There are all kinds of things you can do any time you find yourself with extra rope .
One of the simplest things you can do is use the extra rope to make a wrap :
It 's exactly as simple as it looks .
The free end of the rope wraps around and around another part of the rope ; if you reach the end of the rope , just tuck it beneath the wrap .
This technique is quite handy for making " handles " that are quite convenient for grabbing , if you like .
For some more things you can do with a longer piece of rope , stay tuned for the next installment .
For the 20 centuries between Plato and Kant , the study of beauty was a signature concern of philosophy .
Recently , however , beauty has largely been dropped from the philosophical curriculum .
The story of how this has come to pass is inseparable from a broader story about how philosophy itself has become so hopelessly professionalized .
Contemporary philosophers , preoccupied with their small quarrels , have abandoned the discussion of beauty to the likes of Elaine Scarry and Denis Donoghue and their colleagues in art and English departments .
It should come as little surprise , then , that beauty has been smuggled back into philosophy by Alexander Nehamas , a professor of philosophy at Princeton , whose previous books have made wideranging inquiries into what he calls " the art of living . "
Mr. Nehamas is among his generation 's few heirs to a philosophical tradition in America  which runs from Emerson and William James through Richard Rorty and Stanley Cavell  that believes it might have something useful to say to an educated public .
For Plato , beauty was inseparable from eros , or desire .
Roughly with Kant , however , philosophers became increasingly " mistrustful of passion " for all the usual reasons : its baseness , unreliability , and emotional illogic .
Kantian philosophy sought to eliminate passion from beauty , replacing it with a model of disinterested contemplation .
Kant called this category " the aesthetic , " which Mr. Nehamas interprets as " pleasure bereft of desire . "
Mr. Nehamas 's brief but reverberant new book , " Only a Promise of Happiness " ( Princeton , 186 pages , $ 29.95 ) , proposes that we once again talk about beauty as " identical with the spark of desire . "
A beautiful object is , quite simply , one that beckons us to it .
In the phrase Mr. Nehamas has borrowed from Stendhal , beauty is a " promise of happiness , " a hint that a closer relationship with the beautiful object might enrich our lives .
When we are captivated by beauty  in a person or an artwork  we find ourselves following wherever that beauty may lead , well aware that we might be forever changed by the encounter .
Mr. Nehamas 's prose is so slyly witty ( " I can remember , and I hope you do too , how lovely it felt when I began to hate Hermann Hesse " ) that it 's easy to underestimate the implications of his argument .
Not only professional philosophy but large swaths of culture begin to look different once we 've included desire and uncertainty in our idea of beauty .
When , for example , we talk about beauty in purely formal terms  as Modernist critics did we must conclude that beauty will always be a rare thing , its appreciation inherently difficult .
But if instead we agree with Mr. Nehamas that beauty is identical to desire , that desire longs for engagement , and that such engagements are invariably risky , we might talk about beauty as we would talk about friendship : not as a verdict of something 's worth but as indication that a relationship with the beautiful object will continue to give us unexpected pleasures over time .
Mr. Nehamas uses this deceptively simple idea  that any perspective on beauty requires what Proust called " this great dimension of Time "  to reframe the history of Modernism , to reconceive the role of the reviewer , and to demolish casually an array of philosophical and cultural distinctions : reality / appearance , physical / mental , description / interpretation .
To do justice to Mr. Nehamas 's vision would require a book many times the length of his own .
One example must suffice here : the putative distinction between high and low culture .
Mr. Nehamas devotes his longest chapter to Manet 's " Olympia " and the effect the painting has had on him , but he also frequently invokes the television shows " Oz , " " Frasier , " and " St. Elsewhere . "
" Watching television and spending time thinking and even writing about it may well be ruining my character and wasting my life .
Perhaps , though , you are missing something that could really add to yours , " Mr. Nehamas writes .
Because our most meaningful encounters with beauty unfold over time , we can only ever say in retrospect that a beautiful object has or has not made our lives  or our culture  better .
" The perils of the popular arts , aesthetic and moral , seem greater because the jury , so to speak , is still out , and their place within culture is not yet determined . "
The difference between high and low culture is thus spread out along a spectrum of how powerful  and how enduring  our experiences with beauty are .
On one end is pornography , which provides ephemeral satisfaction of uncomplicated desires .
On the other end is Proust , which Mr. Nehamas claims he literally could not imagine his life without .
In the middle lie " Olympia " and " St. Elsewhere " and other preoccupations that hold our interest to varying degrees .
We might one day find , as Swann did with Odette , that we have wasted decades in pursuit of an undeserving beauty .
We might also find that years of sitting in front of " Frasier " reruns has proven more inspiring than we ever would have guessed .
Beauty is only ever that promise :
There is no a priori judgment that might reveal what will prove evanescent and what sustaining .
In seeking such a failsafe , the philosophical tradition since Kant has made aesthetics a science of indifference .
By inventing " pleasure bereft of desire , " it found itself unable to tell us anything meaningful about beauty or desire .
In Mr. Nehamas 's vision , the possibility of beauty is well worth the price of uncertainty .
We ’ve already had a thread about strange buildings from Soviet era .
Today we ’ve got another piece of strange architecture , now from modern Russia .
That ’s a building made in the form of giant bar code , the same bar code we see on all the goods in a supermarket .
It seems to be an office building made of modules .
It ’s from St. Petersburg , Russia , and was submitted by Jolq , would somebody be able to read the barcode ?
AMERICA loves a winner .
Almost every business magazine and trade publication compiles its annual list of the fastest - growing or the finest - managed or the farthest - seeing companies in its universe .
But what happens at the other end of the scale ?
Which are America 's most hated companies , and why ?
None claims the title publicly , yet some must deserve it .
This deeply unscientific stab at an answer relies mainly on a searching of databases , a trolling of blogs , and conversations with business - school professors across the country .
Polling and focus - group data have been sought but not always obtained .
“ Our clients would so like not to be included in this project ” , explained one corporate - reputation consultant .
Any conclusions which may inadvertently be reached should be viewed as provisional , anecdotal and , above all , not actionable .
James Hoopes , a professor of business ethics at Babson College in Massachusetts , suggests reaching back to the end of the 18th century for the first enterprise to provoke public loathing .
That , he says , would be the First Bank of the United States , founded in 1791 , which did the work of a central bank even though private investors held most of its shares .
Jeffersonians denounced it as an unconstitutional victory of commerce over farming .
Refounded in 1816 as the Second Bank of the United States , it over - lent wildly and then called in its money , sparking financial panic .
President Andrew Jackson ended its special status in 1836 .
Five years later , as an ordinary commercial bank , it went bust .
That was a true one - off .
Big business in a rough - edged version of its modern form arrived with the robber barons of the late 19th century .
That era's most - hated company , though by no means the worst of them , was Standard Oil , a monopoly founded by John D. Rockefeller in the 1870s , and finally broken up by court order in 1911 .
Standard Oil was America's “ first and reigning champion of public wrath ” , says George David Smith , a professor at New York University 's Stern School of Business .
To corner the market in infamy ( as well as in refining capacity ) might seem a harsh fate for a company that was not particularly malevolent by the exacting standards of its time , and really quite laudable in an historical perspective .
( For a bona fide bad - hat , Jay Gould was probably the top contender ; see article . )
The efficiencies and economies of scale achieved by Standard Oil helped the whole world to industrialise and grow richer .
The firm 's success may well have left all Americans better off , save for the competitors that it drove out of business .
But still Americans chafed at it , says Mr Smith , because “ Throughout our history we do n't mind that people become rich but we do mind that people become powerful .
Standard Oil had the first real problem with that among public companies . ”
Rockefeller 's empire became , says Mr Smith , “ a proxy for everything that Americans feared — and what they feared was a concentration of power . ”
Here Americans diverged sharply from Europeans , who have been much more comfortable with concentrations of power manifested in big government and nationalised industries .
Where Americans fret about trusts and combinations that stifle future winners , Europeans fret about unbridled competition that guarantees future losers .
To be fair on Standard Oil , it could also be a pretty nasty operator when it chose .
Rockefeller conspired with railway companies to ensure that his rivals would pay much higher freight charges than he did , and that their payments would secretly cross-subsidise discounts for Standard Oil .
That cost disadvantage left independent refiners with a choice between going bust over time , or selling out to Standard Oil for the scrap value of their plant .
And the more Standard Oil grew , the more people 's feet it stepped on .
If it cut prices , competitors complained about unfair competition .
If it raised prices , consumers complained about gouging .
A top Standard Oil manager , William Warden , wrote in 1887 that the firm , albeit “ a success unparalleled in commercial history ” , was viewed almost everywhere as “ the representative of all that is evil , hard hearted , oppressive [ and ] cruel . ”
The Wall Street Crash of 1929 spread its shock and misery so indiscriminately that no one corporation could be held accountable for it — though National City Bank , and its president , Charles Mitchell , did more than their share of running the market up .
The system took the blame , as it did for the depression which followed in the 1930s .
The 1940s and 1950s were golden decades for big business , when America 's leading companies basked in the admiration of a diligent public .
Prosperity was advancing more evenly across society , and no industrial revolution intervened to create a provocative new monopoly in a leading industry , in the manner of Standard Oil and , later , Microsoft .
Hostilities between business and society resumed in the 1960s with the Vietnam War and the rise of rebellious baby - boomers .
Student demonstrators marched against many things that decade , but rarely as often as they did against Dow Chemical , maker of napalm and Agent Orange .
Dow was on its way to earning a lifetime achievement award for the courting of controversy .
In the 1980s and 1990s the silicone breast implants which it produced jointly with Corning , a glass company , gave rise to an unfounded public health scare and class - action suits costing up to $ 3.2 billion .
In 2001 Dow Chemical bought Union Carbide , operator of a plant at Bhopal in India , where a leak of toxic chemicals in 1984 produced the biggest industrial disaster of modern times .
If Dow Chemical did not find itself in the headlines from time to time , that was scarcely for want of trying .
No smoke without fire
Between the mid-1960s and the mid-1990s the American public went sour on a whole industry : big tobacco .
Fair enough , many would say .
“ If you are killing people , it does n't matter whether you are creating shareholder value , you are still bad , ” observes Mason Carpenter , a professor at the University of Wisconsin - Madison School of Business .
Yet the American public has gone on liking alcohol companies and , for the most part , fast - food companies , even though their products also ruin many people 's heath .
The key difference , probably , was the growing belief in the dishonesty of tobacco firms .
The industry had fought off private lawsuits for 30 years by insisting , in effect , that it knew no more about the hazards of smoking than anybody else did .
But as scientific evidence mounted and company documents were leaked , the public lost faith .
Now , “ probably everybody thinks of tobacco companies as being intrinsically bad , ” says Stern 's Mr Smith .
Set against big tobacco , Microsoft looks positively benign .
And , in every significant way , it is .
Its frequent designation as a most - hated company from the late - 1980s onward always owed more to the quality than to the quantity of its critics — computer users with infinite scope to air their views through e-mail and the internet .
Probably never was a company insulted so ingeniously and elaborately .
Type “ hate Bill Gates ” into Google even now , and you will probably get over 15,000 hits .
Type “ love Bill Gates ” , and on a good day ( for Mr Gates ) you may get 2,000 .
The ubiquity of Microsoft 's operating system was frustrating enough for consumers accustomed to exercising choice elsewhere in their lives .
The company made things worse by managing its ruthlessness clumsily , trying to conquer every other software and internet market worth having .
But the verdict of history will be kind .
By popularising and standardising personal computing , Microsoft laid the foundations of an industrial and technological revolution too big for any one company to control .
Most Americans applauded this achievement , even while the federal government was trying to break up Microsoft ( see chart ) .
But enough of even - handed judgments .
The end of the 1990s brought a company with nothing to be said for it whatsoever .
Few would dispute Enron 's right to the title of America 's most - hated company , at least since Standard Oil .
Nominally an energy company , Enron filed for bankruptcy in 2001 after inflating its balance sheet with so many dodgy asset - financing deals that nobody outside the boardroom understood quite what it was doing other than misusing shareholders ' money .
“ Basically bandits ” , says Mr Carpenter .
“ There is a BS factor there that makes people feel very strongly negative , ” says David Kirsch , a professor at the University of Maryland 's Robert H. Smith School of Business .
“ An authentic emblem of corporate corruption , and will remain so another hundred years from now , ” according to Stern 's Mr Smith .
Much the same might be said of WorldCom , a telecoms firm which combined the worst features of the dotcom boom with those of an Enron - style accounting scandal .
After declaring bankruptcy , Worldcom was reborn as MCI , then bought in 2005 by Verizon , another big telecom firm .
Its former boss , Bernie Ebbers , was jailed for 25 years .
A straw poll by Fred Bateman , a professor of economics at the University of Georgia 's Terry College of Business , brings us to the present .
He asked three classes in economics , about 100 students in all , which company they thought was the most hated in America .
They almost all said Wal - Mart .
And , in its darker moments , Wal - Mart might almost half - agree .
For the past two or three years it has endured spikes of public hostility provoked by labour unions that want to organise in its stores , communities that want to shut it out to safeguard local commerce , and by periodic rows over claims that Wal - Mart was using illegal immigrants as cleaners , paying its staff so little that they relied on welfare benefits , and systematically underpaying female workers .
Having tried at first to stare down its critics , Wal - Mart has moved in the past year to recruit a high - powered team of lobbyists and consultants , including former advisers to Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton , to manage its image and interests more actively .
As with Microsoft , Wal - Mart is loved at least as much as it is hated , often by the same people .
You can hate its market power while loving its low prices , though these are two sides of the same coin .
“ What they do , they do really well , ” says Mr Kirsch , “ and they share the benefits .
If they can get a thing 10 % cheaper , then 5 % goes to the shareholders and 5 % to the customers .
It 's that simple .
But we get back to the inherent problem of size .
Big boxes in small towns .
When you get very big you are bound to do things that will piss people off . ”
Any trot this brisk through a century of pissed - off people will risk neglecting many corporate reputations worthy of separate discussion —
Manville , McDonald 's and Martha Stewart , for example , to pause only at the Ms.
But still , a few general truths emerge .
The main one is that Americans are generally accepting of big business , but only so long as they feel in control of it , as citizens or as consumers .
They lose that sense when a company wins a monopoly for its products , or when it comes busting into a community and displacing local commerce , or when its officers break the law .
When that happens , they are disproportionately shocked and hostile , because they see it as a violation both of the natural order of things , and of their trust .
But so long as that does not happen , business can get on with its job of making and selling things , almost whatever they may be .
Americans are not unduly excited about arms makers , for example , or sellers of genetically modified crops .
Monsanto may be the most - hated American company in Europe , but it is scarcely noticed in America .
Where is public hostility turning next ?
Big oil is one target .
Unlike in Europe , where governments get most of the blame for high petrol prices , because taxes account for so much of the final cost , the American public holds oil firms mainly responsible .
No surprise , then , that while oil prices have been soaring in 2005 , esteem for oil companies has been plummeting .
A Gallup poll in August found that 42 % of Americans disliked the oil industry , including 35 % who disliked it very much indeed .
Plus ça change , as John D. Rockefeller might say .

Clarification
National City Corporation of Cleveland , Ohio , asks us to make clear that it is not related to the National City Bank mentioned above
I first met Kelbessa last December , a few days before Christmas , in a fluorescent - lighted room inside the Atlanta City Detention Center , a 14 - story municipal jail where the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement leases space .
He shuffled in , led by a beefy prison guard , his legs shackled , his arms cuffed before him and affixed to a chain around his waist .
He was wearing a bright orange prison uniform .
His hair was thin , and his mustache was flecked with gray .
Though only 55 , he looked very frail .
Kelbessa contorted his wrists within the cuffs in order to offer a handshake .
Then he sat down on a hard wooden bench .
" I did n't expect from America this kind of stuff , because this is a very highly civilized country , " he told me .
" I was trying to improve myself .
I bought a house .
I was working hard .
And all of a sudden , they accused me , the government accused me . "
Kelbessa lowered his voice for emphasis and said , " I am not a torturer . "
Kelbessa will be kept in detention for as long as his deportation case is pending , which is mandated by law , because his 2002 conviction in Ethiopia means that he is classified as a violent felon .
" Because he 's facing life when he returns to Ethiopia , he 's also considered a very high flight risk , " Schroeder says .
Kelbessa says that that sentence was a product of a " sham trial . "
The damning memos that prosecutors uncovered have been taken out of context , he claims .
When I asked him what he meant when he wrote his superiors about " weeding out " resistance fighters , he laughed .
" That is revolutionary language , " he said .
Kelbessa is terrified of what will happen to him if he is deported .
He has seen the inside of an Ethiopian prison before .
In 1979 , as the Red Terror was winding down , the forces of the revolution turned against him , and he was purged .
Kelbessa was jailed , and only released when the military regime pardoned him several years later .
Eventually it granted Kelbessa permission to emigrate to the United States , where he claimed asylum , saying , truthfully , that he had been a prisoner .
" I was tortured for five years , " Kelbessa said .
He claimed he had never lied to immigration officials and said he believed that the United States had merely been duped by his home country 's present government , which is led by Prime Minister Meles Zenawi , a former anti-Mengistu rebel .
" I am just a victim , " Kelbessa said .
" I am a victim of the Ethiopian government .
Before , I was a victim of the Derg military government .
I can't tolerate torture now .
I am old now for torture . "
Kelbessa 's fears may not be entirely unfounded .
Prime Minister Meles 's regime has gone to great pains to give the perpetrators of the Red Terror fair trials .
It 's a poor country , however , and the special tribunals have had to deal with more than 2,000 defendants .
Human rights groups have documented numerous irregularities .
" Ethiopia has violated the rights of the defendants in its pursuit of justice , " concluded a law review article by one American lawyer who consulted the tribunal .
Prison conditions are uniformly awful .
In the last year , Kelbessa is quick to note , Ethiopia 's political situation has taken a drastic turn for the worse , as Meles has jailed journalists and opposition politicians .
Human Rights
Watch says political prisoners are sometimes abused .
Since the United States enacted its new , tough law aimed at immigrants with a history of committing atrocities , some have questioned it , wondering whether the United States should be sending anyone , however loathsome , to places where their own rights might in turn be violated .
" There has been a great deal of debate within the human rights community about the immigration option , " says William Aceves , a law professor and the principal author of a 2002 Amnesty International report titled " United States of America : A Safe Haven for Torturers , " which highlighted Kelbessa 's case .
" It 's frustrating , because the human rights community is in favor of accountability , but we want to make sure that it 's legitimate accountability . "
Aceves and others point out that the United States has a federal torture statute , passed in 1994 , which applies to acts committed anywhere in the world .
But no one has ever been charged under the law .
For now , the United States government is putting its energies into deportation cases instead .
In less than two years , the immigration bureau has prosecuted or investigated more than 1,000 cases related to human rights abuses .
Legal advocates for immigrants , however , caution that many of those caught thus far appear to be marginal figures , not masterminds .
Deportation cases are handled in a special nationwide system of immigration courts .
As a result of the federal government 's new vigilance about human rights abusers , these courts are increasingly playing a new role , as a way station between exile and , presumably , a trial back home .
Even the best - run court system , however , would struggle with such distant events as the crimes of the Red Terror , with their complex political and ethnic overtones , and human rights advocates question whether the immigration court system , which is overburdened , underfinanced and opaque , is up to the task .
" It 's a really shocking system , " says Carolyn Patty Blum , a Columbia University law professor who specializes in asylum and human rights cases .
The standard of proof for deportation is lower than it is for criminal trials .
There are usually few witnesses called .
The proceedings are often closed to the public .
There is no public defender .
Every citizen would be issued with a carbon " credit card " - to be swiped every time they bought petrol , paid an energy utility bill or booked an airline ticket - under a nationwide carbon rationing scheme that could come into operation within five years , according to a feasibility study commissioned by the environment secretary , David Miliband , and published today .
In an interview with the Guardian Mr Miliband said the idea of individual carbon allowances had " a simplicity and beauty that would reward carbon thrift " .
He acknowledged the proposal faced technical difficulties , but said ministers needed to seek ways of overcoming them .
The idea was floated in a speech in the summer , but the detailed proposals show Mr Miliband is serious about trying to press ahead with the radical idea as a central part of his climate change strategy .
Under the scheme , everybody would be given an annual allowance of the carbon they could expend on a range of products , probably food , energy and travel .
If they wanted to use more carbon , they would be able to buy it from somebody else .
And they could sell any surplus .
The study was prepared by the Centre for Sustainable Energy for the Department for Environment , Food and Rural Affairs .
It argues that firms like Tesco have shown that complex computer schemes logging billions of transactions are feasible .
" Tesco Clubcard is collecting , storing and analysing some 50bn pieces of data a year , " it says .
The study also claims that individual carbon trading is less regressive than carbon taxes , as the poor emit less than the rich .
Instead of flat " green " taxes it proposes a hybrid system using permits and taxes , with the permits possibly issued , tracked and traded through the existing banking system using pin and chip technology .
Carbon allowances could be treated as bank accounts .
The report admits huge questions would have to be resolved , including the risk of fraud , the relationship to ID cards , and costs .
However Mr Miliband said " bold thinking is required because the world is in a dangerous place " .
He said : " It is a way of pricing carbon emissions into individual behaviour and it would recognise carbon thrift , as well as economic thrift .
Twenty years ago if I had said 8 million people would have a Tesco loyalty card , no one would have believed me . "
The scheme will be discussed at a special cabinet committee on the future role of the state convened for today .
VIDEO : Whistleblower uses YouTube to tell his story RAW STORY
Published : Tuesday August 29 , 2006 Print This Email This
An article in this morning 's Washington Post reveals that for the first known time , a whistleblower working on a US Government contract has posted a video on YouTube making his case about a problem inside government .
RAW STORY has located the video referred to in the Post article and made it available here .
The Washington Post story tells the case of Michael De Kort , an engineer for Lockheed Martin , who worked on a US Coast Guard contract to replace the patrol boats used by the service .
The contract is worth billions of dollars .
In the video , De Kort , a 41 - year old , fails to give his name , but commented in an interview after being contacted by the Post .
The Washington Post notes that De Kort appears to be the only known whistleblower to use YouTube to date .
Nonetheless , they add " The video also has caught the eye of people in high places .
De Kort 's video has been covered by defense trade magazines , and yesterday , Rep. Bennie Thompson ( D - Miss. ) , ranking Democrat on the Homeland Security Committee , wrote a letter to the Coast Guard asking for an answer to De Kort 's " extremely distressing " allegations . "
The video is provided by RAW STORY and can be viewed below .

CYA Security
Since 9/11 , we ’ve spent hundreds of billions of dollars defending ourselves from terrorist attacks .
Stories about the ineffectiveness of many of these security measures are common , but less so are discussions of why they are so ineffective .
In short : much of our country ’s counterterrorism security spending is not designed to protect us from the terrorists , but instead to protect our public officials from criticism when another attack occurs .
Boston , January 31 : As part of a guerilla marketing campaign , a series of amateur - looking blinking signs depicting characters in the Aqua Teen Hunger Force , a show on the Cartoon Network , were placed on bridges , near a medical center , underneath an interstate highway , and in other crowded public places .
Police mistook these signs for bombs and shut down parts of the city , eventually spending over $ 1 M sorting it out .
Authorities blasted the stunt as a terrorist hoax , while others ridiculed the Boston authorities for overreacting .
Almost no one looked beyond the finger pointing and jeering to discuss exactly why the Boston authorities overreacted so badly .
They overreacted because the signs were weird .
If someone left a backpack full of explosives in a crowded movie theater , or detonated a truck bomb in the middle of a tunnel , no one would demand to know why the police had n’t noticed it beforehand .
But if a weird device with blinking lights and wires turned out to be a bomb — what every movie bomb looks like — there would be inquiries and demands for resignations .
It took the police two weeks to notice the Mooninite blinkies , but once they did , they overreacted because their jobs were at stake .
This is “ Cover Your Ass ” security , and unfortunately it ’s very common .
Airplane security seems to forever be looking backwards .
Pre -9/11 , it was bombs , guns , and knives .
Then it was small blades and box cutters .
Richard Reid tried to blow up a plane , and suddenly we all have to take off our shoes .
And after last summer ’s liquid plot , we ’re stuck with a series of nonsensical bans on liquids and gels .
Once you think about this in terms of CYA , it starts to make sense .
The TSA wants to be sure that if there ’s another airplane terrorist attack , it ’s not held responsible for letting it slip through .
One year ago , no one could blame the TSA for not detecting liquids .
But since everything seems obvious in hindsight , it ’s basic job preservation to defend against what the terrorists tried last time .
We saw this kind of CYA security when Boston and New York randomly checked bags on the subways after the London bombing , or when buildings started sprouting concrete barriers after the Oklahoma City bombing .
We also see it in ineffective attempts to detect nuclear bombs ; authorities employ CYA security against the media - driven threat so they can say “ we tried . ”
At the same time , we ’re ignoring threat possibilities that do n’t make the news as much — against chemical plants , for example .
But if there were ever an attack , that would change quickly .
CYA also explains the TSA ’s inability to take anyone off the no-fly list , no matter how innocent .
No one is willing to risk his career on removing someone from the no-fly list who might — no matter how remote the possibility — turn out to be the next terrorist mastermind .
Another form of CYA security is the overly specific countermeasures we see during big events like the Olympics and the Oscars , or in protecting small towns .
In all those cases , those in charge of the specific security do n’t dare return the money with a message “ use this for more effective general countermeasures . ”
If they were wrong and something happened , they ’d lose their jobs .
And finally , we ’re seeing CYA security on the national level , from our politicians .
We might be better off as a nation funding intelligence gathering and Arabic translators , but it ’s a better re-election strategy to fund something visible but ineffective , like a national ID card or a wall between the U.S. and Mexico .
Securing our nation from threats that are weird , threats that either happened before or captured the media ’s imagination , and overly specific threats are all examples of CYA security .
It happens not because the authorities involved — the Boston police , the TSA , and so on — are not competent , or not doing their job .
It happens because there is n’t sufficient national oversight , planning , and coordination .
People and organizations respond to incentives .
We ca n’t expect the Boston police , the TSA , the guy who runs security for the Oscars , or local public officials to balance their own security needs against the security of the nation .
They ’re all going to respond to the particular incentives imposed from above .
What we need is a coherent antiterrorism policy at the national level : one based on real threat assessments , instead of fear - mongering , re-election strategies , or pork - barrel politics .
Sadly , though , there might not be a solution .
All the money is in fear - mongering , re-election strategies , and pork - barrel politics .
And , like so many things , security follows the money .

I 've no great love for pit bulls or pocupines for that matter but that poor dog is in serious trouble .
Most likely they will have to put him down .
I imagine there are quite a few quills in its mouth and throat .
Probably blind too .

Pit bulls must really be extraordinarily stupid members of the canine family , because most dogs would back off before they ever accumulated anywhere near that many quills .
I wonder if they had to put this animal down ?
The quills have barbs and cannot just be pulled out .
Left in place they can work their way into internal organs and such .
Poor pup , even if it is a dumb pit bull .

Tests To Reveal Levels Of Depleted Uranium In Army Personnel
An A - 10 Warthog over a tank after it has been hit with a Depleted Uranium Armor Piercing Incendiary round .
by Staff Writers
Leicester UK ( SPX ) Mar 07 , 2007
A test recently used by the UK government 's Independent Depleted Uranium Oversight Board to detect exposure to UK troops by depleted uranium ( DU ) during the 1991 Gulf Conflict was developed by a team led by a University of Leicester geologist .
Randall Parrish , Professor of Isotope Geology , developed the test with Postdoctoral Fellow Dr Axel Gerdes , who now works at the University of Frankfurt , Germany , and his colleague Matt Horstwood at the British Geological Survey , using advanced mass spectrometry .
Prof Parrish 's team has tested more than 350 individuals as part of the programme , with the result that none so far tested had any demonstrable DU exposure resulting from their participation in the 1991 Gulf Conflict , though the extent of actual initial exposure of tested individuals to DU is unknown .
Depleted uranium ( DU ) is a by - product from the manufacture of enriched uranium , used for fuel in nuclear reactors or in weapons .
It is 60 per cent as radioactive as natural uranium .
Because of its hardness , it has been used in engineering projects , as well as in the construction of military tanks and anti-tank weapons , such as those used in the 1991 Gulf War , in Bosnia in 1994 - 5 , Kosovo in 1999 and in the latest conflict in Iraq .
While DU weapons can reduce casualties amongst the forces using them , there may be long - term risks to the health of those exposed to them , either through shrapnel wounds or inhalation , and risks , also , to the environment .
The test was designed to detect after 15 years even a modest exposure to DU , on the basis of accepted knowledge about the retention and solubility of DU in the human body .
The test is applicable even to those who excrete extremely low levels of uranium in urine .
Professor Parrish's and his colleagues ' work , undertaken to help in the planning of the UK DU testing programme , explored the sensitivity and accuracy of urine tests to measure uranium concentrations and isotope ratios .
The testing programme was set up in 2001 , to investigate concerns amongst UK Service personnel from the Balkans and the 1991 Gulf War , following media coverage about Depleted Uranium .
Professor Parrish commented : " Dr Gerdes and I continue to collaborate on this test , which is by far the most sensitive and accurate of all uranium isotope test for urine worldwide .
It uses multiple isotopes to ascertain the extent of contamination .
" Our facility has used this test in the monitoring of more than 400 UK veterans

SUNDAY , Jan. 7 . Newark International Airport .
I disembark at Gate C85 , with my two daughters , from Continental Flight 488 at 5:55 a.m .
We ’ve just arrived from Puerto Rico , our skin tight with sunburn and salt .
I navigate the terminal at the minimal level of consciousness required to find the baggage claim , collect our suitcases , and get into the taxi line .
Tempted to buy coffee from the kiosk between Baggage Carousels 2 and 3 , I discover I do n’t have my wallet .
I must have left it on or around my seat , 23B , where I paused to rifle through my carry - on to be sure I was n’t leaving any of my younger daughter ’s toys or games behind .
Jolted by adrenaline , I instruct my daughters , ages 16 and 6 , to remain at the baggage claim while I try to retrieve my wallet .
Carrying only my passport , I run upstairs to find someone who can issue me a gate pass allowing my return through security to Concourse C .
Impressing the validity of my request on one distracted airline employee after another takes a discouragingly long time .
I am referred to and from and back again to the agent at Desk 72 .
By the time I pass through the gantlet of uniformed security personnel busy separating travelers from their toothpaste and emollients , I ’ve lost 30 minutes , more than long enough for a cleaning crew to straighten , vacuum and de-wallet the airplane .
I run , my shoes in one hand , passport in the other , to Gate C85 , at the end of the abandoned concourse .
Gates 85 , 84 , 83 — all gates in sight — are bereft of both airline and airport personnel , but my plane ’s still there ; I can see it through the window .
As rioters spread fire and violence across France on Sunday , shooting and wounding police officers , President Jacques Chirac vowed to restore calm and punish those responsible for 11 days of disturbances .
Chirac made his first public comments on the unrest after a rare meeting of his security Cabinet that underscored the gravity of the situation .
The rampage of arson and vandalism has spilled from hardscrabble housing projects into provincial towns and the capital itself .
Rioters showed alarming new aggressiveness Sunday night in clashes that injured 34 police officers , including 10 hit by birdshot from firearms .
“ Today , the absolute priority is restoring security and public order , ” Chirac said .
“ The Republic is determined , inherently , to be stronger than those who would sow violence or fear .
And they will be caught , judged and punished . ”
In his brief statement , Chirac also indicated that the government intended to address the alienation , unemployment and neglect contributing to the explosion of rage in predominantly Muslim neighborhoods .

Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin , who stood by Chirac as he spoke , is expected to outline today a plan to deal with deprivation , discrimination and youth unemployment , which is close to 50 % in some areas .
The government will also speed up a multibillion - dollar overhaul of hundreds of run-down , crime - ridden housing projects , which are fixtures on the industrial peripheries of many French cities and towns and are populated largely by working - class immigrant families .
“ We understand also that the evolution of things requires respect for everyone , justice and equality of opportunities , ” Chirac said .
“ But there is a precondition : the restoration of security and public order . ”
Although French presidents tend to focus on big - picture issues such as foreign affairs , leaving details of domestic governance to their prime ministers , Chirac ’s silence had been criticized as the riots mushroomed into the worst urban unrest in decades .
His words Sunday , and his decision to convene ministers in charge of law enforcement and defense , were designed to send a message of strength .
But on the streets Sunday night , thousands of police backed by helicopters clashed again with fast - moving , wellorganized gangs of masked , hooded vandals on scooters and bikes who had torched at least 839 vehicles by midnight .
Police made 186 arrests .

About 1,300 vehicles burned overnight Saturday and early Sunday , the most since the unrest began .
The toll of 34 injured officers represented a major escalation ; only seven had been injured in the previous 10 nights of violence .
The worst incident Sunday took place in a housing project in Grigny , south of Paris .
Assailants fired on a contingent of riot police confronting gangs of stone - throwing young men .
Ten officers were hit .
Two were hospitalized , with one wounded in the throat and the other in the leg , national police spokesman Patrick Hamon said .
The shooters used pellet guns or shotguns to fire birdshot , which can maim but is unlikely to kill , Hamon said .
Police did not shoot back .
Under strict orders from Interior Minister Nicolas Sarkozy , the police have not fired a single shot since the riots began , Hamon said .
Rioters reportedly fired on police about half a dozen times .

“ We are fearful for our officers because of these shootings , ” he said .
“ But they are showing great professionalism .
The order is repeated to them every morning .
Still , at some point an officer might find himself trapped , confronted by a gang or something , and you do n’t know what could happen . ”
Compared with the gun battles and body counts of riots in Los Angeles and other U.S. cities in recent decades , the French disturbances have been marked by a kind of ritualistic restraint .
The rioters have mainly attacked private property and symbols of the state .
Although there have been no deaths , there has been plenty of brutality .
A 61 - year - old retiree remained hospitalized in grave condition Sunday after being beaten when he went to check on a garbage can fire at his apartment building in the working - class suburb of Stains .
In Normandy , an assault early Sunday by a mob in Evreux left four police officers wounded , one seriously , and destroyed a shopping center , a post office and two schools .

“ Rioters attacked us with baseball bats , ” Philippe Jofres , a deputy fire chief sitting in his truck , told the France - 2 television network .
“ We were attacked with pickaxes .
It was war . ”
It was the first outbreak in Evreux .
The destruction also spread to Lyon , Nantes , Nice and Cannes .
The nominal trigger for the riots was an incident in the poor Paris suburb of Clichy - sous - Bois .
Two teenagers , one wanted by police , hid from officers in a power substation and were accidentally electrocuted .
Police said the casualties have been low partly because guns are still rare in France .
Many of the rioters are teens who have trouble obtaining anything more powerful than pellet guns .
Although heavy weapons such as AK - 47 assault rifles can be found in housing projects , they are held mainly by older , experienced criminals involved in organized robbery gangs , investigators say .

“ They are specialists , and they do n’t have any interest in getting involved in this for the moment , luckily , ” a police intelligence official said .
“ That ’s why we are finding kids with low - quality , inferior guns if we find any at all . ”
But the rioters have other weapons .
On Sunday , police arrested six youths in Evry , a town south of Paris , in a basement where they had assembled 90 Molotov cocktails .
One of France ’s leading Muslim organizations issued a religious edict , or fatwa , Sunday condemning the riots , according to news reports .
The statement by the Union of Islamic Organizations in France cited Koranic passages forbidding the destruction of property .
The group has links to the fundamentalist Muslim Brotherhood and has had a sometimes tense relationship with the government .
Islamic groups , from wellintegrated moderates to violent anti-Western extremists , are believed to wield great power in the housing projects .
Debate persists among political leaders and police about whether religious extremists have had a role in inciting the unrest .
So far , intelligence officials mainly report instigation by small - time gangsters but only scattered activity by Muslim extremists .
Nonetheless , police worry that hard - core Islamist groups could exploit the situation by encouraging the unrest or gain new prominence if the government enlists their assistance in restoring peace .

Halliburton gets ' immigration emergency ' contract as prosecutions skyrocket in its hometown 24 Jan. 2006 WASHINGTON , Jan. 24 ( HalliburtonWatch.org ) --
The Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) awarded Halliburton 's KBR subsidiary a $ 385 million contract to build " detention facilities " ( prisons ) for immigrants arrested on charges of entering the country illegally and to provide construction and logistics support services in the event of an " immigration emergency , " Halliburton announced in a press release today .
The announcement comes at an opportune time for Halliburton since the Bush administration has accelerated the number of immigration arrests and prosecutions nationally , but most remarkably in the Houston area , where Halliburton is headquartered .
According to a study by Syracuse University , the number of immigration arrests and prosecutions in the Southern District of Texas , which includes Houston , is " literally off the chart " compared to areas with greater illegal migration problems .
Immigration prosecutions spiked by 14,030 cases in the district between 2003 and 2004 , a 345 percent increase .
The number of immigration prosecutions is dramatically skewed in favor of Halliburton 's hometown in Texas even though over half of the 1.1 million people entering the United States illegally in 2004 crossed the border through Arizona .
The Bush administration has been criticized for doling out DHS contracts based on politics and cronyism rather than need .
For example , sea ports in New York and New Jersey handle 12 percent of the nation 's cargo but receive barely one percent of DHS funds for protection against terrorism and other emergencies .
" The sheer volume of DHS immigration referrals in Texas South ( Houston ) in FY 2004 ( 18,092 ) tower over the totals racked up by the four other districts along the Mexican border in the same year , " the Syracuse study said , adding that prosecutions in Texas West , Arizona and California South " increased at a far slower pace . "
In New Mexico , prosecutions actually declined .
Additionally , 21,000 individuals were prosecuted in the Texas South district in 2004 , 18,340 of whom were charged with immigration violations .
By comparison , the district only prosecuted 90 white collar crime matters .
“ We are especially gratified to be awarded this contract because it builds on our extremely strong track record in the arena of emergency operations support , ” Bruce Stanski , executive vice president of KBR's Government and Infrastructure division , said in response to the DHS contract award .
“ We look forward to continuing the good work we have been doing to support our customer [ the DHS ] whenever and wherever we are needed . ”
Under the contract , KBR will build temporary detention facilities for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement ( ICE ) , a department of the DHS , " to augment existing ICE Detention and Removal Operations ( DRO ) Program facilities in the event of an emergency influx of immigrants into the U.S. , " the company 's press release said .
The contract requires KBR to provide logistics support to operate one or more of the detention facilities if required .
KBR will also perform emergency repair and construction services for ICE in the event of a natural disaster .
The five - year contract , consisting of a one - year base period and four one - year options , was awarded to KBR via competitive bidding and will be executed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers , Fort Worth District .
The contract takes effect immediately .
KBR held the previous ICE contract from 2000 through 2005 .
ICE is one of three agencies that make up the Border and Transportation Security ( BTS ) Directorate of the DHS .
The mission of the BTS Directorate is to secure the nation 's air , land and sea borders .
ICE , the largest investigative arm of the DHS , is responsible for identifying and shutting down vulnerabilities in the nation ’s border , economic , transportation and infrastructure security .
( Update : The Associated Press reported that , while the contract was awarded to KBR via " competitive " bidding , KBR was the only contractor who submitted a bid .
The company obtained nearly $ 6 million from the contract between 2000 and 2005 . )

An adult is free to buy whatever he wants , and presumably he knows what he likes .
So ideally , you ’d want to give him something he might like but does n’t know about , or some kind of guilty pleasure that he would n’t buy for himself .
In either case , you are creating value for the recipient by giving him something that is actually worth more to him than the money you spent on it .
But realistically , most of our gifts fall well short of that high standard .
This creates a lot of inefficiency .
In 1993 , the economist Joel Waldfogel addressed this subject in a paper whose continuing fame in economics circles is due in part to its wonderfully Scrooge - ish title : “ The Deadweight Loss of Christmas . ”
Since gifts “ may be mismatched with the recipients ’ preferences , ” Waldfogel argued , it is likely that “ the gift will leave the recipient worse off than if she had made her own consumption choice with an equal amount of cash . ”
He concluded that “ holiday gift - giving destroys between 10 percent and a third of the value of gifts . ”
If gift - giving destroys so much value , why not take the most efficient route and simply give cash ?
Obviously , some people do .
In the small survey of Yale undergraduates on which Waldfogel based his paper , grandparents gave cash 42 percent of the time , and parents gave cash 10 percent of the time .
But not once did a student receive cash from his or her significant other .
Plainly , there are a few relationships for which a cash gift is appropriate , but in most cases , the social taboo crushes the economist ’s dream of such a beautifully efficient exchange .
So if cash is inappropriate , and buying gifts is inefficient , would n’t a gift card — not quite as fungible as cash but also not nearly as coldhearted — be a perfect solution ?
You could certainly make that case .
And for the merchant , at least , the gift card is a godsend .
Just think of it :
In the weeks leading up to Christmas , millions of people visit your store or Web site and hand you billions of dollars in exchange for nothing more than a plastic I.O.U. that may never even be redeemed .
Best Buy , for instance , earned $ 16 million last year in gift - card “ breakage , ” which is the industry ’s term for card value that was bought but never redeemed .
Then there ’s what retailers call “ upspending ” : most customers who do use their gift cards spend some of their own money to buy merchandise that is more expensive than the value of the card .
For the giver , meanwhile , a gift card could hardly be easier .
But most economists would argue that if a gift card is so transparently good for the giver , it is necessarily bad for the recipient : the fact that it can be bought so easily signals to the recipient that the giver did n’t put much effort into the gift .
In the end , the value of any gift is overwhelmingly dependent on the nature of the relationship between giver and recipient .
The economist Alex Tabarrok , writing recently on the Marginal Revolution blog , put an even finer point on this fact , noting that each of us has many “ selves , ” including a “ wild self , ” and that “ we want the wild self in someone else to be wild about us . ”
His advice ?
“ If you want to please the economist in me , send me cash .
If you want to please my wild self ( you know who you are ! ) , use your imagination . ”
So next year , if you need a gift for a strict rationalist , consider cash .
If you want to appeal to someone ’s wild self , you ’ll have to use your imagination .
And if you ’re hoping to send a little something extra to the shareholders of Best Buy or the Gap or Tiffany , consider a gift card .
January 31 , 2007 — jao
It all began while i was using MDK ‘s development as an excuse to learn everything i could about programming and programming tools : makefiles , autoconf , automake , localization , texinfo docs , lexers , parsers … and , eventually , extensibility .
I kept hearing about an exotic thing by the name of GNU ’s Ubiquitous Intelligent Language for Extensions , and , finally , rose to the bait .
But my first attempts at writing Scheme felt awkward .
Not because of the parens ( i liked Scheme syntax from day zero ) , but basically because i was writing C code using Scheme .
Clearly , i needed to read a bit about this new thing and , to that end , i got a copy of The Little Schemer … to no avail : i did n’t get what elephants , food and Socrates had to do with programming ; i still felt awkward .
( It was not the book ’s fault , mind you , but mine .
More about this in a bit . )
Then i found the book .
Abelson and Sussman ’s Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs changed my life as a programmer .
I ’m sure you ’ve read lots of praise for this book .
Totally deserved !
SICP is not really about Scheme , but about thinking about programming .
Reading it will make you a better programmer in any language .
It will expand your mind .
It will cure your diseases .
It ’s really that good .
Besides , SICP is freely available in HTML , PDF and texinfo formats , so you really have no excuse .
For extra fun , get the accompanying video lectures , by Abelson and Sussman themselves .
These lectures are charming : these guys have a passion for what they do , and they transmit it from the very beginning , when Abelson jokingly explains why computer science is neither a science nor about computers .
The most cited alternative to SICP is How to Design Programs by Felleisen , Findler , Flatt and Krishnamurthi .
Its authors have even published a rationale , The Structure and Interpretation of the Computer Science Curriculum , on why they think SICP is not well suited to teaching programming and how their book tries to fix the problems they ’ve observed .
I wo n’t try to argue against such eminent schemers , but , frankly , my feeling is that HtDP is a far , far cry from SICP .
HtDP almost made me yawn , and there ’s no magic to be seen .
If for whatever reason SICP is not your cup of tea , i would recommend Max Hailperin ‘s Concrete Abstractions as a far better ( as in more fun than HtDP ) alternative .
With SICP under my belt , i was ready for The Little Schemer and The Seasoned Schemer ( by Daniel P. Friedman and Matthias Felleisen ) , which i read in a row .
You ’d be hard pressed to find any programming book similar to the Schemers books .
As in my case , the initial reaction may well be of rejection : on a superficial reading they look too queer , even childish , and by any means the kind of book a serious programmer should read , except maybe for fun .
But that ’s precisely the point : you wo n’t learn unless it is for fun !
If you enter the game proposed by Daniel and Matthias , accepting to participate in their Socratic scheme , you ’ll learn a lot with their books .
I found easier to put me in the right mood after SICP because it also is imbued of a kind of magic , and also because i was much better equipped to capture the subtleties lurking in every page of the Schemers books .
Besides having a great time , one ends up with a sound grasp of higher order functions , recursion ( including the Y combinator ) and continuations .
In fact , it was reading The Seasoned Schemer that something clicked and i really understood continuations .
After all these readings i felt i was starting to have a good grasp of the conceptual underpinnings of Scheme and Lisp , and that it was due time to strengthen the technical details .
Or in other words , i wanted to come to grips with the nitty gritty details of Scheme syntax and semantics , including macros ( which i knew from some tutorials and readings on Common Lisp ) .
To that end , Dybvig ‘s The Scheme Programming Language was the perfect book .
Comprehensible , exacting and with an elegant prose , and to the point .
But , despite its succinctness , Dybvig does an excellent job in conveying the details of the language and its usage .
The book also includes extended usage examples for a good measure .
Thus , TSPL works nicely as both a tutorial and a handy reference .
If you already have a good basis on functional programming you can use TSPL as your first Scheme book and skip the previous ones ( but you will be skipping lots of fun and , maybe , insight too ) .
And if you happen to read French , an interesting alternative for a speedier learning path is Jacques Chazarain ’a Programmer avec Scheme .
In the first part of the book , Practical programming with Scheme , Scheme is thoroughly presented , using it in many examples taken from the standard data structures and algorithms curriculum .
Taking this practical basis as a starting point , Chazarain proceeds to a comprehensive ( almost 400 pages long ) discussion of the formal basis of the theory of programming languages : automata , lexers and parsers , propositional calculus , rewriting systems , logic programming , lambda calculus and more .
As you can see , the scope of this book is amazing , and it ’s well worth learning a little French !
The nice thing about learning a programming language in such a good company is that one learns much more than a single programming language .
These books helped me obtain a conceptual basis for thinking about programming and programming languages in abstract terms , applicable to any programming problem .
As Sussman colorfully demonstrates in one of the SICP lectures , one feels like beholding the heart of the spirit that lives in the machine .
An that spirit , of course , is an interpreter .
So i delved into the theory and practice of implementing interpreters guided by another classic : Essentials of Programming Languages by Daniel P. Friedman , Mitchell Wand , and Christopher T. Haynes .
This marvelous book delves deep into the art of writing interpreters using Scheme as the implementation language .
By way of running example , an interpreter for an ML - like language is developed all along , showing the magic of , among other things , register machines or continuation - passing style .
To get a flavor of what this book has to offer , i wholeheartedly recommend reading Friedman ’s The Role of the Study of Programming Languages in the Education of a Programmer , an insightful talk on how a theoretical background is useful ( and even needed ) to any programmer in any language , which Friedman illustrates with practical cases taken from his book .
One of the rites of passage of any self - deserving schemer is writing a metacircular scheme interpreter , that is , a scheme implemented in itself .
Having a look at the innards of your language implementation sheds a whole new light on your daily usage of the language .
Sussman goes as far as wearing his magician ’s hat when he explains the metacircular interpreter in the SICP lectures , and rightly so .
But i’ve always felt a bit frustrated by the fact that the implementations one finds in books like SICP , EOPL or , to cite another classical example , PAIP are actually for toy interpreters not covering all the details of real Schemes .
And often the left out precisely the most interesting bits !
Fortunately , there ’s a book that will tell you everything you ever wanted to know about implementing Lisp interpreters and compilers : Lisp in Small Pieces by Christian Queinnec .
This is easily the best book about Lisp i have ever read .
LiSP shows , without omitting any details , how the family of Lisp languages is implemented ( in interpreted and compiled forms ) .
You ’ll learn from the inside the difference between Lisp - 1 and Lisp - 2 , how dynamical and lexical scope work , how blocks and continuations are related , how on earth one implements … everything you ever wanted to know about Lisp implementations , and then more .
On top of that , Queinnec writing style is engaging and the book is pervaded by a fine sense of humour that made me laugh out loud several times .
If you ’re serious about Lisp , you must read this book .
Let me close my list of recommendations with the last addition to my Scheme bookshelf , namely , the third schemer installment :
The Reasoned Schemer ( by Daniel P. Friedman , William E. Byrd , Oleg Kiselyov ) .
Paraphrasing Alan Perlis , the key reason for learning new languages and paradigms is the fact that they , hopefully , change the way you think about programming .
Functional languages do a pretty good job at that , but they ’re not the only game in town .
Declarative programming is definitely another mind blowing experience , which you can enjoy reading The Reasoned Schemer .
The book presents , in that peculiar style of its predecessors that i like so much , the basis of logic programming using a Scheme implementation that , in many ways , surpasses standard declarative languages like Prolog .
The best of two awesome worlds , and an excellent way to ensure that you keep learning and expanding your programming horizons .
Happy reading !
Armed with a text editor mu's views on program and recipe !

Cairo Tutorial for Python Programmers
by Michael Urman
Cairo is a powerful 2d graphics library .
This document introduces you to how cairo works and many of the functions you will use to create the graphic experience you desire .
In order to follow along on your computer , you need the following things :
Cairo itself , Python to run the code snippets , and PyCairo to join the previous two .
Alternately , if you 're up for a challenge , you can translate the examples to your preferred language and host environment and only need cairo from above .
Nis Martensen has graciously done so for the C language ; the C translation has been adopted by the cairo project as its tutorial .
Note :
All the example code has a dependency on cairo 1.2.0 or higher for cairo .
SVGSurface .
In addition several examples need push_group ( ) and pop_group ( ) , and the radial gradients require 1.4 for proper rendering .
In a pinch you can work around the first by changing instances of cairo .
SVGSurface ( filename + '.svg ' , width , height ) to cairo. ImageSurface( cairo.FORMAT_ARGB32 , width , height ) , but really you should consider upgrading .
Translations : fr .
Table of Contents
Cairo's Drawing Model
In order to explain the operations used by cairo , we first delve into a model of how cairo models drawing .
There are only a few concepts involved , which are then applied over and over by the different methods .
First I 'll describe the nouns : destination , source , mask , path , and context .
After that I 'll describe the verbs which offer ways to manipulate the nouns and draw the graphics you wish to create .
And do n't read this now , but here 's the code behind all the diagrams .
If you find the descriptions below to be too sparse , Donn Ingle has created at - a - glance overview diagrams in SVG which try to tie everything together .
They require Inkscape ( or similar ) to view , as well as two specific fonts for correct appearance .
Zoom in on each " page " as you follow along .
Donn requests that you download and share the diagrams on your own website if you find them useful .
Nouns
Cairo 's nouns are somewhat abstract .
To make them concrete I 'm including diagrams that depict how they interact .
The first three nouns are the three layers in the diagrams you see in this section .
The fourth noun , the path , is drawn on the middle layer when it is relevant .
The final noun , the context , is n't shown .
Destination
The destination is the surface on which you 're drawing .
It may be tied to an array of pixels like in these PyGTK tutorials , or it might be tied to a SVG or PDF file , or something else .
This surface collects the elements of your graphic as you apply them , allowing you to build up a complex work as though painting on a canvas .
Source
The source is the " paint " you 're about to work with .
I show this as it is — plain black for several examples — but translucent to show lower layers .
Unlike real paint , it does n't have to be a single color ; it can be a pattern or even a previously created destination surface .
Also unlike real paint it can contain transparency information — the Alpha channel .
Mask
The mask is the most important piece : it controls where you apply the source to the destination .
I will show it as a yellow layer with holes where it lets the source through .
When you apply a drawing verb , it 's like you stamp the source to the destination .
Anywhere the mask allows , the source is copied .
Anywhere the mask disallows , nothing happens .
Path
The path is somewhere between part of the mask and part of the context .
I will show it as thin green lines on the mask layer .
It is manipulated by path verbs , then used by drawing verbs .
Context
The context keeps track of everything that verbs affect .
It tracks one source , one destination , and one mask .
It also tracks several helper variables like your line width and style , your font face and size , and more .
Most importantly it tracks the path , which is turned into a mask by drawing verbs .
Verbs
The reason you are using cairo in a program is to draw .
Cairo internally draws with one fundamental drawing operation : the source and mask are freely placed somewhere over the destination .
Then the layers are all pressed together and the paint from the source is transferred to the destination wherever the mask allows it .
To that extent the following five drawing verbs , or operations , are all similar .
They differ by how they construct the mask .
Stroke
The stroke ( ) operation takes a virtual pen along the path .
It allows the source to transfer through the mask in a thin ( or thick ) line around the path , according to the pen 's line width , dash style , and line caps .
Fill
The fill ( ) operation instead uses the path like the lines of a coloring book , and allows the source through the mask within the hole whose boundaries are the path .
For complex paths ( paths with multiple closed sub - paths — like a donut — or paths that self - intersect ) this is influenced by the fill rule .
Note that while stroking the path transfers the source for half of the line width on each side of the path , filling a path fills directly up to the edge of the path and no further .
Show Text / Glyphs
The show_text ( ) operation forms the mask from text .
It may be easier to think of show_text ( ) as a shortcut for creating a path with text_path ( ) and then using fill ( ) to transfer it .
Be aware show_text ( ) caches glyphs so is much more efficient if you work with a lot of text .
Cairo Tutorial : Diagrams ( Section # text ) cr.set_source_rgb(0.0 , 0.0 , 0.0 ) cr.select_font_face ( " Georgia " , cairo .
FONT_SLANT_NORMAL , cairo.FONT_WEIGHT_BOLD ) cr.set_font_size( 1.2 ) x_bearing , y_bearing , width , height = cr.text_extents ( " a " ) [ : 4 ] cr.move_to( 0.5 - width / 2 - x_bearing , 0.5 - height / 2 - y_bearing ) cr.show_text ( " a " )
Paint
The paint ( ) operation uses a mask that transfers the entire source to the destination .
Some people consider this an infinitely large mask , and others consider it no mask ; the result is the same .
The related operation paint_with_alpha ( ) similarly allows transfer of the full source to destination , but it transfers only the provided percentage of the color .
Mask
The mask ( ) and mask_surface ( ) operations allow transfer according to the transparency / opacity of a second source pattern or surface .
Where the pattern or surface is opaque , the current source is transferred to the destination .
Where the pattern or surface is transparent , nothing is transferred .
Drawing with Cairo
In order to create an image you desire , you have to prepare the context for each of the drawing verbs .
To use stroke ( ) or fill ( ) you first need a path .
To use show_text ( ) you must position your text by its insertion point .
To use mask ( ) you need a second source pattern or surface .
And to use any of the operations , including paint ( ) , you need a primary source .
Preparing and Selecting a Source
There are three main kinds of sources in cairo : colors , gradients , and images .
Colors are the simplest ; they use a uniform hue and opacity for the entire source .
You can select these without any preparation with set_source_rgb ( ) and set_source_rgba( ) .
Using set_source_rgb(r , g , b ) is equivalent to using set_source_rgba(r , g , b , 1.0 ) , and it sets your source color to use full opacity .
Gradients describe a progression of colors by setting a start and stop reference location and a series of " stops " along the way .
Linear gradients are built from two points which pass through parallel lines to define the start and stop locations .
Radial gradients are also built from two points , but each has an associated radius of the circle on which to define the start and stop locations .
Stops are added to the gradient with add_color_stop_rgb ( ) and add_color_stop_rgba( ) which take a color like set_source_rgb *( ) , as well as an offset to indicate where it lies between the reference locations .
The colors between adjacent stops are averaged over space to form a smooth blend .
Finally , the behavior beyond the reference locations can be controlled with set_extend ( ) .
( TODO )
Cairo Tutorial : Drawing ( Section # gradient ) radial = cairo.RadialGradient( 0.25 , 0.25 , 0.1 , 0.5 , 0.5 , 0.5 ) radial.add_color_stop_rgb(0 , 1.0 , 0.8 , 0.8 ) radial.add_color_stop_rgb(1 , 0.9 , 0.0 , 0.0 ) for i in range ( 1 , 10 ) : for j in range ( 1 , 10 ) : cr.rectangle ( i/10.0 - 0.04 , j/10.0 - 0.04 , 0.08 , 0.08 ) cr.set_source( radial ) cr.fill ( ) linear = cairo.LinearGradient( 0.25 , 0.35 , 0.75 , 0.65 ) linear.add_color_stop_rgba(0.00 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 0 ) linear.add_color_stop_rgba(0.25 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 0.5 ) linear.add_color_stop_rgba(0.50 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 0 ) linear.add_color_stop_rgba(0.75 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 0.5 ) linear.add_color_stop_rgba( 1.00 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 0 ) cr.rectangle ( 0.0 , 0.0 , 1 , 1 ) cr.set_source( linear ) cr.fill ( )
Images include both surfaces loaded from existing files with cairo. ImageSurface.create_from_png ( ) and surfaces created from within cairo as an earlier destination .
As of cairo 1.2 , the easiest way to make and use an earlier destination as a source is with push_group ( ) and either pop_group ( ) or pop_group_to_source ( ) .
Use pop_group_to_source ( ) to use it just until you select a new source , and pop_group ( ) when you want to save it so you can select it over and over again with set_source ( ) .
Creating a Path
Cairo always has an active path .
If you call stroke ( ) it will draw the path with your line settings .
If you call fill ( ) it will fill the inside of the path .
But as often as not , the path is empty , and both calls will result in no change to your destination .
Why is it empty so often ?
For one , it starts that way ; but more importantly after each stroke ( ) or fill ( ) it is emptied again to let you start building your next path .
What if you want to do multiple things with the same path ?
For instance to draw a red rectangle with a black border , you would want to fill the rectangle path with a red source , then stroke the same path with a black source .
A rectangle path is easy to create multiple times , but a lot of paths are more complex .
Cairo supports easily reusing paths by having alternate versions of its operations .
Both draw the same thing , but the alternate does n't reset the path .
For stroking , alongside stroke ( ) there is stroke_preserve ( ) ; for filling , fill_preserve ( ) joins fill ( ) .
Even setting the clip has a preserve variant .
Apart from choosing when to preserve your path , there are only a couple common operations .
Moving
Cairo uses a connect - the - dots style system when creating paths .
Start at 1 , draw a line to 2 , then 3 , and so forth .
When you start a path , or when you need to start a new sub-path , you want it to be like point 1 : it has nothing connecting to it .
For this , use move_to ( ) .
This sets the current reference point without making the path connect the previous point to it .
There is also a relative coordinate variant , rel_move_to ( ) , which sets the new reference a specified distance away from the current reference instead .
After setting your first reference point , use the other path operations which both update the reference point and connect to it in some way .
Straight Lines
Whether with absolute coordinates line_to ( ) ( extend the path from the reference to this point ) , or relative coordinates rel_line_to ( ) ( extend the path from the reference this far in this direction ) , the path connection will be a straight line .
The new reference point will be at the other end of the line .
Arcs
Arcs are parts of the outside of a circle .
Unlike straight lines , the point you directly specify is not on the path .
Instead it is the center of the circle that makes up the addition to the path .
Both a starting and ending point on the circle must be specified , and these points are connected either clockwise by arc ( ) or counter - clockwise by arc_negative ( ) .
If the previous reference point is not on this new curve , a straight line is added from it to where the arc begins .
The reference point is then updated to where the arc ends .
There are only absolute versions .
Curves
Curves in cairo are cubic Bézier splines .
They start at the current reference point and smoothly follow the direction of two other points ( without going through them ) to get to a third specified point .
Like lines , there are both absolute ( curve_to ( ) ) and relative ( rel_curve_to ( ) ) versions .
Note that the relative variant specifies all points relative to the previous reference point , rather than each relative to the preceding control point of the curve .
Close the path
Cairo can also close the path by drawing a straight line to the beginning of the current sub-path .
This straight line can be useful for the last edge of a polygon , but is not directly useful for curve - based shapes .
A closed path is fundamentally different from an open path : it 's one continuous path and has no start or end .
A closed path has no line caps for there is no place to put them .
Text
Finally text can be turned into a path with text_path ( ) .
Paths created from text are like any other path , supporting stroke or fill operations .
This path is placed anchored to the current reference point , so move_to ( ) your desired location before turning text into a path .
However there are performance concerns to doing this if you are working with a lot of text ; when possible you should prefer using the verb show_text ( ) over text_path ( ) and fill ( ) .
Understanding Text
To use text effectively you need to know where it will go .
The methods font_extents ( ) and text_extents ( ) get you this information .
Since this diagram is hard to see so small , I suggest getting its source and bumping the size up to 600 .
It shows the relation between the reference point ( red dot ) ; suggested next reference point ( blue dot ) ; bounding box ( dashed blue lines ) ; bearing displacement ( solid blue line ) ; and height , ascent , baseline , and descent lines ( dashed green ) .
The reference point is always on the baseline .
The descent line is below that , and reflects a rough bounding box for all characters in the font .
However it is an artistic choice intended to indicate alignment rather than a true bounding box .
The same is true for the ascent line above .
Next above that is the height line , the artist - recommended spacing between subsequent baselines .
All three of these are reported as distances from the baseline , and expected to be positive despite their differing directions .
The bearing is the displacement from the reference point to the upper - left corner of the bounding box .
It is often zero or a small positive value for x displacement , but can be negative x for characters like j as shown ; it 's almost always a negative value for y displacement .
The width and height then describe the size of the bounding box .
The advance takes you to the suggested reference point for the next letter .
Note that bounding boxes for subsequent blocks of text can overlap if the bearing is negative , or the advance is smaller than the width would suggest .
In addition to placement , you also need to specify a face , style , and size .
Set the face and style together with select_font_face ( ) , and the size with set_font_size ( ) .
If you need even finer control , try getting a cairo .
FontOptions ( ) with get_font_options ( ) , tweaking it , and setting it with set_font_options ( ) .
When working in GTK + , there is also the pangocairo .
CairoContext .
I think using cairo's builtin font functionality is more suitable for handling text with picky size restrictions and complex positioning , whereas pangocairo .
CairoContext may be more suitable when you 're trying to create widget text that looks like other GTK + widget text , or has complex font needs or a wrapping layout .
Working with Transforms
Transforms have three major uses .
First they allow you to set up a coordinate system that 's easy to think in and work in , yet have the output be of any size .
Second they allow you to make helper functions that work at or around a ( 0 , 0 ) but can be applied anywhere in the output image .
Thirdly they let you deform the image , turning a circular arc into an elliptical arc , etc .
Transforms are a way of setting up a relation between two coordinate systems .
The device - space coordinate system is tied to the surface , and cannot change .
The user - space coordinate system matches that space by default , but can be changed for the above reasons .
The helper functions user_to_device ( ) and user_to_device_distance ( ) tell you what the device - coordinates are for a user - coordinates position or distance .
Correspondingly device_to_user ( ) and device_to_user_distance ( ) tell you user - coordinates for a device - coordinates position or distance .
Remember to send positions through the non-distance variant , and relative moves or other distances through the distance variant .
I leverage all of these reasons to draw the diagrams in this document .
Whether I 'm drawing 120 x 120 or 600 x 600 , I use scale ( ) to give me a 1.0 x 1.0 workspace .
To place the results along the right column , such as in the discussion of cairo's drawing model , I use translate ( ) .
And to add the perspective view for the overlapping layers , I set up an arbitrary deformation with transform ( ) on a cairo .
Matrix ( ) .
To understand your transforms , read them bottom to top , applying them to the point you 're drawing .
To figure out which transforms to create , think through this process in reverse .
For example if I want my 1.0 x 1.0 workspace to be 100 x 100 pixels in the middle of a 120 x 120 pixel surface , I can set it up one of three ways :
cr.translate ( 10 , 10 ) ; cr.scale ( 100 , 100 ) cr.scale ( 100 , 100 ) ; cr.translate ( 0.1 , 0.1 ) cr.transform(cairo.Matrix( 100 , 0 , 0 , 100 , 10 , 10 ) )
Use the first when relevant because it is often the most readable ; use the third when necessary to access additional control not available with the primary functions .
Be careful when trying to draw lines while under transform .
Even if you set your line width while the scale factor was 1 , the line width setting is always in user - coordinates and is n't modified by setting the scale .
While you 're operating under a scale , the width of your line is multiplied by that scale .
To specify a width of a line in pixels , use device_to_user_distance ( ) to turn a ( 1 , 1 ) device - space distance into , for example , a ( 0.01 , 0.01 ) user - space distance .
Note that if your transform deforms the image there is n't necessarily a way to specify a line with a uniform width .
Where to Go Next
This wraps up the tutorial .
It does n't cover all functions in cairo , so for some advanced lesser - used features , you 'll need to look elsewhere .
The code behind the examples uses a handful of techniques that are n't described within , so analyzing them may be a good first step .
Other examples on cairographics.org lead in different directions .
As with everything , there 's a large gap between knowing the rules of the tool , and being able to use it well .
The final section of this document provides some ideas to help you traverse parts of the gap .
Tips and Tricks
In the previous sections you should have built up a firm grasp of the operations cairo uses to create images .
In this section I 've put together a small handful of snippets I 've found particularly useful or non-obvious .
I 'm still new to cairo myself , so there may be other better ways to do these things .
If you find a better way , or find a cool way to do something else , let me know and perhaps I can incorporate it into these tips .
Line Width
When you 're working under a uniform scaling transform , you can't just use pixels for the width of your line .
However it 's easy to translate it with the following shortcut :
cr.set_line_width(max(cr.device_to_user_distance( pixel_width , pixel_width ) ) )
When you 're working under a deforming scale , you may wish to still have line widths that are uniform in device space .
For this you should return to a uniform scale before you stroke the path .
In the image , the arc on the left is stroked under a deformation , while the arc on the right is stroked under a uniform scale .

Text Alignment
When you try to center text letter by letter at various locations , you have to decide how you want to center it .
For example the following code will actually center letters individually , leading to poor results when your letters are of different sizes .
( Unlike most examples , here I assume a 26 x 1 workspace . )
Cairo Tutorial : Tips and Tricks ( Section # center ) for cx , letter in enumerate (' AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStUvWxYz ' ) : xbearing , ybearing , width , height , xadvance , yadvance = ( cr.text_extents ( letter ) ) cr.move_to(cx + 0.5 - xbearing - width / 2 , 0.5 - ybearing - height / 2 ) cr.show_text( letter )
Instead the vertical centering must be based on the general size of the font , thus keeping your baseline steady .
Note that the exact positioning now depends on the metrics provided by the font itself , so the results are not necessarily the same from font to font .

BEIJING  A rare , nearly blind white dolphin that survived for millions of years is effectively extinct , an international expedition declared Wednesday after ending a fruitless six - week search of its Yangtze River habitat .
The baiji would be the first large aquatic mammal driven to extinction since hunting and overfishing killed off the Caribbean monk seal in the 1950s .
For the baiji , the culprit was a degraded habitat _ busy ship traffic , which confounds the sonar the dolphin uses to find food , and overfishing and pollution in the Yangtze waters of eastern China , the expedition said .
" The baiji is functionally extinct .
We might have missed one or two animals but it wo n't survive in the wild , " said August Pfluger , a Swiss economist turned naturalist who helped put together the expedition .
" We are all incredibly sad . "
The baiji dates back 20 million years .
Chinese called it the " goddess of the Yangtze . "
For China , its disappearance symbolizes how unbridled economic growth is changing the country 's environment irreparably , some environmentalists say .
" It 's a tremendously sad day when any species goes extinct .
It becomes more of a public tragedy to lose a large , charismatic species like the river dolphin , " said Chris Williams , manager of river basin conservation for the World Wildlife Fund in Washington .

" The loss of a large animal like a river dolphin is often a harbinger for what 's going on in the larger system as whole .
It 's not only the loss of a beautiful animal but an indication that the way its habitat is being managed , the way we 're interacting with the natural environment of the river is deeply flawed ... if a species like this can't survive . "
Randall Reeves , chairman of the Swiss - based World Conservation Union 's Cetacean Specialist Group , who took part in the Yangtze mission , said expedition participants were surprised at how quickly the dolphins disappeared .
" Some of us did n't want to believe that this would really happen , especially so quickly , " he said .
" This particular species is the only living representative of a whole family of mammals .
This is the end of a whole branch of evolution . "
The damage to the baiji's habitat is also affecting the Yangtze finless porpoise , whose numbers have fallen to below 400 , the expedition found .
" The situation of the finless porpoise is just like that of the baiji 20 years ago , " the group said in a statement citing Wang Ding , a Chinese hydrobiologist and co-leader of the expedition .
" Their numbers are declining at an alarming rate .
If we do not act soon they will become a second baiji . "
Pfluger said China 's Agriculture Ministry , which approved the expedition , had hoped the baiji would be another panda , an animal brought back from the brink of extinction in a highly marketable effort that bolstered the country 's image .
The expedition was the most professional and meticulous ever launched for the mammal , Pfluger said .
The team of 30 scientists and crew from China , the United States and four other countries searched a 1,000 - mile heavily trafficked stretch of the Yangtze , where the baiji once thrived .
The expedition 's two boats , equipped with high - tech binoculars and underwater microphones , trailed each other an hour apart without radio contact so that a sighting by one vessel would not prejudice the other .
When there was fog , he said , the boats waited for the mist to clear to make sure they took every opportunity to spot the mammal .
Around 400 baiji were believed to be living in the Yangtze in the early 1980s , when China was just launching the free - market reforms that have transformed its economy .
The last full - fledged search , in 1997 , yielded 13 confirmed sightings , and a fisherman claimed to have seen a baiji in 2004 .
At least 20 to 25 baiji would now be needed to give the species a chance to survive , said Wang .
For Pfluger , the baiji's demise is a personal defeat .
A member of the 1997 expedition , he recalls the excitement of seeing a baiji cavorting in the waters near Dongting Lake .
" It marked me , " he said .
He went on to set up the baiji.org Foundation to save the dolphin .
In recent years , Pfluger said , scientists like the eminent zoologist George Schaller told him to stop his search , saying the baiji's " lost , forget it . "
During the latest expedition , an online diary kept by team members traced a dispiriting situation , as day after day they failed to spot a single baiji .
Even in the expedition 's final days , members believed they would find a specimen , trolling a " hotspot " below the industrial city of Wuhan where Baiji were previously sighted , Pfluger said .
" Hope dies last , " he said .

Consider a mug of American coffee .
It is found everywhere .
It can be made by anyone .
It is cheap — and refills are free .
Being largely without flavor it can be diluted to taste .
What it lacks in allure it makes up in size .
It is the most democratic method ever devised for introducing caffeine into human beings .
Now take a cup of Italian espresso .
It requires expensive equipment .
Price - to - volume ratio is outrageous , suggesting indifference to the consumer and ignorance of the market .
The aesthetic satisfaction accessory to the beverage far outweighs its metabolic impact .
It is not a drink ; it is an artifact .
This contrast can stand for the differences between America and Europe — differences nowadays asserted with increased frequency and not a little acrimony on both sides of the Atlantic .
The mutual criticisms are familiar .
To American commentators Europe is “ stagnant . ”
Its workers , employers , and regulations lack the flexibility and adaptability of their US counterparts .
The costs of European social welfare payments and public services are “ unsustainable . ”
Europe ’s aging and “ cosseted ” populations are underproductive and self - satisfied .
In a globalized world , the “ European social model ” is a doomed mirage .
This conclusion is typically drawn even by “ liberal ” American observers , who differ from conservative ( and neoconservative ) critics only in deriving no pleasure from it .
To a growing number of Europeans , however , it is America that is in trouble and the “ American way of life ” that can not be sustained .
The American pursuit of wealth , size , and abundance — as material surrogates for happiness — is aesthetically unpleasing and ecologically catastrophic .
The American economy is built on sand ( or , more precisely , other people ’s money ) .
For many Americans the promise of a better future is a fading hope .
Contemporary mass culture in the US is squalid and meretricious .
No wonder so many Americans turn to the church for solace .
These perceptions constitute the real Atlantic gap and they suggest that something has changed .
In past decades it was conventionally assumed — whether with satisfaction or regret — that Eu-rope and America were converging upon a single “ Western ” model of late capitalism , with the US as usual leading the way .
The logic of scale and market , of efficiency and profit , would ineluctably trump local variations and inherited cultural constraints .
Americanization ( or globalization — the two treated as synonymous ) was inevitable .
The best — indeed the only — hope for local products and practices was that they would be swept up into the global vortex and repackaged as “ international ” commodities for universal consumption .
Thus an archetypically Italian product — caffè espresso — would travel to the US , where it would metamorphose from an elite preference into a popular commodity , and then be repackaged and sold back to Europeans by an American chain store .
But something has gone wrong with this story .
It is not just that Starbucks has encountered unexpected foreign resistance to double - decaf - mocha - skim - latte - with - cinnamon ( except , revealingly , in the United Kingdom ) , or that politically motivated Europeans are abjuring high - profile American commodities .
It is becoming clear that America and Europe are not way stations on a historical production line , such that Europeans must expect to inherit …

Most of the time , I run Emacs in a single , maximized frame ( and , sometimes , just inside a urxvt terminal ) .
Inside that frame i create and destroy windows as needed to contain my buffers [ 0 ] .
After a while working with Emacs one gets used to a fluid window setup , where windows come and go as need arises .
But I remember that in the early days I felt a bit confused : I started by creating a windows setup ( split horizontally , then vertically , open files in each of the windows … that kind of thing ) and was non-plussed when any operation ( going to a Gnus buffer and reading messages , for instance ) destroyed my carefully prepared layout .
Over the years i’ve seen many a newbie feeling that way .
My advice is usually to let go , and learn how to move around your windows , creating them as needed .
That said , i must admit that , sometimes , i want to recover a certain window configuration in a quick way .
A particularly simple one is provided by winner - mode , a package which is part of Emacs .
Winner keeps track of your window configurations , and provides functions to navigate your window configuration history .
As advertised , activating winner - mode ( which is a global minor mode ) is as easy as one can get : just type M-x winner - mode or put this line :
( winner - mode 1 )
in your .emacs .
Use Emacs normally , and whenever one cherished window layout gets destroyed , press C - c < left > ( where < left > refers to the left cursor key ) to recover it–actually , this calls winner - undo , and you can invoke it as many times as you want to visit previous window configurations .
As one would expect , C - c < right > ( the default binding for winner - redo ) navigates configurations in the opposite direction [ 1 ] .
Simple and very useful , as it should be .
But maybe you want to be automatically tele - transported to a previous configuration without traversing the intermediate ones .
No problem : Emacs provides functions to store and retrieve window configurations ( which , in fact , are the ones winner - mode is using under the covers ) .
You can store the current window configuration in register ‘ a’ ( registers are named using single letters or numbers ) pressing C-x r w a , and restore it later by means of C-x r j a .
Again , it ’s that easy .
Although there exist several packages providing more sophisticated window management ( named configs , save and restore , etc. ) , in my experience , the simple tricks described above are more than enough ( and work out of the box in any Emacs ) .
As always , YMMV .

[ 0 ]
For those of you not familiar with Emacs lingo , an Emacs frame is what most window managers would call a window , while an Emacs window is any of the regions displaying a buffer inside a frame .
Usual ways of creating windows in Emacs are C-x 2 , C-x 3 , C-x 4 f , and so on .
See Windows and WindowsAndFrames for more .

In Emacs 21 , the default keybindings start with C-x instead of C-c .

· Engine shut down but US to UK flight continues · Jumbo jet had 18 crew and 351 passengers on board
Air traffic controllers monitoring a British Airways jumbo jet were stunned at the pilot 's decision to try to " get as far as we can " after an engine caught fire on takeoff , a transcript of discussions between the plane and the control tower revealed .
The controllers in Los Angeles expected the four - engine Boeing 747 to turn around but , after taking advice from BA 's operations base , the pilot carried on towards London .
He told air traffic control : " We just decided we want to set off on our flight - plan route and get as far as we can . "
He was allowed on his way , but an air traffic controller who had seen the flames coming from the engine told a colleague : " If you would have saw what we saw out the window , you 'd be amazed at that . "
Flight 268 eventually made it to the UK , but the pilot was so concerned about his fuel levels that he carried out an emergency landing in Manchester .
The UK's Air Accident Investigation Branch has already made safety recommendations in the wake of the incident , which happened in February last year .
But the transcript , obtained by the Wall Street Journal under US freedom of information laws , may reignite the controversy .
In the transcript a controller warns the plane : " It appears you have flames coming out of either your number one or number two engine . "
The captain replies : " We 're shutting it down . "
The tower controller passes the plane on to another controller and tells him : " We do n't know what he wants to do .
We know he wants to come back , probably . "
The pilot is told to climb to 5,000ft and advise them of his intentions .
Pilot : " Climb and maintain 5,000 .
We are able .
We will advise .
We had a surge on takeoff and we 're just doing the checks . "
The controller asks how many people are on board .
The pilot says 351 passengers and 18 crew , and tells the controller : " We have now shut down the No 2 engine .
We are going to consult our company and see what they require us to do . "
A few minutes later the pilot says they are going to continue .
Clearance is given and the controller speaks to his colleague who saw the flames .
" Is he going ? " the original controller asks .
" He 's going . "
" If you would have saw what we saw out the window , you 'd be amazed at that . "
By pressing ahead with the flight , the aircraft avoided a £ 100,000 bill for delay compensation , though there is no suggestion that this is why this flight went ahead .
The Air Accident Investigation Branch found that since April 2001 , BA had recorded 15 incidents in which jumbo jets continued after an engine had been shut down .
Its report flagged up that different operators had different policies on what pilots should do if one engine was lost .
It recommended that the Civil Aviation Authority , the Federal Aviation Authority in the US and other authorities should " review the policy on flight continuation ... following shutdown of an engine , in order to provide guidance to operators " .
BA yesterday insisted the aircraft was operating in accordance with the CAA 's regulations .
It said the AAIB 's report concluded that the crew had " sufficient fuel and performance " to reach the UK .

Washington -- Sen. John Warner , R - Va. , chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee , said Thursday that widespread corruption and criminality are " pushing Iraq down into a morass . "
Warner said corruption in Iraq is increasing , despite U.S. efforts over the last three years to eliminate corrupt practices that were rampant during the Saddam Hussein era .
" The corruption , the payoffs , the graft -- all of this is just , in a sense , overlaying the courageous work of coalition forces , " Warner said during a hearing of the Senate Intelligence Committee .
The panel was hearing testimony from U.S. intelligence officials on worldwide threats .
Warner painted a grim picture of U.S. forces increasingly diverted from battling insurgents in Iraq so they could deal with corruption - linked violence .
" It 's almost like it 's pushing Iraq down into a morass . "
Warner said .
" And a lot of the activities of the coalition forces , particularly the U.S. forces now , are directly or indirectly dealing with these situations .
I 've been told through my sources if you were to quantify it , the criminal corruption problem is now -- equates to the seriousness of the insurgency problem . "
One witness , Army Gen. Michael Maples , director of the Defense Intelligence Agency , testified that corruption was at the root of some of the daily violence in Iraq .
" I 'm not sure that the level of criminal engagement is at the level of the insurgency , but I think it 's a very serious problem , " he replied when Warner asked his opinion .
" And I see that a great deal of the violence that we are experiencing in Iraq today does have a relation to a criminal element , as opposed to an insurgent element with a political purpose . "
U.S. and Iraqi officials last November established a joint anti-corruption taskforce and urged additional training on combating corruption for Iraqi government officials .
The Americans also have helped the Iraqis establish a commission on public integrity and a contract - auditing board to improve oversight of contracts awarded to Iraqi companies .
Warner 's assessment of corruption contrasts to the view of Bush administration officials .
President Bush last December acknowledged that corruption in Iraq " is a problem at both the national and local levels . "
But he was upbeat about the prospects of eliminating it , calling it one of several " challenges common to young democracies . "
In a report to Congress last week , the administration 's special inspector general for Iraqi reconstruction warned that " corruption directly undermines the effectiveness of U.S. reconstruction efforts and impedes Iraq 's progress toward becoming a democratic , market - oriented society . "
The special inspector general also has reported misuse of funds by U.S. officials , saying that millions of dollars have been squandered or stolen outright .
The pill would maintain muscle tone without the need for pumping iron
The aim is to prevent muscle weakness and wasting in the sick and elderly and to help make long space flights feasible for humans .
But anti-wasting drugs would inevitably be tempting for athletes , experts told New Scientist magazine .
Teams have been studying the genetic pathways controlling how muscle builds up and is broken down in the body .
Gym in a bottle
Tests on rodents showed that manipulating these pathways can halt muscle wastage from disuse or disease .
At least three research groups have identified some of the genes responsible .
Alfred Goldberg and colleagues at Harvard University in the US and a pharmaceutical company Regeneron have found genes called atrogin1 and muRF1 that are active during muscle wasting .
A team at Purdue University , Indiana , has been looking at a gene called erg1 .
It 's extremely exciting and of enormous potential for clinical intervention
Professor Paul Greenhaff , from Nottingham University
Scientists are confident that they will soon have a workable therapy ready for testing in humans .
Such drugs could be given to patients confined to bed for more than a few days or to elderly patients to help keep them mobile .
The drugs might mean that people with broken bones could avoid long and painful physiotherapy sessions to rebuild muscle strength .
Weaning people off respirators would also become easier as doctors could prevent wasting of the diaphragm .
NASA is also interested in the medicines because astronauts lose muscle mass on long missions .
Open to abuse
But while there are valid medical and space applications for anti-wasting drugs , they will inevitably be tempting for athletes , Dr Goldberg said .
Experts warn that the although the drugs would maintain muscle size , they would not provide any of the other health benefits of regular exercise .
Professor Paul Greenhaff at Nottingham University in the UK has been conducting similar research into muscle growth and wasting .
It is our hope that its use will be on serious medical conditions rather than for those desiring a ' gym in a bottle '
Dr Julia Thomas at the Muscular Dystrophy Campaign
He said : " It 's extremely exciting and of enormous potential for clinical intervention .
" But we need to do these experiments in patients now .
" And there is a potential for abuse of these drugs , " he added .
He said that the role of exercise had been underplayed .
" Contraction of the muscle itself is important .
Exercise itself is the most highly potent stimulus of muscle growth .
" We must also look closer at nutrition as well . "
He said dietary intake of carbohydrate and protein is known to promote muscle protein synthesis , he said .
Dr Julia Thomas at the Muscular Dystrophy Campaign said : " In order for this treatment to be truly beneficial it is important that muscle strength is also increased and future trials and research will be key in determining whether this is the case . "
She said a pill to prevent muscle loss would unfortunately not be able to change the genetic cause of muscular dystrophy , but might slow down the disease progression .
" It is our hope that if this research becomes a workable drug the concentration of its use will be on serious medical conditions , such as muscular dystrophy , rather than for those desiring a ' gym in a bottle ' . "
The recent mid-air collision in Brazil of a new regional airliner ( fitted out for use as a business jet ) and a Boeing 737 has people baffled .
How could two brand - new airplanes with advanced avionics , flown by two professional pilots in each plane , collide at 37,000 ′ ?
The precision of modern avionics may well have contributed to this collision .
Airplanes under instrument flight rules fly from one navigation beacon to another along published standard routes .
In the old days , with radio navigation receivers and pilots flying by hand , a plane would n’t fly its clearance exactly .
The airways include a tolerance for error of +/- 4 miles .
If you ’re 4 miles to the right of course , in other words , you ’re still legal and safe from hitting mountains or other obstacles .
Altitude was similarly sloppy .
If you reached for a drink of coffee or to look at a chart , you might drift up or down 200′ .
Air traffic control would n’t get upset .
How does it work now that the computer age has finally reached aviation ?
The GPS receiver computes an exact great circle route from navaid to navaid .
All GPS receivers run from the same database of latitude / longitude coordinates , so they all have the same idea of where the Manchester , New Hampshire VOR is , for example .
The autopilot in the plane will hold the airplane to within about 30′ of the centerline of the airway and to perhaps 20 ′ in altitude .
If two planes in opposite directions are mistakenly cleared to fly on the same airway at the same altitude , a collision now becomes inevitable .
Almost any other system would be safer .
If you sent airplanes up to fly in random point - to - point paths , e.g. , from Boston to Denver , they ’d be less likely to encounter one another .
If you kept the airway system , but introduced some extra logic into the avionics so that planes always flew 1 mile to the right of an airway and + or – 200′ in altitude , they ’d be less likely to encounter one another .
If you replaced the precise autopilots with imprecise humans , planes would be less likely to encounter one another .
If you replaced the high - precision GPS receivers with low - precision VOR receivers , planes would be less likely to encounter one another .
Episode 35
There 's something indefinable about the Christmas season that makes the whole workplace seem a little brighter .
It could be the impending arrival of relatives , the promise of presents or just the knowledge that for a short space of time you 're free of the horrors of the workplace .
Whatever it is , the workplace becomes a much nicer place to work and people often put aside their petty differences in the spirit of goodwill .
" We can't call it Christmas any more , " the HR Droid says , reading from his memo .
" From now on it 's got to be called the holiday season . "
" Why ? " the PFY asks .
" Because not everyone celebrates Christmas .
It 's not PC . "
" So the non-Christmas lot will be working through then ? "
" Well , obviously not .
It 's a public holiday ! "
" So this is a cake - and - eat - it - too situation then ? "
" I... do n't want to go into it , that 's just the way it is .
Now ... uh ... the next point is that if you 're participating the five quid anonymous present thing you must adhere to the five quid maximum . "
" Eh ? "
" Last year one of our traders donated an overly large present ' because he earns so much more than the normal participant ' . "
" .. which made everyone else feel like fried dogs balls on toast ? " the PFY asks .
" Pardon ? "
" I think he meant that it probably made the other people feel bad , " I say , interpreting .
" It did .
And it 's not to happen again ! "
" Tell you what , why do n't you leave that item with us to bring up - as a Christmas treat to you . "
" I ... Well ok then , thanks ! "
. . .
" So which trader was it ? " the PFY says , scrolling through the directory .
" Brown , " I say , fingering the name on the screen .
" He gave an espresso machine . "
" I ... That is excessive ! "
" Yes , but it goes nicely with my toaster - I had to X - ray everything for security reasons . "
" So he knew it was going to you ? "
" He may have been under the impression that it was going to the young woman in accounts he was having a clandestine relationship with at the time , but I 'm sure he felt better about it when she dumped him after getting the five pairs of running socks ... "
" And you think it 'll happen again ? "
" He does appear to be spending a large amount of his time receiving stationary selection lessons from the temp in the supply cupboard ... "
" We 've got a temp in the supply cupboard !!!! " the PFY sniggers , just before a surge of voltage surges through his frame .
" So , " I snap as the PFY recovers his faculties .
" We need to get to work .
Now how do we stop him buying something excessive ? "
" Ask him ? " the PFY suggests .
" No . "
" Tell him ? "
" No . "
" Threaten him ? "
" No .
No we need to remove the urge to splurge " .
" Steal his money ? "
" He 's a trader , they do n't have any money . "
" Steal his credit card ! "
" Getting warmer ... "
" Oh ... " the PFY says , handing me the phone .
> clickety < > click < ...
" Hi , systems and networks here , " I say , speaking to Mr Brown .
" We 've got a problem with your username and I was wondering if you'd be so kind as to logout and log back in again . "
" Sure , " he burbles , tapping away quickly .
" .... Wait , No , I can't ! "
" Yes , as we thought , it 's a problem with our network but I 'm AFRAID you 're going to have to come down here in person for us to change it - rules and all that . "
" Okay , well I suppose I can't work without it . "
" Always the way , " I sympathise .
" And if you can bring a couple of forms of ID with you too . "
" Sure " ...
. . . ten minutes later . . .
" Ok , so here 's your drivers license and credit card back , " the PFY says , handing back a substitute he crafted earlier , " and if you could just select a four - digit PIN number on the keyboard over there which you can use to automatically verify yourself if you ever need to get support over the phone again . "
" Oh , ok , > tap < > tap < > tap < > tap < "
" And once more to lock it in . "
> tap< > tap< > tap< > tap <
" And you did make sure not to use the same PIN number as any other service ? "
" Oh ... uh ... yes ! " he lies .
. . . two minutes later . . .
" Yes , I 'd like to increase my credit limit , " I say , once the formalities of the credit card number and expiry date are out of the way .
" Certainly " the professional young woman at the end of the line says " And if you could just type in your PIN number ... "
> tap< > tap< > tap< > tap <
" ... no , I 'm sorry , that 's not working . "
" Backwards , " the PFY mouths silently .
" My mistake , I 'll try again , " I say tapping away .
" Excellent .
And a final verification , your mother 's maiden name ? "
" !!!!! "
" Uh , Eva Braun . "
" Wa ... Uhh ... that 's not what I have here ! "
" Course it 's not , I usually make one up - what with the connotations and all ... "
" I... see .
Well , I suppose if you know your PIN ...
What limit would you like ? "
I go for gold and pick an excessive number out of thin air .
" Uh . . I thought you said you wanted to increase your limit ? "
* BONANZA *
" Oh of course , I was thinking about the price of the car I was thinking of buying my girlfriend - how about you just double the limit ? "
" I 'll just see ... > clickety < ....
Annnnnnd that 's been accepted .
Is there anything else I can do for you ? "
" Can I update my emergency contact details - you know , the number you call if you notice a drastic change in spending behaviour ? "
" Sure ... "
... 30 seconds later ...
" ... and is that all I can do for you today ? "
" Can you tell me where the nearest money machine is ? "
The rest of the day is a bit of a blur , ending up at a bar so posh the toilet lollies are menthol flavour .
" Just one more 30 - quid - a - glass cognac ! " I say to the PFY .
" I sense we 're on the edge . "
" I can 't .
I can't do it , " the PFY slurs , sliding off his chair onto the floor .
" Do n't do it for me , do it for the company !
Do it because it 's bloody Christmas ! "
. . .
Early the next morning . . .
" I 'm sorry sir , your card has been declined ! " the Posh Barman says .
" Thank goodness , " the PFY gasps .
" Can you call me a cab ? "
" Of course sir - you 're a cab . "
Drinking all day and most of the night , hearing a good dry joke from a barman then getting the crap kicked out of you because the PFY landed a right hook on a bar stool - now THAT is priceless . ®

What 's more , the preservationists ' program does not even offer any guarantee that tomorrow the state will not exercise the increased authority they wish to grant it in a direction directly contrary to their goals .
To illustrate the problematic nature of coercive preservation efforts , we will offer two representative examples of how the preservationists ' project actually has been implemented .
We did not choose these instances because of any conviction that they comprise the most egregious cases of state - mandated preservation , but because we were familiar with them and saw them as fully adequate demonstrations that our theoretical objections to such policies meet the test of real - world applicability .
Our first exemplar is drawn from among the variety of attempts to regulate the future of rural landscapes , while for our second , in the hope of showing the general nature of the obstacles facing state planners efforts to make sensible trade - offs between historical worth and more prosaic , day - to - day utility , we will turn to an urban setting .
Rural Preservation
Among the worst laws ( we use " laws " in a loose sense here ) passed in the United Kingdom in the 20th century are the Town and Country Planning Acts ; the laws that nationalized the use of land .
They have impoverished the lives of millions of people for over half a century .
The acts require permission from the state before land can be used or built upon .
Authorization to build new houses is particularly hard to come by .
If the proposed home site happens to lie in the inaptly named " green belt " - a vast swathe of ploughed fields , mud , and monoculture surrounding London — then it almost impossible to get permission to build .
The result is that building land in the southeast of England is hugely expensive .
The land for even a small house might easily cost £ 50,000 , even before a single brick is laid .
Consequently millions of people simply cannot afford to own a home .
Demagogic politicians and their allies in the press then blame this state - created shortage of affordable housing on the market and use it to justify massive programs of house - building by the state ( so - called " social housing " ) .
The market is thereby distorted still further and an ever - growing client class is created , dependent upon the state for a roof over their heads .
Although the UK is one of the more densely populated countries in the world , the relatively high cost of British housing has little to do with any unavoidable shortage of land .
In fact , UK farmland is so cheap as to be almost free .
The quite real shortage of buildable sites is the product of policy rather than geography ; policy that has produced five decades of unnecessary hardship for millions of Britons .
Vast quantities of land are left fallow while many families across the country are forced to live in private accommodations far more cramped than do most residents of comparably wealthy societies , or to become supplicants for state housing .
Nor is the diminution of Britons ' material well - being offset by their being assured that at least the character of the land of olde England is protected .
All too often , England 's famous old towns and villages have had the heart ripped out of them ( why is another story — but planning and local government are the culprits ) .
The land protected from house building comprises thousands of square miles of oil seed , sugar beet , and other ecologically barren croplands .
John Corkindale of the IEA has written on this .
He refers to research by Cheshire and Sheppard
who made use of comparative data from Reading and Darlington to examine what the impact on housing development and house prices in Reading might have been had the local planning authority adopted the more relaxed planning regime found in Darlington .
The results suggested that plot sizes would have been 65 per cent bigger and the area of the town 50 per cent bigger , because people living in the area would have been able to afford larger housing with bigger gardens .
Land prices in Reading would have fallen considerably and real incomes risen commensurately .
( Corkindale , p. 4 )
Urban Preservation
A parallel example from an urban context was recently discussed in The Village Voice ( Gillette , 2007 ) .
The article discusses the author Tom Wolfe 's campaign to stop the proposed alteration of a building at 980 Madison Avenue in Manhattan .
The current structure is apparently fairly undistinguished , and was constructed only in 1949 .
The new owner of the property hired the renowned British architect Norman Foster to design a renovation and extension of the building , including a rooftop garden and two thirty - story , elliptical towers containing numerous luxury apartments .
The design has won praise from many who have seen it .
But Wolfe and his allies want none of it .
They claim the new design is not compatible with the character of the Upper East Side Historic District , in which it is contained .
There are at least two ironic aspects to their opposition to the new construction .
One is that the building they are attempting to preserve represented a change in the character of the neighborhood at the time it was built , as , indeed , did every other structure presently in the historic district .
If today 's preservation laws had been in place 100 years ago , it is likely that little of what the preservationists are trying to preserve would even exist .
The other irony is that , if the innovative design for the new construction at 980 Madison Avenue is realized it is probable that , in a few decades , it will be regarded as the very sort of landmark requiring protection by preservation laws .
We can imagine hypothetical , past preservationists preventing the construction of the Athenian Parthenon ( it will ruin the natural beauty of the unspoiled acropolis ! ) , the Roman Coliseum ( a massive structure , out of keeping with the neighborhood ! ) , the Empire State Building ( blocks the views of residents in the vicinity ! ) , or any other edifice today considered as an important part of our cultural heritage .
The urge to protect cherished monuments from the past or particularly scenic rural landscapes is not without merit .
However , the flaw in attempts to do so through legislation is that the political process cannot properly balance the value of such preservation with the cost of foregoing other possible uses for the land in question .
Preservation advocates who employ the legal system to stop new projects get the benefits of keeping around the familiar landmarks they appreciate without having to take into account the requisite costs , which generally fall on the owner of the property .
Harvard economist Edward Glaeser , commenting on the controversy surrounding 980 Madison , sensibly noted that blocking the construction of new Manhattan residential space will result in housing costs being higher than they would be if the apartments were built .
Wolfe 's response demonstrates his ignorance of the fact that his pet cause entails very real costs : " [ The proposed 980 Madison Avenue project ] certainly is n't going to help the housing situation .
Just more people who have the money will be able to move in " ( Gillette , 2007 , p. 21 ) .
Wolfe apparently has never considered the fact that , when very rich people move into those new apartments , that will ease the demand for the residences they would have occupied otherwise , allowing the slightly less wealthy to acquire those spots .
That , in turn , will free up the housing those people would otherwise have chosen , making them available to yet others , and so on .
An increase in the housing stock at any price level will tend to lower housing costs in general , although , of course , that effect might always be offset or even swamped by some other factor working in the opposite direction .
Wolfe , not content with this first display of economic naïveté , continues , " To take [ Glaeser 's ] theory to its logical conclusion would be to develop Central Park . "
Here , he confuses the recognition that action X would act towards lowering the cost of good Y to imply that , therefore , X must be done !
Without a doubt , filling Central Park with apartment buildings would lower New York City rents .
Similarly , butchering all of the dogs and cats in the United States for food would lower meat prices .
But that in no way implies that either course of action is indisputably recommended .
People quite sensibly prefer not to eat their pets , even though doing so would reduce their meal expenditures , just as New York City residents might prefer a bucolic respite in the midst of their urban environment , even given the higher housing costs that entails .
Glaeser is doing nothing more than noting that the elementary principles of supply and demand apply even to virtuous causes , while Wolfe , by refusing to concede such a basic truth , raises the suspicion that his campaign may have more to do with his public image than with concern for the greater good .
( That , in fact , is just what Gillette suggests is the case in his Village Voice article . )
Conclusion
In contrast to the groping in the dark characterizing the political disposition of resources , the market process , while it does not eliminate the possibility of bad choices — market participants always may come to realize , after the fact , that they had misperceived the value of some good — offers the best chance of making good choices .
Only market prices can reveal the current valuations that interested parties assign to the various uses conceived for any resource .
Our arguing that decisions about the fate of historical edifices and scenic landscapes should be in the hands of market participants in no way implies that we long for the day when all of our cultural treasures have been leveled to make way for " more efficient " operations , like factories , malls , and condominiums .
We have a deep appreciation for how those survivors from earlier eras connect us to our forebears , enrich our understanding of how their actions and choices brought about the world we now inhabit , and help to disabuse us of the conceit that today 's hot issues and fashionable obsessions have an unprecedented and cosmic significance .
But there are many promising ways of protecting the heritage left to us by our ancestors without resorting to threats of punishment and violence by the state .
To cite just a few that spring to mind immediately : voluntary associations can purchase and preserve sites , owners can place covenants on their property to restrict alterations when selling it , and tourists can show their appreciation for some landmark by paying a fee to visit it .
Ardent preservationists may worry that leaving the fate of historically significant edifices and sites to the undirected and unpredictable interactions of free agents in the market does not guarantee a perfectly secure future for every one of those cherished heirlooms .
And their suspicions are well - founded — sometimes , their very best efforts to outbid a potential buyer who intends to put something new in place of an antiquity will fail .
However , it is a pipe dream to think that the alternative of governmental control can shield the objects of their devotion from the ubiquitous vagaries characterizing this world of flux and change .
Human experience suggests that , sooner or later , the individual existence of any entity existing in time dissolves into the great sea of being from which it arose .
The fundamental impermanence of temporal being renders absurd all grandiose assertions that a new law means some site now will be " protected forever . "
But even more damaging to the case for state - mandated preservation is the fact that the most egregious destroyers of treasures from our past have not been market actors seeking profit , but states pursuing power , engaging in wars , urban renewal projects , and eminent domain seizures of long - established and beloved neighborhoods for highways , airports , sports stadiums , and commercial developments promising higher tax revenues .
It was the forces of the Venetian state ( with some help from the Ottoman government ) that blasted the roof off of the Parthenon after it had been held aloft for over two millennia .
It was the army of the Roman Republic that razed the venerable cities of Carthage and Thebes .
It was as a result of state actions that the great library of Alexandria is lost to us .
World War I and II obliterated valuable relics of Europe 's past and its cultural gems at a rate previously unimaginable .
Examples from more recent history include the deed for which the Taliban first gained widespread notoriety , the demolition of a number of ancient , monumental statues of Buddha in Afghanistan , as well as the destruction by the Turkish government , this year , of antique Roman baths .
The crucial difference between the two approaches to preservation is that the path offered by the market , unlike the political process , prompts all interested parties to consider the costs , and not just the benefits , of their preferred use of some property .
Those costs do not vanish when such decisions are reached by legislative or judicial decree , but only come to fall on the loser of the political battle , not because of any matter of justice , but merely because he proved to have less political influence than did his adversaries .

Pupils ' must look away to think '
Looking away helps children to process the question Pupils should be encouraged to look away from their teacher when answering a question , scientists have found .
Far from daydreaming , children who avert their gaze when considering their response to a question are more likely to come up with the correct answer .
Stirling University psychologists found that , when looking away , five - year - olds answered 72 % of questions well .
But when children had not been instructed to look away when thinking , they answered just 50 % correctly .
The experiment , conducted among 20 children aged five , backs up other studies carried out by the Stirling researchers , which suggest that by the age of eight , children instinctively avert their gaze when considering a response to a question .
The mistake adults make is to interject too quickly
Dr Gwyneth Doherty - Sneddon Dr Gwyneth Doherty - Sneddon from Stirling said taking the gaze away from the human face was very important when trying to concentrate .
" Looking at faces is quite mentally demanding , " Dr Doherty - Sneddon told the BBC News website .
" We get useful information from the face when listening to someone , but human faces are very stimulating and all this takes processing .
" So when we are trying to concentrate and process something else that 's mentally demanding , it 's unhelpful to look at faces . "
Adults ' should wait '
The researchers believe teachers and parents often mistake " gaze aversion " for children failing to understand a question and do not give them enough time to compose an answer .
" The mistake adults make is to interject too quickly , they need to try and hold back , " said Dr Doherty - Sneddon .
" If they avert their gaze , it 's worth waiting because they are probably trying to come up with something .
" There is this idea of ' look at me when I 'm talking to you ' , but it should be okay to look away at some point of the interaction . "
If a child looked blankly at an adult when asked a question it was a good indicator that the question had not been understood , she added .
The research , funded by the Economic and Social Research Council , was published in the British Journal of Developmental Psychology .

The Real Estate Soufflé
We have a decidely nuanced view of Real Estate :
While not neccessarily a bubble , it has been the prime driver of the economy since rates were slashed to half century lows 3 years ago .
Our expectation for the slow motion slow down rests on Real Estate cooling ( which its been doing since August ) , home construction and sales slipping , and prices slowly sliding .
That may stop the Fed from tightening appreciably further ( 2 and through ? ) .
Mortgage rates staying below 6.5 % allows Real Estate to maintain a moderate level of activity -- but one that is obviously way off its prior white hot pace .
I suspect this could happen more slowly than those who think Real Estate is a full blown bubble ready to pop .
Indeed , one of the comments in " Top Ticking Real Estate is Different Than Stocks " notes that :
" Last weekend I first heard the term " real estate soufflé " proposed on the radio to replace the term " real estate bubble . "
Even when the soufflé falls as it comes out of the oven , it does n't pop like a bubble . "
That seems to make a lot of sense to me .
Its consistent with last month 's final Home Sales slipping to to a minus 0.3 % , from a prior 3 month average gain of 4.6 % .
While down on a month to month basis , the absolute levels still remain historically high .
Mortgage Rates have been bouncing between 6 and 6.25 % -- still historically cheap .
Barron 's Alan Abelson is even more Bearish than I on the prospects for Housing & Real Estate :
" On that score , our conviction has been mightily strengthened by clear signs that the great housing boom is rolling over .
Exhibit A is last month 's steep drop in the sales of existing houses -- 5.7 % , to be precise .
Yes , we 're well aware that the Commerce Department reported that sales of new single - family homes rose 2.9 % in December .
But the figures do n't jibe with the rather downbeat findings of the housing industry .
And as to which we find more credible -- Uncle Sam's or the builders themselves -- it 's no contest . "
Merrill Lynch 's David Rosenberg has become a regular in his column .
His views on the end of the housing boom , and its impact on the macro economy are also pretty bearish :
" To that astute economic observer David Rosenberg of Merrill Lynch , the startling collapse of sales of existing single - family homes in the October - December span -- they fell at a 36 % annual rate -- is persuasive proof that the bull market in housing has metamorphosed into a bear market .
What marked the extended and powerful cycle , he reminds us , is that it was built on cheap credit and incredibly relaxed loan standards .
Some 43 % of first - time buyers , David recounts , put zero money down on their home purchases last year ; by contrast , two years earlier , 28 % bought a house with no down payment .
Well over a quarter of the mortgages in '05 were of the dicey " buy now , pay later " variety .
Not exactly sturdy underpinnings for a boom , especially with credit likely to get increasingly less cheap and the regulators fretting over lending standards .
The backlog of unsold inventories in the resale housing market last month shot up 26 % above the December ' 04 level to a 5.1 months ' supply ; that compares with the low of 3.8 months in January of last year .
Inventory of new homes stands at its highest level in nine years .
The overhang of unsold units in the condo market constitutes a formidable 6.2 months ' supply .
And pricing is beginning to reflect the inventory bulge : December 's median price of $ 211,000 for an existing home was virtually unchanged from last spring and down 4 % from the August peak . "
There 's little there I disagree with ;
If anything , we only differ on how long this will take .
I have no clue , but I suspect it will be a more gradual process than many expect .
" For the economy , David asserts , the end of the housing boom could be a serious drag on economic growth .
Considerably more serious , we might interject , than most of the sunshine gang , whether in Wall Street or D.C. , care to admit .
In the past three years , the surge in housing prices , he calculates , accounted for nearly 40 % of the expansion in household spending via home equity cash - outs .
Merely stagnant home prices , by his reckonings , would shave a full percentage point off consumer spending growth in the coming year .
An outright decline obviously would have that much more of an impact .
Just the direct effects of the raging bull market in housing , he figures , chipped in 25 % of the overall growth in GDP since 2003 .
The real - estate boom , he goes on , was responsible for a cool 20 % of the rise in total retail sales , while enlarging the nation 's payrolls by around a million jobs .
As David wonders , " So who picks up the baton now that the housing parade is over ? "
Who , indeed ? " "
The sunshine crowd will tell you that Business is ready to pick up the baton ; they certainly sang that from on high after Q3 GDP showed a big uptick in Corporate Capex .
Of course , they have been saying that for years now .
And as Q4 GDP has revealed , Q3 capex is looking more and more like an outlier . . .

I 'd say at least half of the real estate bubble crowd believes it will take a few years for the air to escape .
So the souffle argument , while it may be a better metaphor , offers a distinction without much of a difference .
Posted by : ross | Jan 29 , 2006 11:10:02 AM
It was a prodigious feat .
Yet for Peek - the real - life ' savant ' on whom Dustin Hoffman 's character in the film Rain Man is based - such recall only gives a glimpse of his powers .
He knows 9,000 books off by heart ; he can direct people around US cities from maps he has memorised years ago ; and he has total recall of the dates of all major world events .
Now studies of Peek 's abilities are being used by scientists to shed intriguing light on the human mind , and to open the way for men and women to exploit far more of their intellectual potential , as the latest issue of Scientific American reveals .
' Kim 's story tells us that the human brain is far more flexible than we had thought , ' said Darold Treffert , a psychiatrist and co-author of the Scientific American paper told The Observer .
' Like many other savants , he has suffered disability in one area of his brain , but has compensated by acquiring remarkable new abilities in other areas .
This shows we all have considerable hidden intellectual potential .
By studying Kim and other savants , we can learn how to tap those powers . '
This potential has been of particular interest to Nasa - currently carrying out lengthy electronic scans of Kim 's brain in its attempts to understand how astronauts are using their brains while on deep space missions .
Kim - now 54 - was born with a malformed cerebellum , at the base of his brain , and lacks a corpus callosum , the thick bundle of nerves that normally connects the brain 's two hemispheres .
As a child he was assumed to be suffering from severe mental retardation .
Only later was his condition found to be more complex .
He had superb abilities at arithmetic but could not deal with the abstractions of mathematics .
In 1988 he was given an IQ rating of 87 , well below average .
Yet some of his subscores were in the genius bracket , while others plunged into the mentally retarded range .
Kim has poor physical co-ordination , cannot button his shirts but has remarkable memory power and has started to develop as an accomplished pianist in the last two years .
This latest development - in a man in his 50s with large chunks of his brain missing - is particularly significant , added Treffert .
' His brain is still adapting to his condition , even in mid-life . '
One key to understanding Kim 's condition is that his right and left brain hemispheres are not connected .
Our left brain , in which our linguistic prowess has its centre , tends to dominate our right .
That has not happened with Kim , however , suggesting the possibility that his right brain has been allowed to develop more freely and reach a greater potential than normal .
Kim displays little personal interest in people outside the arithmetical details of their lives .
When I talked to him by phone in his home in Salt Lake City last week , he asked for my birthday .
I told him .
' Ah , you were born on a Sunday , your next birthday will be a Sunday , and you are scheduled to retire on a Thursday , ' he replied , correctly .
' He remembers 98 per cent of what he reads , ' said his father Fran .
' It 's like downloading data on to a hard disk - except his never crashes . '
Global warming is expected to have far - reaching , long - lasting and , in many cases , devastating consequences for planet Earth .
Global warming , the gradual heating of Earth 's surface , oceans and atmosphere , is caused by human activity , primarily the burning of fossil fuels that pump carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) , methane and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere .
Despite political controversy about climate change , a major report released Sept. 27 , 2013 , by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) stated that scientists are more certain than ever of the link between human activities and global warming .
More than 197 international scientific organizations agree that global warming is real and has been caused by human action .
Already , global warming is having a measurable effect on the planet .
" We can observe this happening in real time in many places .
Ice is melting in both polar ice caps and mountain glaciers .
Lakes around the world , including Lake Superior , are warming rapidly — in some cases faster than the surrounding environment .
Animals are changing migration patterns and plants are changing the dates of activity , " such as trees budding their leaves earlier in the spring and dropping them later in the fall , Josef Werne , a professor of geology and environmental science at the University of Pittsburgh , told Live Science .
Here is an in - depth look at the changes wrought by global warming .
Increase in average temperatures and temperature extremes
One of the most immediate and obvious effects of global warming is the increase in temperatures around the world .
The average global temperature has increased by about 1.4 degrees Fahrenheit ( 0.8 degrees Celsius ) over the past 100 years , according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) .
Since record keeping began in 1895 , the hottest year on record worldwide was 2016 , according to NOAA and NASA data .
That year Earth 's surface temperature was 1.78 degrees F ( 0.99 degrees C ) warmer than the average across the entire 20th century .
Before 2016 , 2015 was the warmest year on record , globally .
And before 2015 ?
Yep , 2014 .
In fact , 16 of the 17 warmest years on record have happened since 2001 , according to NASA .
For the contiguous United States and Alaska , 2016 was the second - warmest year on record and the 20th consecutive year that the annual average surface temperature exceeded the 122 - year average since record keeping began , according to NOAA .
Extreme weather events
Extreme weather is another effect of global warming .
While experiencing some of the hottest summers on record , much of the United States has also been experiencing colder - than - normal winters .
Changes in climate can cause the polar jet stream — the boundary between the cold North Pole air and the warm equatorial air — to migrate south , bringing with it cold , Arctic air .
This is why some states can have a sudden cold snap or colder - than - normal winter , even during the long - term trend of global warming , Werne explained .
" Climate is , by definition , the long - term average of weather , over many years .
One cold ( or warm ) year or season has little to do with overall climate .
It is when those cold ( or warm ) years become more and more regular that we start to recognize it as a change in climate rather than simply an anomalous year of weather , " he said .
Global warming may also lead to extreme weather other than cold or heat extremes .
For example , hurricane formations will change .
Though this is still a subject of active scientific research , current computer models of the atmosphere indicate that hurricanes are more likely to become less frequent on a global basis , though the hurricanes that do form may be more intense .
" And even if they become less frequent globally , hurricanes could still become more frequent in some particular areas , " said atmospheric scientist Adam Sobel , author of " Storm Surge : Hurricane Sandy , Our Changing Climate , and Extreme Weather of the Past and Future " ( HarperWave , 2014 ) .
" Additionally , scientists are confident that hurricanes will become more intense due to climate change . "
This is because hurricanes get their energy from the temperature difference between the warm tropical ocean and the cold upper atmosphere .
Global warming increases that temperature difference .
" Since the most damage by far comes from the most intense hurricanes — such as typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines in 2013 — this means that hurricanes could become overall more destructive , " said Sobel , a Columbia University professor in the departments of Earth and Environmental Sciences , and Applied Physics and Applied Mathematics .
( Hurricanes are called typhoons in the western North Pacific , and they 're called cyclones in the South Pacific and Indian oceans . )
Lightening is another weather feature that is being affected by global warming .
According to a 2014 study , a 50 percent increase in the number of lightning strikes within the United States is expected by 2100 if global temperatures continue to rise .
The researchers of the study found a 12 percent increase in lightning activity for every 1.8 degree F ( 1 degree C ) of warming in the atmosphere .
NOAA established the U.S. Climate Extremes Index ( CEI ) in 1996 to track extreme weather events .
The number of extreme weather events that are among the most unusual in the historical record , according to the CEI , has been rising over the last four decades .
Scientists project that extreme weather events , such as heat waves , droughts , blizzards and rainstorms will continue to occur more often and with greater intensity due to global warming , according to Climate Central .
Climate models forecast that global warming will cause climate patterns worldwide to experience significant changes .
These changes will likely include major shifts in wind patterns , annual precipitation and seasonal temperatures variations .
In addition , because high levels of greenhouse gases are likely to remain in the atmosphere for many years , these changes are expected to last for several decades or longer , according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) .
In the northeastern United States , for example , climate change is likely to bring increased annual rainfall , while in the Pacific Northwest , summer rainfall is expected to decrease , the EPA said .
Ice melt
One of the primary manifestations of climate change so far is melt .
North America , Europe and Asia have all seen a trend toward less snow cover between 1960 and 2015 , according to 2016 research published in the journal Current Climate Change Reports .
According to the National Snow and Ice Data Center , there is now 10 percent less permafrost , or permanently frozen ground , in the Northern Hemisphere than there was in the early 1900s .
The thawing of permafrost can cause landslides and other sudden land collapses .
It can also release long - buried microbes , as in a 2016 case when a cache of buried reindeer carcasses thawed and caused an outbreak of anthrax .
One of the most dramatic effects of global warming is the reduction in Arctic sea ice .
Sea ice hit record - low extents in both the fall and winter of 2015 and 2016 , meaning that at the time when the ice is supposed to be at its peak , it was lagging .
The melt means there is less thick sea ice that persists for multiple years .
That means less heat is reflected back into the atmosphere by the shiny surface of the ice and more is absorbed by the comparatively darker ocean , creating a feedback loop that causes even more melt , according to NASA 's Operation IceBridge .
Glacial retreat , too , is an obvious effect of global warming .
Only 25 glaciers bigger than 25 acres are now found in Montana 's Glacier National Park , where about 150 glaciers were once found , according to the U.S. Geological Survey .
A similar trend is seen in glacial areas worldwide .
According to a 2016 study in the journal Nature Geoscience , there is a 99 percent likelihood that this rapid retreat is due to human - caused climate change .
Some glaciers retreated up to 15 times as much as they would have without global warming , those researchers found .
IceBridge project sciencist Michael Studinger calls this photo a textbook example of a receding glacier , one that 's shrinking in size .
The dark , arc - shaped piles are terminal and lateral moraines , jumbled rock piles left behind as the glacier recedes .
A small , frozen lake sits at the left - hand terminus of the glacier .

Sea levels and ocean acidification
In general , as ice melts , sea levels rise .
In 2014 , the World Meteorological Organization reported that sea -level rise accelerated 0.12 inches ( 3 millimeters ) per year on average worldwide .
This is around double the average annual rise of 0.07 in . ( 1.6 mm ) in the 20th century .
Melting polar ice in the Arctic and Antarctic regions , coupled with melting ice sheets and glaciers across Greenland , North America , South America , Europe and Asia , are expected to raise sea levels significantly .
And humans are mostly to blame :
In the IPCC report released on Sept. 27 , 2013 , climate scientists said they are at least 95 percent certain that humans are to blame for warming oceans , rapidly melting ice and rising sea levels , changes that have been observed since the 1950s .
Global sea levels have risen about 8 inches since 1870 , according to the EPA , and the rate of increase is expected to accelerate in the coming years .
If current trends continue , many coastal areas , where roughly half of the Earth 's human population lives , will be inundated .
Researchers project that by 2100 , average sea levels will be 2.3 feet ( .7 meters ) higher in New York City , 2.9 feet ( 0.88 m ) higher at Hampton Roads , Virginia , and 3.5 feet ( 1.06 m ) higher at Galveston , Texas , the EPA reports .
According to an IPCC report , if greenhouse gas emissions remain unchecked , global sea levels could rise by as much as 3 feet ( 0.9 meters ) by 2100 .
That estimate is an increase from the estimated 0.9 to 2.7 feet ( 0.3 to 0.8 meters ) that was predicted in the 2007 IPCC report for future sea - level rise .
Sea level is n't the only thing changing for the oceans due to global warming .
As levels of CO2 increase , the oceans absorb some of that gas , which increases the acidity of seawater .
Werne explains it this way : " When you dissolved CO2 in water , you get carbonic acid .
This is the same exact thing that happens in cans of soda .
When you pop the top on a can of Dr Pepper , the pH is 2 — quite acidic . "
Since the Industrial Revolution began in the early 1700s , the acidity of the oceans has increased about 25 percent , according to the EPA .
" This is a problem in the oceans , in large part , because many marine organisms make shells out of calcium carbonate ( think corals , oysters ) , and their shells dissolve in acid solution , " said Werne .
" So as we add more and more CO2 to the ocean , it gets more and more acidic , dissolving more and more shells of sea creatures .
It goes without saying that this is not good for their health . "
If current ocean acidification trends continue , coral reefs are expected to become increasingly rare in areas where they are now common , including most U.S. waters , the EPA reports .
In 2016 and 2017 , portions of the Great Barrier Reef in Australia were hit with bleaching , a phenomenon in which coral eject their symbiotic algae .
Bleaching is a sign of stress from too - warm waters , unbalanced pH or pollution ; coral can recover from bleaching , but back - to - back episodes make recovery less likely .

Plants and animals
The effects of global warming on the Earth 's ecosystems are expected to be profound and widespread .
Many species of plants and animals are already moving their range northward or to higher altitudes as a result of warming temperatures , according to a report from the National Academy of Sciences .
" They are not just moving north , they are moving from the equator toward the poles .
They are quite simply following the range of comfortable temperatures , which is migrating to the poles as the global average temperature warms , " Werne said .
Ultimately , he said , this becomes a problem when the rate of climate change velocity ( how fast a region changes put into a spatial term ) is faster than the rate that many organisms can migrate .
Because of this , many animals may not be able to compete in the new climate regime and may go extinct .
Additionally , migratory birds and insects are now arriving in their summer feeding and nesting grounds several days or weeks earlier than they did in the 20th century , according to the EPA .
Warmer temperatures will also expand the range of many disease - causing pathogens that were once confined to tropical and subtropical areas , killing off plant and animal species that formerly were protected from disease .
These and other effects of global warming , if left unchecked , will likely contribute to the disappearance of up to one - half of Earth 's plants and one - third of animals from their current range by 2080 , according to a 2013 report in the journal Nature Climate Change .
Social effects
As dramatic as the effects of climate change are expected to be on the natural world , the projected changes to human society may be even more devastating .
Agricultural systems will likely be dealt a crippling blow .
Though growing seasons in some areas will expand , the combined impacts of drought , severe weather , lack of accumulated snowmelt , greater number and diversity of pests , lower groundwater tables and a loss of arable land could cause severe crop failures and livestock shortages worldwide .
North Carolina State University also notes that carbon dioxide is affecting plant growth .
Though CO2 can increase the growth of plants , the plants may become less nutritious .
This loss of food security may , in turn , create havoc in international food markets and could spark famines , food riots , political instability and civil unrest worldwide , according to a number of analyses from sources as diverse as the U.S Department of Defense , the Center for American Progress and the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars .
In addition to less nutritious food , the effect of global warming on human health is also expected to be serious .
The American Medical Association has reported an increase in mosquito - borne diseases like malaria and dengue fever , as well as a rise in cases of chronic conditions like asthma , most likely as a direct result of global warming .
The 2016 outbreak of Zika virus , a mosquito - borne illness , highlighted the dangers of climate change .
The disease causes devastating birth defects in fetuses when pregnant women are infected , and climate change could make higher - latitude areas habitable for the mosquitos that spread the disease , experts said .
Longer , hotter summers could also lead to the spread of tick - borne illnesses .

Modern mainstream economics has particular strengths and weaknesses .
Mainstream concepts like opportunity cost , comparative advantage , and marginal cost pricing have great merit .
Yet mainstream economics places undue emphasis on equilibrium .
The shortcomings of mainstream economics are subtle , but can be understood with clear examples .
Such examples need not come from observed history .
While art may imitate life , there is one instance where life cannot imitate art .
The movie Groundhog Day ( 1993 ) illustrates the importance of the Mises - Hayek paradigm as an alternative to equilibrium economics by illustrating the unreal nature of equilibrium theorizing .
In Groundhog Day Bill Murray plays Phil Connors , a man who relives a particular day — Groundhog Day — many times .
In the first instance Phil Connors lives through this day quite imperfectly .
After committing numerous errors he goes to sleep .
When he awakens , time has turned back twenty - four hours .
He is about to relive the same day .
Since no one else remembers having lived this day before , Connors can relive it knowing more about what will happen than he did the first time .
After reliving this same day hundreds of times , he learns how to live it perfectly , not just for him , but for others too .
How does this movie relate to economics ?
The first time through , the day is highly imperfect because Connors lacks knowledge concerning what will happen .
He lacks knowledge of how to take best advantage of what will happen during the day .
By his final iteration of Groundhog Day , he has acquired virtually perfect information on how to act during this particular day , given how everyone else will react .
In economic terms the final reliving of the day constitutes what economists refer to as a perfectly competitive equilibrium based on perfect information .
With full knowledge of how to realize every possible gain during this day , Connors is able take advantage of every opportunity for gain .
The difference between his first time through the day and his final reliving are dramatic .
While this is of course only a movie , it does serve to illustrate the wide gulf between the economists ' notion of perfectly competitive equilibrium and reality .
The ability of this fictional character to relive a single day points to vital issues in economics .
Perfectly competitive equilibrium requires perfect information .
Ignorance leads to errors that put the ideal state of equilibrium out of reach .
Ignorance and error exist due to perpetual change .
In a world where everything stays the same — except our knowledge of previous days — we can approach perfection .
Phil Connors is able to live a perfect day not only because the events of the physical world are repeating perfectly ( i.e. the weather ) , but more so because people are living it as if it was the first time .
Economists refer to " Nash Equilibrium " as a situation where everyone makes plans that are optimal given the plans of others .
In such a situation the plans of everyone mesh perfectly .
This situation requires everyone to know about the plans of others in advance .
This is the essential idea behind equilibrium theorizing in economics .
The problem with equilibrium theorizing is that it assumes that the fundamental conditions of the world do not change .
That is , it assumes that we simply play the same game over and over again without any fundamental structural change .
In the hypothetical world of Phil Connors in Groundhog Day all of the parameters of the " game " he is playing are reset back to their original position every night while he sleeps .
In the real world there are no constants .
FA Hayek recognized the importance of this fact in 1937 :
" For any one individual , constancy of the data does in no way mean constancy of all the facts independent of himself , since only the tastes and not the actions of individuals can be assumed to be constant .
As all those other people will change their decisions as they gain experience about the external facts and about other peoples ' actions , there is no reason why these processes of successive changes should ever come to an end " ( Hayek 1937 [ 1948 ] p49 ) .
Hayek reasoned that equilibrium was an unreal state , and that the actual economy that we need to explain is one characterized by perpetual change .
This fact changes the way we view all economic activity .
As Ludwig von Mises put it
" Once everything is in a state of flux , everything which happens is an innovation .
Even when the old is repeated , it is an innovation because , under new conditions , it will have different effects .
It is an innovation in its consequences …
In any economic system which is in a process of change all economic activity is based on an uncertain future .
It is therefore bound up in risk .
It is essentially speculation . " ( Mises 1922 p180-181 ) .
While it might seem extreme to characterize all human action as speculative this is actually an eminently reasonable position .
Some people might recall examples of repeated behavior on their own part that generated the same results .
Yet such impressions are more apparent than real .
Much of the change that happens is subtle , very small , or affects persons other than ourselves whom we do not see .
Yet change does occur even when it goes unnoticed .
Furthermore , many changes are in fact large , whether noticed or not .
The pervasive and ceaseless nature of change has serious consequences .
The lessons we learn each day are at best only partially valid for the next day .
Consequently we can at best hope for only a gradual improvement in our lives as we keep pace with but never overtake changes in our surroundings .
Our reality is to live our lives as Phil Connors did the first time he lived through Groundhog Day , not the last time .
We are all speculators and our every action is innovative .
The idea that we cannot achieve the ideal state of perfectly competitive market equilibrium might seem pessimistic .
Some economists insist upon holding the capitalist system to a standard of competitive equilibrium .
Failure to meet this standard constitutes a " market failure " that warrants government intervention .
After all , if markets are so very far from perfection , then perhaps government intervention could make things better .
While it is important to realize that markets fall far short of perfection , it is more important to realize that markets do enable us all to realize a remarkable degree of plan coordination and efficiency .
Capitalism has increased living standards to levels that primitive man never imagined .
The capitalist system delivered tremendous progress through its ability to bring about partial plan coordination among the world 's population .
On any given day market prices can , in the absence of price controls , adjust to a level where supply equals demand .
This does not represent a perfect state of affairs as actual market supply is always determined by past production plans based on incomplete and partially incorrect information . [ 1 ] .
However market prices do serve as guideposts in the imperfect coordination of production in a complex world ( Lavoie 1985 p54 ) .
Prices arise out of the pursuit of profit by entrepreneurs and the pursuit of greater satisfaction by consumers .
These participants to trade use money as a universal and homogeneous measuring rod to realize mutually beneficial exchanges .
Without freely circulating money and the pursuit of profit by private owners of the means of production , society would collapse into complete chaos .
The political process is different from the market process .
Capitalism operates according to profit and loss calculations , market prices , entrepreneurial trading and innovation , and voluntary agreements .
In contrast , government lacks prices and genuine entrepreneurship , and substitutes coercion for voluntary trade .
While markets fall far short of perfection , activist government often increases disorder in society .
The problem with equilibrium theorizing is not its abstract nature .
All theory is abstract .
The problem with equilibrium theorizing is that it is unreal , and it diverts attention from important issues .
Mises and Hayek recognized that government fails to match the imperfect results of capitalism , as have other economists .
Nobel prize winners Ronald Coase and James Buchanan also emphasized the need to make meaningful comparisons between private and public institutions .
Unfortunately , many economists still hold markets to the unrealistic standard of perfectly competitive equilibrium .
Free - market capitalism allows for a degree of coordination that no other system can match .
Those who hold capitalism to a standard of perfection ignore the fact that activist governments have failed to attain anything better , and have often made matters worse .
Groundhog Day is an entertaining movie , and it illustrates an important concept : one that we can never observe in real life .
Because perfect competition is completely unreal we need other concepts that enable us to understand how the world really works .
Fortunately , such concepts already exist in the writings of Ludwig von Mises and FA Hayek .

Truckers Watching the Highways
Highway Watch is yet another civilian distributed counterterrorism program .
Basically , truckers are trained to look out for suspicious activities on the highways .
Despite its similarities to such ill - conceived still - born programs like TIPS , I think this one has some merit .
Why ?
Two things : training , and a broader focus than terrorism .
This is from their overview :
Highway Watch ® training provides Highway Watch® participants with the observational tools and the opportunity to exercise their expert understand of the transportation environment to report safety and security concerns rapidly and accurately to the authorities .
In addition to matters of homeland security – stranded vehicles or accidents , unsafe road conditions , and other safety related situations are reported eliciting the appropriate emergence responders .
Highway Watch® reports are combined with other information sources and shared both with federal agencies and the roadway transportation sector by the Highway ISAC .
Sure , the “ matters of homeland security ” is the sexy application that gets the press and the funding , but “ stranded vehicles or accidents , unsafe road conditions , and other safety related situations ” are likely to be the bread and butter of this kind of program .
And interstate truckers are likely to be in a good position to report these things , assuming there ’s a good mechanism for it .
About the training :
Highway Watch® participants attend a comprehensive training session before they become certified Highway Watch® members .
This training incorporates both safety and security issues .
Participants are instructed on what to look for when witnessing traffic accidents and other safety - related situations and how to make a proper emergency report .
Highway Watch® curriculum also provides anti-terrorism information , such as : a brief account of modern terrorist attacks from around the world , an outline explaining how terrorist acts are usually carried out , and tips on preventing terrorism .
From this solid baseline curriculum , different segments of the highway sector have or are developing unique modules attuned to their specific security related situation .
Okay , okay , it does sound a bit hokey .
“ … tips on preventing terrorism ” indeed .
( Tip # 7 : When transporting nuclear wastes , always be sure to padlock your truck .
Tip # 12 :
If someone asks you to deliver a trailer to the parking lot underneath a large office building and run away very fast , always check with your supervisor first . )
But again , I like the inclusion of the mundane “ what to look for when witnessing traffic accidents and other safety - related situations and how to make a proper emergency report . ”
This program has a lot of features I like in security systems : it ’s dynamic , it ’s distributed , it relies on trained people paying attention , and it ’s not focused on a specific threat .
Usually we see terrorism as the justification for something that is ineffective and wasteful .
Done right , this could be an example of terrorism being used as the justification for something that is smart and effective .

" The US economy is in danger of a recession that will prove unusually long and severe .
By any measure it is in far worse shape than in 2001 - 02 and the unraveling of the housing bubble is clearly at hand .
It seems that the continuous buoyancy of the financial markets is again deluding many people about the gravity of the economic situation . "
Dr. Kurt Richebacher
" The history of all hitherto society is the history of class struggles . "
Karl Marx
This week 's data on the sagging real estate market leaves no doubt that the housing bubble is quickly crashing to earth and that hard times are on the way .
" The slump in home prices from the end of 2005 to the end of 2006 was the biggest year over year drop since the National Association of Realtors started keeping track in 1982 . "
( New York Times ) The Commerce Dept announced that the construction of new homes fell in January by a whopping 14.3 % .
Prices fell in half of the nation 's major markets and " existing home sales declined in 40 states " .
Arizona , Florida , California , and Virginia have seen precipitous drops in sales .
The Commerce Department also reported that " the number of vacant homes increased by 34 % in 2006 to 2.1 million at the end of the year , nearly double the long - term vacancy rate . "
( Marketwatch )
The bottom line is that inventories are up , sales are down , profits are eroding , and the building industry is facing a steady downturn well into the foreseeable future .
The ripple effects of the housing crash will be felt throughout the overall economy ; shrinking GDP , slowing consumer spending and putting more workers in the growing unemployment lines .
Congress is now looking into the shabby lending practices that shoehorned millions of people into homes that they clearly cannot afford .
But their efforts will have no affect on the loans that are already in place .
$ 1 trillion in ARMs ( Adjustable Rate Mortgages ) are due to reset in 2007 which guarantees that millions of over - leveraged homeowners will default on their mortgages putting pressure on the banks and sending the economy into a tailspin .
We are at the beginning of a major shake - up and there 's going to be a lot more blood on the tracks before things settle down .
The banks and mortgage lenders are scrambling for creative ways to keep people in their homes but the subprime market is already teetering and foreclosures are on the rise .
There 's no doubt now , that Fed chairman Alan Greenspan 's plan to pump zillions of dollars into the system via " low interest rates " has created the biggest monster - bubble of all time and set the stage for a deep economic retrenchment .
Greenspan 's inflationary policies were designed to expand the " wealth gap " and create greater economic polarization between the classes .
By the time the housing bubble deflates , millions of working class Americans will be left to pay off loans that are considerably higher than the current value of their home .
This will inevitably create deeper societal divisions and , very likely , a permanent underclass of mortgage - slaves .
A shrewd economist and student of history like Greenspan knew exactly what the consequences of his low interest rates would be .
The trap was set to lure in unsuspecting borrowers who felt they could augment their stagnant wages by joining the housing gold rush .
It was a great way to mask a deteriorating economy by expanding personal debt .
The meltdown in housing will soon be felt in the stock market which appears to be lagging the real estate market by about 6 months .
Soon , reality will set in on Wall Street just as it has in the housing sector and the " loose money " that Greenspan generated with his mighty printing press will flee to foreign shores .
It looks as though this may already be happening even though the stock market is still flying high .
On Friday , the government reported that net capital inflows reversed from the requisite $ 70 billion to AN OUTFLOW OF $ 11 BILLION !
The current account deficit ( which includes the trade deficit ) is running at roughly $ 800 billion per year , which means that the US must attract about $ 70 billion per month of foreign investment ( US Treasuries or securities ) to compensate for America 's extravagant spending .
When foreign investment falters , as it did in December , it puts downward pressure on the greenback to make up for the imbalance .
Everbank 's Chuck Butler put it like this :
" Not only did the buying stop in December by foreigners in December , but the outflows were huge !
Domestic investors increased their buying of long - term overseas securities from $ 37 billion to a record $ 46 billion .
This is a classic illustration of ' lack of funding ' .
So , the question I asked the desk was ' Why is n't the euro skyrocketing ? ' "
Why , indeed ?
Why would central banks hold onto their flaccid greenbacks when the foundation which keeps it propped up has been removed ?
The answer is complex but , in essence , the rest of the world has loaned the US a pair of crutches to bolster the wobbly dollar while they prepare for the eventual meltdown .
China and Japan are currently hold over $ 1.7 trillion in US currency and US - based assets and can hardly afford to have the ground cut out from below the dollar .
There are , however , limits to the " generosity of strangers " and foreign banks will undoubtedly be pressed to take more extreme measures as it becomes apparent that Team Bush plans to produce as much red ink as humanly possible .
December 's figures indicate that foreign investment is drying up and the world is no longer eager to purchase America 's lavish debt .
The only thing the Federal Reserve can do is raise interest rates to attract foreign capital or let the dollar fall in value .
The problem , of course , is that if the Fed raises rates , the real estate market will collapse even faster which will strangle consumer spending and shrivel GDP .
In other words , we are at the brink of two separate but related crises ; an economic crisis and a currency crisis .
That means that the unsuspecting American people are likely to be ground between the two mill - wheels of hyperinflation and shrinking growth .
In real terms , the economy is already in recession .
The growth numbers are regularly massaged by the Commerce Department to put a smiley face on an underperforming economy .
Industrial output continues to flag ( In January it was down by another .5 % ) while millions good paying factory jobs are being air - mailed to China where labor is a mere fraction of the cost in the USA .
Also , automobile inventories are up while factory production is in freefall .
In addition , new jobless claims soared to 357,000 in the week ending February 10 .
44,000 more desperate workers have been given their pink slips so they can join the huddled masses in Bush 's Weimar Dystopia .
December 's net capital inflows are a grim snapshot of the looming disaster ahead .
As the housing bubble loses steam , maxxed - out American consumers will face increasing job losses and mounting debt .
At the same time , foreign investment will move to more promising markets in Asia and Europe causing a steep rise in interest rates .
This is bound to be a stunning blow to the banks which are low on reserves ( $ 44 billion ) but have generated $ 4.5 trillion in shaky mortgage debt in the last 6 years .
It 's all bad news .
The global liquidity bubble is limping towards the reef and when it hits it 'll send shock - waves through the global economic system .
Is it any wonder why the foreign central banks are so skittish about dumping the dollar ?
No one really relishes the idea of a quick slide into a global recession followed by years of agonizing recovery .
Maybe that 's why Secretary of Treasury Hank Paulson has reassembled the Plunge Protection Team and installed a hotline to his Chinese counterpart so he can quickly respond to sudden gyrations in the stock market or a freefalling greenback ; two of the calamities he could be facing in the very near future .
Greenspan successfully piloted the nation into virtual insolvency .
In fact , the parallels between our present situation and the period preceding the Great Depression are striking .
Just as massive debt was accumulating in the market from the purchase of stocks " on margin " , so too , mortgage debt between 2000 and 2006 soared from $ 4.8 trillion to $ 9.5 trillion .
In both cases the " wealth effect " spawned a spending spree which looked like growth but was really the steady , insidious expansion of debt which generated economic activity .
In both periods wages were either flat or declining and the gap between rich and working class was growing more extreme by the year .
As Paul Alexander Gusmorino said in his article , " Main Causes of the Great Depression " : " Many factors played a role in bringing about the depression ; however , the main cause for the Great Depression was the combination of the greatly unequal distribution of wealth throughout the 1920's , and the extensive stock market speculation that took place during the latter part that same decade " .
The same factors are at work today except that the speculation is in real estate rather than stocks .
Just as in the 1920's the equity bubble was not created by wages keeping pace with productivity ( the healthy formula for growth ) but by the expansion of personal debt .
Also , one could buy stocks without the money to purchase them , just as one can buy a $ 600,000 or $ 700,000 house today with zero - down and no monthly payment on the principle for years to come .
The current account deficit ( $ 800 billion ) could also weigh heavily in any economic shake - up that may be forthcoming .
Bob Chapman of The International Forecaster made this shocking calculation about America 's out - of - control trade deficit : " US debt was up 10.1 % to $ 4.085 trillion and accounts for 58.8 % of all the credit issued globally last year .
That means the US expanded credit at a much faster rate than the economy grew .
This was borrowing to maintain a higher standard of living and attempt to pay for it tomorrow . "
Think about that ; the US sucked up nearly 60 % of ALL GLOBAL CREDIT in one year alone .
That is truly astonishing .
There are many similarities between the pre-Depression era and our own .
Paul Alexander Gusmorino says : " The Great Depression was the worst economic slump ever in U.S. history , and one which spread to virtually all of the industrialized world .
The depression began in late 1929 and lasted for about a decade ....
The excessive speculation in the late 1920's kept the stock market artificially high , but eventually lead to large market crashes .
These market crashes , combined with the misdistribution of wealth , caused the American economy to capsize .
" ( The income disparity ) between the rich and the middle class grew throughout the 1920's .
While the disposable income per capita rose 9 % from 1920 to 1929 , those with income within the top 1 % enjoyed a stupendous 75 % increase in per capita disposable incomeA major reason for this large and growing gap between the rich and the working - class people was the increased manufacturing output throughout this period .
From 1923 - 1929 the average output per worker increased 32 % in manufacturing8 .
During that same period of time average wages for manufacturing jobs increased only 8 % ( This ultimately causes a decrease in demand and leads to growth in credit spending )
The federal government also contributed to the growing gap between the rich and middle - class .
Calvin Coolidge's ( pro business ) administration passed the Revenue Act of 1926 , which reduced federal income and inheritance taxes dramatically ( At the same time ) the Supreme Court ruled minimum - wage legislation unconstitutional .
The bottom three quarters of the population had an aggregate income of less than 45 % of the combined national income ; while the top 25 % of the population took in more than 55 % of the national income ... Between 1925 and 1929 the total credit more than doubled from $ 1.38 billion to around $ 3 billion " .
( Just like now , the growing wage gap has spawned massive speculative bubbles as well as a steady up - tick in credit spending .
Wage stagnation forces workers to seek other opportunities for getting ahead .
When wages fail to keep pace with productivity then demand naturally decreases and business begins to flag .
The only way to spur more buying is by easing interest rates or expanding personal credit , and that is when equity bubbles begin to appear .
That 's what happened to the stock market before 1929 as well as to the real estate market in 2007 .
The availability of credit has kept the housing market afloat but , ultimately , the result will be the same .
On Monday October 21 , 1929 , the over - valued stock market began its downward plunge .
It managed a brief mid-week comeback , but 7 days later on Black Tuesday it plummeted again ; 16 million shares were dumped and there were no buyers .
The game was over .
Confidence evaporated overnight .
People stopped buying on credit , the bubble - economy collapsed , and the mighty locomotive for growth , the American consumer , hobbled into the Great Depression .
Tariffs were thrown up , foreigners stopped buying American goods ; banks closed , business went bust , and unemployment skyrocketed .
Tens years later the country was still reeling from the implosion .
Now , 77 years later , Greenspan has led us sheep - like to the same precipice .
The economic dilemma we 're facing could have been avoided if the expansion of personal credit had been curtailed by prudent monetary policy at the Federal Reserve and if wealth was more evenly distributed as it was in the '60s and ' 70s .
But that 's not the case ; so we 're headed for hard times .

Professor Michael Bisson , archaeologist at Montreal 's McGill University , sits with an actor playing the part of a Neanderthal on the set of the BBC documentary " Walking with Prehistoric Beasts , " shot in 2001 .
Depending on which journals you 've picked up in recent months , early humans were either peace - loving softies or war - mongering buffoons .
Which theory is to be believed ?
A little bit of both , says one archaeologist , who warns against making generalizations when it comes to our long and varied prehistory .
The newest claim concerns Australopithecus afarensis , who lived approximately five million years ago and is one of the first hominids that can be linked directly to our lineage with some certainty .
Hardly an expert at tearing other animals limb from limb , scientists say the small and furry creature likely spent most of its time avoiding becoming the lunch of those saber - toothed mammals you see in natural history museums today .
That 's a far cry from the spear - wielding image most of the public has of our earliest ancestors , Robert Sussman of Washington University told an audience at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science last month .
Other research appearing in current scientific journals , however , paints a different picture of early man .
Groups of humans likely engaged in occasional violent encounters in order to increase their territory , argues Raymond C. Kelly of the University of Michigan in a recent edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
According to Kelly , this may have continued up until about a million years ago , when distance weapons like the spear were invented and increased the risks of attacking other groups .
How can scientists see things so differently ?
Generalizing
Human evolution just is n't that simple , says Michael Bisson , professor of anthropology at McGill University in Montreal , Canada .
People tend to make generalizations about our early ancestors , even though they lived for a period of several million years and include many entirely different species of hominids .
As for the peaceful nature of Australopithecus afarensis , Bisson wholeheartedly agrees with Sussman .
" Afarensis was small and completely non-technological .
No one has ever argued that they were predatory .
They are bipedal , ground - eating apes , " Bisson said in an interview .
Interpretations get trickier , however , as time moves forward and hominids become more prevalent and diverse .
When humans began to eat meat and use weapons , around two million years ago , some inter - group killings were almost certainly going on in the cases where individuals encroached on each other 's territory .
Still , at this point hominids are mostly timid scavengers , according to Bisson , not mammoth - hunters .
" The interesting thing about early hominids and meat - eating is that all of the evidence we have for it is little animals that might have been caught and dismembered by hand and big animals that were scavenged , " he said .
" It fades in very slowly .
After two million [ years ago ] , there 's about a half - million - year transition before you get to hunting of some kind . "
Spear or tooth ?
It 's around this time where mistakes can be made in the fossil record , experts say .
With humans beginning to hunt animals , weapons in hand , it 's easier to assume they are also killing each other .
Puncture wounds in a skull from an animal bite can be mistaken as injuries from a spear attack , for example .
The fossil record is not always an easy thing to read , Bisson explained .
" Cause of death is almost impossible to determine on all of these ( fossils ) , " he said .
" They have almost all been subject to scavenging .
Since there 's no deliberate burial at that time , the bodies end up part of the food chain , so we simply can't say what happened . "
A lot can depend on how archaeological remains are interpreted .
Sussman calls this the " 5 o'clock news " version of history and science , one that applies to today 's humans as easily as those of several million years ago .
" Human groups are much more likely to live in peace than in war , " he explained .
" What we usually find is that what is reported or emphasized is any violent encounter that takes place .
Thus , instead of using the actual statistics , we emphasize the rare events . "
Context of war
Bisson agrees that the archaeological remains must be put in context depending on who makes the find , even .
He pointed to the discovery of some Australopithecus remains in the 1920s , in what is now Botswana .
Along with a skull , the material found included tools made from the bones of gazelles , antelopes and wild boar .
The archaeologist working there mistakenly interpreted them as a cache of weapons , while later testing would show the points were used simply for digging in termite holes .
" A lot of this stuff was written between the First and Second World War , " he reasoned .
" It was very easy to see warfare and violence as inherent in the human condition during a period when humanity was literally trying to exterminate itself . "
Mainstream media can also have a lot to do with what the public believes as fact .
" No archaeologist in the last 40 years has bought the ‘ Killer Ape ' interpretation , but it did get ingrained in popular culture in the intro sequence to the famous Stanley Kubrick film [ " 2001 : A Space Odyssey " ] , " Bisson said .
In the movie , ape - like humans are shown having the eureka moment that bones can be used as weapons , thus evolving to become hunters and killers .
" It 's a fairly literal dramatization of the hypothesis , complete with leg bones used as clubs . "
Even if early humans were mostly cooperative with each other during the Paleolithic era—a period lasting about two million years — there is plenty of evidence to suggest that ( like today ) , some people were just plain nasty .
Cannibalism was clearly practiced in some areas , according to Bisson .
" We know that there is at least one case of Homo erectus with extensive cuts on the cranium indicating that the person was essentially scalped and the eyes gouged out , " he said .
I ’ve been blissfully neglecting this site for months with the assumption that a large part of our goal was completed .
After watching good people like Martin LaMonica and Jon Udell balance out the mainstream tech press with coverage of lessish tools and languages , and having seen forward looking companies like RedMonk inject themselves into the traditional analyst racket with smart , honest , and unignorable critique , and having seen herds of Java luminaries migrate to simpler , more agile tools and languages , and after hearing Bill Gates say that less code was the only metric , and having watched David , Bill , Ian , Adrian , Phillip , Aristotle , Harry , Mark , Mark , Chad , Curt , James and many other extremely talented programmers dismantle all the common hollow arguments for superfluous complexity and replace them with simple methodologies and working code , after all that I just figured there was n’t much to do around here .
But I completely forgot about James Gosling :
“ There have been a number of language [s ] coming up lately , ” noted James Gosling today at Sun ’s World Wide Education & Research Conference in New York City when asked if Java was in any kind of danger from the newcomers .
“ PHP and Ruby are perfectly fine systems , ” he continued , “ but they are scripting languages and get their power through specialization : they just generate web pages .
But none of them attempt any serious breadth in the application domain and they both have really serious scaling and performance problems . ”
We ’ll get back to that in a second .
I believe that a majority of people in IT now consider dynamic languages like Perl , Ruby , Python , and PHP to be very much capable of sitting at the table with Java and .NET for a wide range of common technical problems .
Similarly , straight - forward systems like REST , Microformats , and Atom are generally considered legitimate alternatives to the vendor / analyst / press peddled technologies like WS -* for a wide range of integration issues .
In other words , I could walk into most shops during a technology evaluation and put these technologies on the table as legitimate considerations without being too worried about being laughed out of the room .
This is not to claim superiority for a given task , just that the competitive playing field is beginning to level off .
This was not the case last year at this time , so what happened ?
Something must have changed .
None of these technologies underwent huge feature or stability increases in the past year .
I ’m unaware of any breakthrough in scaling these systems past what they ’re already capable of .
There have been some improvements in running dynamic languages on the mainstream VMs , which many predicted would lead to quick acceptance , but that ’s not it either .
So what changed ?
Minds changed .
Respectful debate , honesty , passion , and working systems created an environment that not even the most die - hard enterprise architect could ignore , no matter how buried in Java design patterns .
Those who placed technical excellence and pragmaticism above religious attachment and vendor cronyism were easily convinced of the benefits that broadening their definition of acceptable technologies could bring .
The people who are still unconvinced are those that just do n’t care or are too lazy to spend a small amount of time researching and validating the arguments , which brings us back nicely to James Gosling ’s recent statements .
On The Current Quantity of Language
“ There have been a number of language [s ]
This part is notable because it ’s actually true .
There have , in fact , been some number of languages .
While I stand steadfastly by James ’ analysis of the current quantity of language , we will quickly diverge in opinion from here .
A quick note to aspiring Java pundits : play close attention to the next few statements .
While none of them have any basis in reality , they have proven sufficient in creating fear and uncertainty in the minds of those who are evaluating these technologies .
On “ Scripting Languages ”
“ PHP and Ruby are perfectly fine systems , ” he continued , “ but they are scripting languages
James pulled this directly out of “ Effective Java Advocacy Beans ” , section 6.8.3 “ Dealing with questions on dynamic languages ” :
First , call anything not statically compiled a “ scripting language ” .
Attempt to insinuate that all languages without an explicit compilation step are not to be taken seriously and that they are all equivalently shitty .
Best results are achieved when you provide no further explanation of the pros and cons of static and dynamic compilation and / or typing and instead allow the reader to simply assume that there are a wealth of benefits and very few , if any , disadvantages to static compilation .
While the benefits of dynamic languages –first realized millions of years ago in LISP and Smalltalk–are well understood in academia , IT managers and Sun certified developers are perfectly accepting of our static = professional / dynamic = amateurish labeling scheme .
This technique is also known to result in dynamic language advocates going absolute bat - shit crazy and making complete fools of themselves .
There have been no fewer than three head explosions recorded as a result of this technique .
Also , avoid the term “ dynamic language ” at all cost .
It ’s important that the reader not be exposed to the concepts separating scripting languages like bash , MS - DOS batch , and perl - in - the - eighties from general purpose dynamic languages like Ruby , Python , Smalltalk , and Perl present day .
We ’ve tried our best to clear up any ambiguity related to the term “ scripting language ” in the past :
On “ They Just Generate Web Pages ”
and get their power through specialization : they just generate web pages .
Gosling shows his ignorance regarding the current feature set provided by dynamic languages and what people are using them for .
A cursory glance over rubyforge.org ’s project tree reveals that the number of projects that “ just generate web pages ” are really quite small : 151 of 1,342 total projects are registered under Internet : : WWW / HTTP :: Dynamic Content and many of those projects are related to using the web ( HTTP / URIs ) as a platform for integration more than they are for “ generating web pages ” .
I expect Perl and Python break down even wider .
Update : Seo Sanghyeon provides a list of popular Python related applications that have nothing to do with generating web content .
I ’d also like to note that exposing resource representations via HTTP / URLs has been moving into areas other than “ generating web pages ” .
This was the plan when HTTP was originally designed but has only recently begun to really catch on .
Specialization and enhanced capabilities related to generating and serving hyper-media over HTTP are and will continue to increase in value .
The web server is becoming a key piece of integration infrastructure .
What James refers to as “ generating web pages ” is now a general purpose technique for exposing resources to anything outside of the application process .
On “ breadth of application domain ”
But none of them attempt any serious breadth in the application domain
It ’s hard to determine what kind of breadth is missing when you consider the capabilities provided by modern dynamic language environments , the platforms they run on , and the extensions and bridges that allow them to use damn near any other program or library available .
James uses the example of “ interplanetary navigation ” , which is a really good example except that it is n’t ; most of us are n’t working at NASA and those of us who are working at NASA are doing things like trying to get the payroll and accounting systems working together or building simple productivity applications .
Gosling seems bent on meeting the needs of the 20 % while leaving the 80 % with a platform that ’s losing bids to dynamic / agile shops .
“ That ’s the kind of power I do not envy ” .
Lastly , Peter Yared ( former Sun hacker ) and the rest of the folks over at ActiveGrid should also be interested to learn that no one is attempting to widen the viability of dynamic languages in the “ application domain ” .
On Scaling and Performance
and they both have really serious scaling and performance problems .
It is simply not possible for me to add anything to the massive set of material addressing this topic .
Scalability :
Performance :
Why people are upset
There have been multiple responses to Gosling ’s statements ranging in sentiment from outrage to amusement :
All we ’re asking is that you stop spreading misinformation about the current state of dynamic languages to the press , analysts , and your customers .
This does not require you to champion or otherwise support these technologies – just stop lying about them .
One year ago , this type of behavior could be attributed to a lack of documentation and discussion on these issues , today it ’s impossible to attribute to anything but malice .
Analysis It 's Autumn in St. Louis , my favorite time of year in Missouri .
Coats are getting progressively thicker as the temperature drops , trees are changing their leaves in a final show of brilliant color before their skeletons show , and darkness is starting to scare away the sun a bit earlier every day .
Every Thursday night this Autumn you 'll find me teaching the latest iteration of a wonderful course at Washington University in St. Louis titled " Technology in Our Changing Society " .
Once a week my students and I examine a different issue about the point at which technology and social change intersect , and our discussions are as fulfilling as they are knotty .
I can't tell you how many times this semester I 've heard someone say , " This is a really complicated issue , and I 'm not sure yet what I think .
I respect and understand completely what they 're saying .
After all , when you 're wrestling with issues around free speech , biotechnology , identity online , or virtual property , discussions tend to operate in shades of grey instead of black and white .
Sometimes issues are a bit more cut and dried , and a student will utter a bon mot that perfectly encapsulates an issue .
A long time ago , a high school kid who was n't that great of a student told the class , after a long discussion about governments and politics , " Well , here 's what I 've learned : socialism is fair but does n't really work , while capitalism is n't fair but does work mostly . "
Not too bad for a 9th grader .
More recently , I had the adults in " Technology in Our Changing Society " read both the Windows XP EULA and the GNU General Public License .
When I asked them what they thought , one woman said , " The EULA sounds like it was written by a team of lawyers who want to tell me what I can't do , and the GPL sounds like it was written by a human being who wants me to know what I can do . "
Nice
The next version of Windows is just around the corner , so the next time we discuss software licensing in my course , the EULA for Vista will be front and center .
You can read the Microsoft Vista EULA yourself by going to the official Find License Terms for Software Licensed from Microsoft page and searching for Vista .
I know many of you have never bothered to read the EULA - who really wants to , after all ? - but take a few minutes and get yourself a copy and read it .
I 'll wait .
Back ?
It 's bad , ai n't it ?
Real bad .
I mean , previous EULAs were n't anything great - either as reading material or in terms of rights granted to end users - but the Vista EULA is horrendous .
Benchmark censorship
Ed Foster has written - with his usual righteous eloquence - a piece on his Gripelog titled " A Vista of Licensed Censorship " that covers several new restrictions in the upcoming Vista EULA .
Vista
Home now contains this gem :
9. MICROSOFT .NET BENCHMARK TESTING .
The software includes one or more components of the .NET Framework 3.0 ( " . NET Components " ) .
You may conduct internal benchmark testing of those components .
You may disclose the results of any benchmark test of those components , provided that you comply with the conditions set forth at http://go.microsoft/fwlink/?LinkID=66406.
Foster brings up good points about the inevitable problems that this clause will bring .
Microsoft can - and undoubtedly will - change the terms on that web page at any time , thus complicating life for anyone wanting to disclose test results .
Worse , another requirement dictates that any benchmarks must " be performed using all performance tuning and best practice guidance set forth in the product documentation and / or on Microsoft 's support Web sites , " thus forcing testers to use settings that are n't found in the workaday world , potentially distorting results .
Foster gives this example , one that should resonate among the readers of this column :
Just by way of example , what about a security researcher who a year or so from now wants to compare the buffer overflow vulnerabilities of the original version of Vista with the inevitable SP1 ?
Under Microsoft 's rules , the researcher could not make public the results of the older version of the software .
And if you think it highly unlikely Microsoft would actually object to the benchmarks in such circumstances , think again .
In 2001 Microsoft came down on an independent lab that was about to go public with performance benchmarks comparing Windows NT and Windows 2000 .
Beyond the fact that censorship is almost always a bad thing ( I 'll agree that it 's permissible in a very few cases involving national security , but that 's about it ) , software is of such critical importance to people 's lives that I can see virtually no reason why any limitations on benchmarking and testing results should ever be allowed to stand .
No virtualization for you !
Right now , consumers and businesses can buy two versions of Windows XP for their desktops : Home and Professional .
Let 's review the choices they 're going to face , including pricing , when Vista rears its head :
Starter ( OEM pricing only )
Home Basic ( $ 199 , or $ 99 upgrade )
Home Premium ( $ 239 , or $ 159 upgrade )
Business ( $ 299 , or $ 199 upgrade )
Enterprise ( OEM pricing only )
Ultimate ( $ 399 , or $ 259 upgrade )
I understand that product differentiation among market segments is common and makes good sense .
But this is ridiculous .
Six different versions ?
Quick , which one is right for you : Home Premium or Business ?
Uhhhh ...
WHEN President Bush sent his new budget to Congress yesterday , he trumpeted a continuing decline in the deficit and projected a swing back into the black by 2012 .
But the accounting in the thick volumes issued by his Office of Management and Budget bears about as much similarity to the practices of private sector companies as Sanskrit does to Chinese .
For sometimes obscure and sometimes political reasons , the federal government reports its finances in a way that portrays them far more favorably than they deserve .
The “ official ” deficit figure for the 2006 fiscal year is just under $ 250 billion .
But a more accurate calculation would indicate a deficit nearly three times higher , and that is even without including some vast obligations the government owes .
And while a strong economy is pushing down that headline deficit , the government ’s financial commitments actually grew more rapidly last year than in 2005 .
In fact , the federal government itself obliquely acknowledges this chimera in a flotilla of other reports , including the obscure Financial Statement of the United States , prepared by the Government Accountability Office using methods closer to what a shareholder would find in an annual report .
In cases of major discrepancy
it is always reality that 's got it wrong .
From RFC1118
A : I consider Open Source to be an important part of the international programming fraternity , an institution organized as a virtual scientific academy that discovered many talented developers from various countries , especially Europe and Spanish speaking countries .
It 's great how active this fraternity is !
This " pro bono " ( Latin " for the common good " ) development is not unique to software .
Most professional codes of ethics encourage participants to donate some of their time " pro bono " .
I think that the healthy part of Open Source movement is in reality a " pro bono " movement that already produced a long lasting impact on software and is especially important to education , developing countries , cash - strapped startups , etc .
I consider it to be an important part of the Unix Renaissance , the most important democratic movement in software development in the XX century started by Berkeley University Free / Net BSD project ( TCP / IP , Bind , sendmail , vim to name a few things ) and MIT 's GNU project ( gcc , gdb , emacs , etc. ) .
One very important benefit that Linux provides is that along with Free / Open BSD it 's a free and open alternative to any proprietary operating system and due to the GNU license it most probably will stay that way .
At the same time the movement is still in its early stages ( and not last days , as some predict ) and it suffers from some " childish diseases " .
One of them is bad advocacy .
The term " bad Linux advocacy " or Raymondism was introduced in my First Monday paper to differentiate a credible OSS advocacy from the popular brand of naive on the border of blind fold Linux chauvinism ( " Linux uber alles " ) .
The main problem with Raymondism is that with the loss of credibility comes a betrayal of trust to the intelligent readership .
Like any other type of groupthink Raymondism incorrectly assumes :
Systematically overestimate the group capabilities .
Believe in the inherent morality of the group , regardless of how immoral parts of the group behave .
Develop their own rationalization for failures .
Rely on stereotypes of adversaries ( Microsoft ) rather then accurate perceptions .
Suppress rather then express their doubts and reservations about the group and particular decisions .
Have an illusionary belief that the group is unanimous in its decisions when many in fact have their doubts and reservations .
Overly call upon those who do express criticism to suppress this criticism out of loyalty to the group or the " fearless leader " .
What ESR and Co failed to realize is that people who are developing and using Solaris , Novell and Microsoft products are also professionals and many of them are of a caliber far superior to the author of low to middle - range open source products like EMACS editor macros , a mail utility , and like ;-) .
For any intelligent professional an open demonstration of arrogance naturally creates a strong negative reaction , a backlash that is damaging to the movement credibility and future .
Before I get flamed for this , please understand that a holy war , " Linux uber alles " of sorts , is a self - defeating strategy .
I hope that there is a healthy " silent majority " of the open source community ( that why I actually am writing this FAQ ) who are just writing code as best they can , and / or submitting patches bug reports .
But that does not mean that we can just ignore the ranting and raving of the zealots : the public tend to define the open source community in terms of its most outspoken members ( ESR and Co ) which in this particular case means zealots ...
The main problem with Raymondism is that with the loss of credibility
comes a betrayal of trust to the intelligent readership .
As Jono Bacon put it in the UK Linux Group article The Good , the Bad and the Proprietary :
I mean , let 's take a reality check at this early point in this discussion ; Linux is software - a man made tool that serves a purpose , and we need to remember that Linux is only software , and not some godly means in life where we must cast down all those who oppose .
The particular Linux users that I direct this comment to are what I would call " those users who like to express their opinion in forceful manner " ; in other words , those people who get very hostile to anything that is n't Linux .
Microsoft is usually a direct target when it comes to shoving some negative energy in the right direction .
While I think that Microsoft does have it 's flaws , everything has two sides , and Microsoft has consistently developed well designed easy to use software that lets novices get some work done .
The same problems exist with primitive anti Microsoft rhetoric like ERS's ( see Slashdot ESR responds to Ed Muth for more detailed discussion :
After months of silence out of Redmond , the themes of Microsoft 's coming FUD campaign against Linux are beginning to emerge like a zombie army from the fetid mists of Redmond .
And who should that black - armored , axe - wielding figure riding point be but our old friend Ed " Sheriff of Nottingham " Muth , apparently recovered from leading with his chin last time around and ready for another go at Linus and his Merry Men of Sherwood .
Even Linus
Torvalds proved to be not immune to this disease .
Some of his technical judgments are very suspect .
It 's enough to read attentively several of his interviews to understand that he started making predictions and evaluate things about which he actually has very little real knowledge due to the specifics of his career and the best he can do is to make an educated guess .
As Charles Hannan , a developer of an alternative operating system was quoted in Ottawa Citizen artilce " All in all that IPO money did to some Linux developers was make them incredibly arrogant . "
Overhyping open source does n't actually help to create a larger user base and / or sustained development of the community .
We should suspect any OSS advocacy that includes the following features :
Gross oversimplifications like " open source software is good , closed source is bad " , " Linux has better quality than closed source UNIXes or Free / Open BSD " , that " contributors to open source projects is plentiful and contributions always has high quality " , etc. Bob Young 's example of a car in which you are not allowed to " look under the hood " ( as if most customers know or want to know how to fine tune fuel injection or able to diagnose various malfunctions and / or install additional equipment like , say , turbo compressor ) is a more subtle example of the same category .
Claming that open source software is the most economically efficient paradigm of producing software and is much better than any alternative method .
This is called economism or Vulgar Marxism .
See Is " Vulgar Marxism " a legitimate scientific term .
Bad Linux advocacy considers commercial software developers inferior to free / open source developers .
It also has fundamentalist attitude about the necessity of redistributing software code .
I agree that it 's nice feature and it really make the difference in many cases ( especially in education , poor countries , cash - strapped startups , etc ) but still the absence of the source code should not be the cause of moral indignation as Bertrand Meyer hinted in his essay .
Emphasizing volunteer development and concealment of the facts about the true economic origin of many popular open source software products including Linux .
In reality a considerable part of it is not " donated " , but " taxpayer - funded " ( university - funded ) or " commercially funded " ( current versions of Linux ) .
Even Linus
Torvalds cannot be called volunteer after probably just first two years of kernel development : after that his " hobby " was financed by the University of Helsinki ( which allowed Linus to do development on his university job ) , then Transmeta picked the bills .
Later IPO stock gold rush remunerated him quite nicely , probably on the level very few leading commercial developers enjoy .
I would say that Linus Torvalds probably belongs to the first dozen of the most highly paid developers in the Unix word .
Without commercial developers and support of development by commercial distributors Linux in its present form would be impossible .
Most significant open source products are now developed by paid developers ( staff of Linux companies , IBM , Sun , etc ) and in this respect are not that different from commercial products that involve cooperation of several companies .
It 's just a new commercial software development paradigm that can be called complexity - level based commercialization .
There is nothing bad about it , we just need to understand the real picture .
Actually FSF from the beginning used paid developers to develop software .
That means that CatB 's claim that Linus Torvalds is a volunteer developer contradicts Linus Torvalds biography .
From the other hand commercial companies contributed a lot more to the Linux than Raymondism would like to accept .
For example , the role of DEC in the development of Linux and Intel and IBM in funding Linux startups is ignored in CatB and similar essays .
A holier than thou attitude , disrespect of other developers .
The attacks against commercial software developers , especially Microsoft .
These two communities actually are interdependent .
First of all one needs to understand that development of all major open source products is currently organized on the commercial basis .
Instigation of hatred of the members of the commercial community is unproductive and unethical .
Often open source products are re-implementation of commercial products ( Linux is a very good example here , but Ghostscript , GIMP and Samba probably can be mentioned too ) .
Borrowing from the design of the commercial product requires respect and acknowledgement of the original product .
This attitude is definitely lacking in phases like " I invented Linux " ( the most generous claim possible would be " re-implemented a Unix kernel using Minix and FSF tools " ) and so on .
This is as close to the infamous Microsoft phrase " We invented Windows " as one can get .
See also Linus Torvalds cult of personality issue in Linus Torvalds biography .
We will also touch this important problem below .
Another example " a holier than thou " attitude is ESR 's anti-Microsoft rhetoric like his discussion of Microsoft in Halloween documents ( see for example Halloween V )
After months of silence out of Redmond , the themes of Microsoft 's coming FUD campaign against Linux are beginning to emerge like a zombie army from the fetid mists of Redmond .
And who should that black - armored , axe - wielding figure riding point be but our old friend Ed " Sheriff of Nottingham " Muth , apparently recovered from leading with his chin last time around and ready for another go at Linus and his Merry Men of Sherwood .
Yes , of course , Microsoft is far from being a saint , but this is simply ridiculous .
Even the usual marketing suspects rarely sink so low .
Jeff Lewis in his interesting paper
The Cathedral and the Bizarre discussed other trick that ERS often uses ( " Windows 2000 63 K bugs trick " ) : Raymond points out that Windows 2000 , which reportedly shipped with 63,000 bugs , shows that OpenSource works because under Brook 's " Law " , the number of bugs is roughly proportional to the square of the number of programmers .
Since Linux has 40,000 developers working on it - there should be 2 billion bugs in Linux .
The flaw is that he perceives Linux as a collection of small projects , but sees Win2 K as a single monolithic application - much as he seems to see MacOS .
In reality , Win2 K and MacOS are n't monolithic .
They are composed of many smaller parts which are handled by smaller teams .
Much like Linux .
As for comparing bug counts - at least Microsoft has a bug count .
If Raymond had bothered to check the number , he'd have found that a rather large proportion of the 63,000 bugs are cosmetic - and none were considered ' showstoppers ' .
We do n't even have a way to determine the real bug count for Linux since there 's no central repository for this sort of information .
Raymondism seems to be assuming that all OSes are targeted to the same market segment .
This is a questionable assumption .
Developer resources are not infinite and explicit or implicit priorities lead to particular strong and weak points of a particular OS .
Unix in general was designed as a developer OS and naturally most developers and power users really like this OS and prefer it to others .
It also a very good server OS .
That does not exclude the possibility of using it by other market segments but the level of success achievable in each of them is questionable .
For example Mac is popular among graphic artists , musicians and users without special computer training .
One can say that it is a specialized OS for those market segments and that 's why the question of consistency of user interface is so well addressed in the OS .
It 's a top priority for those segments .
See Slashdot discussion of the The Cathedral and Bizarre for more information .
Its just reinforcing the idea that there are different markets and different kinds of software and different kinds of users .
No surprise that OSS fits some niches and does n't fit others .
Explicit and / or implicit personal attacks on RMS .
You can disagree with political views of RMS ( software anarchism ) or reject GPL as a license for your software ( I am far from that , LGPL seems more reasonable for me ) but please do not forget that RMS was a great programmer who initiated the development and put a lot of personal efforts in GCC , GBD and Emacs .
And that means that we definitely should respect him as one of the greatest contributors to open source .
As Bertrand Meyer have shown RMS has its own problems in the advocacy area , but please remember that GCC complier is the cornerstone of the movement .
In any case ESR and his closed Open Source Initiative is a pigmy in comparison with RMS / FSF past and present role and achievements .
Paradoxically in many important aspects Raymondism is more radical than RMS ' views .
For example RMS never claimed that free software development is a superior model for the software development than commercial development .
Nor they ever claim that everybody should use open source software only -- for him it's a personal preference that you can take or reject .
In no way RMS contributed to those crazy Linux IPOs that lead to " enthusiasm led investments " from the most active people in the community -- the investments that are now at risk due to the unclear commercial perspectives of the Linux - based companies .
Actually the RMS and the FSF supporters ( " Free Software " or GPL community ) in general have no problem with commercial software developers and selling software .
In fact , the FSF generates revenue through the sale of software .
Since Jan. 1998 Eric Raymond successfully promoted " open source " as a distinct and slightly anti-Stallman movement .
See for example his interview with Smart Reseller Straight From The Source where Eric was called a Godfather of Linux ;-)
Note how skillfully an anti-RMS stance was injected -- GPL essentially permit commercial use and might be one of the core reason of Linux popularity ( FreeBSD was technically superior in many important areas until probably 2.4 kernel ) .
Open source license is a Johnny - come - lately and as of this writing has no important products to claim : SR : Some of our readers may be confused by the " open source " movement you represent , which is significantly different from Richard Stallman 's ( a.k.a. RMS , founder of the Free Software Foundation and the GNU Project ) " free software " statements .
Open source is not the same thing as Stallman 's " free software , " right ?
Raymond :
The distinction between the open - source movement and what RMS is doing is that we push utility arguments while he publishes moralistic ones .
RMS 's basic stance is that intellectual property is evil and , therefore , sources must be open .
Ours is that we want what gives the best engineering results , and that 's open source .
Later ESR seems to get a pop star syndrome at some point and decided that he can safely make personal attack on RMS in order to promote his own Open Source Initiative .
This " pop star syndrome " can probably explain the fact that he also have felt the need to go public about his new wealth .
This was very bad move from PR perspective and just shows how arrogant ESR became ; he not only managed to discredit himself both as a person and as an evangelist by attacking FSF , but also alienated those Linux developers who fail to get into this short - lived get - money - fast - and - run Linux Gold Rush ( I suspect the latter category encompass most developers outside USA ) .
There 's nothing wrong with making money , even big money , but Linux does n't benefit from crazy IPOs based on hype and manipulations by investment brokers .
I suspect that " Open source rich " became rich at the expense of naive believers in the OSS phenomena , not from the day traders .
Attempts to contribute to Linus Torvalds ' " cult of personality " .
Often this is done via blatant exaggerations in the best style of North Korea press , but sometimes more subtle ways are used too .
For example calling him a " true pragmatist " and contrasting his with an " idealist " RMS ( who , by the way is the principal author of GPL license -- the license that proved to be instrumental to the success of Linux and along with BSD license was widely adopted in project all over the globe .
The GNU Project was around long before Linux .
But it 's not a stretch to suggest that GNU was a relatively obscure phenomenon before Linux brought its benefits front and center to the computing mainstream .
Stallman 's belief that it is better to have poor - quality free software than high - quality proprietary stuff might have forever kept the GNU world view as a niche had Torvalds ' pragmatism not brought it out .
From this point of view GPL proved to be a very " pragmatic " license .
Moreover FSF was well known / respected well before Linux .
For example , here is a stance by Evan Leibovitch in his essay
In the middle lies sanity See cult of personality for additional quotes .
Claiming that open source software has intrinsic higher quality than closed source commercially developed software .
This statement is an article of faith among some open source advocates , but until I see an objective , empirical study that substantiates it , it should n't be stated as fact .
Actually there are badly designed , insecure and quite popular open source products ( Sendmail might be one example ) .
Some open source products might use algorithms that are no longer on the cutting edge of technology , development might be slow , but they still play the role of the standard de-facto in the open source world ( compare , for example , speed of development and the level of interface refinement of gzip and rar ) .
The issue of the quality of algorithms is often ignored , but IMHO algorithms used are often far more important that other issues and make the difference between bad and good software .
Blah - blah - blah about word domination .
Linux domination would be a bad thing .
We need to respect BeOS , Inferno , VMWare .
VM / Linux ( derivative of older VM / CMS -- IBM 's two layer approach to the OS design in which simper OS ( Linux ) run on the top of complex ( and proprietary ) virtual machine monitor that hides a lot of complexity from the upper level and that provide virtual cluster or network and as such is different from plain - vanilla Linux on a single machine ) and other free Unixes ( Free / OpenBSD / Net BSD ) .
Pluralism in OSes is as important as in other spheres of life and one of the greatest achievement of Linux is that it helps to overcome Microsoft dominance in the PC world .
The Microsoft dominance already badly influenced people and there should be no new " Mongol oppression " .
It 's really important that people chose a right tool for the job ( best tool for the job , if you have enough money ) .
That will never always be Linux or Unix .
No single OS can do everything well .
Actually Linux on a desktop is far from being a paradise and probably will never be due to its server - centric architecture .
It 's pretty attractive to power users mainly because they actually need and can productively use a server as a desktop .
But you need to want to be your own sysadmin ;-) .
The other side of this " word domination " drive is the attempts to represent Linux kernel as the best available Unix kernel implementation strengthen an impression about Linux movement as a high - tech cult .
The kernel is pretty good and I like and use it but in many respects its not the best and never will be .
Overrating open source security .
The problem is not finding people , but finding quality people to audit software and that 's much more difficult than ESR assumes .
On April 14th 2000 reports began to appear of a apparently deliberate back - door in Microsoft FrontPage services .
The reports specified that the back - door password was " Netscape engineers are weenies ! " .
ESR fell over himself .
After his Halloween success this was the news item he was waiting for !
But here the result was quite opposite .
A real fiasco occurred .
In his note Designed for Uncertainty Matt Michie wrote : Eric Raymond wrote an article where he stated , " It 's pretty clear .
Anybody who trusts their security to closed - source software is begging to have a back door slipped on to their system -- with or without the knowledge of the people who shipped the code and theoretically stand behind it .
...
Apache has never had an exploit like this , and never will .
Nor will Linux ... " .
Of course the next day , after some background and fact checking , it was revealed that the Microsoft back - door was n't as bad as was originally reported .
Further , ten days later a security firm found a what could be considered a back door in Red Hat Linux .
Ironically , the bug was in a piece of web software .
The security advisory states , " The GUI portion of Piranha may allow any remote attacker to execute commands on the server .
This may lead to remote compromise of the server , as well as exposure or defacement of the website . "
Wait a minute .
Does n't Red Hat " theoretically " stand behind the code they ship ?
How could this back door have been inserted into Open Source code ?
Did n't Mr. Raymond say that this could n't happen to Linux ?
What do all the pundits who were railing against Microsoft 's security holes have to say about this ?
Is there a double standard when it comes to reporting Microsoft ?
In this situation , the Linux press , such as Slashdot , are looking more like a sick imitation of what ZDNet used to be .
Why is it " evil " when Microsoft FUDs Linux , but " advocacy " when Linux sites FUD Microsoft ?
Is it too much to expect unbiased reporting in the media ?
But the problem is deeper .
Here is an opinion of John Viega , a Senior Research Associate in the Software Security Group at Reliable Software Technologies , an Adjunct Professor of Computer Science at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute , the author of Mailman , the open source GNU Mailing List Manager , and ITS4 , a tool for finding security vulnerabilities in C and C++ code .
He has authored over 30 technical publications in the areas of software security and testing , and is responsible for finding several well - publicized security vulnerabilities in major network and e-commerce products , including a recent break in Netscape 's security .
In his recent paper open source resources at open source it The Myth of Open Source Security he wrote : ... Even if you get the right kind of people doing the right kinds of things , you may have problems that you never hear about .
Security problems are often incredibly subtle , and may span large parts of a source tree .
It is not uncommon to have two or three features spread throughout a program , none of which constitutes a security problem alone , but which can be used together to perform a security breach .
For example , two buffer overflows recently found in Kerberos version 5 could only be exploited when used in conjunction with each other .
As a result , doing security reviews of source code tends to be complex and boring , since you generally have to look at a lot of code , and understand it pretty well .
Even many experts do n't like to do these kinds of reviews .
And even the experts can miss things .
Consider the case of the popular open source FTP server wu-ftpd .
In the past two years , several very subtle buffer overflow problems have been found in the code .
Almost all of these problems had been in the code for years , despite the fact that the program had been examined many times by both hackers and security auditors .
If any of them had discovered the problems , they did n't announce it publicly .
In fact , the wu- ftpd has been used as a case study for vulnerability detection techniques that never identified these problems as definite flaws .
One tool was able to identify one of the problems as potentially exploitable , but researchers examined the code thoroughly for a couple of days , and came to the conclusion that there was no way that the problem identified by their tool could actually be exploited .
Over a year later , they learned that they were wrong , when an expert audit finally did turn up the problem .
In code with any reasonable complexity , it can be very difficult to find bugs .
The wu - ftpd is less than 8000 lines of code long , but it was easy for several bugs to remain hidden in that small space over long periods of time .
To compound the problem , even when people know about security holes , they may not get fixed , at least not right away .
Even when identified , the security problems in Mailman took many months to fix , because security was not the core development team 's most immediate concern .
In fact , the team believes one problem still persists in the code , but only in a configuration that we suspect does n't get used .
An army in my belly
The single most pernicious problem in computer security today is the buffer overflow .
While the availability of source code has clearly reduced the number of buffer overflow problems in open source programs , according to several sources , including CERT , buffer overflows still account for at least a quarter of all security advisories , year after year .
Open source proponents sometimes claim that the " many eyeballs " phenomenon prevents Trojan horses from being introduced in open source software .
The speed with which the TCP wrappers Trojan was discovered in early 1999 is sometimes cited as supporting evidence .
This too can lull the open source movement into a false sense of security , however , since the TCP wrappers Trojan is not a good example of a truly stealthy Trojan horse : the code was glaringly out of place and obviously put there for malicious purposes only .
It was as if the original Trojan horse had been wheeled into Troy with a sign attached that said , " I 've got an army in my belly ! " ... Currently , however , the benefits open source provides in terms of security are vastly overrated , because there is n't as much high - quality auditing as people believe , and because many security problems are much more difficult to find than people realize .
Open source programs which appeal to a limited audience are particularly at risk , because of the smaller number of eyeballs looking at the code .
But all open source software is vulnerable , and the open source movement can only benefit by paying more attention to security .
That 's why in my first paper I raised a heretical question : " Is the global free software / open source movement suffering from a special type of bad advocacy ? " .
For those who read the paper it 's clear that my answer is yes .
Bad Linux advocacy for me is the name of an Linux - based open source fundamentalism -- the dominant type of bad advocacy that adopts the simplistic and badly thought out arguments in a spirit of an obscure cult ( see also Lysenkoism ) .
I ’ve often wondered why it ’s so difficult to avoid hyperbole when discussing Linux .
After all it 's just one of several free Unix kernels and technically even not the best one .
Actually dramatic overstatement is not confined only to those who are most closely associated with Linux evangelism ( sometimes called slashdot crowd ) , it also spread to those who are developing and implementing Linux .
In his DaveNet The Sixth Sense Dave Winer aptly stated ( bold italics are mine ) :
What does open source have in common with Java ?
Both are former panaceas .
Like object oriented programming in the late 80s , if adopted , they would supposedly lead to magic synergies known only to the promoters , and breathlessly replayed by reporters looking for an easy story to repeat over and over and over .
Java was ( and is ) Pascal reincarnated .
A virtual machine that ran on real machines .
Good idea .
Been done before .
Open source is a tradition that dates back at least thirty years , if not longer .
If you learned how to program in the 70s your teacher was quite possibly the source code for Unix ( that 's how I learned ) .
Fodder for the hype machine , these " trends " make some people rich , and take the focus off what 's really happening , which is still the Web .
Then they fade out , to be replaced by the next vaccuous trend , and in the meantime , most developers work hard , outside the spotlight , to make their users happy .
( That includes open source developers , btw . )
The thing that 's truly offensive about these panaceas is that they are so exclusive and disrespectful of other developers .
Until Sun embraced SOAP , the only Sun-endorsed way to communicate with Java apps was to convert your whole program to Java .
The Java evangelists would cheerfully and seriously tell you to do this .
Same with open source .
Unless you shipped all your source on their terms the wall was insurmountable .
These are outages of the first order .
When will we learn the lesson , that predates even the Internet , that all outages in software are eventually routed around .
Try to control and you lose your place .
The time - of - control is shortening all the time .
IBM had a 20 year run .
DEC was the leader for 10 years .
Microsoft , for four , at most .
Java had an even more brief run and it was over before Java could actually do anything that anyone wanted to do .
If you 're a student of technology history , the long - shot bet of being dominant looks worse and worse .
Even if you manage to attain dominance , briefly , who wants to be the trend of last year ?
Thankfully the open source rage is on its last legs .
If you 're honest and made a bet on open source , and want to get help from the press and investors , here 's some open source ( free ) advice .
Play it down .
Actually open source software can be better than closed source it can be worse , it 's just different class of software with its own strengths and weaknesses and to claim that its superior by definition is kind of naive .
I think that RMS is right that the main advantage here is freedom , not quality or other real or perceived attributes per se .
Actual benefits depend on the personality of developer .
Only talented people can produce top quality software be it open or proprietary .
And quality documentation about algorithms used is often as important ( or more important ) as the availability of the source code .
I often will prefer more simple and probably not that well written open source program to the closed source one , but I would prefer a closed source program with carefully documented algorithms and clean interface to a large undocumented open source program .
For non-trivial programs algorithms are of crucial importance .
I would not go that far as to claim that extremist open source advocacy is a new type of religious fundamentalism although raymondism does share some features with a high demand cult .
Religious fundamentalism is extraordinarily dangerous .
Open source fundamentalism , at best , is annoying .
It 's just an example of what 's happening when a movement based on particular principles is repackaged and sold to companies as a new and effective means , i.e. a better way to turn a profit .
It 's interesting that RMS is now typically criticized by ESR for being past his time , etc .
There 's a predictable pattern to many social movements of this sort : they begin with prophetic characters with a radical moral - ethical agenda ( RMS ) , and then gradually become co-opted and assimilated to serve corporations and the market by opportunists like ESR .
But in reality FSF approach " free as a principle " approach is close to the idea of " pro bono " and might be the most democratic approach .
Yes , there are problems with GPL , and I would prefer BDS - style license in most ( but not all ) cases , but that 's a completely different story .

Electrode cap allows users to think themselves along a virtual street .
© Christoph Guger / Nature Read about our reporter 's experience with the thought cap .
Computer scientists have created a hat that can read your thoughts .
It allows you to stroll down a virtual street .
All you have to do is think about walking .
Called a brain - computer interface , the device detects activity in certain brain areas linked to movement , and uses the signals to mimic that movement in a virtual world .
The technology could one day help paralysed patients to move robotic arms , or help sufferers of motor neuron disease to type out words on a virtual keyboard .
" Just thinking about movement activates the same neurons as actually moving , " explains Gert Pfurtscheller of Graz University of Technology in Austria , who has been working on the device for around four years .
By picking up on these bursts of nerve activity , the computer can decide whether you are thinking about moving your hands or feet , and react accordingly .
“ Just thinking about movement activates the same neurons as actually moving . ”
Gert Pfurtscheller , Graz University of Technology , Austria .
The technology detects brain waves by using electrodes placed at strategic points on the scalp ; they are positioned over brain areas known to be involved in moving specific body parts .
The computer can then distinguish between signals corresponding to different types of movement .
Previously , accurate detection of local brain activity has required electrodes to be implanted in the brain .
This technique has allowed recipients to control robots and even send e-mails ( see " " Paralysed man sends e-mail by thought " : http://www.nature.com/news/2004/041011/full/041011-9.html " ) .
The new device , presented at the Presence 2005 technology meeting in London last week1 , achieves a similar feat using non-invasive methods .
Thinking cap
Doris Zimmerman is so good with her thoughts that she was flown in from Austria for the demonstrations © Michael Hopkin / Nature
The team tested their creation by asking participants to navigate a virtual - reality studio called the Virtual Cave .
Test subjects sit in a square studio wearing three - dimensional goggles , which project a scene such as a street , complete with pedestrians and buildings .
The computer then chooses a task for the participant : either walking forwards or moving their hands .
It tells the user what to do through sound cues .
If the person is asked to think about walking , and they do so in a way that can be picked up by the cap , the virtual character steps forwards .
If they fail , the character stays still .
When asked to think about moving their hands , successful volunteers are rewarded by staying still .
Failure leads to punishment : their character takes a step backwards .
One of the world 's best - trained users is Doris Zimmerman , a student who has worked extensively with the team in Austria .
She was flown in to help with demonstrations at the conference .
As she sits in front of the Virtual Cave 's three - dimensional screen , we watch her effortlessly glide down a high street .
However , it 's not as easy as it looks , as I discover when I try a simplified version of the test ( see ' Piano player gets poor score on brain test ' ) .
And I 'm not the only one that struggled : " I took about five hours to learn it , " confides Christoph Guger , who has set up a Graz - based company to develop the technology .

But after enough training , the team hopes that the virtual device could help those who are unable to move to interact more easily with others .
It could even enable stroke patients to regain movement , Pfurtscheller hopes , by allowing them to ' exercise ' their brain 's motor centres .
" If they think of moving their hand and they see a hand move , it reinforces the thought , " he says .
And strengthening the mind , he adds , might lead to better motor control .
